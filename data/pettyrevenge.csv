I was driving home cautiously since the road were unplowed and in very bad condition. Naturally, a person zips right behind me and begins to tailgate me. I am not going to speed up and risk killing myself or others, so I maintain a safe speed. The tailgater begins to honk at me, repeatedly, even as we pass multiple people stuck in the snow on the side of the road. 

After tailgating and honking incessantly at me for a solid five minutes, he zooms past me and barrels down the road. Not 100 meters ahead, he reaches a sharp turn, loses his traction, and slides straight into a snowbank. He immediately tries to back out of it, but his tires spin uselessly in the snow. He jumps out of his car and flags me down for help (I am driving a truck and I am sure he got a good look at the winch on the back of it while tailgating me).

I stop my truck and he makes a visible gesture of relief. I lay on my horn for about 10 seconds, and drive off. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1361819950.0,,,True,t3_19760w,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/19760w/i_never_knew_revenge_so_petty_could_feel_so_good/,

She spent all day on this thing and it was actually pretty impressive.  

The town I'm from is actually a borough and it only has something like 7,000 people who live there, meaning High School classes were small and relatively tight-knit.  There was one particular kid, who I'll call Scotty, who drove me up the fucking wall.  He never did anything to me personally, but he just had a massively annoying way about him.  To make matters worse, it seemed as if I had way too many classes with him to be statistically possible.

One of Scotty's irritating behaviors is that he drove a loud, redneck-ish, John-Deere-green truck.  It was obnoxious as hell and (important to the story later) had a huge brush guard on the front of it.    

Well, on the evening after she built her snowy sentinel, I heard the sound of Scotty's truck making its way down the street from inside our livingroom.  Then I heard the ""pfft"" of someone running over a snowman and laughing.  Unfortunately for my sister, she had built it close to the road and too easily within the range of this semi-guided asshole.  She was rather upset to see her day's work splattered all over the street...  Something needed to be done about this.

So, the next morning, I woke up early and began building another snowman.  It was glorious.  I made the classic, three section, scarf-wearing, sticks-for-arms-and-vegetables-for-a-face snowman.

This new snowman's cheery countenance betrayed a grim and dark secret, however; Frosty was built on top of a fire hydrant at the corner of our yard where there was no curb.

For a good two days I dreamt of Scotty wrapping his stupid truck around my masterpiece out in the yard.  But no dice.  I didn't see him at all anywhere around town so I thought I was out of luck.

Then, on the evening of the 4th day, I heard it.  My family was eating dinner and I heard the low grumble of fate's motors kicking from gear to gear.  Would they find themselves abruptly halted in about 10 seconds?  It all depends on you, Scotty boy...

So I start chewing my food really fast because, knowing the idiot, I knew what was happening next.  The final acceleration sounded off like a chaotic crescendo as he plowed straight into—not through—the snowman with the deafening crunch of twisting metal.

My family ran outside and it took everything I had to not laugh before I got out there.  There stood Scotty, dazed and bewildered and caught-off guard by a battle that he lost before he realized it had begun.

My little sister, about 12 or 13 years old at the time, found a great coupon to the local hobby store, and since she loved to scrapbook and sew, she was pretty excited about it. We went to the store and she took her time going through various items to take home with her hard earned money. After she found everything she needed, she went up the register where a 50-ish year old woman was manning the ancient (read: not digital, almost a typewriter) register.

Without saying a word, the woman snatched up the first item and rang it up, manually punching in the price on the dusty register. 

*click click click click click click click click click click clack whiiiiir*

My sister spoke up, saying, ""excuse me, I have a coupon I'd like to use"".

The woman sneered at her and snidely replied, ""it's too late to use a coupon, I've already rang an item up. Better luck next time"". My sister tried to ask why, but the cashier completely ignored her while manually punching in each and every price on every little item while my sister tried to protest.

*click click click click click click click click click click clack whiiiiir*

*click click click click click click click click click click clack whiiiiir*

*click click click click click click click click click click clack whiiiiir*

After a few minutes of slowly clicking and completing the sale, my sister gave her the money and took her items, but didn't leave. The cashier leaned over the register and told her, ""move aside, little girl. Better luck next time"". My sister then asked, ""do you have a customer service desk?"". Confused, the woman replied ""no, no we do not. Our cashiers handle everything"".

""Alright"", my sister mused, ""I'd like to return these items"".

""Are you serious?"".

By now, a sizable line had built up behind my sister, and they were starting to murmur about why the only register in the store was taking so long.

""Yes, I'd like to return these items please"".

*click click click click click click click click click click clack whiiiiir*

*click click click click click click click click click click clack whiiiiir*

*click click click click click click click click click click clack whiiiiir*

By now, it seemed like half the store was waiting for this crabby cashier to finish with my sister, and even the store manager was out on the floor at this point, watching it all.

*Finally*, the return was complete. ""Please don't put those items away yet"" my sister advised the cashier as she was handed her change. She grabbed the items, put them back on the desk, and looked the cashier right in the eye.

 In elementary school I wasn't the most popular kid, I was into books, had big glasses, into video games, got very grades, classic nerd. I had friends sure, but I did tend to be the butt of the classic ""nerdy-kid"" jokes.

One day in class we were doing some sort of busy work and I was seated across from one of the girls (let's call her BitchJ) who always loved to make fun of me and give me crap. The girl for some reason was stamping her feet up and down on the floor like a crazy person (not just the nervous knee thing that most people get from time to time, full on lifting and dropping them fuckers). 

The massive shockwaves from her dinosaur stomping ending up knocking her glasses off the desk and somewhere right beneath her feet. Being the good guy that I was, I immediately yelled out ""BitchJ, STOP, WATCH YOUR FEET!"". She stops her foot, a few inches from her glasses, then looks at me and just asks, ""Why?"".

Now I could have told her that she was about to ruin her glasses, but for some reason I didn't. I happened to not be wearing my own glasses at the time, and on a lark I told her, ""You're about to step on my glasses"". 

The bitch got the biggest grin on her face, lifted her foot back up and smashed it back down onto her own glasses. BitchJ heard them crack and bent down to pick the glasses up, still grinning at me without breaking her gaze.

At a past job I had a long commute. It was 62 miles door to door. To save money I bought an early 80's Rabbit Diesel from an old man for $2000. 40MPG and it ran like a top.  
However, it was gutless, and some of this commute was through the foothills of the Colorado Front Range. Some of the larger hills would slow my top speed to about 50 on this 70MPH Interstate. I can handle this just fine, especially with the money it saved me.  

However, even though this is a three lane hiway and I kept to the right 100% of the time (never even tried to pass people on the very rare occasion it was an option) some people would still honk angrily or flip me off when they came up behind me. I was somehow inconveniencing them to force them to pass. Bear in mind my shift did not make me commute in rush hours... there was little to no traffic. 
One guy lost his everloving mind. Honking and flipping me off, he paced in the next lane becide me for a while- foaming and spitting, screaming and using every rude gesture in the book. Completely lost it. Then he moved on.

There was a long drive contest on the 18th hole. The way a long drive competition works in a tournament is there is a little marker with a pad of paper on it out in the fairway. If you hit your ball in the fairway past the marker, you sign the paper, and place the marker next to where your ball was. It's an honor system sort of thing, but then again, that's golf for you.

I was in the second-to-last group, one of my good friends was in the group behind me. I step up to the tee, tee up, and free the beast all over that golf ball. By some fluke, it ends up drawing down the right side of the fairway. I crushed this thing. Based on yardage left, I hit this ball a little over 330 yards. I had the previous long drive beat by almost 20 yards. I happily signed the marker, and put it next to my ball.

After I finished the hole, I walked off the green, and watched the foursome behind us tee off and play the hole in. You know, waiting for my friend, and to see if anybody beat my drive. Now, the men's tee box that we were supposed to play from was on the left side of the hole, and the ladies was 40 or so yards up and on the right side of the hole. I saw one of the guys tee up from the ladies tee, hit his drive, walk up, sign the marker, and move it to his ball. That shit ain't right.

They finish the hole, and my friend comes up to me and confirms my suspicions. This chucklefuck had hit from the ladies tee and taken my long drive. He beat me by two yards. I went up to the asshole, and had this conversation with him.

Me: ""Are you really going to take that drive?""

Him: ""Yep.""

Me: ""That's cheating, chief. You didn't win.""

Him: ""Do you have any proof?""

Well, fuck. It's his word against mine. The other guys in his foursome are his friends. My jimmies are at maximum overrustle.

We go to the post-tournament dinner. Sure enough, when they call the long drive winner up, this smug fucknut goes up and collects his (my) $50 Tim Hortons gift card. 

Oh, but what's this? He dropped something when he stood up. It's his door prize raffle ticket. It's number 77. Well, I'm just going to take this, you know, for my troubles. I lean over in my chair, and snag it off the floor

An hour later, we're at the final prize. It's the door prize draw. The prize?
 A $1000 MasterCard prepaid gift card. The MC rifles through the drum with the tickets. The universe must have been on my side that day, because the MC pulls out a ticket, and speaks into the microphone.

""The winner of the MasterCard prepaid card is... Ticket 77.""

Asshole McTerribleperson loses his shit. He's jumping up and down, yelling ""I won I won I won ohmygod I won!""

He runs up to the front to the MC, who then asks for the winning ticket. Fuckface sticks his hand in his back pocket. Then his other back pocket. Then the side pockets. His face looks like he just watched his dog just get run over. Repeatedly.

I'm crazy excited at this point, but I make a show of checking my ticket. Then I hold up the ticket and call out,

""I got it!""

I run up to the front, and give it to the MC. 

Douchebag McGee isn't happy about this. He starts yelling about how I stole his ticket and ticket 77 was totally his and I'm a cheater and a liar.

I look him dead in the eyes, and ask him deadpan ""do you have any proof?""

He looks like he's about to cry. The MC sends him to sit down, and I collect the $1000 dollar gift card.

Because I'm the type to salt the wound, as I leave, I walk past his table, and say quietly to him ""Enjoy your Tim card. You deserve it."" 

Pretty sure he popped a blood vessel. But I didn't stick around to find out. I had beers to buy for my friends.

You know the scam. Whine about perfectly good food to get some sort of comp.
In their old age, my parents befriended another older couple who would pull this stunt everywhere they went. After my mother told me a few stories about how their new friends had shown them how to get discounted or free meals, I felt like I was suddenly the responsible adult, concerned about the bad influence these people were on my parents. While visiting my parents with my girlfriend, this other couple attended dinner with us. As I expected, the food was brought to the table and they immediately began dramatically complaining to one another about the quality/taste/temperature/etc. They were making a scene in order to attract the attention of the waitress. When our waitress returned to ask how we were doing, the miserable old bastard who played the lead role in their act took a deep breathe, struck a dramatic pose (with his hand raised to begin gesticulating for emphasis) and bega--I leaned forward and cut him off before he could finish the first word: ""Everything is absolutely fantastic. It's all great! Thank you very much!"" She smiled, and began her obligatory ""Great, well if you need any--"" when he made a second attempt. ""We come here all the time an--"". I didn't acknowledge that he was speaking at all, repeated that all was just as we ordered and thank her again. He was stunned and thrown off from his routine by my interruption. During this pause the waitress walked away (It seemed clear that she knew what they were trying to accomplish). He turned bright red. I turned to my girlfriend and, smiling and without lowering my voice, stated how pitiful it is that some people could be dishonest, deceitful and put at risk the livelihood of a cook, server or hostess for a pathetic discount or a free early-bird special.

I wasn't driving particularly fast, just some 5-10 kph over the speed limit, pretty normal.

Up behind me comes a car tearing up the asphalt. But I'm not in a hurry, my bike is new and I'm not gonna risk a ticket just cause this guy is in a hurry.

He starts to come up really really close behind me. Just a meter or two between his front bumper and my rear wheel. So now he's driving dangerously and putting me at risk. So I move over to the right side of the lane and give him room to pass figuring he'll go on on his jerkish way and be done with it.

Well...nope! He passes me and then slows down in front of me, and starts to break at random basically trying to tick me off even more.
At the next traffic light I tell the guy how dangerous his driving was and that he should quit it. Apparently I shouldn't have because he flips his lid and starts opening his car door, probably to give me a good kicking.

Thankfully the light turns green, I gun the engine, now really thinking ""fuck traffic regulations this guy's dangerous!"" Of course motorcycle in dense traffic beats a car no matter how nuts the driver is so I get away.

Later that evening I'm doing grocery shopping, no longer in my biking clothes and guess who I see at the checkout lane next to me? Yeah it's the asshole.

I'm out of the store before him and heeey, there's his car... And I happen to have found an old parking ticket on the ground. Rather then keying his car I slide the paper underneath his windshield and keep my distance, I'm gonna enjoy this little bit of payback....

And oh boy did I! Not only did he completely flip his shit about the ticket ( Which btw has a diffrent plate number on it but apparently he's blind with rage ).

Bonus points because there's 2 cops nearby. The asshole stomps over to them and begins to rant and curse and swear at them like there's no tomorrow. At first the officers try to calm him down but this guy's fucking nuts. So after a minute or so the officers have enough, perform the most beautiful takedown I've seen in my life and put the cuffs on him, he gets stuffed in the back of the van and hauled off to the station.

I do think it's unfortunate that this happened though. The revenge is sweet but the dangerous situations on the road are most definately not.

There are some close friends in there, that's why I'm there. There are about 25 people in this group, five of which are good friends. The group plans all kinds of things; parties, friendly soccer tournaments, clubbing and whatnot. There's this guy, let's call him Steve. Steve thinks he's the alpha male of the group. He uses performance enhancing drugs to be 'a beast' in the gym. This guy completely flipped out towards his sister on Facebook, because she expressed her concern towards his drug use. It was very verbal and extremely rude. He also stole an iPhone 5 last weekend, that's Steve. I don't know if any people in the Facebook group actually like him, but he's there for most of our events. Now I have zero respect for assholes like him, but one rotten apple in a group of 25 is not going to ruin anything for me, so I put up with it. He once hysterically laughed at me while working out at the gym because I was struggling. It was my first week. It demotivated me, but I started saving up towards revenge. This was about a year ago, fast forward to last week. He proudly links to a status update on Facebook, through the group. It's an irrelevant update of him, containing the word 'cancer.' It was something like ""I had a cancer-hard workout this morning"". In our native language it sounds better, 'cancer' is sometimes used as an adjective. 

Some girl I don't know commented on his status asking him why he had to use the word 'cancer'. He starts raging towards this girl, as per usual. He uses the word even more, because he is an alpha male of course. For no apparent reason he flips out completely. 

The girl then states she is suffering from cancer for the second time. Even though I know this asshole, I presumed he'd stop after that. He didn't. He literally stated she might as well be dead and the cancer should ideally spread to her entire family. 

He proudly links this to the entire group. There are mixed reactions, but most of the people think he crossed the line. The subject is dropped soon and everyone starts talking about something else. But I couldn't leave it at that. I wanted revenge, for myself but especially for that poor girl with cancer. I took screenshots of his comments and saved them.

And friday, the perfect opportunity for revenge presented itself. He posted in the group that he was invited for a job interview at a local company. I'm not sure if I crossed the line with the following, but I stand by what I did. I printed out the screenshots onto paper, put them in an envelope, and sent them to the small business where he was to be interviewed for a job. I anonymously addressed them to the personnel manager. 

He made another status this morning. When he showed up for the interview, the interviewer showed him the screenshots and told him this was no behaviour he'd tolerate in this business. Steve went batshit crazy again and he said he knew it had to be someone from the group. Many people laughed and that made him quit the group and unfriend everyone.

I've been smiling the entire day. That asshole had it coming.

He never showed up and then didn't respond to an email I sent for about 2 weeks where I showed my disappointment. H

is response was one **curt** line explaining his no-show.


     *""When my CEO calls me, I go. Sorry.""*


I later found out from people in our industry that he is a self important douchebag and that this is typical behavior. Nobody likes him, and he got to his position because of family. It turned out we didn't need his company and their competitor proved to be a great partner (silver lining).

Fast forward to a year ago...I am now the ""interviewing boss"" in my current company (same line of business) and we were hiring for a VP role out of NY. Wouldn't you know it his resume ended up in my desk. I told our admin (the entire back story) and to make sure to book the interview, he didn't know it was me that was first interviewer.

He told her that he would love to interview in LA where he lives, but unfortunately we said that he would have to make his way to NY if he was truly interested.

Well I guess he was. He flew all the way to NY and drove out to Long Island where my admin made him wait for 1 hour before informing him that I was unfortunately unable to make it and we would have to reschedule. So Sorry. I was chuckling about this from my office (In LA).

He emailed me and was VERY UPSET, to which I did not respond for a week (I couldn't wait a whole 2 weeks).

My response was verbatim, ""Apologies, but when my CEO calls, I go. Sorry""

I expected a long winded email back from him, but no - he simply said ""**Fuck You**"". It made me so happy and our company still laughs about it.

He also is still not working...he is ""consulting"". jobless asshole. He is still despised by our entire industry.

I take him to a motel and pay for the room via credit card. I wait at the car while he takes the t.v. remote to the room. He literally opens the door and tosses it on the bed and closes the door. As he is walking back to the car so I can take him to get something to eat, cops pull into the parking lot. Of course he has a warrant and they arrest him within 5 minutes.
I go back into the motel office and ask for a refund. I am told that I have to come back in the morning and speak with a manager.
The next morning the manager Calls Me, and tells me that there will be no refund as the room was used. I demand to see the room and go down there. 
They open the room, there are cigarette butts in the ashtray, but no ashes, the toilet paper is still wrapped but the sheets on the bed have been pulled down. Oddly there is not a dent in the pillows or a wrinkle on the bottom sheet. 
I proceed to argue with the manager and I quote he told me ""that we don't rent rooms out by the hour, I don't know what dirty deeds you did in there or how many men you had in there last night"". Umm excuse me! I have my own home and my own bed to do all of the dirty deeds my devious little mind can come up with! I was livid.
I went on the internet and found the corporate office in France. I wrote them a letter with a copy of my receipt (has time of transaction on it) and a copy of the arrest report ( has a time of arrest on it, literally 12 minutes after I paid for room).
Fast forward 2 weeks. I get a phone call from the motel asking me top come down. When I get there I am met by a very nicely dressed man with a French accent (AWESOME!). He asked me to point out the employees that were there when I got  the room and when I inspected the room. I did. They were arrested, it turn out they processed the refund but pocketed the money. My money was refunded and I got vouchers for 5 free nights for 2 people.

I often take my clients out to the local mall or whatever to engage them with the community.

One of my clients, ""Sean,"" has been diagnosed with both autism and a rare chromosomal abnormality. He's nonverbal and has severe physical and mental handicaps, but the dude is seriously one of the coolest people ever. He's obsessed with one of the department stores in the mall that employs pianists. I've spent hours sitting by the piano and listening to them play, which is fine because it's easy money for me and it's probably his most favorite thing ever to do.

The other week we were in there hanging out. ""Sean"" is standing up and rocking back and forth on his feet, clapping and squealing to himself at times. He may have been a little louder than the average customer, but it was a busy Thursday afternoon and he wasn't being disruptive in any way.

Lo and behold, a random woman comes up behind me and taps me forcefully on my shoulder. She tells me that Sean is being way too loud, for which I immediately politely apologize for. She continues to say that ""people like 'Sean' shouldn't be out in public"" and I ""should be ashamed to have a child like that.""

A few minutes later, the woman returns with her children and strikes up a short conversation with the pianist. Most of the pianists are elderly women that are just there to get out of the house, and since Sean and I are there all the bloody time I know them all by name and they often sit down with us during their breaks for small talk.

The woman asks the pianist if some of her brood could play on the piano, as her oldest is ""just *the* talk of her art school"" and is ""incredibly brilliant at the piano for her age level!"" The pianist looked her dead in the eye and said, ""I'm sorry, but we try not to encourage rude behavior in our stores. Perhaps children as brilliant as yours shouldn't be out in public?""

I was headed to San Diego for a conference.  The night before, I went out for some drinks with a coworker who would also be there.  A few drinks turned into us pretty much closing down the bar.  When I woke up at 6:30 later that morning, I actually felt great - I figured I must have drunk my way through the hangover!  This was of course a very stupid thought, and as the morning dragged on through getting to the airport, getting through security, and waiting at the gate, my head decided I am an idiot and deserve to be punished.  It was not wrong.

I made my way through the plane to my row, where I was to be seated in the window (a personal preference).  As I approached my row, I saw a woman sitting in the middle seat, with her belongings on my seat.  I politely said that it was my seat and waited for her to move them.  She let out an overly-large sigh, then laboriously moved her things onto her lap.  She then sat there.  And sat.  I asked her if she would mind letting me by, and she said the oddest thing:

""Go over me.""

Now at first, I assumed that this was my fault.  I assumed that in my awful, terrible hangover, I had forgotten how people board cramped seats and that I was wrong for assuming she would and should get up to let me in.  But then I remembered, I'm an idiot.  So I assumed she had some sort of physical disability which made standing and sitting difficult or painful for her, and rather than embarrass her I did as she requested, I went over her.

Shortly before takeoff, she stood up and hollered at her husband, who was in the back of the plane with their two children:

""I don't know why you couldn't get us seats together!  Honestly, this is absurd, why didn't you?!""

Lady, I got an idea why.

I didn't really care about her constantly reshuffling things or her armrest-hogging.  It did bum me out when her daughter came up to our row with a cheese and cracker platter and asker her mom if she wanted some and the lady simply said ""No.""  Eventually, I was able to fall asleep.

For those who don't drink, there is a phenomenon called the beer shits.  After a night of heavy drinking, you will often have a large amount of gas (and other things which go along with it) the next day.  About halfway through out flight, I felt this coming on, and I decided I had no choice but to go.  I asked her if I could please get out.  The gentleman in the aisle seat immediately got out, but she again said:

""Go over me.""

Now by this point, I was pretty irritable.  I had an awful headache, my stomach was doing somersaults, and I was about to blow an O-ring, and this miserable bitch wanted me to go over her?  On a moving plane?  Fine, I would.  I swung my right leg over her, then put my ass over her face, nearly touching.  A slight tremble in the flight, and I released a full-on, seemingly never ending fart, a cloud of noxious gas which should have had me arrested for war crimes.  I let the whole thing go.  Afterwards, I turned, made full eye contact, and said ""Sorry.  Turbulence.""  Everyone around me was fully and truly disgusted, and to them I am still so sorry, but I did what I did for the greater good.

This man called in, and I was lucky enough to get him on my headset.
  
   ""Thank you for calling &lt;redacted&gt;.  How can I help you?""

   Him (screaming) ""This fucking phone isn't working!  I can't make calls and people call me and just get my voice mail!  Fix it god damnit!""

   Usually, the first thing we do is have to customer power the phone off and then on again.  Nine times out of ten, this re-registered the phone on the cell site and made it work again.  So I suggest this to him.  He just continues to scream.

   ""Fuck you I'm not doing that!  I'm a fucking lawyer.  My time is very valuable!  People pay me hundreds of dollars an hour.  You should be paying ME to talk to YOU!""

   As he's ranting, I'm checking out the computer.  We had two programs; one that was Windows based, contained all the normal account stuff and a DOS based program that would show you what cell sites they were pinging off of, as well as allow you to deauthorize their phone, basically knocking it off the cell site until they powered the phone off and on (sometimes the phones got hung up between sites).  The Windows program could be seen by the bosses, but the DOS one could not.

   I check his account in Windows.  He's all paid up and everything's fine from that angle.  I pull up the DOS program and sure enough, the cell sites aren't picking up his phone.  So I tell him again to just turn the phone off and on again, and that should fix the problem.

   ""FUCK YOU!  I shouldn't have to do that!  I shouldn't have to do anything you dumb bitch!  You need to fix this right now.  And I want my account credited for every second I can't use my phone!""
    I explain that we can't do that, his service is fine, all he has to do is pick up the cell site again.  He continues to scream, yell and threaten to get me fired if I don't fix his phone and give him credit.  I keep telling him he has the ability to fix the problem himself if he just presses that one little power button. After some more cursing and sputtering, he finally hangs up on me.

   After he hangs up and my ears stop bleeding, I go to add my notes about the call into the Windows program.  I look back at the previous notes and see this guy has been a douche-nozzle to every single operator he's ever spoken to.  So I write his phone number down on a little post-it and stick it to my computer.  For the rest of the time I worked there, whenever I had a spare minute, I'd pull his phone up in the DOS program and knock it off the cell site.  And I did it completely randomly.  Sometimes once a day, sometimes as many as twenty.

So a few years ago I was at the vet's office waiting to pick up my dog from some routine something or other. I was the only person in the waiting room at first, but after awhile a mid 30's woman comes in with a young boy, probably 5 or 6 years old. 

For whatever reason, in a totally empty waiting room, they come and sit very close to me, over in the corner in a little alcove or whatever near a table with a bunch of magazines and coloring books on it. Before anyone says ""well no shit they came and sat near the coloring books"", there was more than one table like this in that waiting room

Ok so the mom is sitting across from me and the kid is next to her and in between us are these magazines and all that and some crayons and just junk on the table. Well I'm reading a magazine and the kid picks up a magazine that is obviously not something he's interested in, like the Economist or something. I turn a page in mine, he turns one in his. I sigh, he sighs. I move my leg, he moves his leg. I pick up another magazine, he picks up another magazine. He's copying me, in other words

So at first this was vaguely amusing, but then the longer it went on the less funny it got. Obviously I'm tired of waiting for my dog, ready to leave, etc, and this kid is mimicking everything I do with this shit eating grin on his face like he's got me and there's nothing I can do about it

Eventually it gets so that he's mocking my eye movements and facial expressions, stuff like that. I look over at the mom with a look of ""are you really going to just let your kid do this for 15 min straight to a total stranger?"" kind of in disbelief, and she's smiling at him like he's the most amazing kid in the world and clearly encouraging him to mock me some more

Up until this point, not a single word has been spoken between the 3 of us, its all non-verbal communication. But it was clear (to me anyway lol) that the kid was a brat, I wasn't in the mood, and the mom was over indulgent of him and something had to be done to right the balance of the universe

By this time it was obvious to the kid I was annoyed and I had been sitting totally still not doing anything for a minute or two while I thought this through, so he was afraid his game was over I guess. So finally I moved my arm with elaborate non-chalance and he got this huge grin on his face like ""fuck yeah! this guy still hasn't figured out i'm the king of this waiting room!"" and he mimics my arm movement very obviously

So then i reach over and get a coloring book. He gets a coloring book. I get a crayon, he gets a crayon. I slowly take the paper wrapper off the crayon, he take his wrapper off his crayon. He shoots his mom a jubilant glance once in awhile and she beams back at him like he's a good boy and is taking his first crap in the adult toilet or something

So i'm sitting there with this crayon and he's sitting there with his, waiting to mock me more, and the mom is looking on waiting to see how special and brilliant her child is going to be, and then i stick the crayon in my mouth and start chewing. 

Only not really, I palmed it and was making these exaggerated chewing motions with my jaw like ""OMG this crayon is SO good!"" with this look on my face like I was loving it. So then boy wonder stuffs his crayon in his mouth for real and starts going to town on it, bits of wax all in his teeth and shit, it was glorious

Finally mom springs into action and snatches him up by one arm and starts smacking his ass with the other hand, clearly furious, while staring at me the whole time like she wishes she was hitting *me*. I stare back with the shit-eating grin I just learned from her 5 year old. Then after about 5 smacks, she grabs the crying child and storms out of the vet's office in a huff

I have no idea what they were even there for, since they left without getting it, but I like to think that they went home with a little lesson in waiting room etiquette and I left with my (very) petty revenge and my loyal dog",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1fa7k5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1fa7k5/very_petty_revenge_on_bratty_child_in_waiting_room/,

I look, a young girl, around 18 yo was stood there, I heard her friend tell her to 'dig her elbows deeper'. Then she somehow managed to get in front of me to the bar, block my path and allow her pal access. I had waited too long for this to happen and not yet being drunk I quickly thought of a plan. 

""It's OK ladies, allow me. This rounds on me. What would you like?""

They requested their order, though I never bothered to listen to it. They then freed up some space for me to get to the bar. I ordered my drink and nothing more. I then proceeded to explain to the barman how I had heard these girls talking about school and probably weren't old enough for drinking. I turned around to see them casting me some really evil looks as I left the bar with only my drink. They lost their place, had to wait some more time only to be refused drinks as they failed to produce ID.

This meant lots of tests/quizzes/labs on Fridays. The guys that lived below us were in one of the several colleges (I don't know which one) that had no class on Fridays, and so would hold parties almost every Thursday night. Obviously, not an ideal situation for us. Conversations with the downstairs neighbors resulted in near fisticuffs, so we decided another tact was required.

My roommate and I were climbers, we would go camping/climbing frequently, and after one particularly loud Thursday party, we were set to head out. My roommate, the acoustical engineer, brought in several impressive looking speakers from his lab along with some acoustical foam. We used the foam to ""soundproof"" the front door and we hooked the speakers up up, laid them down on the floor, face down, cranked the volume to max, and just before we left on Friday at about two, we hit play on a 5 second loop of ""Achy Breaky Heart."" ""Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart,"" repeat, repeat, repeat.

We returned about 50 hours later to death threats on the door. It appears that because we put the speakers face down and because of the acoustical foam, the noise was nearly inaudible at our front door, so the Police would not make entry, and the super was never available on weekends. So they got 50 full hours of achy break heart. 

We negotiated a ceasefire. No more parties past midnight on Sunday through Thursday in exchange for no more weekends of Billy Ray.

TL;DR - You throw a party before my test, you get Billy Ray Cyrus for the whole weekend.

I worked at a busy Waterpark similiar to Six Flags as a lifeguard/attendant. It was the middle of summer, there were thousands of people in the park, and good 'camping/setup' spots where limited by lunch time.

**Situation**:

While lifeguarding over a fake beach/wave pool, we were periodically required to tell customers on the dining table that the seating was short term seating only, while they eat their food etc. Otherwise people leave there towels and bags over every table, and flip out if anyone tries to eat at 'their table'

Most people are cool and clear out after eating, freeing it up for the next customers. These tables are constantly packed when it's busy.

One lady has decided that she'll pull 2 tables, and 8 chairs together, spread all her stuff around, and start reading a book (with a coffee). This is incredibly rude, and pisses a lot of customers off (rightly so).

So after the waves turn off (20 min on, 10 off) I do the walk through with the same speal ""Limited seating, appreciate if you could free up once you're finished your meals etc etc"" I get to this lady who says:

""Im drinking a coffee""

""I understand, but you can't really set up 'base' here, we keep the dining tables free for people with food to have somewhere to eat. There are plenty of spaces here, here n here""

""yeah, thanks...""

Another half hour goes, I go through the tables again, same speal etc, get to this lady.

""Sorry Ma'am, but I really have to ask you to move on shortly, you've taken up 8 seats and 2 tables for the last hour while only occupying one...""

""I'm reading a book! Get your manager if you have a problem, show some initiative! (She actually said that...)""

So call the duty manager over, he has a chat, calms her down, comes back to me and says ""She claims to have a heart problem and can't walk around much or be in the heat etc, so just let her be""

Not a problem, I'm not going to harass a lady with a *cough* heart problem, and the Manager is cool with it so I dont care.


**Revenge**:

About 3 hours later I was rotated on one of the more popular group waterslides. The lineup was over an hour.

Low and behold, look who it is! The same lady, with some of her friends.

She gets to the front of the line, attempts to step into the ride:

""Sorry Ma'am, unfortunately I can't let you ride this today""

""Why not!??!""

""As it's a 'thrill' ride, people with heart conditions aren't permitted to ride"" (not entirely true, they are just not advised to ride, I wasn't going to tell her this though)

""I don't have a heart condition!""

""I'm sorry if I was misinformed, but I've been notified that you have a heart condition, and so really wouldn't feel comfortable putting you in this situation, risking it etc, your friends are fine to go though!""

They all took off yelling and laughing etc

""This is b.s! I want to speak to your manager!""

""Certainly""

I radio'd to the Manager, briefly let him know the situation, and heard the amusement in his voice when he said he'll be around soon.

She waited another 30 mins standing at the top of this line, only to be greeted by, guess who, the same Manager she claimed she had the heart condition to. While putting on his incredibly sincere and concerned voice, told her how he couldnt possibly risk putting her in a situation like this, opening them up for court action etc. She tried pleading to him that she didn't really have a heart condition, and how it was something else etc.

A couple of kids who lived in my neighborhood who were around 10-12 years old kicked my cat while it was laying out in front of my porch sun bathing.  I was looking out the window while I saw them walk by and do it and when I opened the door, they took off running.  My cat limped up onto the porch and I could obvious tell it was hurt so I took it up to the vet who gave it an x-ray and confirmed she had a couple broken ribs but no internal organ damage.

This whole thing happened at about 4:30 pm and I ended up getting home at 7:00 pm.  When I got home, I put Bonkers in the house and went down to talk to the kids parents about what they did.  They told me that their kids wouldn't do something like that and I must have been mistaken.  I told them that I wasn't and I wanted to make sure they were disciplined for what they did.  She told me again that her kids wouldn't' do something like that so I went home and called the police.

The police came and got my statement and talked to the parents.  They denied everything and then came and told me there was little they could do.  I could try filing in small claims court to recoup my vet bills but I told him there was next to no way I'd win and he apologized to me and hoped my cat would get better.

I went to work the following day and told my co-workers about the incident and they felt sorry too for my cat.  I got pissed off to the point where I wasn't going to let them get away with it.  The day after this, I got off work and stopped by the hardware store and bought some bolt cutters.  I waited till about 2 am and went and stole both of their bikes off their porch and put them in my garage.

I went to work and thought about dumping them on the other side of the city but instead, I decided to cut them up instead.  When I got home, I took them apart and cut them on my work bench and tossed the crankshaft and bolts in the car wash dumpster a couple blocks away.  I waited till Friday night and dumped them down the street in the field they liked to play at on the weekends.  

I was on my porch most of Saturday when I saw them crying and dragging their cut up bike pieces home to their parents.  I saw the police come over to their home later in the day but I was sure they told them that there was no proof I did it so they didn't stop by and talk to me.  In the end, my cat didn't get to go out side the rest of the year and they didn't get bikes to play with the rest of summer.

I have an asshole neighbour. He is an elderly-ish man - maybe around 60. Still works down in town. Anyway, we share the start of our driveway, except his goes past my house and down the valley a ways, where his house is. 

Now we had just got our driveway paved, meaning he had to park up on the road for the two days they were laying the sand and pavers. Its maybe a 25 meter walk down to his house. 

Not only did he berate me at long length when our paths met at the letterbox on the first day, but on the second, he outright abused me in front of my student (I tutor drums). I told my young student to go inside, as he was swearing furiously at me for having the nerve to ask him to park out front for two days. 

Fast forward to the next week. He decides to park in the middle of where our driveways split up. Meaning I have to park out on the road. Keep in mind this is actually my property, he's just a prick. That night, instead of abusing him the next time I saw him, I thought of a better revenge. 

In the dead of the night, I take a pack of frozen prawns out of my freezer. I sneak down my driveway and kneel down by one of his tyres. I then begin sliding frozen prawns one by one into his hubcap. Pushing them far enough in that they are invisible from the out side. I systematically fill each of his four hubcaps with two kilos of frozen prawns (4.4 pounds). 

Now keep in mind this is in the middle of a boiling hot Australian summer. Even by the next morning i could smell the prawns had thawed and were beginning to cook. Over the course of the next week I watched him inspect his car thoroughly, trying to work out where the abhorrent stench was coming from. He looked in his engine, all through his car, in his fucking exhaust for christs sake. 

But never deep within his hubcaps. 

They must have festered there for a good month before he finally sold his car. The smell was bloody horrible. Serves him right, the cunt.

1371051554.0,2146,self.pettyrevenge,1g78ps,Petty Revenge at the Strip Club,3484,1338,503,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1g78ps/petty_revenge_at_the_strip_club/,"A little bit of background before I get into the petty revenge. I’m a dancer at a strip club in Florida. It’s a small club in a relatively conservative area, so it’s pretty tame compared to a lot of other places. It’s more of a bikini bar as we must keep our bottoms on and our nipples covered with tape or tassels at all times under penalty of losing our job (which I’m OK with). In the past few years strip clubs have become more mainstream and popular with all types of people – not just the clichéd perverted old men (although we definitely still get those guys). We regularly host bachelorette parties, couples, groups of women, and groups of couples come in to enjoy the show. We even get middle-aged couples (they’re always the most fun and surprisingly accepting to the scene).  For the most part, the women are pretty cool with being surrounded by half-naked strippers, and enjoy hanging out with us, and we’re happy to have them there. MOST of them….not all. We get the occasional girlfriend or wife who comes in with a ‘holier than thou’ attitude who just sits there and scowls at everyone. Clearly she was dragged in against her will and wants to show her displeasure by trying to ruin the night for everyone. If you try to make conversation with them, they make passive-aggressive remarks putting you and your profession down.  That’s fine. Dancers have to have tough skin and lots of confidence, so we usually just go to the dressing room and laugh about how insecure the girl is. 


For those of you who aren’t familiar with how most strip clubs are set up, here is a brief explanation. Most have a bar right when you walk in so you can grab a drink. There is typically a stage with a dancer on it either in the middle of the club, or running along one wall. Generally, the closer to the stage you sit, the more open you are to talking to girls and getting private dances. The stage will have chairs around it which is called ‘the tip rail’. At the tip rail you have a very close view of the women on stage, but it is heavily implied that you must tip the dancer to sit there. At my club, there are about a dozen chairs around the stage.  When a dancer receives a tip at the tip rail, she normally does something a little extra for the guy. If it’s a dollar or two I just let them stick it in my G-string. If it’s $5-$10 I’ll motorboat, or shake my butt. If it’s $10-$15 I’ll wrap my thighs around their neck and jiggle the lady bits. Anything over $15 I’ll climb off the stage and give them a 30 second lap dance.  If a douchebag sits at the tip rail and tips nothing, then I will completely ignore them. An additional note: if you’re sitting at the tip rail, and all the chairs around the tip rail are full, and the club is packed your ass had better be tipping generously, because if you’re just sitting there taking up space from someone who would otherwise be tipping, then you’re essentially taking money out of my pocket. It’s truly frustrating, but we can't really say anything about it because tipping at the tip rail is only heavily implied, not required.


Here is where the petty revenge comes into play. Every once in a while one of those scowling, angry women sits at the tip rail –usually with the boyfriend or group of friends who are having a GREAT time – and doesn’t tip a single dollar. Her friends are usually tipping, but she will just sits there, arms crossed, pissed off and bitter. For the longest time my reaction to these women would be just to ignore them just like I do with non-tipping men. Then I mentioned it to a co-worker about how annoying these girls are because they bring down the mood of the night, and don’t tip when they should be. She told me I’m taking the wrong approach in ignoring them. Next time it happens, treat the girl like she tipped $15 – wrap your legs around her neck and stick your crotch right in her face. So I did. The next time a pissy girl came in and sat at the tip rail during a busy night and didn’t tip, I SHOWERED the girl with attention: boobs in her face, ass jiggling, thighs wrapping around her neck, pussy in the face, the whole nine yards despite her not tipping a single dollar. This is what happened: the guys LOVED it and threw TONS of money on the stage because, hey, girl –on –girl. The woman? Madder than hell, but unable to do anything about it because she’s sitting at the tip rail and I’m just doing my job. In addition, I’m the one smiling having a great time while she looks like a curmudgeon. It’s a win-win for me.
I now do this on a regular basis with almost the exact same results each time: I make more money, and at the same time piss off someone who clearly looks down upon my job.

Edit: I really hate when people edit, but it's pretty clear some of you have never been to a strip club. The atmosphere is VERY relaxed and chill. No one is sexually harassing anyone. The tip rail is literally the only place I do this. If someone isn't comfortable with it, they have a choice of about a hundred other chairs they are more than welcome to sit at without any disturbance.

We are trained more extensively than the other people working on the desk as we need to be able to work solo without support, so we get looked upon by our colleagues as superior/replacement managers when our team leader isn't in. 

One of my 12 hour colleagues loves it, chicken-guy felt superior before he went 12 hour and it probably hasn't helped. He often forgets that he isn't superior to me. One day he took it upon himself to do the lunches. He asked if I wanted a specific time and I told him 12:30, it was another colleagues leaving day and we were going for a pub lunch to say goodbye to her. He told me ""I'm going at 12:30, you can go at 1:30 or 2:30.""

I politely declined his offer and told him why I wanted to go at this time, he replied ""Tough shit, bitch, I'm going at 12:30 because that's when not-Tesco finishes cooking their deli chicken. You can go at 1:30.""

The bitch bit was unnecessary, I'm a dude for starters, so I agreed to go at 3:30, with the full intention of going at 12:30. This meant that the other lunches where filled out from 12:30 - 3:30 and during this 3 hour period no one would be able to go on lunch at the same time.

I emailed my manager and said ""You know it's leaving-girl's leaving lunch today, you mind if I go to lunch at 12:30 with them?""
I got a reply minutes later saying ""Sure, I'll give you a lift.""

Manager pops over to the desk at about 12:20 and say's ""Are you ready to go?"" I grabbed my wallet, put myself on lunch and left without saying anything to [guy], he just watched with a ""what is happening"" look.

We get back about an hour later, I sit at my desk and he is just staring at me. I check my emails, and he's sent an email to the manager that just took me to lunch and BCC'd me in. the general jist of it was ""I made the decision, he should respect me, blah blah blah, I'm more important.""

1371742665.0,2059,self.pettyrevenge,1gqddi,Threaten to sue me over your adult movie rental charges at a hotel? Be prepared to pay.,3242,1183,353,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1gqddi/threaten_to_sue_me_over_your_adult_movie_rental/,"I worked at a nice, 3 star hotel in a very rich suburb in 2007.  I worked the weekend night audit shift to have a little extra spending money while I was finishing up my Master's degree, since the rest of my weekly 8-5 money was going to pay my bills.  

It was Saturday morning around 5 am and I had just gotten finished putting all of the room checkout slips under the doors of the people checking out.  I was in back finishing up my paperwork when I hear ""ding ding ding"" (I would put a bell out if I was in back working so I knew when people came up to the desk.) I reply ""I will be back up in a minute"" and I heard ""ding ding ding"" again.  I ignore it since I knew he heard me, then he starts hitting the bell incessantly until I finally come up.

I come around the corner and take the bell out of his hands (since he's still ringing it even though I'm in front of him).  I smile and say ""How can I help you?"" and he replies ""There's a mistake on my bill.""  I take the bill and look at it, check his account, and say ""I don't see any mistakes on the bill.  What do you think is in error?""  He replies, ""These video charges... they aren't mine.""  I look at the bill again and see around $250 in video movie charges.  I reply back ""Sir, these were movies were checked out of your room and the system automatically processes them.""

He looks uncomfortable and he then accuses the housekeeping staff of renting the movies while he was out of his room.  I highly doubt this, but trying to give him the benefit of the doubt I say I will look into it.  He says he'll come back in a little bit.  I go back to the movie rental system and print out his rental report.  I don't really review it because I need to check my audit paperwork and finish running my reports.

He returns around 6:30 am and in tow with him are a group of other adults and kids checking out (he's chatting with them, so I assume they're in the same group).  He asks me if I have removed the charges and I go and grab his checkout report.  

One thing you should know is that the rental system in most hotels will tell the hotel staff exactly what movies were watched, when they were watched, and how long they were watched.  Usually if movies are flipped on by mistake (usually by a kid or rolling/sitting on the remote), most people catch it within the first few minutes and call down immediately to have the charges removed.  Which we have no problem with because hey, it happens.

I look over his report and ALL the movies rented are adult films.  They were all watched for 15-20 minutes and they were all late at night at almost the same exact time (there is no way the housekeeping staff was here that late at night or would be in someone's room). It was hard not to smirk, but I put a smile on my face and politely say ""I'm sorry sir, but the rental report shows that you did check out these movies and watch them."" I show him the report and his face totally falls.

Then this guy narrows his eyes and out of no where stars yelling at me. ""Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you, I DID NOT RENT THESE MOVIES.  YOUR HOUSEKEEPING STAFF ARE THE ONES WHO WATCHED THESE MOVIES.  THEY ARE STEALING MY HARD EARNED MONEY AND I'M GOING TO SUE YOU AND THE HOTEL.""

Well, I do not take well to being yelled at or being told I'm going to be sued.  So in front of all his friends and their kids, I loudly start reading the times, movie titles, and how long they were watched for.  A few of the adults start pulling their kids away from him, a few starting laughing at him, and one guy even said ""You sicko, just pay the nice lady your bill for your pornos.""  The best part: All the titles were for granny porn. 

He grabs the bill from me and runs out of the hotel (literally ran).  A bunch of the adults start laughing harder and I hope is that to this day they have not let him live it down.

**tl;dr** - Guy in hotel has about $250 in adult movie rentals.  He accuses the housekeeping staff of watching them in his room, so I read the list of granny porn he watched out loud to him in front of his friends.

**Edit 2**: Not sure what to say to those who think it's fake... I really have no way of proving it true or false.  I haven't worked with the company since I graduated in 2008 and the only thing I have are my tax forms to prove I worked there.

My stepsister was raised to expect everything handed to her on a platter. She's the first-born idol of her side of the family. She's not an only child but she fills every cliche of the spoilt brat only kid. I feel sorry for her brother and sister. They get treated so differently, although they're okay people for it they do miss out on a lot from their parents.

Stepsister is also a bigoted, racist cow. The filth that spills from her mouth and her attitudes about anybody who isn't attractive, cool, or *normal* is sickening. I've lived with it for years and I'm pretty bitter about it, though I keep the peace for my mom's sake. Worst that's happened between us is a screaming match where I ended up bawling and wilting because she hates the idea of gays being visibly gay, gays being allowed around kids, gay marriage, and she wonders out loud why we can't just shut the fuck up and hide like good little freaks. Me, I'm lesbian and out.

I'm not terribly confident at the best of times, though I'll stand my ground when it comes to that kind of bigotry, but her confidence is absolute. she feels she's right all the time and entirely dismisses anything that stands in the way of her bigotry and goes into attack if she feels threatened, and everything threatens her. Fuck I hate her.

Occasionally I check her facebook page (we're not friended, but it's well worth seeing what she's up to in order to prepare for her dramas before they hit the family). Before her wedding she had a meltdown on facebook at the cost of the photographer she wanted. I know the guy she wanted to use, and he's damned good and charges worthwhile prices for good work.

The kicker here is that's my profession too. Most of my income comes through my photography. Commercial and product though, not weddings thankfully.

And in a little post on the wall of a friend of hers, hidden from general view, she said she planned to get around even paying for a wedding photographer by inviting me. She knows I always have a camera on me and one or another of them comes with me everywhere. The presumptive cow decided she'd get free wedding photos out of me.

Day of the wedding I brought my worst camera body with a broken flash, and a useless 17-85mm lens (a rubbish lens to start with) that I borrowed (ironically from the photographer she wouldn't pay for) and had suffered from a water spill. It took photos with bad halos around EVERYTHING, and I took photos constantly in small jpg mode.

She asked for the photos from me after the wedding and I gave her the cards with them all on, straight from the camera.

It made her cry. She went fucking MENTAL at me to her and my family, but not a soul except her and her husband lay any blame on me for taking shit photos because hey, I was never hired for the job and never told to my face I'd be needed as a photographer, let alone paid for anything. If she had a clue beyond the superficial she'd realize that her wedding, the actual event, and the marriage that followed was the most special part of it all - but no. She considers the ability to show off her wedding to be the most important thing, and I removed some of that ability from her.

I took a small professional hit I'm sure, but I can live with that if it keeps her away from me.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1elg58,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1elg58/i_destroyed_my_nasty_stepsisters_ability_to_show/,

Enjoy your hike.,2592,553,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/19emql/strand_my_girlfriend_enjoy_your_hike/,"I've been reading this subreddit since it started, and it's definitely  become one of my favorites. So I'm glad to finally contribute. I apologize if it's a bit long.

Background:

During college I was in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend Mary (now my wife). We went to neighboring state schools, which meant a lot of 3-4 hour drives back and forth most weekends. On this particular weekend Mary discovered that her friend, Jess, was also planning on visiting my school. They only lived about 30 minutes apart from each other, so it made sense to carpool for the long ride up. Jess offered to use her car if Mary would drive them up there, with the condition that Jess would drive Mary home on the way back.

Since it's a college town, parking was at a premium, and free parking was even harder to find. Luckily, some of my friends had a free lot on the outskirts of town. Since we're all doing each other favors I offered to park Jess' car there and save everyone some money.

I met them both when they arrived Friday afternoon.  Jess went to hang out with her friends,  and I parked her car in the free lot. I should mention that it's a very large town, and it was easily a 25 minute walk from Jess' friend's apartment to the free lot. That is, if you know where the free lot is located...

Anyway, we had an awesome weekend and Sunday rolls around meaning its time for Jess and Mary to go home. I was engaged in an all-day student club event when I got a phone call from Mary stating the following:  

Jess had decided that she didn't have time to drop Mary off at home anymore. And that she would leave Mary several towns over. At which point Mary should call another friend to take her the rest of the way. Oh, and can I go get Jess her car and bring it to her since I still had her keys?  Oh hell no!

I was pissed, and I was certainly not going to let Jess strand my girlfriend in an unfamiliar place with no means to get home. Mary was upset and didn't really know what to do since Jess was being a selfish bitch. It was at this point that I realized the only way I could guarantee for Mary to get home was to make the long drive there myself to drop her off. So I left my event, leaving my understanding friends shorthanded, and went to meet that bitch Jess.

The revenge:

I told Jess ""Sure, come to my apartment and I'll take care of you."" She arrived expecting her car, and was handed only keys. I pointed her in the direction of the lot, walked to my car and started driving Mary home. The thing is, the free lot was in an obscure and far away part of town. It took me 25 minutes to walk there, moving at a relatively fast pace, and knowing exactly where I was going.

Jess was still calling me 2 hours later trying to find her car from my intentionally vague directions. Mary was half way home before Jess even started her trip. I hope she grasped the irony that by trying to save 30 minutes, and screwing over my girlfriend, she ended up losing 2 hours of her time. But, that's probably giving her too much credit.

TL;DR:  My girlfriend's ""friend"" was willing to strand my girlfriend to save herself a half hour. She completely went back on everything she promised after taking advantage of our kindness.

My sister, she probably loves them more then anyone. So on the day she was down and depressed after breaking up with her boyfriend, my brother and I swore to bring her cheer with a delicious chocolate cake.

We venture out the front door and hop into his Jeep and set on down the road to the local grocer. We arrive and as we are looking to park this women, who we will call the Blob, cuts us off and steals the parking spot we were waiting for. We shrugged it off as we are pretty relaxed fellows and parked in another spot. We make way into the grocery store, head directly to the baked goods counter, and wait in line to be served. The Blob pulls up behind us chattering away obnoxiously on her cell phone and completely oblivious to what was around her. Our turn to be served comes up, we select the last remaining chocolate cake, and ask the baker to out a message on our cake. She said it would take about ten minutes, as there was a line, and we told her we would be back to pick up our order. As we were walking away The Blob asks for a chocolate cake and is told there is none left and that we got the last one. She begins freaking out in a very entitled tone and demands that she receive said cake since we cut her off in the bakery line. However, the baker assures her we were here first and she would have to pick a different cake. At this point we could no longer hear what was happening but we didnt care as the Blob stole our parking spot, and got her just desserts as we took the last chocolate cake. However, our dealing with the Blob were far from over.

We headed to the frozen aisle to grab some pizza pockets, fries, chicken fingers, and other delectable snack foods as we were pretty starved. We headed back to the bakery counter only to find a different person behind the counter. We ask her for our cake and are told our sister picked it up. She then points down the bread aisle to the Blob with our cake in her motherfucking cart. Now most people would walk away and let this bitch eat her cake, but we were not backing down.

We followed her for some time through the grocery store. We decided to wait for an opportune moment and steal our cake back. The second she turned to grab something from the dairy fridge we gallopped over, grabbed the cake and ran headlong to the checkout. Looking back we saw she was distracted on her phone again and did not notice the cake was missing. We paid for our groceries and headed out to the truck.

As we were leaving we realized that maybe we could get a little extra revenge on her. So we wrote up a note, indicating how delicious the cake was, and that she should thank us for saving her the calories. We tucked this under the wiper of her car and drove off just as she was walking out. Her face was red and puffed with air, we could tell she was angry as hell that we got our cake back.

It wasn't much but it was home. The neighbors house were close on all sides which normally wasn't an issue.

A house next to the bedroom side of me was rented out to a young group of people who occasionally had loud late night parties. To me this wasn't a problem as i worked nights. For the other neighbors it was a nightmare. The group would always seem to turn the music off before the cops would arrive, threaten violence or vandalism to people if they would walk over to complain etc.

I was trying to stay out of the drama, until one of the punks got a new  ""system"" for his car. The bass would literally shake my walls. I tried to be civil and even asked politely for him to wait at least until I was awake ,around 12pm ,to rattle the few brain cells he had left into oblivion.  He blatantly refused and I'm pretty sure he did it more often to piss me off.

So, I did what the other neighbors had neglected to do. I got on the tax collectors website found out who owned the house. It was owned by an elderly couple in Massachusetts, where I'm from. After talking to them and gathering complaints form the others who had been harassed the landlords had enough and sent them a notice to vacate, which they ignored. 

I ended up being appointed (volunteer) property manager, and escorted a police officer to hand delivering the eviction notice to them 

The look on their face was priceless.

In one of our subjects, the teacher wanted to have a class debate about a controversial topic and chose abortion since there was a national debate on the practice at the time. I was picked to be the moderator of the debate, so I had to do research, create questions, know how to ask follow up questions, etc.

Now there were two classes for this subject. There was mine, right before lunch, and another right after lunch on the same day. The class after lunch picked an obnoxious, idiotic, spoiled brat of a soul as their moderator. She was an obnoxious person. Lets call her X

I was never a top student, but I was quite good, and so I prepared all my work and had it ready a bit in advance. The day before the debate, X comes up to me all nicely and asks if she can have my notes because he hasn't had time to prepare them (this is bullshit, she was known for copying). At this moment, I instantly came up with a way to teach her a lesson. I said yes, but tomorrow at lunch since. I told her I wasn't finished yet.

Come the next day, I do the debate, it went fine and then there's lunch. At some point she runs into me and asks me for the notes. I gave her the notes folded up and she put them in her bag without even looking at it. This turned out to be an even greater blessing, so I went to the teacher and asked if I could watch the debate to see how they approached the subject (I had a free period after lunch).

Class begins, and X takes out the papers and opens them to my delight. The expression of horror on her face was beautiful. Each page had one word on it in the very centre. The first page said 'NO', the second page said 'FUCKING' and the third page said 'WAY'. She gave me a death stare while I smirked. She tried to improvise but was a disaster, causing the teacher to ask for my help to 'show X how it's done'. It became clear she didn't do her work. Ohhhhh it was beautiful.

I get to the platform about 8-10 minutes before the 7:16 express train which arrives in the city a little after 8. At 7:12, there is a local which arrives at 8:15. At 7:12, the local still was not at the platform. I am standing towards the edge of the platform because I was one of the first ones there (I was behind the yellow line which is the area on the edge of the platform they reccommend you do not stand on because it is an unnecessary danger being that close to the tracks). The way it works is that the first people stand towards the front of the platform so they get on first, classic first come-first serve. 
 
At 7:15, this woman comes pushing past everyone on the platform. She goes behind me and, I don't know if she only meant to nudge me, didn't see me, or meant to push me because she was having a bad day. I stumbled forward and almost fell on the tracks. I was starting to catch myself but I realized I was probably going to have to jump down onto the tracks then climb back up to avoid falling on the metal tracks onto my face. I was going slow enough that some nice person behind me grabbed my backpack and stopped my forward momentum. I thanked the man for his kind action and he said loudly how obnoxious that lady was. She either didn't or pretended not to hear.
 
I realized because she arrived at 7:15, she didn't know the 7:12 hadn't come yet, so I thought of a quick revenge plan. I moved towards her so I was next to her and at 7:16, the local arrived. As it was pulling into the station, she said aloud to no one in particular, ""this is the express, right?"" I said ""yes ma'am"". Because she pushed her way past everyone and was at the front, she made sure to rush and be the first one on. No one else followed her. The conductor said ""delayed 7:12 local"" but becuase she had moved SO fast to get the seat she wanted, the doors closed before she got out and left me a glaring look.

To provide a little background, I was a nerdy kid of less than 100 pounds with no muscle whatsoever.  I was frequently bullied because of this, usually just verbal but sometimes more.  This kid named A realized that he could take my lunch and I couldn't do anything about it, so that went on for a few days.  He had a particular taste for packaged meat products- this is important.

After the second time he stole my lunch (and I went hungry as a result), I was fed up.  I went home, took a piece of beef jerky, and soaked it in Dave's Insanity sauce for 36 hours.  After sampling the meat (holy shit was it spicy, and I have a high tolerance for heat), I brought it in to school.  I told my friends and classmates what was about to go down so that they could watch it happen.

Well, what do you know, A came around and snatched the beef jerky out of my hands at lunch.  I hardly complained, just told him it was a special recipe of mine.  He took a giant bite and started to talk about how spicy it was, me telling him that was how I like it (and with a big shit-eating grin on my face).

Fast forward to 10 minutes later and A was visibly sweating, face red, swearing loudly about the beef jerky he was still nibbling on so he didn't look like a bitch in front of his friends.  He snatched my fruit snacks and applesauce, ate them in front of me, and then I knew I had to end this once and for all, so I tried to think of a plan.  Meanwhile, A spent the rest of lunch blocking anyone else from using the water fountain in order to wash the heat from his mouth.

On the way back from lunch, A still swearing at me, I told him I knew a little trick to get the heat out.  I told him to just massage the corners of his eyes, right near the tear ducts...

It is a very popular destination for rich swedes and norweigans during summer, and is packed with bars and fancy resturants.

The staff saw what happend, and threw them out. But the girl was in tears, and everyone was mad. The owner of the place quickly sent one of the staff to take pictures of the two men. He then sent them to every owner of a resturant, bar, nightclub and shop on the island and explained what had happend.

I had filled up the day before [gas station is 2 miles from the house and has competitive prices] so i knew my tank was supposed to show full. I come out to leave for work and turn the car on like normal and watch the gas gauge rise on back up...half way. Ok, no big deal; parents might have borrowed some. I can ask them when I get home.

They say no, they didn't, and offer to let me fill up from the gas cans we keep filled and stored for whatever we might need it for. I top my tank back off with this welcome help and go on in for the night. The next morning, crank up the car and... 1/4 a tank. Something fishy is up.

Asked my nearest neighbors if perhaps they had siphoned my tank for an emergency; its happened before, so figured perhaps that was the explanation. Nope. No one had done so. I figured I could only conclude there was some one stealing my gas. Time to fix that.

I go on to the gas station and fill up my tank again. I also fill a 1 gallon jug most of the way with diesel, then top off the jug with gasoline. The combine mixture now, for all intents and purposes, appears and smells like gasoline. 

I head on home and set up a pipe with a cap and sink it on into my gas tank, then take it out to be sure there were no leaks seeping into the pipe. I put the pipe back in and anchor it inside my tanks receiving tube [the portion leading down into the gas tank from the cap] and fill it with the gasoline-diesel, close my cap and go on in for the night.

This girl, let's call her R, is a coworker of mine at a local grocery store.  One day at work R asks me to buy her cigarettes from our work (I'm 18, she's 17).  I tell her I won't and after a few more questions she drops the subject.  Later that day, I am called into my manager's office and he is furious because R told him that I had offered to buy her cigarettes.  He  threatens to fire me over this, but gives me one final chance because I've been a model employee, although he believes I'm lying to him when I tell him the true version of the story.

Now R is a very flirty, touchy person.  She is always giving hugs and touching the other male employees.  I was never bothered by it, but after this incident I decided her touching was making an ""uncomfortable work environment"" for me.  I began to keep a detailed record of each time she touched me and told her each time that I wasn't comfortable with her doing it.  Each time I said it loud enough so another employee could hear and asked them to sign my record, thereby affirming my story.  

3 weeks go by and I mention something to our store's HR person telling them R was making me uncomfortable.  R is given a warning, but after a couple days the touching continues, as does my recording.  3 more weeks go by and a similar complaint is made by me to our HR person.  R is given a second warning, but ignores it and continues to touch me, mainly because she knows that I'm ""made uncomfortable"" by it, and she thinks that is funny.

Finally, after 2 months I go to the HR person and show them the physical list I have made of each time R has touched me, including my fellow coworkers signatures, telling how they can back up my claim.  The HR person immediately calls R into the HR office and fires her on the spot for ""repeated sexual harassment of fellow employees"".  The look of shock/surprise on her face made it all worthwhile, especially when she looked over and saw the knowing smirk on my face.

tl;dr:  Co-worker asks me to buy her cigarettes illegally, and almost gets me fired.  I get her fired for sexual harassment.

My first story:

Years ago in my high school AP economics class I was assigned to sit in the corner of the room where I was flanked by a handful of very popular, *very* lazy kids. After every exam the teacher would announce (much to my chagrin) my ""high score"" to the class.

After a particularly challenging exam where I only scored 93%, the teacher announced that the guy to my right (let's call him Matt) had ALSO scored 93%, his friend behind him 90%, and the friend behind HIM 90%! Needless to say I vacillated between self-doubt and suspicion for a few days before I finally ""congratulated"" one of the 90%'ers on his score. With an impish grin he admitted that his friend Matt had been cheating off me for months and ""thanked"" me for helping ""so many people do so well"" in the class. The petty revenge gears started turning in my head for what seemed like ages before I replied ""no problem, I'm just glad to help!""

At the next exam I put my my paper in very clear view of Matt. He had been told that I was now willing to ""help"" him and his friends. I circled all wrong answers while making a special mark for the correct ones. Just before the time was up, I quickly changed my answers back when nobody was looking, turned in my exam, and smugly walked back to my seat.

What I didn't know at the time was that the cheating conspiracy didn't just involve the kids sitting next to me, but that my answers were written down and forwarded to the next 4 periods, all of which took an identical test.

One week later a record 22 people failed the exam. Matt empathetically remarked ""Oh man, Accidentally_Upvotes, did you fail too!?"" I flipped over my sheet: **100%**.

Nobody ever cheated off me in that class again.

1361712291.0,1808,self.pettyrevenge,194qln,You don't ignore a man with unlimited patience.,2273,465,205,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/194qln/you_dont_ignore_a_man_with_unlimited_patience/,"OK, let me preface this with two things:
1) I'm still a little (just a little) intoxicated from the time these events took place, and
2) I have the utmost respect for tipping, tippers, servers, bartenders, etc., having worked in the food industry myself. 
So let me begin.

Tonight, on my reading break back around my home city, I attended a split birthday event of two of my friends at a downtown bar. Good times were being had, all that stuff, everything was great until one point. See, I had left my jacket with coat check, but at some point I had lost my coat check ticket by accident. For a normal drunk this would certainly be disastrous, but I had my wits about me, and due to planning this couldn't be that big a problem.

See, I knew exactly where my jacket was in the coat check area, I knew my coat check number, I knew exactly what was in each pocket of the jacket, hell, I even had a PHOTO ID in one of the pockets. Easy enough to get me my jacket back, right? Nah.

After waiting in line, I explained my predicament to the attendants at the coat check in detail, which included pointing to my jacket and telling them exactly how I could prove it was mine (including the ID). In the most condescending tone possible they tell me there's *nothing* they can do, I have to wait for closing (three hours later) and a manager to get it back, long after the last skytrain (fancy talk for subway) leaves and forces me into a $65+ cab home. I ask if they can just call a manager over, I understand they can't just give out coats without tickets all willy-nilly, but with a manager called over, really taking the minimum amount of effort possible, the whole thing could've been over within 30 seconds. Nope, they clearly didn't give half a shit about me having my jacket. Well shit, there's no way I'm leaving without it and having it ""disappear"" when I go to get it the next day, I have to deal with this tonight.

Easier said than done.

After again explaining how easily this whole situation could be resolved, they decide to make their power play. Their power play turned out to be saying, word for word, ""We're going to ignore you now."" Now I'm not competitive man, I'm not a vengeful man, but I am a patient man. A very patient man. In this case, a man with unlimited patience. So I said, ""I'm going to ignore you too."" But that is not all that I did.

The petty revenge, you want? Sure thing.

If you're going to be waiting around for a very long time, like, say, for bar closing, you have to have something to lean against. In this case, l chose the empty pitcher that served as tip jar for the two coat check attendants. Immediately I saw a splash of panic in one of their eyes, but out of their principle, not a word of protest. As long as they were refusing to rectify my easily fixable situation, I refused to let them take in a  single cent of tip, leaning over the pitcher in their plain sight, with a smile on my face. Nothing. Even when they tried to get clever and set out a second one at the far side of the counter, a quick ""Oh, sorry, excuse me, gotta grab this,"" cut through the line of drunks collecting their coats and provided me with some perfect additional arm support. I was going nowhere, but they were getting nothing. Someone had to break, and it sure wasn't going to be me. I just wanted my fucking jacket, damn it.

So, for the next hour and a half (the last skytrain was long since gone), I stood and watched with glee as the two attendants worked non-stop taking in and giving out everyone's jackets without taking in a cent of tip money because of me. They had damaged me in one go, and a devastating one at that, but I got the satisfaction of watching them slowly realize the error of their stubbornness over a long, long time, their faces turning from stony half-smiles to the bitterest of longings for what those two pitchers could have meant to them. Lo and behold, a bit before closing my coat-check ticket ""was turned in"" and I got to leave with my jacket before the manager got involved. I got everything I needed while they left with nothing. Success!
Sorry if this was convoluted garbage, just read below.

**the TL;DR: Coat check attendants refuse minimum effort to get me my jacket back, I refuse them their tips for the busiest part of the night.**

I'm mild-mannered. I'm quiet, I don't really go out of my way to speak at all. I enjoy observing, and it takes a lot to phase or irritate me. A lot. I'm also Muslim and I wear a hijab (head covering, like a nun...but not). 

I live in a small rural town in Southern Ontario, and for the past 8 years I have loved it here. It's really nice, the townspeople are wonderful and inclusive and it's just a beautiful little town, really. I have never really encountered rudeness, aside from my brief foray into the world of retail. I have also never been on the receiving end of any racial abuse. That is until the fateful day I went to my local grocers to see that it was, in fact, closed early that day. 

Sighing, I resigned myself to the fact that I'd had to go to the next town over to get my bread and eggs. The next town over wasn't nearly as nice as my town. It was rundown, unpleasant and had a very long history of the KKK being active in there. But it's 2013 and no one had heard of any such horrible business for a good long while, right? And it'd be silly to not get bread and eggs based on things I wasn't even sure were true, right? 

So off I went. I walked into the grocers and began perusing the fruits. The town, thus far, hadn't been at all what I had thought of it as. Sure it was rundown, but no one had given me any dirty looks. I was contented and went on my way. Until I heard, 

""Why is *she* here?""

I didn't pay no mind, until I heard again, 

""People like *her* should not be allowed in this country.""

My back stiffened. I was, quite plainly, the only 'minority' around. I turned around and saw a wizened 50 year old woman. Long of face and sour of expression, she looked at me with such hatred I was shocked. Her bony fingers pointed at me in an accusingly. My eyes widened, but I stood my ground and decided that perhaps she was just batty, and went on with my shopping calmly. 

Standing next to her was her husband, I presume. He was tall, large and just as mean-faced as his wife. But he said nothing, and I was going to say nothing too. I'd let it go, II didn't want to get into a verbal altercation. I just wanted to get my things and go home. 

The old lady did not rest, however. She followed me around the shop and began spewing more hatred. 

""Religion is evil but Islam is the most evil.""

""You are dirty, they should burn everything you touch.""

""You're a pig.""

""Islam is disgusting.""

""Go back to your own country you illiterate bitch.""

""I bet you fuck pigs.""

And on, and on it went. Each new epithet more horrifying than the last. They were only words though, she hadn't touched me or assualted me in anyway. But I was starting to get annoyed. What had I done to her, anyway? I just existed and she hated me based on my existence! I, for the life of me, don't understand how you can hate someone based purely on their physical appearance. 

The other customers and the cashiers were starting to stare now, but no one said anything. Fine, whatever. I don't really expect people to jump to my help, at all and most of them were seniors anyway. 

I have, by now, finished paying. Her insults still ringing in my ears, I'm about to exit the store and then I calmly turn around and face her for the first time.

This whole time I had been silent, she had been going on about my illiteracy, about how I should go back to my own country, how disgusting I am etc etc.

So I said in my clipped accent, 

""I find it surprising that you know *so* much about me just based on my appearance.""

She gestured to my headscarf and spat, 
""That thing tells me all I need to know.""

So I said, 

""Well I thought you looked like a crack whore when I first saw you. But now I can see your face I realize you're far too ugly to be one.""

She turned bright red in apoplectic rage and began screeching at other customers at this injustice I had caused her. 

Suddenly a green-aproned man with a name tag that said 'manager' appeared. She turned to him saying how horribly I had been her, how I'm a terrible person for calling her such foul things.

He calmly allowed her tirade to abate and said, 

""You're a sorry excuse for a human being and you and your husband aren't allowed back here again. Please get out of my sight.""

He then turned me and apologized profusely for not being alerted sooner to the situation, and said I'm welcome back anytime. I thanked him and left. 

The old lady was spitting with rage so as I drove off I gave her a cheery wave. 

TL;DR: Called a racist too ugly to be a crackwhore, manager backed me up.


Aside: I know it's not that juicy, but it was satisfying for me. I hardly ever speak up for myself so it was a big deal to me to have said anything. Thank you for reading.

Three years ago I made my wife a lasagna. Sauce from scratch, homemade spinach pasta, expensive cheese, the works. Hours invested - and the return? ""You should put more cheese on it like at the Macaroni Grill.""

I went out that night and bought six interior left hand doors. All of our interior doors were right handed. I cut plugs to fill the strike-plate &amp; hinge mortises, and every few weeks I change out a door or two, right hands for left, left for right. It only takes about twenty minutes now: pull the door, plug the mortises, spackle the plug seam, chisel the plug from the opposite side, hang the opposite door and sweep up. I painted the first few times, but it's a white jamb and I decided the paint smell was more suspicious than the unpainted spackle. It's a thin seam, and my wife wouldn't even know where to look. She's never said anything about it, but I've seen her grasp the air where a doorknob used to be a hundred times. Fuck the macaroni grill.

I work out at a large fitness chain gym and they have a ""bar"" where you can buy drinks and shakes with various supplements. I normally just bring my own, but I had forgotten it this day due to being a little slow out of bed, and decided to give it a shot. I hopped in line behind this self-entitled suburban house mother in her head-to-toe pink name brand workout outfit and patiently waited my turn.

We slowly move up and finally it is her turn to order, but instead of ordering she just starts lecturing the employee (A huge dude) on how dangerous the use of steroids are for him and how his genitals will shrivel up and die and he will grow man tits, and etc... Essentially publicly humiliating an employee for no reason at all. 

Now I have been working out at this gym for a few months, and I go at different times according to my schedule... but almost every time I go, he is there either working or working out, and the amount of dedication that he has is admirable. I'm not saying he doesn't use them for sure, but judging by body language and how he suddenly seemed so defeated, I am almost certain he got that way through natural means and hard work.

She finally ends her unsolicited lecture and orders a protein shake with soy milk because she is trying to lose a few last pounds before the summer begins. The employee reluctantly turns and starts to make the shake and she steps to the side to take a presumably *very* important phone call. That's when I catch it, the sweet sweet petty revenge. Instead of putting protein mix into the shake, he puts in mass gainer.

If you don't know much about fitness supplements, mass gainer is essentially very dense protein and carbohydrates, so it was still a ""protein"" shake, but probably ~400 calories more than what the plain protein shake would have been. Judging by how small this woman was, those extra calories were just enough to burst any caloric deficit that she was trying to get, but not too much to gain much extra weight... If he keeps this up, she will sit comfortably for the remainder of the summer prep time at the exact same weight completely confused as to why her efforts just aren't cutting it.

Just as he turned around to hand it to her he caught my eye and froze. I just gave him a wink, he smiled back and handed her the evil concoction. I was sure to give him a nice tip out of admiration for how expertly he had engineered that petty revenge.

(Longish but worth it in abundance)",2430,655,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hntbu/the_tale_of_the_entitled_princess_the_vengeful/,"So I work at a frozen yogurt store, one of those self-serve places where you make your own and weigh it.  It's an easy job and aside from some occasional bullshit from upper management, it's also generally pleasant.  I also happen to live in a fairly wealthy area, and the vast majority of my customers are very wealthy folks, and while 99% of them are awesome, wonderful people, there are always bad apples.

Slightly rude or short with me is one thing, but once in a while we get a customer in who is well and truly an entitled monster, and on those occasions I wish for nothing more than the power to set people on fire with only my furious gaze.  This young lady was one of those people.

**The offense:**  It's about 6-7pm, and it's a busy day.  I've been cutting up fresh fruit for the fridge and now I'm bringing it out for the customers to use.  *Entitled Princess*(hereafter known as *EP*) and her friend - both would be about 16-17 - are getting their yogurt, and as I'm passing them, *EP* ""accidentally"" knocks a chair into me, causing me to fall and spill about 6 containers of mango all over the floor.  I take a deep breath and ask the customers to please not walk on it while I grab a cloth and a cup to put the floor-mango into, and *EP*'s friend immediately begins to help me, getting on the floor and scooping it into a pile.  

*EP* leans down, laughs, and tugs friend to her feet announcing loudly ""Ewwww Laura, don't help her!  That's what they pay her for!"" as she purposefully stomps all over the fruit on her way to the cash, making an already huge mess about 5x worse.  Friend begins to protest, but *EP* is clearly queen bee and she relents, giving me apologetic eyes as they pay and leave.  *EP* also made sure to run the yogurt all over the place while making hers, so the machines are also really messy and gross now.

**The Revenge:** So about 5 minutes after they've left, the store has gotten quiet.  I'm going around doing some busywork, cleaning chairs and tables and doing a quick mop, when all of a sudden I notice a wallet lying beside the scale by the register.  As is our policy, I open it up to look for ID(so that when they return I can verify that the wallet does indeed belong to them), and lo and behold, the wallet appears to belong to *EP*.  But then, looking closer, I notice two driver's licenses.  I pull them out, thinking maybe it's the nice friend's wallet instead(and in that case, I would have slipped a bunch of dollar off coupons inside), but no, both have pictures of *EP*.  One has a name and birthdate matching her health card(that says she's 16) and the other has a totally different name and birthdate(that says she's newly 20. **Edited to add: I live in Ontario, Canada where the drinking age is 19**).  It dawns on me that it's a fake I.D. and I chuckle to myself before putting the wallet away to return when she comes back, untouched.  I'm not the kind of person to risk my job to steal from a forgotten wallet, even if the owner sucks.

But then it happens.  About two hours after the wallet was found, *EP* returns with her spray-tanned, blinding-teeth-knashing, hair-helmeted and polo-shirt wearing dad in tow, both in a snit and clearly expecting the wallet to have mysteriously ""disappeared"".  Dad marches up while *EP* stands behind smirking at me, and declares that his precious daughter left her(very expensive, LV in fact!) wallet here and that she ABSOLUTELY must have it back this very moment.  Well, this is like Christmas morning for me, because I realise that I get to completely shit all over *EP*'s day.  I pull out the wallet and ask ""Is this the wallet you left?"" to which she snappily responds that it is, while jumping in front of dad and trying to yank it from my hand.  I pull it back, open it up, and say, very calmly and with a poker face: ""Can I get the name and birthdate on the I.D.?""

Dad rolls his eyes like a dying cow and barks ""OH FOR GOD'S SAKE (FIRST NAME) (LAST NAME) AND (ACTUAL BIRTHDAY)!""

To which I respond, fake I.D. in hand, ""That's not the information I have here."" right before I swiftly reach over *EP*'s grasping fingers and hand the I.D. to Dad.

There's a moment of horrible, fantastic silence while Dad takes in the I.D. in his hand.  About 10-15 seconds later I break the tension by pulling out the real license and saying ""Ooooh, silly me, here it is!  That other one must be old or something!"", giving *EP* my best fake grin and holding out her wallet for her to take .  *EP* reaches out to take it, but dad leans over and snatches it from me, shooting her a look that could peel paint and snapping ""*EP* WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE CAR!""

I live in a duplex that is surrounded by some apartments and it is all owned by the same landlord. Its hard to explain the set up, but basically we all have assigned parking spots and there are some visitor spots set up for everyone in the back lot. 

My side of the duplex has 4 spots for us, directly outside of our front door, separate from the rest of the parking.

**Enter Douchebag**

Now this one person was a regular visitor of one of my back neighbors. She knew the parking set up. But she seemed to always park in our assigned spots. I left plenty of strongly worded notes that seemed to go unread. But I rolled my eyes and let it slide. Our landlord was pretty passive and I knew he'd never have them towed.

I was frustrated, but it was fine. People steal spots here all the time. But one week everything changed.

The girl's car started acting up. The car alarm would go off at random. At any time of the day or night. For 20 minutes at a time. She apologized once, saying that it only happened when she locked her car electronically, but if she locked it manually it was fine. I thought that meant that she'd lock it manually.

Of course not.

For the next week I was annoyed, awakened, and infuriated by her car alarm. Her car that was parked outside my bedroom window. 

**The Revenge**

So one night we took the matter into our own hands. Her car had been at our house for 2 days straight. It was finally enough.

Her car was unlocked so we opened the door, popped the hood, and disconnected her battery. Car dead? No car alarm. Victory. 

**Aftermath**

Of course she is car illiterate. She comes to our door and asks if we know anything about cars. We say, sure! We'll take a look! We pop open the hood. ""Gosh, I really don't know what is the matter, looks like you'll have to get it towed.""

Girl had to spend $100 bucks to get that hunk of junk hauled out of our parking lot. I'm sure she spent even more on a mechanic to look and see our simple sabotage. 

**Satisfying Conclusion**

That also meant that by forcing her to see a mechanic, they fixed her alarm. She started parking in the appropriate spots (probably because she realized that we were the saboteurs) and her alarm never went off again.

I'm sure you are familiar with these so I won't go into a great explanation.  Normally, I can just ignore them, but these were coming to an email pertaining to a domain that I owned for my computer repair business.

It started with a few, and then grew to about 20 per day - every single day.  It was irritating to get an email notification only to find out that it was one of these BS emails.

I thought...what to do, what to do...then I had an idea.

I went to Angelfire and created a free website with nothing more than a counter on it.

I shelled out to a command prompt and wrote a batch file that when executed erased boot.ini, nrldr, ntdetect.com then launched a browser which loaded the website I had created (I put a pause in it, silently recursing the windows directory just to make sure their PC made it to the website) then it would shut down the PC.

For those of you not in the 'know', this will prevent a computer from booting, stopping at a black screen displaying an error message.  A good tech could have it back up and going with not much issue, but I was betting against that - after all, this is Nigeria.

I packaged the file into a password protected zip file and emailed it back to a few scammers stating that 'This was given to me by the bank, and contains my banking and credit card information. It is set to give a false virus warning to stop scammers, the password for the first file is &lt;password&gt;.  Please do not steal my information, I trust you'.

Within 2 days, the counter on my website had went from 3 (where I tested it) to over 140.

I have YET to receive another email from scammers at this email address.

From what I understand, they hack each others email in hopes of stealing 'victims' from each other.

He notices people coming in and avoids eye contact, keeps his nose buried in his book, keeps his white earbuds in, and ignores people who ask him to move his bag. 

Finally, an elderly lady gets on the train and she asks him (very nicely) if he'll move his stuff. He looks up at her, takes out his headphones, tells her to ""piss off,"" and then looks back down at his book. She looked shocked, but a businesswoman stood up and gave her her seat on the train.

Within the first day, only hours after moving in, the neighbor next to them started yelling and screaming at them to move their cars and that if they did not move their cars, he would not only have them towed but he would file trespassing charges on them for being on his property. My friends were beyond upset and didn't know what to do; they were just certain that their realtor had told them that the gravel driveway was theirs as was the very small piece of land that connected the driveway to their home. So for the time being they parked their cars directly in front of their house (practically on their lawn). In the meantime, the neighbor had rented a bulldozer and parked it in the spot that he claimed was his. He moved piles and piles of dirt into huge mounds blocking off entry to the gravel driveway. 
Seeing as how I work for the state as a social worker, I know quite a few people at the local court house. I called a few people and was directed to someone that could get me a copy of a land survey that had been done on my friends property. After pulling a few strings, I managed to get a copy of it. 
This is where it gets reallllllly good. Almost makes me want to jump up and down again while telling this story. You see....the land survey showed that the gravel drive way and the little patch of land connecting it to my friends house was THEIRS. The crazy neighbor was actually trespassing by having his rented bull dozer on their property. What makes it even better is that he had used this bull dozer to destroy their property by moving the huge mounds of dirt all over. So, I told my friends and they called the police (there was no reasoning with this man).  The police officer was just wonderful. He explained to the neighbor that he was trespassing and that he had to remove the bulldozer immediately and that he was lucky because his neighbors had declined to press charges against him for destruction of their property on the condition that he repair the driveway to its original condition so that it could be accessed by the owners. Needless to say, the neighbor hasn't caused anymore problems for my friends and avoids them at all costs.

Our hotel is downtown and we own a large lot across the street. For a while, we have had an asshole in a Ferrari that constantly parks in our lot illegally. I have left numerous notes on his windshield to stop parking there to no avail. I could have towed his car, but I wanted to confront him. 

When I wasn't too busy, he once again parked in the lot. I took my car and blocked him; I also left a note on his windshield to ""see valet at Hotel __________"". I also started the stopwatch on my watch. 1.5 hours passed and I was running to grab a car when I noticed him standing next to his car on the phone. He said to me, ""move this car I have to get out."" I replied, ""I'll move it when I have a chance"". His response was, ""I wouldn't talk to me that way, I'm a cop."" 

I hopped into the car I was bringing to a guest and slowly meandered back to the Ferrari owner after I was done. My immediate response was, ""you're a cop? I'd like your badge number and I'd like to know where you are a police officer."" He immediately denied that he ever said he was a cop, just that he had a lot of cop friends. I kindly informed him that cop or not, you simply can not park illegally and I had given him numerous warnings. I let him know that I was busy, ran back to the hotel, did a lot of nothing for ten minutes and headed back to him. He mentioned how I ""inconvenienced him"" and I retorted back, ""I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but you don't think you're inconveniencing me when I have a full lot and you illegally take my spot, making my job harder?""

""I didn't know I couldn't park here.""
I pointed right above his car, ""you didn't see the huge sign saying 'no public parking', did you?""
""I was only here for a few minutes.""
""Sir, I started my stopwatch, you were here for over an hour and a half.""
""Why are you giving me such a hard time?""
""Why did you lie to me and say you were a police officer?""
After about 30 minutes of my leaving mid conversation to check up on ""work"", he finally apologized and I moved my car out of the way.

A week later, I was pulling a different car out of the lot and he pulled in and flagged me down saying, ""they told me I can park over to the left."" 

I said, ""who told you that?""
""Your boss.""
""Oh, that's interesting. I am actually in charge of this lot and you can't park here. I will happily tow your car the next time I see you here.""
""Well, where can I park?""
I let him know the few spots that didn't belong to the hotel but let him know that chances are he will get towed. He drove off and I haven't seen him since. 

Edit: Punctuation

Edit 2: I removed the picture. 

Edit 3: A lot of you guys have been saying that it is more pleasurable to see their face when the car is towed. I would have loved to see that but it was in a remote lot; chances are 50/50 of me being there when a tow goes down. This guaranteed that he had to see me. A few weeks ago, though I put a tag on a ladies car saying not to park in our spot and she would be towed the next time. The next day it was back, so I put another tag on her car (I like to give people the benefit of doubt). She moved her car from one spot of ours to another. I then called the tow company; when the huge tow man had showed up and put the racks around the tires (before lifting it) the lady ran out saying she would move the car. The tow guy looked at me, looked at her and said, ""that will be 80 dollars, it is what my company charges for me to come out."" The woman then said ""I don't have $80."" The tow guy looked at me, looked at her, looked back at me, smiled, hit the hydraulic button and said, ""then that will be 300 dollars, see you at the impound lot."" That was gold...

I'm fortunate enough to have a driveway. It is my driveway and it's not a common driveway. Next door a bunch of college students are renting it, and they think they can park in my driveway. 

The first 2 or 3 weekends we are forgiving, tell them to move their car, and remind them that they cannot park here.

One weekend I came down separately. My parents were already down there and took a street spot. (It gets annoying to shuffle 3-4 cars around). I saw the neighbors car in our driveway again, but I had a plan this time. I parked behind them and said nothing. I usually don't need to drive anywhere as I bike most places. About an hour and a half later we hear a knock on the door. I answer it, and guess who it is, the neighbor. He wants to move his car and he is sorry that he parked there. I get in my car and flip the kill switch. I park in a bad neighborhood so I have a kill switch that will cut power to my fuel pump, basically my car will crank but won't start since no fuel is getting to the engine. After 30 seconds of trying to start a car that won't start, I tell him my car's computer needs to reset (BS story) and that takes half an hour. My family and I went out to dinner.

We come back and he was seething. He gave us a death stare for trapping his car on our property. He runs up to us and demands that I move my car. I told him that I'll move it after I go to the bathroom (this wasn't a joke I really had to take a shit). It completely slipped my mind. About half an hour later we get a knock on the door. Its the police, hilarity will ensue. The cop said that I need to move *my* car out of *my neighbor's* driveway. I asked him to repeat himself. My neighbor told the cop that *I* parked in *HIS* driveway. I asked the officer to look at where the property line is as I assured him that it was my driveway. I went on telling the officer that this is not the first time he has parked here and we have asked him to stop. I moved my car so he could pull out. It was totally worth it seeing the cop write up a trespassing ticket for my neighbor. Have fun with that fine buddy.


**Incident 2**

Fast forward 3 weeks. We see a different car parked in our driveway. We recognize it as one of theirs. The windows were rolled down a bit, and the car was manual. 

In the past I have called tow companies to tow cars off our property but they never come. However the cops will tow a car if it is obstructing traffic. This leads to my idea.

I reach inside the open window and unlock the door. I then hop in the car and disengage the E-Brake. My driveway is sloped gently down to the street. I ride the brake, and I was going to turn the wheel, but the wheel locked. I figured eh this is close enough. I re-engage the e brake, lock the doors and get out. I called the police and tell them that an illegally parked car is blocking the street. They come and in quick order tow them away. 

I was a bit short sighted on this call, I forgot that even though that the car is gone, the people that own that car are not gone. They knock on our door, and my dad answers it. He said some BS like ""Oh we just got down here about 15 minutes ago (car was towed like 2 hours ago) and I was glad to see you didn't park here. I would call the police and report your car stolen."" We never heard from him again that day.

They have not parked in our driveway for a good month now.

In 2009 I was travelling up to New York. I flew in and was waiting for a shuttle to take me to Columbia. I put a bag in the shuttle, and realized I had left a bag inside the airport. I went to get the bag, came back, and the shuttle had departed, with my bag inside which had my computer in it.

I ended up tracking my bag to the companies office, and took a taxi to get there, albeit two days later. I got to the office, opened my bag up, and my Macbook computer was gone. As you can imagine, I was very upset, but I kept my cool as I pretty much felt I was SOL. 

Now this is where the story gets interesting....

After travelling home a day later, I get an email from Apple thanking me for contacting them about my computer. Knowing I had done no such thing, I contacted them to explain to them what had happened. They immediately agreed to help me, and told me to locate my serial number from my receipt. This is why it is always important to keep receipts, everyone! I gave them the number, and they were able to track the computer back to New York, and even had the name of the individual who had the computer. 

With this information, I contacted the shuttle company. After many phone calls with higher ups of getting nowhere, and them basically telling me I was SOL, I gave them the name of the individual. Their demeanor immediately changed, and it turns out it was one of their employees who had my computer. They agreed to refund my money, as long as I would not release personal information such as names, the company name, etc. 

With the information I had, I decided to become a vigilante. I contacted the individual, posing as an Apple Genius, telling him we could upgrade his computer under a promotion for no cost, all he had to do was bring it in. 

He brought the computer in, and was arrested on the spot.

I was next in line at a pump and had been there for about 10 minutes. When the car in front of me pulled out and I started rolling forward this dude in an audi whipped in front of me and took that spot. 

The guy jumps out and starts trying to pumping gas, but apparently it turns out that spot was ""cash only"" because the credit card portion of it was broken or something.

At this point I've gotten over the fact that he took my spot and was minding my own business trying to back into position for a pump on the other side. Just as I was turning my head to back into the spot, this audi whips around and steals THAT spot from me, so now he's two for two in being a dick and I'm staring daggers at him.

He jumps out, swipes his credit card, grabs the gas pump and proceeds to try to pull it around his car to the gas tank which was **on the other side**. Looking flustered, he tugged and tugged trying to get it to reach, but it just wouldn't.

So there he stands, in a gas station having cut me off twice and unable to even pump his own gas. I think it all became too overwhelming, as he then jumps in his car and drives away.

I finally back up into the spot I was waiting for, pissed and running late, when I go to swipe my card and pump my own gas, grab my receipt and go on my merry way.

It was only when I looked at the receipt later I realized that guy had never cancelled his credit card, so the machine didn't even read mine.

Today while going through/getting to a McDonalds Drive thru, I was going at what I felt was a reasonable and safe parking lot appropriate speed. I had another vehicle (a pickup truck) happily following me through the parking lot to the ordering boxes as well. 

As I reach getting to the entrance of the ordering boxes, a woman in her car comes veering in and cuts me off just before the entrance of the ordering boxes. I nearly shit myself because I had to brake pretty hard to avoid a collision, and I know the truck behind me was pissed because they were laying on their horn pretty good (this woman essentially just cut in line on both of us).

I kind of roll my eyes because if someone is in that much of a rush to get some greasy cheeseburgers in them, I will let me be. I just pull up to the second ordering box (I don't know how common this is, but McDonalds in my area just started making their drive through have two sets of ordering boxes so I guess they can help two drive through customers at a time?).

As soon as I get to the ordering box, the McDonalds employee takes my order, and happily tells me my total. At this point I hear some screaming and yelling coming from the other ordering box from the woman who just cut me off, ""TAKE MY DAMN ORDER! I WAS HERE FIRST!"".

I laugh inside kind of thinking that the McDonalds employees probably saw two cars show up suddenly and just decided to take my order first. I figure it was karma shining down on me.

I pull up to the pay window and right away I can tell the person collecting money is the one taking orders. Usually at these double drive thrus, the McDonalds employee needs to confirm that I am paying for the correct order (As there is usually two people taking orders at the same time). Today this employee doesn't she just reconfirms the cost and tells me to pull to the next window.

As I pull away from the pay window I hear car horns, and a moment later I see the truck (not the douchey woman in the car) that was behind me before is pulling up to the pay window.

As I get my food, my gut feeling is validated; seems like they keep the drive through windows open when its nice out, so I can hear the employees talking amongst themselves. 

Employee 1: ""Do you think we should take another vehicles order before that car?"" 

Employee 2: ""I don't know, they're honking quite a bit now"" 

Employee 1: ""Well they shouldn't have cut that other car off"" (I drive a car)

So there’s this guy who lives near my neighborhood, who is an evil driver. I’m talking, the kind of guy who will pull into an empty right turn lane, to cut of the people in the left lane (turns left in front of them, from the wrong lane). He is always curb checking around corners and veering around other cars, even going up onto sidewalks. His car is very distinctive, so it is pretty obvious when it is him. 

He is especially bad in our Wally World parking lot near my house. He will whip around other cars, park in handicap spots with no handicap tag, and *flings* his doors open into cars parked next to him. As a permanent pedestrian, I HATE this guy with a burning passion. I was hunkering for some kind of petty revenge. 

**The set up**

So one day he comes flying past me in the parking lot. Nearly knocks me down, then honks at me and shouts “Keep out the way cripple!” Whips himself into the oncoming-lane to park crooked in the handicap spot. Flings his door open like usual and huffs his way on up to the door, shouting on his cell phone the entire way. 

I wander up to his car, and notice that he has [this]( http://imgur.com/BfvSjT7) kind of door handle. The kind that flips away from the car to open.

And I have superglue in my bag.

**The revenge**

So, very casually, I pull up on the handle, and put a gob of superglue under every handle on this jerk’s car. Push down on it a bit to make sure it sets. I want a rest anyways, so I sit on the bench right out front – about 20 metres from where his car is (parked with driver side towards me, some good fortune). 

Ten minutes later he hasn’t come out yet, so I wander on over, check the handles. No motion in them at all. Perfect.

Sit and wait, and about five minutes after that he comes out still on his celly. He’s got a fast food bag and a big drink on one hand, other has his cell phone. He goes over to his door, yanks on the handle hard as he can as is his custom…

And nearly falls backwards as the door doesn’t open. For some reason, (I guess his hand slipped?) his drink and food goes *flying*. He curses, yanks on the handle again – no give. I am laughing so hard I nearly died.

He checks his other handles – no go. He is screaming curses, and at this point I go on inside, to let the customer service desk know some guy with no handicap tags is parked in the handicap space. 

Cue laughter the whole walk home.

Revenge ensues.,2140,608,311,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1iqtxo/my_police_officer_aunt_gets_her_food_tampered/,"I was reminded of this story that my aunt had told me while commenting in a thread on another post. It got buried amongst the other comments so I thought I'd tell her story here as it's own post. Sorry if you have already read this story before in that comment thread. 


My aunt is a retired police officer. A few years ago, before she had retired, she went through a McDonald's drive through in her police cruiser. She got a really weird feeling when the McDonald's employee handed her order to her. He had this smirk on his face and was acting overly nice in a really fake way (that's how she described it me). Her 6th sense was going off like crazy, so she took her food and pulled into a spot in the parking lot to examine her burger. Sure enough, there was a pretty obvious, phlegmy loogie right in the middle of her burger. Since food tampering is a pretty serious offense, she went inside the restaurant to confront the drive through employee. He denied over and over again and then had the nerve to tell my aunt that she had no proof he had done anything to her burger. His smugness sent her over the edge, so she left the McDonald's with the burger in her hand as the evidence that the drive through moron claimed she didn't have. A little later two other police officers arrived at the McDonald's to question the douche bag. They told him that the burger was all the evidence they needed, and if they needed to, they could easily get DNA sample from it. I'm not sure whether they would have actually used the resources to run a DNA test, but they didn't need to in the end because the kid broke down like a sputtering idiot and confessed to spitting in the burger. I believe that he got charged with felony food tampering.

Don't get laid.,2123,601,224,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1k5vhu/dont_tip_me_dont_get_laid/,"So I work as a bartender at a smaller bar in downtown Minneapolis. It is considered standard for the servers to tip me out at the end of their shift, based on a percentage of their tips, in order to compensate me for the time I spend making drinks for their customers.  Most of the servers are good for giving me 10% of their tips when they are having their free shift drink (allowed 1 rail drink or domestic tap per shift), but there is this guy who never tips back (it's not technically required). This same guy, let's call him ""B"" also feels entitled to all the free booze he wants, actually, a lot of people do, and some of the bartenders will actually give them free booze all night!  I don't usually, but sometimes I do give them an extra drink or two if they had a slow shift.


So fast forward to last night, I made somewhere between 75 and 100 drinks for this server, while having a slower night at the bar (it was nice and people wanted to sit at the patio) and I knew me must have made at least $200 based on the food/drinks he was selling. His shift was nearing an end, and a cute girl he was trying to impress came in to wait for him to get off. He comes behind the bar (a big no-no) and tells her that her drinks are on him, then tells me that she can have his shift drinks, turns back to her and suggests she order an expensive microbrew, and she does.  
Here is where the revenge part starts, i know he isnt going to tip me out for the drinks i made for him during his shift and it seems He is expecting me to just GIVE her beers. So I start a tab under his name for the craft beers. She has several more, and he gets off and asks for a rail whiskey with ginger ale, ( which he would only order as a shift drink, otherwise he would drink top shelf) and another. While I did give him his deserved shift drink, they eventually rang up a $50 tab, and when I reminded him to take care of the tab before they left, and presented him with the bill, he gave me a look like ""WTF man"". They studied the bill, and I explained the shift drink rules. He continues to argue that he should get at least 2 shift drinks and I remind him that he only ordered 1 drink that could have qualified (the rail whiskey) and reminded him of the rules. While he did pay his tab, it was grudgingly and he left no tip. She ended up paying for all her own drinks (and left a great tip) and left without him.  I saw him trying to pick up sleazy girls for the rest of the night, with no success, he was too drunk by then!

[Long]",1761,250,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/148etz/not_petty_but_industrial_strength_revenge_do_not/,"Okay, a little while back I was an HVAC technician working for a company here in the limp wang of the country, Florida. 

While schlepping myself around repairing, installing, duct taping and in general making shit happen in a all together too sweaty living I've met many different kinds of people. Some love it when you show up because they're sweaty and miserable and they know you'll make them as frosty as an ice queen by the time you blow out of there; and others just fucking hate you because you happen to be the avatar of their cheapness come to visit them in their hour of defeat.

Now when installing an AC system, legally, you need to have it inspected by the County or City Building Dept. Usually these inspections are cursory at best and a real bear if you've drawn a pissed off inspector. Or if not pissed off, someone looking for a bribe(this is Florida, bribery is a part of life).

This day I drew a man looking for a bigger than normal bribe. Typically, it's $50. This guy wanted $150. Shit, my take-home on the job was only $200 and I wasn't about to split that with an over-zealous asshole with a clipboard. 

I refused to pay and he struck my inspection card with the big red pen. This meant that he found everything incorrectly installed, even if he didn't look. The miserable fuck. This meant I had to reapply for another inspection at $100(the first one's free). So this asshole had cost me time AND money. This meant vengeance! 

So I waited a couple weeks and followed him home from a busy day of gouging blue collar guys plying their trade skills. I still hadn't formulated what I wanted to do to him, but it was going to be fucking rude. Thankfully, he lived alone on a busy street but not many other houses and some long lines of sight. 

Perfect. 

So I watched and waited, hearing stories from other guys about him. The numbers never changed really, except they got more expensive the bigger the job. That fuck. 

When he left for work one morning and I didn't have anything to do, I slipped on my coveralls with the City Public Works Dept logo slapped on the back and did the measuring on his windows and doors. Wood framed house, no siding that stuck out too far, good strong timbers. Perfect. Took note of where his water meter was and checked what type of electrical meter system he had. All easily accessible. 

I worked a few construction sites over the next few weeks and collected some sheets of leftover plywood. Not the lightweight stuff, but heavy fire rated sheathing. The sheets I cut to size from the measurements I took earlier on. I stowed these pieces one by one and collected a few other things. 

Finally, the day of reckoning had come. I'd had another run-in with that greedy fuck, and again, I refused to pay the exorbitant bribe rates. That was the last fucking straw. I waited until the next week which was a government holiday, 4 day weekend, that sort of thing. Either way, the very places he'd need to call would be closed to deal with the shitstorm that was coming. 

He trundled off to work that morning while I was watching from down the road in a rented white pickup truck filled with precut wood and my framing tools. Again I was in my faux city coveralls and hard hat. I backed the truck right up and started setting the wood panels around the house corresponding to their measurements. Once those were set up, I started whacking them in with the framer as fast as I could with plenty of extra nails. Windows and doors, front and back. Boarded up as tight as you could please. 

Then I moved on to the electrical meter can and pulled that free, padlocking the panel shut. Then it was off to the water meter which I shut down and detached. That was padlocked shut too. The meters went into a cardboard box and into the truck. 

For the coup de grace, I slapped up ""Building Condemned by Court Order"" and ""Caution: Hazardous Materials Within"" sticker signs on the plywood window covers and a faked but real court order on the front door declaring the house unsafe because of methamphetamine production. (You come across this kind of stuff in the course of your days doing construction, and if you find extras, why not grab em?)

I then cleaned up my work, made sure everything looked kosher and hauled ass for a Publix sub. I needed to be back there to watch the festivities. 

After getting lunch and ditching the extra tools back at the house, I chilled out and sat in a parking lot down the road with a pair of binoculars and a good book. I didn't wait long as my target came home early and was completely floored at seeing his house boarded up with those horrid green and orange stickers all over the place. 

I watched him call the cops and when they showed up, there was much pointing at the signs and eventually they left without pulling the wood off. The court order looked way too real and the Clerks office was already gone for the weekend so there wasn't anyone to confirm it was a fake. This was part of the plan. 

I watched him try to pull the wood off and since I used way too many nails he just couldn't do it. I smiled so hard I thought my face would crack. It was beautiful watching that man have a breakdown in his front yard, enjoying the schadenfreude from a half mile away. Poetry. 

I drove away after watching for as long as I dared and spent the weekend enjoying life and doing service calls. I still smile when I think of that day. The inspector was fired a couple years later by the city when people started really bitching about the bribery accusations.

My sister has been more than obsessed with those kids and, well teenagers will be teenagers.

Months go my sister learned about a One Direction concert in our home country (Belgium). As a good brother I decided to get her a ticket (because I could).

As the months passed on she started to realize a bit of a problem. The concert would be done at midnight, in the other side of the country (this is Belgium, so it isn't that far). Neither my father nor I could pick her up from the concert, so after looking for parents who were driving their kids as well (she told me none of her other friends were going, note that all tickets were also sold out), and trying to fix my schedule so I could pick her up, I ended up finding the ideal solution.

A busservice was riding, specifically for the concert, from my town to Antwerp where the concer was taking place, and back. It seemed perfect and she agreed with me, so I paid another 20 bucks for the bus fare and arrenged her a seat in that bus.

That was 2 weeks ago. Three days ago she suddenly tells me she won't take the bus afterall (the bus was already paid and there was no refund possible). She had discovered the bus would arrive an hour before the concert, which according to her was not early enough. The concert starts at 7PM, but she wants to be in that city at 10AM. Her plan is to go to the boy's hotel and attempt to get autographs.

I told her it was unlikely she'll get autographs, which made her freak out. She started throwing stuff, screaming at me, calling me the worst words and telling her how I was taking everything away from her.

I pointed out that without me there wouldn't be a concert for her, and for all intends and purposes that ticket is mine and I can just sell if I wanted to. 

This made her go berserk and she shouted that I should start treating her more like an adult, and stop trying to arrenge everything for her.

I just told her I wasn't comfortable with her taking the train from and to that city on her own, especially if I already paid for the busfare (on her request).

She then told me she had arrenged for going with the train with her friends for the past few months, which is a blatant lie as she stated she didn't have friends that were going to the concert only a few weeks back. 

Now comes the revenge bit, note it is very petty and I could probably do more to have my revenge, but I'm too much of a softy for that.

My sister is notorious for never setting an alarmclock. She depends on me or our father to wake her up in time for school and other things. If we don't do that, she'll easily spend the entire day sleeping.

She was taking the 7AM train, but it is currently noon and she's still sleeping. I won't wake her up, even if it means she misses the concert. She has until 5PM to wake up (which should be reasonable, I think) so she can take the bus like I arrenged for her. If she gets angry for not waking her up, I'll tell her she asked me to treat her like an adult. 

UPDATE:

At 2:15 PM she woke up. She was of course grumpy and started demanding why I did not wake her up earlier. I reminded her that she wanted to be treated as an adult, and told her that if she had waken up in time, she could have left without a problem.

The message came across, though there was some shouting involved. She has locked herself up in her room now, and I'm going to leave her and her emotions alone now. She did apologize for her behavior, which I think is progress. She'll be able to go to the concert and have a good time later today.

I smiled, looked at him in the  eyes and asked him if he was hitting on me, and if he wanted to go on a date later. He did not like this and decided to spit in my face. 

I was raging now, staring at him, unsure what I should do. So I put my visor down on my helmet, leaned in close and slammed the top of my helmet on his partially open window. It smashed into pieces as I dropped the clutch and sped out of there.

He tried to follow me but got caught in the intersection because he was in a right turn lane trying to go straight.

I found out from a friend that Sarah was cheating on me with one the typical doucher jocks. due to some problems at school, picture day wouldn't be here for another month, keep this in mind as this is important to the story. Anyways, I was thinking of how to get back at Sarah for cheating on me, Sarah liked to wear a lot of make-up and was very sensitive. I didn't tell Sarah that I knew about her cheating on me. Come picture day, I tell her that I'm breaking up with her. She starts to cry and her make-up runs down all over her face (mascara, all that stuff), she didn't  have time to clean up, so her picture looked like crap. The next day I tell her that I'm sorry and that I shouldn't have done that, we start dating again. And on retake day,I told her that I found out about her cheating on me and said we're through, and she just exploded, ruining her  ID yet again. From what I've heard she hasn't cheated on anyone for awhile.

TL;DR: make-up Girlfriend in Highschool was cheating on me, dumped her on picture day, ruining her ID, took her back, then dumped her again on retake day.

It was a ~14 hour coach journey, so tension on the coach was at an all time high and morale was at an all time low. I was on the top deck near the back, and at the very back of the coach were two young (18ish) girls being loud, screaming, swearing, and generally pissing off people trying to sleep or otherwise enjoy their journey. For anyone from the UK, you'll understand what I mean when I say these girls were chavs. For everyone else, I direct you to [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav).

About half way through the journey, they found a button at the back of the bus which turns on and off the overhead lights. Why this button exists is a mystery for me but it does, and they were abusing it. About 2 minutes into the abuse a somewhat old black lady asks them to settle down because she's trying to sleep, however she was only met with abuse, yelling and racist comments about ""this is my country you can't tell me what to do blackey"".

Eventually the driver had to stop and move the girls downstairs, and the rukkus stopped for the rest of the journey. When we got to the coach station and everyone unloaded to get their bags, it all started again with the girls throwing abuse at the old lady and her family. Eventually the officials from the coach company step in and take them to the side after they've unloaded their bags and dumped them beside the coach. I'm still waiting to get my bag, and when I do I'm right beside their two suitcases on wheels as I reach into the coach luggage bay. Revenge mode kicks in, and I quickly throw their bags back onto the coach and pull mine off. I walk away briskly towards the exit, hoping to hang around and watch the chaos unfold.

The coach shut its luggage bay doors and moved on. The coach was due to go back up to Glasgow, along with the girls bags.

my younger sister used to date a real douchebag. he started out as an ok dude, I had no problems with him, seemed like a nice enough guy. but as time went on he became really aggressive, mean, controlling and jealous.

Some examples:

* he and my sister had a little drunken spat at a party; he pushed her and told her ""Watch yourself because I could fuck any girl here.""

* he borrowed her car without permission, dented the front bumper and didn't tell her or pay for it.

* he would obsessively check her phone and internet history to make sure she wasn't talking to other guys. 

* he would get pissy and upset if she left the house wearing anything that showed her cleavage, or shame her into changing. my sister is well-endowed, unless it's a t-shirt or it closes at the neck there's going to be cleavage (big boob problems). 

* during the very last legs of their relationship, he started telling her he'd ""found her account"" and ""knew she was posting nudes."" They were nude pictures (face removed) of a girl that was not my sister. I think he *actually* believed they were her. he was losing his grasp on reality.

* after the breakup, he went CRAZY. started calling her at work (they work at the same place) repeatedly, had a meltdown on the phone. came in to work, she wasn't there, meltdown. started texting her, calling her a slut and a whore and a bitch and then turning around and telling her ""I love you babe, come home, the cat misses his mommy."" one time she came home from a casual date a few weeks after the breakup, and as soon as she was dropped off she got a text saying ""moving on already huh?"" fucking creep.

one time he hit her up for sex post-breakup (""you know what, I don't even care about this relationship, I don't want you back, I just want to fuck"") and when my sister went over to their shared apartment (I scolded her for that) he ended up just crying for two hours. 

I could go on, but I won't, because it's making me angry.

anyway! after they broke up, there was a long period where I didn't see him and that was awesome. my sister was pretty miserable, as he was her first love, and she was in denial about a lot of the horrible treatment she got. as much as I told her that she deserved better, that she shouldn't be treated like that by anyone, let alone someone who claims to love her, they were together for almost three years. but eventually she started conceding that, yeah, it was a toxic relationship.

**the revenge**

come first day of my winter quarter, I found out ex-shithead and I had both signed up for the same class.

for god knows what reason, he saw me and decided to sit near me. he said ""hey revengethrowawayman, it's been awhile, no hard feelings about [sister] right?"" I kinda shrugged and he said ""yeah, no, **she was kinda a crazy bitch anyways, no offense**."" really??? I had a strong urge to laugh and/or deck him in the face and/or some combination thereof but I just smiled quickly and turned back to the front. I hate him so much.

our professor collected weekly assignments on thursdays; a few essay questions, a few pages typed. we didn't have tests in-class, most were take-home and replaced the regular assignment due on Thursdays. as soon as you came to class and our professor arrived, we were supposed to go put our assignment on the podium at the front.

I got up the first thursday to turn in my assignment and ex-douchebag holds out his paper to me, eyebrows raised. I was about to laugh pityingly or tell him to fuck off and take it up himself but then... I smiled and took it. I walked down to the front of the class and when I was sure he wasn't looking (buried in his phone) I stuck his assignment in my pocket and put mine and mine only on the podium. 

our teacher told us the first day she wouldn't give us our annotated work back until the end of the quarter but she would have a spreadsheet online for us to check the grades for our assignments. I worried briefly he'd notice he got a 0 for the first assignment, but... come next thursday he hands out his assignment to me again. and again. and again.

and each and every time, it went in my pocket and then into the recycling bin (save the planet guys). on the days he had it that was, lazy fuck. I turned in a few of the lower-point assignments so as not to arouse suspicion, but the take home tests found a comfy home in the big blue plastic bin outside the building.

I saw him on the day of the final arguing with my teacher, but I whizzed through the test and hauled ass out. I don't think it's possible for him to have passed the class. have fun retaking intro to psych, asshat.

**tldr: sister's abusive ex boyfriend puts his fate in my hands. bad move.**

edit: since some are asking about whether or not he found out/confronted me, yes and yes. he obviously put two and two together (for which I am proud of him) after the teacher probably asked why he'd turned in so little. he sent me some VERY ugly, expletive-filled text messages and threats. he called a bunch too, but I ignored them. he also texted my sister similar things.

On this case, we had an heir who was probably the dumbest person I've ever spoken to - we will call him Bubba.  Now Bubba was the bottom of the totem pole in this huge chain of people getting money.  The estate was complicated and had crazy people (literally mentally ill) coming out of the woodwork.  I'm pretty sure there must have been a considerable amount of incest in this family to produce so many crazy idiots.

Bubba feels like the best course of action to get his money is to start calling me every day and, if I don't answer, he hangs up and calls right back, over and over again.  When I do answer, I have to repeat the same thing I said the day before to him and to his wife (who is usually screaming obscenities in the background) and, on occasion, to his dad.

Fast forward a few months.  We have completed the estate, recovered the asset and mailed out checks to all the heirs.  Here's where my revenge starts.  The day I put the checks in the mail, I start calling Bubba about 3 times a day to inform him that we have mailed the check and to ask him if he has received his check.  When he stops answering, I start calling back over and over until he answers.

After about a week of this, he's getting pretty testy on the phone.  I am overly polite and professional through it all.  The day he gets his check, he answers his phone and yells at me that he got the check.  I just say ""Good.  Don't call me ever again and I won't call you ever again."" And I hang up.

When I was a teen, my sister was home from college. My sister has very mild acne, maybe one pimple a week.

 I kept my topical medication in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. I noticed my topical medication was rapidly depleting since my sister came home. I decided to hide my medication in my room. A day later, my sister asked where it was, I told her I hid it as it was not her medication to use. She made a big deal saying ""oh mom pays for it and you don't so I can use it"" I went to my mom and she said ""oh, just let your sister use it"" probably to keep peace in the house.

I was annoyed as it was almost over and my refill wouldn't be due until next week and I know my skin breaks out when I don't use it. I ended up having a dermatologist appointment that week and he put me on a stronger medication, a retinol based med. He warned me it may cause redness and to avoid this, mix with lotion and use very little for at least a week. 

We picked up the prescription and put it in the bathroom. I did what the derm suggested by using a ""dime size amount"" and mixed with lotion. I didn't tell my sister this warning. 

By the second day my sister woke up with a very red face and skin peeling. She was very upset as she planned on going to the beach that day. My skin was fine as I had the warning. I told her that is why you dont use other people's meds. She stopped using my meds after this. My skin never looked better.

So it was not only standing-room-only, but also had everyone's shopping bags and other crap piled up all around. It was miserable, and about 100 degrees to boot.

We were standing in the aisle, and seated next to us was a woman with her son, who was about 6 years old. His mother kept yelling loudly at him about EVERYTHING, and he kept yelling back and jumping up and down on his seat, which of course made him fall over onto people constantly as the bus moved. He was being a total living terror. And to make matters worse, he kept pressing the button for ""next stop"", even though pretty much everyone on the bus was going to the end of the line (the subway station). So every time he pushed it, the bus would have to stop at the next bus stop for no reason, making this otherwise miserable trip even longer and more herky-jerky as the driver had to pull in to an empty bus stop, open the doors, and then deal with traffic (we are in NYC). The mother saw him doing it, and gave him a huge spank on the ass, and told him if he did it one more time he was going to get a whipping he would never forget.

Miss your meeting.,1811,394,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hfbe9/steal_my_parking_space_and_ignore_me_miss_your/,"The office park that my office is situated in has pretty limited parking. Each office suite has a handful of spaces and they're clearly labelled. Typically, each office suite has a couple of spaces right outside the door, and then another few spaces in the middle of the car park. If you use all of your parking spaces, you have to park half a mile away on the main road and walk back (so it pays to get in early enough to grab a space). There's enough space behind the spaces in front of the offices to park a car without blocking the car park, if you park sideways behind two cars (i.e. blocking two cars in, but not stopping other cars driving around), which is what the postman, delivery drivers etc. do. Some offices use this knowledge to provide an extra parking space, as you're just blocking in your coworker's cars and they can easily get you to move if they need to get out. My office is in the corner of the office park. We have a space next to the wall and the space next to that. The next couple of spaces are (obviously) allocated to the office next door. I usually get in early enough to grab the space next to the wall. 

Now, the office next door is the regional HQ for a small company and they often have people from other offices visiting. As they're not familiar with the parking arrangements, it isn't unusual for us to find that one of their visitors has taken one of our spaces. In that case, we'd just knock on their office door and ask the owner of the car to come out and move it. It happened so often that the landlord put a sign on the door of their office to remind visitors that they have to park in assigned parking spaces (if we're having visitors, we make sure we leave a space for them as there are only a couple of visitors' parking spaces for the whole office park and they're always taken).

So, one day I get in early and park in the corner space, next to the wall. Lunchtime rolls around and I have to run some errands so I pick up some lunch while I'm out with the intention of eating it in the office. I got back to work to find that someone from the office next door has taken my space while I'm out. I recognised the car straight away - it was one of their salesmen. He's a real arsehole, totally full of himself, thinks the world revolves around him etc. You know the type. It isn't the first time (or even the tenth time) that he's taken one of our spaces, either.

I don't want to have to drive right down the road and walk back, and I can see him standing outside the office next door, smoking and talking to someone. I shout ""excuse me"". He ignores me. I shout ""excuse me"" again. Still nothing. I beep my car horn. That gets his attention. He turns round and I ask him if he can move his car. He says ""in a minute"", points to his cigarette (which by the look of it, he'd only just lit), and turns back to his conversation. I say ""excuse me"" again, and get ignored again. I beep my car horn again. He turns to look at me. I point out that there's assigned parking and I need to get back to work. He shrugs, tells me he'll only be a minute, and turns his back on me again.

Obviously, trying to reason with him isn't working, and I wasn't going to sit around on the car park for another few minutes. He could have moved his car out of my space and parked behind the two spaces allocated to the office that he was visiting, but he'd rather inconvenience me, so I reversed my car right up to the wall, blocking him and one of my coworkers in. I got out of my car and he demanded that I get back in my car and wait as he'd only be another few minutes. I told him that I needed to get back to work and that he could knock on the door when he was ready and I'd come back out and move. TWENTY MINUTES later (glad I wasn't still in my car!), there was a knock on the door. One of my coworkers answered it and came to tell me that I needed to move my car. Now, usually I'd be straight out, but as this person was a repeat offender, had ignored me, turned his back on me when I was asking him to move his car and had talked down to me when I'd parked, I decided to make him wait. I told me coworker to tell him that I was on a call and that I'd be out in a minute. Half an hour later, I went out and moved my car, to find him pacing backwards and forwards and complaining that he'd missed a meeting on the other side of the city. I told him that he should only park where he's allowed to park, as per the sign on the door to the office that he was visiting, that he'd been told several times before, and that he could have moved his car when I'd asked him to earlier. He never parked in our spaces again.

My dad is a policeman and he works with a man, let's call him Bobby, who, by all accounts, is a pretty stand up fella. Hard-working (my dad hates the lazy) and generally a pretty nice guy. Anyway, his downfall came about 5 years ago when he had an affair, having been married for 15 years. I should mention at this point that they have no children. Suffice to say, his wife was not over the moon about it. You hear stories about scorned partners setting fire to their other half's cars or scattering their clothes down the street, but this, as far as angry spouse revenge is something quite special.

Bobby's wife found out about the affair because a friend of hers is married to a colleague of his. News spreads etc. Instead of confronting him about it, she thought long and hard about a way to really ruin his damn day. Bobby had an important work day coming up.....some sort of meeting with his superiors with a potential for promotion but I can't remember the details. 

Bobby's wife carefully took a thread cutter to each item of clothing that he would be wearing that day and unpicked every other damn stitch. No kidding, from his suit down to his underwear. 

You can imagine that the morning hustle and bustle commute was enough to perhaps strain some of the seams at most. But as the day wore on, his clothes started to slowly fall apart. First a hole in the toe of his shoe (she was obviously dedicated to the cause), then his trousers started to fray upwards from the ankles. The real kicker came when, 10 minutes into his very important business meeting, the arm fell off his suit jacket. The meeting was cut short and, for reasons that may or may not be related, I don't believe that he ever received the promotion he was after. Bobby and his wife and now happily divorced.

I was doing a physics project and had to print out an article which was 2 pages with an image or two. So after printing the article with the images I went to pay for my copy. It was double sided so I thought it was 5 cents. I didn't know there was a surcharge on printing things with images which would cost me 50 cents per page instead.

The next day in class he is giving my brother a verbal beat down over something inconsequential.  My brother gets up in front of the whole class, walks over to the file cabinet, grabs the teacher's bottle if whiskey and sets it on his desk and then quietly returns to his seat.

Basically one guy bought/owned the house, me and the other guy paid rent. 

One roommate (the other renter) was an inconsiderate slob who managed to attract an equally inconsiderate girlfriend. She was rude, bitchy, loud, obnoxious, and worst of all, over ALL the time. She stayed overnight at least 3-4 nights per week, most of which fell on weekdays.

Now, the house we lived had one bathroom, which wasn't a big deal since those of us who lived there were all on relatively different schedules. Until she ""moved in"" rent free. At the time, my job was roughly 45 minutes to an hour away from the house. She worked roughly 15 minutes further away than me, but almost the same commute. Which was a less than fun multiple expressway route of mass congestion. Her job is also a 9-5.

So the first time she stayed over... I wake up at my normal time and she is in the bathroom, taking her sweet time, getting ready for work. She got up maybe 5 minutes before me. I knock, politely ask how long she will be, I need to get ready to go to work, etc. I'm eventually allowed access to MY bathroom (it's mine, I pay rent, dammit). I rush and get ready for work. This repeats every morning she's over for weeks, despite explaining to her that I get up at XX time to get ready for work- she's free to use it to get ready, but she'll have to work around my schedule. 

Apparently that doesn't matter. I go so far as to tell the boyfriend (roommate) that his girlfriend needs to get ready at her own place or wake up earlier. No change.

On to the revenge. I start setting my alarm 10 minutes earlier. Just enough time to beat her to the bathroom, but also some precious minutes to grab a few other things--my clothes, a book, breakfast. I do EVERY part of my morning routine behind the locked doors of the bathroom. She'd knock on the door from time to time, and I'd just respond ""almost done!"" I stayed in there until it was absolutely time for me to leave for work. And on my way out of the bathroom, I smiled and waved and told her to ""have a great day!""
I continued on like this until she finally got the hint and started staying weekdays at her own place, or when she did stay over, she was waking up in time to leave to go to her home to get ready--my understanding is that it wasn't that far away, anyway.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1e0j8x,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1e0j8x/nonroommates_from_hell/,

I turn to the mother (who of course was on the phone and hadn't made a single move to reign her kids in) and say to her, ""Excuse me, but your son just hit me with your cart."" She rolled her eyes at me and went back to her conversation.

The kids immediately run over to their mother and start pulling on her arms and yelling, ""Mom! Mom! That lady says we can get free Slurpees today! You have to take us to 7-11!"" The mother gives me a murderous look. I give her a very smug smile, as the kids continue to bug the shit out of her.

**Some background about why I didn't like the management**

I worked at a  chain restaurant for a while, and the management was very demanding and difficult, especially for a minimum wage job. They would understaff and expect us to just work twice as hard for the same pay. They would not listen to my scheduling demands/requests and this led to me working 5-close after high school (which sucked), scheduling me Fri-Sat-Sun when I would ask for at least one weekend day off (esp. during mon-fri high school), being difficult about taking off days two weeks in advance, and acting like it was ruining their day to have to find someone to work my normal shift.

And GOD FORBID anybody ever called off. I found myself calling off and getting coaxed to come in, partly because I was a young pushover and partly because they would be like ""There is literally nobody to cover you, we really need you to be here. This is really going to ruin my night."" It's understandable if someone calls off often, but I would call off like once every three months or so, and often picked up other peoples shifts when they called me in.

**The Revenge** 

So on a Friday night I was way too sick to work, especially around food. I planned on taking the night off, resting and going into work the next day when I felt better. I called in and they did their whole ""No, you shouldn't stay home"" routine. 

After demanding to stay home my manager said ""Fine, we're going to need a doctor's note."" WTF? Are you kidding me? I'm not in need of a doctor, I'm in need of bed rest. Plus, it costs money to go to the doctor, for this shitty part time job? Please. 

I went to the doctor and made sure to tell him that I was scheduled for saturday and sunday as well, and felt too sick to handle peoples food. He gave me a note saying he didn't want me to work until the following monday. 

I called back that night and had my dad drop off the notice. 

""I'm sorry now you're going to have to find someone to cover me all weekend. That doctors notice sure was a good idea, I was much more sick than I thought! :) My dad will drop the note off in a minute!""

Then I began to listen for him to come up behind me. 

One day, out of the corner of my eye, I saw him sneak up behind me. Just as he was ready to give me a shove I turned around and peed all over him.

I work 45 minutes from my home and my gym is only 5 minutes away from my work. I was having a great gym session and it gets to be about 7:15 AM, so time for me to hit the showers and get ready for work. The problem is that the gym only has one unisex shower. When I go to the shower it's locked. I knock and a girl's voice snobby replies back ""occupied."" I have worked out for months here and this has never occurred before so I figured I would just wait it out. 

So I waited for 40 minutes for this girl to finally leave. By now it was 7:55 and I had 5 minutes to shower and get to work, which I wasn't too worried about since I have a flexible schedule and didn't have any meetings until 9.  Out comes a young, tan, attractive, in-shape girl who scoffs when she sees me waiting patiently and gave me a half hearted apology and said that she worked at 8 and didn't want to smell like her tanning lotion. I replied with a sheepish ""yea... its fine."" I walk into the shower room and see she left her phone. I smile and lock the door behind me and not even a minute later I hear her knock but I just get into the shower with a huge smile on my face. I left the shower room 15 minutes later ready for work with an evil glare from the girl who was now also late for work.

**TL:DR I was made late to work waiting for the shower to open up, so I capitalized when the girl inside forgot her cell phone.**

**Update:** My gym has two unisex bathrooms and one separate unisex shower that has no toilet in the shower room. The shower room is located over by the two tanning beds.The girl had a pink iphone. She normally doesn't shower or really lift she just comes in to tan and then talks with people she knows. I am not from the area and did get some weird looks from other people at the gym when she came in today. She and I didn't make eye contact but there was clear tension.

1373293242.0,1301,self.pettyrevenge,1hv4wt,We just want to give you the best possible service. (x-post from /r/TalesFromRetail),1637,336,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hv4wt/we_just_want_to_give_you_the_best_possible/,"So, I thought I'd share another tale from my time working at a pool store several years ago! Be forewarned, this is a serious wall of text coming.

As anyone who has worked in retail knows, you will always have at least a few quirky ""regulars"" who come in to your store. Sometimes it's a good kind of quirky, like ""She bakes cookies a lot and so brings us some when she comes in."" Sometimes, however, it's a bad kind of quirky. This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirky.

This customer (not his real name, but we'll call him Mr. Rogers, because I always thought he looked like he could be Mr. Rogers' evil twin brother) had a nasty habit of coming in to the store about 5 min. before we close. This would happen every time he came. Now, when doing a water test back then, it would take a couple of minutes. we didn't have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals. We were doing old-fashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything. Normally it didn't take too long, but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night. Not to mention, it can be a messy process, meaning we'd have to clean everything again before we close up.

He would come in, get his water tested, ask a million unnecessary or unanswerable questions (Mr. Rogers: ""Does the Turbo-shock come in a 100 lb. bucket?"" Me: ""No, sorry, it just comes in 25 lb."" Mr. Rogers: ""Why??"" Me: "".....""), and tap impatiently waiting for everything, making me feel like I was defusing a bomb. Most of the time, we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after, but seeing his car pull up at 4:55 was enough to turn an ok day into a full-on panic attack.

So, one day, I was at a high-school soccer game, when who do I happen to see but Mr. Rogers. He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didn't notice that I was there. His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr. High team, and he was there to see her. I debated whether or not to say anything to him, but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was. And then, completely by accident, I overheard him talking to one of his friends.

Mr. Rogers told his friend what he thought was ""the secret to getting good service"" at any place. He claimed that by coming in at the last minute, right before they closed, he was guaranteed swift attention to his needs. Mr. Rogers elaborated that the intense desire to go home was enough of a motivator to ensure this attention to detail. ""After all,"" he said, ""why should they get rewarded if I don't get the best possible service?"" He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows ""for a fact"" that this technique works.

I thought about confronting him right then and there, but I managed to restrain myself. By the time the 90 minutes were up in the match, I had already formulated the basis of a plan....

The next day I went to my manager, the sweet older lady from my last post, and told her about what I had overheard. She was furious. She wanted to refuse him service, shred his file, and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else. But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit, and she agreed.

The next time Mr. Rogers came into the store (of course, at 5 til closing), we made sure to treat him like a king. We gave his water sample every test under the sun. Ph, Alkalinity, Calcium, Free Chlorine, Total Chlorine, Copper, Iron, Phosphates, Total Dissolved Solids, and many, many more. No test was too obscure for Mr. Rogers. When he asked why we were doing so many tests, we told him that we wanted to make sure that everything was perfect. We wanted no stone left unturned! ""But, my water is clear,"" protested Mr. Rogers. ""No, no, we just want it to stay that way! After all, we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight!"" So, we continued to do tests, all the while his foot was tapping, tapping, tapping to the same beat as the clock on the wall. We found tiny fluctuations in chemicals that were normally too small to make a fuss over and blew them up into minor catastrophes that had to be dealt with immediately. We advised him on the best way to mix his chlorine shock to optimize its effectiveness. We discussed the merits and pitfalls of potentially switching to a saltwater system. Then we talked about Baquacil and how he could switch to that as well if he was having issues with the Chlorine (""But I'm not! It looks great!""). We took him on a mini-tour of some of our newer stock, explaining in excruciating detail how it all works.

Finally, when I started talking about the new robotic vacuum cleaners that were starting to come out for residential use, he made it very clear that he had had enough. By now it was well past closing time. We had locked the front door and turned off the front set of lights some time ago. He was trapped, and he knew it. He looked at me and my manager and asked, ""why are you doing this? Why are you taking so long? And why are you talking to me about things I don't care about???"" My manager looked him in the eye, and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice, she said, ""We just want to give you the best possible service.""

It took a second, but then he got it. Someone had let his secret slip. His foot stopped tapping, and the only thing that he could say was ""Oh."" So, we decided the torture was over. We let him go after that. And while he did continue to come to our store (and get excellent service, I might add), he no longer came 5 minutes to closing.

It was one of the only times I've ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career! I will always treasure that moment.

TL;DR: Guy comes in 5 minutes before closing to get better service. So, we gave him the best service of his life as a form of torture.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1hv4wt,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hv4wt/we_just_want_to_give_you_the_best_possible/,

**Backstory**: I went to a private co-educational school for high school, I had to wear a blazer outside of school and always had to look neat as part of the school rules. Our family also had a dog who was female, and so she had a purple lead, as chosen by my sister. Normally before I walk the dog after school I would change into some casual clothes, maybe a hoodie and some shorts, but today I didn't.

**The Incident**: So this particular day I was waiting to cross the road with the dog. I had my full school uniform on and the purple lead in my hand. Then these two douchebags in a white van pull up at the traffic light and roll down their window. I'm looking ahead minding my own business when I hear ""Hey faggot!"", now I didn't think it was directed at me so I didn't acknowledge them. It wasn't until they started whistling at me and calling out ""Hey, you, Blazer boy"" that I turned around. I looked over and one of them was leaning out the window shaking an open fist near his mouth like he was sucking a dick. Now I'm not gay. Nor have I ever been gay so this made no sense. And I had never seen these guys before so they had no reason to do this. As this guy finished doing his blowjob impression with his friend in the driver seat laughing hysterically, he said 5 words which just angered me so much: ""You gay shit, kill yourself"". 

**The revenge:** The crossing light went green at this point and I began walking away from them. They followed slowly alongside me, called me names, and honked their horn whenever I didn't look at them. I continued ignoring them for three blocks before I stopped, looked at them, pulled out my phone and said the number for the police out loud as a dialed it in. The look on their face was priceless as they realised what was happening, they sped off down the street and through a red light. A camera flash went off as they went through. There was one ticket coming their way. I had memorized their number plate and told it to the police, who apparently found them doing 80km/h in a school zone, which in Australia is normally 40km/h and charged them not only for verbal abuse, but also for speeding, that coupled with the red light ticket and previous speeding fines meant that the driver was out of de-merit points and lost his license.

I had moved to a new city that had reached the point where it was running out of phone numbers left in one of it's area codes, but was resisting adding a new one.  So when I got my new land line phone number, I was re-issued the phone number of somebody who had recently canceled their service.   (this was pre-cell phone, and broadband wasn't available in the area yet, so a land line was necessary).

From the day the phone was hooked up, I started getting phone calls for ""Bob"" - the previous owner of the number.  Apparently Bob didn't bother to tell ANYBODY that he had moved, and Bob was a REALLY popular guy.  Friends, family, business calls... you name it.  From early morning until late at night, I was getting calls for Bob.  I would get home from work, and the answer machine (shut up, it was the 90's!) would have a half a dozen messages left for Bob.  For the first couple of months, I would patiently explain to each caller, ""No.. Bob doesn't live here.  No, I don't know Bob.  No, I don't know his new number.  No, I don't know where he moved to. No, I can't get a message to him"".  I would go through this process as much as a dozen times a day on some days.   I figured that eventually I would have talked to every person Bob knew, and the calls would stop.  Unfortunately... they didn't.

I finally had enough.  I changed the message on my answering machine to say ""... and if you are calling for Bob, BOB IS DEAD.  Please stop calling for him!"".  I also started giving that same message every time I answered a call for Bob - ""Bob is dead, I don't know any details, please don't call here again"".

Surprisingly, it only took about 2 weeks before I came home from work to find an answering machine message:  ""This is BOB.  I AM NOT DEAD!!!  Please stop telling people that I am dead!!""  &lt;click&gt;.  I laughed.  I did not change my answering machine message.

Immediately after this, Bob must have finally taken the initiative to start giving his new phone number to people, because over the next week or two the calls for him started tapering off to the point that I only got one call for him every month or so.  I still told those callers that Bob was dead though.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_14p1a0,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/14p1a0/bob_is_dead/,

Sure, I wasn't the most popular kid in my school, but the main reason Dickbag bugged me was because I had gotten him a zero on a group project because he did shit all on it. Anyways, he found out, much to my dismay, that he lived literally around the corner from me, in the same condo complex. 2 days in a row, I came home from school and my house was covered in eggs. Obviously, my mom was pissed, and she didn’t know why anybody would do something like this to us. I did. The next day, I hatched a plan with a good friend of mine, who at the age of 12, was surprisingly muscular. We decided that we ""weren't feeling good"" and called our parents to get permission to go home early, about a half an hour before school ended. We met up at my place (about 5 minute walk from the school) and waited until school was out. Where I lived, in my front little gated area was a little shed. I hid in the shed, and my friend hid just behind the side of the building. After about 20 minutes I hear my latch on my gate open and somebody sneaking into the yard. I peeked out, and sure enough it was Dickbag with a carton of eggs. Before Dickbag realized what had happened I had rushed out of the shed and uppercut him as hard as an 11 year old could. He fell over and sat on the ground dazed for about 3 seconds before my friend charged in and tackled him and pinned him to the ground. The look on his face was priceless. The best part was that we held him there, on his stomach with me sitting on his legs, and my friend sitting on his hands and back until my mom got home, which was about 45 minutes later. My mom, my friend and I dragged him to his house and had him explain what he did to his Dad. I don't think I've ever seen somebody so anger at their child before. He never did seem to bother me after that. Damn, did it feel good knocking that fuck off his feet.

Big package of frozen nuggets, freezer section two aisles over, and she just pulled it out and stuck it on the shelf with the chips.  Being the kind of guy that I am, I was not going to let her get away with this.  I walk over, pick up the nuggets, and drop them back into her cart while she was not looking.  She saw the nuggets a few moments later and you could tell she was thinking that she was sure she had gotten rid of them already.  She shrugs and puts them on a shelf again and walks off. 

Rinse, Lather, Repeat.  

I continue to pick up the package and put it in her cart of items several times.  The first couple of times it was just petty, then it started to get fun and an awesome game.  Not only that, but several people were following watching the fun.  The lady would put it on a shelf, walk away and go an aisle over.  I would run, grab the nuggets and follow as would the rest of the people watching.  She would come back from getting a bottle of water and see the chicken half buried under the cake mix she got the row before.  She would twitch a little, start looking around, and kinda get antsy.  Sometimes she would put it on a shelf right away, sometimes she would carry it a little ways and then put it on a shelf.  

Well, fun has to stop and she almost caught me.  I had slipped the nuggets back into her cart but some items fell over and she heard it.  She didn't catch me doing it, but she did see me standing some five feet away with an evil grin on my face.  She grabbed the bag and starts throwing a huge fit right in the middle of the store.  The kind of fit where a person doesn't say words so much as grunts and incoherent babble.  She then takes the bag of nuggets, raises it over her head, and slams them down on the floor causing a shower of nuggets to fly all over the place.  Including right up on the shoes of the Store Manager and a Police officer.  Seems someone let the store manager know what I was doing to the woman and decided to see for himself, the officer just happened to be coming off duty getting something.  They both tell the lady that she has to pay for her items including the destroyed bag of nuggets and leave the store.  She was pissed, she pointed in my direction and then found that I was not there (I backed away and out as soon as the bag exploded) which caused her to just start foaming at the mouth.  

She paid, she left, she was told never to come back.

I rode the bus to school and home every day, and there were three girls who would constantly annoy and pick on my friend and me. Both of us were always taught to fully respect women, so we just kind of dealt with it and did our best to ignore them. Eventually, they started to throw trash and pencils at us, and one day they brought a bag of Doritos and actually began spitting chewed-up Doritos at us. Every now and then we would lash out at them and throw things back, but it never did any good. Why they did this, I don't know. Neither of us were ugly or weird-looking and we were both pretty well-liked in school. Just a couple of average guys.

This had gone on for almost a year. Nobody ever paid any attention to it, mentioned anything about it to them, not even the bus driver who we literally sat right behind. I never truly confronted them about it because I simply never wanted to talk to them, and after a while it just sort of became background noise. 

One of the girls had nice, blonde hair that she was very proud of, and spent a lot of money taking care of it and getting it styled the way she wanted it etc., judging from what I had heard them talking about behind us. I'll call her Butt. One day, my friend was out sick so I alone was the subject of their tortures. We were on our way to school and she sat behind me once we got to her pickup spot. Butt had placed her hair in a ponytail with a red flower on the side of her head. After greeting her friends, popped up from her seat and spit on my head. Now they had spat at us before, even fired half-chewed Doritos, but they had always missed. This time it was directly dripping onto my head, as if I was in some type of horror movie with the beast clinging to the ceiling and oozing its body fluids down my face.

At this point, I'd had enough. My patience with them had already been worn down needle-thin, and the ooze from her mouth dripping onto my face had broken something in me. I didn't want to simply confront her, I needed something better. It was at that moment that I finally let the hatred flow through me, and I looked all around the immediate area, praying that I would find some kind of object or tool to exact my revenge, not later that day, not the next day, but NOW. And my prayers were answered.

Underneath my seat, there was a full, unopened jar of Vicks VapoRub and a greasy paper plate with crumbs still stuck to it.

Like an artist fueled by the madness burning inside of him, I began to finger-paint the jar all over the paper plate in between her spittings, timing it so she wouldn't see what I was planning for her. We were almost at school, and time was running out. I had to make sure that every last drop of that little jar full of revenge was smeared onto some part of the plate.

We started pulling up to the curb at school. We had arrived late and the line of buses in front of us had already dropped off their loads of kids. Butt continued to pop up to let fly drops of spittle. I had been timing it the entire ride. Almost every 30 seconds. I listened. The sound of her popping up to spit made a slight sound, that crinkling-type sound when you sit on a leather seat and it sticks to you. I was ready.

I heard her start to stand, and like greased lightning on fast-forward, I turned and pied that bitch right in the forehead with an entire jar of strategically-placed Vicks. I smeared it all in her hair, around her ears, making sure to get it on the back of her head as well. The bus stopped and the doors opened. I stood up, dropped the plate on the floor of the bus, and glanced at her. She had a look of shock and horror on her face, her hands running through the blue glazed glob covering her hair. She began to cry. I turned, without saying a word, and walked off the bus, basking in the howls of laughter coming from the rest of the kids on the bus directed at her. Her friends had their hands covering their mouths, unable to believe what had just happened.

This all started from my very uncharismatic mother. Of course young kids pick up words they hear frequently. I happened to learn the mighty unweilded power of the F Bomb.

One day my mom and I were talking and I dropped it. The first thing she did was grab my arm, drag me into the kitchen, grab some liquid dish soap, and proceed to wash my mouth out.

Now, I was only 6 years old, but I was not about to be punished for repeating a word I learned directly from the hand that feeds. Getting my mouth washed out was not a pleasant experience, and I learned nothing from her ""punishment.""

As the night progressed, I was pretty damn bitter about what happened earlier. That night my mom was on the phone talking to my grandparents. She usually had a glass soley for drinking water out of. One thing i figured out is that when she takes a drink, she is a chugger and not a sipper. So being the ""nice"" guy that I am, I offered to refill her empty water glass because she was busy on the phone. 

 This is my favorite part. I had every intention at getting even with her. i refill her water glass. After it is full, I take the bottle of dish soap, and squeeze a shit ton into the glass itself. I waiting to put soap in last to avoid sudding. I gave the cup to my mom. Of course she is super chatty and looked thirsty. I could tell by how parched her lips were. She was pretty much salivating over that cold refreshing glass of water as i entered the room. Sure enough she took it from me and proceeded to chuch. Then wait, the dynamic in the room changed and time came to a halt. The water glass slowly released from her hand as gravity did god's work on its course to the shaggy carpet. 

Absolute disgues spread across her face. I could feel her anger. She grabbed me up so fast and started whooping me. I didn't care though. No spanking could erase that smug smirk from my face. That was the first and last time mouth wash with soap ever happened in the house.

They say revenge is a dish best served cold. I say revenge is soap hidden for consumption.

The guys over at /r/Letsnotmeet said this would be good here, so I figure I'd give it a try! 

One night my dad was the creep, and now there are about 10 teenagers in Czech that are terrified of the woods at night. Although they were douches, so it's alright.

Let me explain.

I go to school in the US, but all of my extended family lives in the Czech Republic. Every year that we go back, my uncles and aunts throw a party for us in their mountain house. This house is up in the mountains, very secluded from other houses.


One night we were all sitting outside around a campfire and our neighbors, albeit quite far were being RIDICULOUSLY loud. They are Czech, aka. they were drunk. Yelling, swearing, shooting off fire crackers; the works. My cousin had just put her toddler down to sleep, and was worried that they would wake him up, so my dad decides to walk over there to ask them to be quiet.

My dad was really polite about it and they seemed apologetic so my dad left and returned to our campfire. Naturally, in about ten minutes they were just as loud, this time yelling thing to us telling us to not be party poopers, shooting firecrackers in our direction, that we are jealous we aren't having as much fun, blah blah blah. After about ten minutes of them not dying down my dad decides to take action.


My dad is 6'6 and 230 pounds of pure muscle (he was an athlete) so he's in incredible shape and just a very imposing man. He takes his shirt off and puts on this mask that my uncle just so happened to have laying around. This mask was human faced, but it was a very distorted and really creepy, kind of like this: http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/creepy-ultra-realistic-human-face-mask
He goes to the shed and takes the ax and decides he's going to scare these drunk assholes.

The property that they were on is shaped like a square with dense forest completely covering the outskirts. Their fire was right in the middle. My dad slowly walks from the forest, but never ventures further toward the camp, and simply slowly walks the perimeter, swinging the ax and staring at the fire.
We heard the drunk guys screaming and swearing and my dad came back laughing, saying that he had never seen teenagers run that quickly.

Not surprisingly, the rest of the trip in the mountain house was peaceful without the noise of our drunken teenage neighbors. Probably because they were too busy locked in their house, shitting themselves.

""Juan"" must have never paid his bills because he got about 10 calls a day from collection agencies.  I would say, ""Sorry man, you got the wrong number.  Please remove this number.""  But they kept calling, after about a month I would get upset and start asking for their manager but they would just hang up and keep calling back.  So I decided I was tired of it.  

Next time there was a call...

Me, ""Hello""
Them, ""I need to speak with Juan""
Me, ""Great, who am I speaking with?""
them, ""This is suzy with xyz finanical corp,...""
me, ""Fantastic, are you calling for yourself or for someone else?""
them, ""I'm calling for Juan...""
me, ""Super! If you don't mind me asking who long have you been thinking of purchasing a widget (whatever I could think of at that time) from our company?""
Them, ""I need to speak with Juan.""
Me, ""I understand.  It's a family decision...  Suzy, how long have you and Juan been married?""
Them, ""Juan is not my husband, I was calling...""
Me, ""then why are you allowing him to make this important widget decision for you?""
Them, ""NO!  I'm calling because""
Me, ""Let me explain some of the benefits our product has to offer...""

At this point they would try to talk over me but I would continue in talk about the product I had mentioned... essentially I was being an obnoxious telemarketing salesperson.  guess what.. they fucking hated it.  I just kept going until they hung up... sometimes I would call the number back and act like we got disconnected...

Me, ""is suzy there?""
they put me through to suzy's line
them, ""Hello""
Me, ""Hello Suzy, we must have gotten disconnected... Now where was I. Oh yes, Widgets are...""  until they hung up again... and again... ""suzy we must have a bad connection we keep getting disconnected...""  


It didn't stop all the calls but it did cut them down about 2 a day... Then I started a whole new thing.

Me, ""Hello""
Them, ""I need to speak with Juan""
Me, ""Yes, This is hiddenonion how can I help you""
Them, ""I need to speak with Juan.""
Me, ""who may I say is calling?""
Them, ""this is xyz money corp.""
Me, ""Oh yes, this is about the financing right?""
Them, ""Well, I can only talk to Juan.""
Me, ""What? is this a joke?""
Them, ""No, I need to speak to Juan.""
Me, ""I am the executor of his will and I am handling all the financing for his funeral.  It is in poor taste to make jokes like that.  I'm glad his mother didn't answer the phone, you son of a bitch!""
Them, ""Juan has pasted away?""
Me, ""Why do you think we financed a funeral through you sons of bitches?!? (i'm yelling at this point) are you retarded or just stupid.""
Them, ""sir, there is not need for that.""
Me, ""I agree!  Why would you call asking for Juan, when you know good and well he's dead because we are financing his funeral with you guys!""
Them, ""Sir we don't finance funerals, we are...""
Me, ""what the hell are you talking about!  so you are not going to pay his funeral, even though you already approved it?  THE DAY BEFORE HE'S TO BE BURIED!!! The funeral home has to be paid upfront!  If we don't then they hold the body... what's your name?""

it would go on back and forth for a while until they hung up and never called back... 

no more calls!  

But I kind of wish they did because I so more many scenarios I could play out for Juan's life.

In the meantime, my family and I camp there as much as possible since we love it out there; creek nearby, rolling hills that used to be ditch-irrigated pasture, gorgeous view, and pretty much nobody around.
 
One of the few people for miles is the ditch rider that operates a trans-mountain water diversion structure farther up the creek, owned by the company that bought the water rights my property had before the previous owner sold it.  I had met the ditch rider once before.  He was gruff at first, but as I curiously questioned him about his work, he opened up a little bit.  Ok, enough backstory.

One Friday evening, my family and I arrived to camp out only to find a group of kids in their late teens in the upper field.  Pickup trucks, circle of tents, and large bonfire.  

I drove by them on the dirt road, and it looked like they were having a pretty chill get-together.  I didn't mind so much that they were trespassing, but we were in a Stage II fire ban, so having a fire was a big deal.  Here in Colorado, it doesn't take much for a fire to spread, and before you know it, thousands of acres are scorched.

So I parked my vehicle at our ""building site,"" left my wife and daughter there, and went up to talk to them.

Map in hand, I pointed out that this was private property, and showed them some of my favorite camping spots in the nearby national forest and BLM.  But since they had already set up camp, they could stay where they were for the weekend.  I made the offer that if they wanted to come back in the future, they could if they just asked me beforehand.  Not a bad deal, I thought.  However, I told them that we were in a stage II fire ban, and flame, including campfires and smoking outdoors, was absolutely prohibited.  I asked that they put out the fire immediately, and they did.  

As I was walking away, I heard one of them say ""fucker thinks he owns the place"" and they all laughed.  I was a little offended considering how I could have easily told them to GTFO, but whatever, you know how male teens can be when trying to impress a group.  Lo and behold, an hour later when I walk back up to check on them, there's a bonfire twice as big as the first one.  A ""fuck you"" to me and, more importantly, a massive middle finger to the well-being of the entire region.  I decide I need to teach these little shits a lesson.

I devised a perfect plan.  Remember when I said that this used to be ditch-irrigated pasture?  All the old water structures were still in place and in pretty good condition.  Only problem was, I didn't have a water right.  So I drove up to the ditch-rider's cabin, and he remembered me from when we had met (I don't think he gets a lot of visitors).  I explained the situation, and his rough exterior turned to outright glee as came up with the same plan I had.  

Together, we shut his company's headgate by about half, allowing a surge of water to flow downstream, and then drove down to the headgate of ""my"" old ditch, and opened it fully.  From the dirt road on the ridge above, we watched as the water crept across the field, soaked their tents and presumably their sleeping gear, and drowned the fire with a steaming hiss.  A mad scramble ensued, as they hastily loaded up their gear and drove away (well, one got stuck in the soggy field for a few minutes and needed to get pulled out).  As they passed us on the dirt road out, I get a nasty look from the guy who had so indiscreetly told me off.  I chuckled to myself.  It's not like I own the place :)

**TL;DR** Trespassing teens camp in my field, I try to be nice, they respond by having a huge fire during a burn ban, and I, with the help of a crotchety old ditch rider, flood the field.

This happened when I just started working on towboats. I was a greenhand along with another guy. We had just both came from deckhand school and were both put on the same towboat. Having already spent two weeks in school, we weren't given anytime to go do any shopping or anything else. So we were put on the boat with pretty much the same stuff as we came to deckhand class with, minus what we used during the class.

The lead man on deck, we will call him LM was a pretty cool guy and always wore overalls. Always. The greenhand that was put on the vessel with me, we will call him Bum. So, Bum and LM both chewed tobacco and Bum was quickly running out of his remaining tobacco in the first week and we still had 3 weeks to go before we got to go home.

LM was a pretty cool guy and told Bum that since it was his first hitch, that he wouldn't mind sharing his chewing tobacco with him, but only for this first hitch. He told him that he understood that he didn't know how much to bring since this was his first time being out here, but that next hitch he would have to bring enough for the entire four weeks or he is on his own. Bum quickly agreed and expressed thanks.

So, next 3 weeks went by uneventful, Bum and I went home. Two weeks later, we were back out there again. This time, Bum barely brought more tobacco than he did the previous time and was out of chewing tobacco halfway through his hitch. He started bumming off of LM again. LM was a cool guy, but I could tell he was upset about it. So, one day we are on the head of tow (at the furthest end from the vessel on the barges or unit of barges we push) and we are about to make a lock. It's just me and LM at the head. He is helping me make the lock.

He told me had a plan to get Bum to stop bumming. It was near watch change, so Bum was coming out to relieve me. The first thing Bum ask for is a chew from LM. LM agreed and pulled out a bag of chewing tobacco that was nearly empty save for one last chew. Bum was kinda hesitant about taking his last chew, but LM insisted saying it wasn't a problem. 

It didn't take long for Bum to lose his guilt about taking LM's chew and took his last chew from that bag. As soon as Bum started chewing, LM immediately pulled out a brand new bag and opened it up. With Bum watching, LM pissed into the bag and sealed it back up. Bum asked him what the hell he was doing. LM simply told him that his grandfather had told him when he was a kid that if you pissed in a fresh bag of chew, it will keep it fresher longer. Bum immediately started vomiting on the barge. 

LM later told me that it was worth wasting a bag of chew for that and Bum never did ask for any more chew from him.

A few years ago in a sunny old town in the south of England, my boyfriend at the time and I had tickets to go and see his favourite band. It was going to be a pretty intimate gig with only about 50 or so people there and we were both really looking forward to it.

So, we're standing in line to get in to the venue when the boyfriend spots his ex girlfriend also waiting in the queue. Fine, whatever, he goes up to her, says hello, introduces me, all is well, very civil, very English. 

Skip ahead a few hours and after several drinks, nature is calling and this being a small venue there is only one ladies' toilet. And who so happens to be in the queue in front of me? Yes, that's right folks, the ex girlfriend. Not a problem I think, bit awkward but she was civil enough earlier. I enter the cubicle, do the business and as I go to open the door, I find that I can't open it. After pushing and pushing it quickly becomes clear that her and her friends are leaning against the door so I can't get out. Very mature. They eventually give up as the main band is about to go on...

**The Revenge**

The problem was that in order to get into this particular venue you needed to be 18 and I knew for a fact that she was, at the time, 17. So, after the incident in the loo, I think ""well, if she wants to act like a child then she might as well be treated like one"", casually strolling up to the bouncer and alerting him to the fact that there is a girl here who is underage. I point her out to him (she had bright pink hair, hard to miss) and she is quickly escorted out when she fails to produce any ID, missing the band she had been waiting all night to see.

To top it off, she was barred from that particular venue.....and her bag got stolen (not by me I might add!)

**Situation**

So I just started college this summer, and the roommate I got paired up with was fine for two weeks.

Now he seems to have developed a habit of leaving his key in the room any time I'm there because I'll just open the door for him on the inside.  I didn't mind the first few times, until i realized he wasn't even trying to remember his key, he was just using me as a doorman. Several times a day he expected me to stop whatever I was doing, and go open the door for him, because he couldn't be bothered with it. I know it's not a big deal but I'm usually in bed with a book or a laptop I don't want to rearrange myself once an hour for no reason.

And there is absolutely no reason for him not to carry his key.  It's just a card that opens the door when he gets close, and he wears cargo shorts everyday so it's not lack of pockets to keep it in.  If he had simply asked ""Do you mind opening the door for me all the time so I don't have to carry my key?"" I would have said yes.  I would have been a little annoyed but I would have said yes.

**Revenge**

Last night while he was out in the lobby, I decided I was tired.  I turned my phone off got into bed and fell asleep.  I'm a fairly heavy sleeper so knocking on the door isn't going to be enough to wake me up, and if you make too much noise the RA will get mad. He had to stay out in the dorm hallway all night.

**Bonus**

He usually has an alarm every morning to wake him up at 7:00  The really annoying iphone emergency one that goes ""DAH DAH DAH"" like there's a fire.  He leaves it on for up to twenty minutes because he's too lazy to turn it off, despite the fact that he is right next to it.  Today was the first day in the last month I got to sleep past 8:00 am which is a ton of sleep because I went to bed before 11:00.

I had bedbugs in my last apartment... even a minor infestation of these things would be awful, but ours was no joke. It was honestly the worst experience of my life.

Anyway, as soon as we noticed the bugs and determined what the hell they were, I called the landlord to get it sorted out. I did some research and it turns out that in my state this is 100% his problem. When we spoke, he told me that we must have brought the bugs in ourselves, because none of the other tenants had said anything about bugs. I tried to explain to him that as the landlord, it was his responsibilty to get it handled, and he just told me that he wasn't paying an exterminator because it was my problem, not his.

He fucked up though, for one simple reason: it really isn't that difficult to knock on the two other tenants' doors and ask if they had seen the things, if so, for how long, and if they had tried to speak with the him about it.

Both had. The people on the second floor said that they first noticed the bites about two months ago (we had first noticed them about three weeks prior to this; strike one, landlord), and that the landlord gave them the exact same song and dance about how they must have brought them in themselves so he's not taking care of it (the landlord had already struck out on strike one, but this was strike two anyway. Big swing and a miss). The family in this apartment told me that they had moved in after their old house was foreclosed, and they didn't want to make waves because they didn't have the means to find somewhere else to go, so they dropped it.

Then I go down to the first floor. These were the newest tenants; it was a family that had moved from a not so pleasant part of town to our building via a rent assistance program that the city offered. Same story as the second floor, only they had been seeing the bugs since they moved in about four months prior to all of this. Not only that, but apparently when they were moving in, the prior tenants were grabbing their last few belongings and one of them said something about making sure the bugs get taken care of. They gave me a similar story about not wanting to make waves in this apartment because they really didn't want to move back to the old neighborhood, as the school district in this one was leagues better.

So now I know this motherfucker is lying through his teeth and hoping that he'll have a building full of people who don't want to make waves. Fuck you buddy, I am a god damn professional wave maker. Licensed and everything. I call a lawyer buddy of mine to confirm a few things about extortion, one party states, and what the results of civil litigation would be if I could catch this dude in his lies. The extortion part doesn't go so great, but I expected as much. The one party state end of things went exactly as I had hoped it would, so that was cool. The litigation part wasn't so promising, but I sort of expected that, and honestly didn't want to get caught up in court anyway, so we were sticking with plan A: bluff.

Next I call my uncle, who is a veteran cop, and ask if he has access to any sort of recording equipment that nobody would miss for a night. He asks what the deal is, I explain the situation, and he says that he can get to the precinct to pick up what I need and have it over to me within the hour. I text my landlord and let him know that we have to talk.

My uncle drops the recording device off about an hour later, and I give my landlord a call. I run through the situation with him, and I get him to repeat everything he had said previously to me. The motherfucker actually has the audacity to tell me that since our last conversation about the bugs he had taken it upon himself to check with the other tenants, and that they definitely hadn't seen anyhing, but I damn well better hire an exterminator before they migrate to the other apartments. I let him go on about this shit for a while, then tell him that he's gonna stop talking for a few minutes and just listen to me.

I explain the conversations I had with the two other tenants, and he keeps trying to cut me off. I sort of try to let him, but the asshole has nothing to say beyond some stammering about ""going behind his back."" Sure. I tell him I've got more to tell him, and read the information about a landlord's responsibilities in this situation directly off of the Department of Housing's (Heath? I forget, it's been a while) website. I stop, and ask him if he'd be willing to get this handled now that I know he's lying.

His response? ""I can lie all I want, you're some dirtbag kid (I was about 27 at the time, and don't think I really come across as a dirtbag, but cool... you roll with that homey), and he's an 'upstanding citizen,' so nobody will believe me."" Dumb fuck. I tried to give him a chance... so be it.

At that point I tell him that he should google ""one party state,"" and check his mailbox in about an hour. In that time I burned a CD of the recording of the phone call, and dropped it in his mailbox (he lived on the next block) with my lawyer buddy's business card and a note that listed my demands. 

1) We would pay no rent till the apartment is treated and declared bug free by exterminators of my choosing. A good buddy of mine actually works for a sort of high class exterminator... he's told me stories about treating roach and rat problems for actors and Major League Baseball players. Not cheap, and very effective... both of those were exactly what I was looking for.

2) Once the apartment was declared bug free, we would be allowed to break our lease with no penalty as soon as we found an apartment. Rent would be paid between the day that the infestation is handled and the day we move out. I already had our next apartment lined up and waiting for us, so no rent was gonna be paid. He didn't have a recording of me admitting this though, so fuck him.

3) We would be paid for the clothing and furniture that had to be thrown away. I wanted a new couch before this anyway.

4) Our security deposit would be returned three-fold regardless of the condition of the apartment. We were paying $1,200 a month; $3,600 sounded like a nice head start on the security deposit for the new place, plus some stereo equipment, a new bong, and a nice chunk of cash in the savings I account I shared with my then girlfiend (now wife).

All of these conditions were to be met or I would be taking him to court for a bunch of shit I made up and can't remember now that sounded great at the time. To be quite frank, if the asshole called me and said that we'd get our security deposit back, and that the bugs would be taken care of, I wouldn't have played hardball... but fuck it, may as well go for a touchdown, you know?

Holy fucking hell did it work. This motherfucker literally showed up at my door bawling, and telling me about how much it would cost to get this thing treated, so I have to understand why he tried to get me to do it, and I didn't understand what spending all the money I was demanding what do to him. I told him that it's not my problem and that he owns two homes that he can take second mortgages out on if he's short on cash, because if this goes to court it's gonna cost him a lot more. Eat it fucker, I can lie through my teeth too.

You could have knocked me over with a fucking feather when he responded to this by breaking out his checkbook, and asking me for the name of the exterminators I wanted to use. A big part of me wishes that I had pulled a Rickey Henderson and had the check framed, but $3,600 is $3,600. I got another check for $1,500 (bringing the total to just over $5k) on the day we moved out to cover the furniture we had to toss. Asshole thought I had forgot about that part, and it looked like he shit himself when I brought it up as I was returning the keys hahaha. We're actually moving out of the apartment we moved to after that one this summer (this was just under four years ago), and we're gonna wind up paying a chunk of the new place's security deposit with some of the money haha... thanks dickbag! I'm happy to say that I haven't seen a bedbug (aside from on r/whatisthisbug) since shortly before we moved out, a few weeks after all of this went down. I also took my uncle, lawyer friend, and buddy who works for the exterminator out for drinks. To be fair I should have made the exterminator pay though; he was in sales at this point and I think that he got a sick commission out of the deal hahaha.

The funniest part is that if he tried to play hardball, the most I probably would have been able to do is call the Department of Housing, who would have forced him to exterminate, using a company that probably would have cost a fraction of what he wound up paying. Oh well!

TL;DR: Moved into a building that had a bedbug infestation, landlord tried convince me that it was my fault/ responsibility, I recorded him lying his balls off, then extorted the living shit out of him even though I had a good deal of ammo but no real gun to load up with it.

But it was worth it.,1403,201,276,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/13hcng/got_the_pettiest_revenge_on_a_customer_but_it_was/,"I work as a cashier at a crafts store. Most of my customers are bored soccer moms or older ladies. Most of those customers are also couponers who argue and fuss over everything. Hell, one lady made me return her items, manually by code, for over an hour so that she could get .38 cents back through a coupon. 

But anyways.

This one lady comes up, ignores my smile and ""Hello, how are you?"" (Fuck you, I have a beautiful smile) and throws her items at me. When I reach over to start scanning, she barks out ""STOP."" Sticking out her hand like so: http://i.imgur.com/Dnmkn.jpg . She tells me that she wants me to tell her the price of each item, even though there is a screen right in front of her that tells her the price. I inform her of the monitor and she replies ""I thought I told YOU to tell me the prices, not the computer?"" I know I should've just told her the prices, but after +30 customers a day wanting you to tell her the prices for all of her items, it's very tiring. I don't like talking. 

So I scan and tell her the prices. She takes out anything that isn't a dollar. Finally, I'm eager to get rid of her and tell her the total. She sticks out her hand again in the ""Stop"" motion and tells me to ""HOLD IT."" She throws a piece of chocolate at me. It hits me in the chest and I just stare at her. She goes ""Scan that. I want it.""

So vision reddening and veins pulsating, I scan it. And squeeze the absolute shit out of the chocolate between my index finger and thumb when I put it in her bag. The crack I felt when the chocolate submitted to my superior strength instantly released any pent up anger I felt. Fuck orgasms, true love, and good grades. That moment was the happiest in my entire life.

It was one of these chocolates: http://i.imgur.com/UJH9f.jpg

So even if it didn't upset or ruin her day, it would have annoyed her just a little. Just because all the caramel would be smeared over the foil wrapper. And she'll get caramel all over her old lady faux-fur lined gloves. Maybe even touch her stupid cat-eye glasses and get chocolate all over her vision, momentarily blinding her and causing her to crash and DIE.

Super petty but a small bit of satisfying revenge. Aside from her throwing her credit card and me and me flicking it back so that she can swipe it on the machine next to her and me not giving her a coupon. Best. Day. Ever.

We would do the engravings in the store, not by hand but with these big machines. The way they would work is, you'd put the piece into the clamps on the machine, type in what you want engraved, and play with the settings, of which only two mattered - how many passes the machine would make, and how much force would be behind the needle (since we engraved anything from glass to stainless steel, these varied settings were necessary). It would usually take five to fifteen minutes to do, but the company policy is to tell the customer it'll be an hour, in case there's a backlog. And the store is in a mall, so waiting an hour wasn't a big deal, there was plenty to occupy yourself with and customers never seemed to have a problem with this.

Except this one woman. She came in and bought a door knocker, wanted her family's name engraved on it. Ok, no problem. I do the papers for her order and tell her it'll be about an hour. She completely lost her shit at this, insisting that her time was too valuable to waste in a mall, and she would wait in the store, thank you very much. And she did, hovering like a bitchy hawk as I plugged her order into the engraving machine.

So of course I chose to put the needle on the lightest force possible, with as many passes as possible, turning what would have been a five minute job into - yep - sixty minutes.

**The backstory**

The long story is in the post if anyone is interested, but the short version is this:

In 2009, my wife and I were driving from her parents' house in Kenai, AK to Anchorage a few days after Thanksgiving.  90 miles from home, we got caught in a blizzard and gale force winds pushed my Jeep just far enough to catch the snow berm and flip us.  A trooper got us to the closest town to the accident, about 40 miles from home, after midnight.

**The plan**

After many calls, I got ahold of a friend who was able to pick us up and take us home.  It was over a 2 hour round trip for him, and he would not take the $50 I was trying to give him to cover gas and his time.  Even after I stuffed the money into his pocket, he just gave it back and said that he wasn't going to take it.  Over the next few days, I kept trying to give him the cash, but he wouldn't take it.

I decided I wasn't going to put up with his shit anymore, so I hatched a plan.  I stopped at the bank and had them convert the $50 bill to 1's and put my plan into motion.  

**The revenge**

In the 2-3 weeks that followed, I would slip $1 at a time into his stuff.  Coat pockets, gloves, stuffed into his cupholder or sticking out of the seat of his car, wherever I could stealthily put cash.  My favorite was sticking one between the sun visor and roof of his truck, which took him a couple weeks to find.  

It took several months, but he eventually figured out it was me and we got a good laugh about it.  Maybe next time, he'll just take the money.

Not from the food server but instead a dismayed observer. 

So I'm out to dinner with some friends. And one guy, a friend of a friend, is being a particular prick. 

As a side note, he is known as a real penny pincher. A tight ass, so to speak. Always asking for drinks, asking for handouts. And it turns out that this guy has been rorting our country's (Australia) welfare system for years. I only recently found out. 

So here we are, at the restaurant table, and he is being racist - talking about Hitler and using fake German accents in this Hungarian restaurant...in front of the friendly young Hungarian waitress... 

He is complaining about the menu, and generally being rude to this poor waitress who is obviously new to the job (a backpacker) and just being nice, whilst no doubt earning very little and not being tipped much (we don't tip as much as people in the States) 

So I tell him to stop being an asshole, but he won't listen. 

He continues... we all, as a group, scold him for being a prick, but he continues. 

Time passes, and later, the waitress brings his dinner which consisted of chicken schnitzel and chips. At this point, we are all happy because the food is great, but of course he then decides to complain and ask the poor waitress to put the chips back in the frier because ""they're not cooked enough"". And to get a new soda because ""it is diet, not regular"" (we sip the soda and all agree he is wrong). 

I'd had enough. Pissed off at this guys lack of empathy, most likely due to the fact he has never worked in hospitality - in fact he doesn't work at all - he relies on welfare payouts from the government, I decide to seek revenge. 

.... SO... As soon as I got home I wrote a long detailed submission to our welfare system 'dob-in' program. It is basically a website where you can anonymously dob in welfare cheats. 

He's toast. I wrote everything I know about the guy, including his boasts about rorting money. I wrote his name, his address, his general M. O. (from what I've heard, etc).

She had a two bedroom apartment but was living by herself. Then one of her ""friends"" needed a place so she offered up her second room. I was down every other weekend and since I was working I paid the cable/phone/internet bills and always bought groceries - mainly for my wife but the roommate benefited from that as well. The roommate happened to be dating a good friend of mine and he usually stayed there a couple nights a week despite having an apartment not too far away. 

About 6 months into this arrangement and after returning home to massive parties several times we received a note on my wife's bedroom door. It read (shortened version): ""ShaneL79 must pay 1/3 rent and bills since he regularly stays here. I would like that amount to be returned from this months and last months rent/bills"". 

My wife was definitely annoyed and shocked that she would make demands. She was even more shocked that she wanted those demands to be retroactive. My wife decided to write up the greatest response letter I've ever read. It said:

*""Dear (Roommate),*

*I have considered your demands and have decided that it would only be fair if we both charge our house guests for their stays. I also do not think it is fair that ShaneL79 pays our $200/month cable/phone/internet bill and still has to pay to stay when he visits while your guests do not. So I have included that bill in my calculations. Rent is $800/month, Bills are $200/month. We each paid $500/month as per our previous arrangement.* 

*The new, and more fair arrangement, would see an increase of $200 to the total amount with the addition of the cable/phone/internet bill. That is a total of $1200/month or $40/day in bills. On days when there are three of us staying here that is about $13.50/person per day. Days when there are four of us staying here it will be $10/person.*

*Last month ShaneL79 stayed here 4 days for a total of $54 he owes us. This month he will be here 6 days for a total of $81 he will pay for staying here.* 

*Last month (roommates boyfriend) stayed here 8 days, owing us $108 and this month he has already stayed here 6 days, owing us $81.* 

*Your parents stayed for 10 days last month and since there were two of them, the amount per person per day is $10 since there were four of us staying here. That equals $200. Your mom is staying with us for 7 days next week for a total of $94.50.*

*So that leaves us with our portions. Since we are responsible for the entire month, that means our portion is $20/day when there is only 2 of us here, $13.50/day when there is three of us here, and $10/day when there is 4 of us here.* 

*Last month there were only 2 of us here for 8 days ($160/each), 3 of us here for 12 days ($162/each for our portion), and 4 of us here for 10 days ($100/each for our portion). Our total portion for last month is $422/each.*

*This month there will be only 2 of us for 11 days ($220/each), 3 of us for 19 days ($256.50/each for our portion). A total of $476.50/each.*

*Since we are responsible for our guests, I will include their totals to our portions and you can collect from them however you like and I will collect from ShaneL79.*

*That brings your total from last month to $730 ($422 + $108 (BF) + $200 (parents)). My total is $476 ($422 + $54 (ShaneL79).*

*This month your current total is $652 ($476.50 + $94.50 (mom) + $81 (BF)). My total is $557.50 ($476.50 + $81 (ShaneL79))*

*Since you already paid $500 last month and this month, you only owe $382 which you can collect from your guests. Please have the money by the end of next week.*

*Thanks.""*

Needless to say she completely expected her roommate to move out after reading that. They had been having some arguments leading up to this whole event so the roommates note was the final straw for my wife. The problem is her roommate waited until rent day to give her notice that she was moving out that day, expecting to get away with paying the next months rent and leaving it all on my wife's shoulders. 

While my wife was at school her roommate moved her stuff out without a mention of where she could be reached. So my wife called her roommates parents and explained the situation about a week later (giving her roommate enough time to re-surface). That same night her roommate returned and paid her $500. 

Needless to say they are no longer friends. 

One night shortly after we were at my friends house (her bf) for a party and I jokingly handed him $20 and said ""in case your gf wants us to pay cover for visiting you"". That was the first time he had heard the story. As far as he was aware, we just decided to increase her rent $200/month for no reason. Once I explained it to him we had a good laugh and I came to find out he was in the process of breaking up with her. As it turns out, she moved in with him and tried free-loading. He kicked her out the day before the party and hadn't spoken to her since. 



**TL;DR** - Roommate demanded money from house-guest who was already paying bills. Roommate didn't realize she had guests more often and it was explained to her using math in a way that showed she owed more money by her own logic. The intention of the lesson was to kick her out.

Sometimes people get pulled, it's all very much a 'zero tolerance' thing with the local PD. I also have the mind to *not* speed through where children are likely to be.

Either way, call it a few weeks ago and I'm headed on my way out of the school parking lot when a black PT Cruiser just comes-a flyin' down the road at a quick clip that is anything but 25 MPH. Crossing guards do the whole 'slow down' thing with their hands and the PT Cruiser driver, a just-over-the-hill blonde woman with short hair couldn't even be bothered to give a sideways glance. If ever there was a time I wished for someone to get a big ol' fat traffic ticket, this was one of those times. As Mr. Murphy and his infernal Laws would state, however, local police were not there this morning. Of course not.

Blood. Boiling. Simmering, rather, but you get the idea I'm sure.

Just so happens that she was going my direction, so I pull out behind her (keeping my speed under the limit until the zone ended, you know how I roll) and attempt to follow. Maybe an emergency? Maybe she's going to be sick, or maybe she's shat herself something fierce this lovely morning and is in dire need of cleaning up.

I bought my two dogs rawhide bones yesterday. A big one for Ruger, the mastiff, and a small one for Molly, the terrier mix. For the last few years whenever these two get treats, Ruger would steal Molly's and eat hers up pretty quick.

As usual, Ruger steals hers. Molly barely complains. She grabs his and goes to the door to be let out. I see her run off to the woods with his bone. A few minutes later she starts barking so of course Ruger wants to see what's going on. 

He drops Molly's bone on the living room rug when I go to let him outside. Molly starts scratching at the front door so I walk to the other freakin side of the house to let her back in. She doesn't have Ruger's bone. Instead she goes straight for her own half chewed one there on the rug.

When I let Ruger in, he looks confused and kinda sad. But he sighs and lays down and doesn't do much about it. Molly finishes off her bone just before bedtime.

This morning after I let them outside to go potty, Molly comes back inside with Ruger's bone. She's laying next to me right now with it. Ruger looks absolutely defeated.

Edit: it's about nine at night now. Ruger managed to steal the rawhide back. Molly is taking out her frustration by violently humping him. *Sigh*.

I found this subreddit and I don't know where else to put this story. I don't really consider it petty revenge, but dammit if I don't get a warm and fuzzy feeling thinking about it.

After my second year in college, a friend and I moved in with another friend. He was renting a 3 bedroom house in a lower income area, so it was pretty cheap. It was fairly close to the university campus, and as all three of us were attending, we were able to work it out where it would be a whole lot cheaper living there than on campus. 

The neighborhood itself wasn't bad at all. It was mostly other kids, elderly folks, and a few others here and there. Everyone in the neighborhood was pretty relax and chill except for our fucking neighbors. We'll call them Walter and Jesse.

Now Walter and Jesse were brothers, and entrepreneurs of sorts. They ran a small, in-home business selling product in niche market that required very little advertisement. They were meth cooks and dealers. Obnoxious, loud, violent, drug dealers. Everyone hated them, but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while, strung out, from there front yard.

We pretty much fell in line (at first). They would blast music and porn from there house from 7am until 7am. We'd hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn. Huge fucking parties that would go on for days. And to our chagrin, we ignored it all.

Well up arrives march, and my income tax comes in, I only get about $500, but goddammit, that's my $500 dollars and I'm gonna fucking buy something for me. Everything has gone to college and bills and I want to splurge. I go out and buy a 42"" LCD TV. It's a VIZIO, but it's the first HDTV I've ever had. My friends and I set it up, and oh boy did we have fun that week. And only that week, for that's as long as I had it.

The Meth bros decide they're gonna shoot their BB gun at whatever the fuck they can see. At birds, bushes, fences, and especially windows. Well one little BB decided to go straight through my window and hit my TV, cracking it while I was playing some MW2. My face dropped and I heard laughing. Which then immediately turned to death threats if I called the cops. Now I know they had real guns. They had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at them.

My friends and I were all disappointed at the turn of events. And both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it. But nay, not I. The one time I purchased me a bit of joy in my life (I grew up fairly poor), it was taken away from me. So I plotted. And I plotted. And I plotted some more. And an evil plot I did accomplish.

I saved up every gatorade bottle I purchased for about 3 weeks. And every other day I would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one, all with cash of course. Now some of you might see what's going. And you'd be right. I had about 15 bottles saved up. And I made some spectacular chlorine gas bombs.

I waited for a night when both of them were gone. It was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep. I had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior, so I started loading the tablets into the bottles and throwing them over the fence. Since I didn't break down the tablets, it took a while for them to go off. I was able to get them all over the fence before the first one went boom. And boom they went.

I go back inside and into my room. I hear them going off. BOOM. BOOM. One of my roommates wakes up and goes ""WHAT THE FUCK!?""

BOOM. He wakes my other roommate (his room was closer) and there both freaking out. BOOM. Time to put my game face on. I scramble on out of there and react visibly scared. BOOM. I look at them and tell them to call the cops. BOOM. BOOM. He calls 911 and tells the cops he hears explosions. I go outside and pretend to look like I'm trying to find out what's going on. BOOM. I tell my friend that it's coming from next door. BOOM. He tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller. BOOM. BOOM. I tell him there's a bunch of smoke coming from outside. BOOM. They tell us to stay inside. BOOM. The last one goes off. We close the doors and watch the mayhem unfold. 

Right before the cops come, the Heisenbros show up freaking out. Right as they go inside about 3 cop cars show up and go through the front door. The officers haul them away and we go outside. They question us we tell them what we know. As far as the chlorine gas is concerned. It has already wafted into the atmosphere. 

They came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers. We told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did. The officer left and that was the last time I talked about it. Nobody knows about what I did but me. And it was the happiest we've been in a long time.

The last I heard about them, they were doing hard time for their drug ring, being in possession of illegal firearms, and human trafficking suprisingly.

He was your typical bully. He would make sly remarks towards people, trying to provoke them into fights. He was constantly vying for attention from everybody due to his own insecure issues I assume. 
Everyday on the way home from school I would walk for about half a mile to this bus stop where I would sit and wait for my mother to come and pick me up. It was the worst time of the day. Andrew and all his horrible friends would always walk past and feel the need to say something horrible to me to try and get me to react. I would just ignore them as I was never the bravest outgoing kid and the idea of a fight really scared me. One Thursday he and his little group of social rejects decided to stop and intimidate me while I was at the bus stop. They would do this from time to time, there seemed to be no coherence to it. They must of just got the urge to make my life miserable for those few minutes. The usual insults started; lanky, nerdy, gay. This went on for a few minutes until Andrew came up to my face and spat on me. He had always been mean to people but I had never experienced anything like that before. I had no idea how to react. His friends were all egging me on the punch him as they clearly wanted to see him kick my ass, but I was too in shock to really do anything. They left shortly afterwards as I wiped my face furiously. I got in the car with my mother when she arrived shortly after, went home and locked myself in my bedroom and just cried. I had never felt that humiliated and weak in my life.

The next day was a Friday and we had to finish off our IT Coursework for that year. For those of you who might not know IT is basically a dumbed down version of Computer Science. It involves a little bit of Word and Excel but nothing too strenuous. The entire day was dedicated to us finishing this off and handing it in by the three o'clock deadline. I had already finished mine and just intended to sit around all day talking to friends. Andrew came into the class grunting something about how he couldn't be bothered to do anything, and I overheard the teacher telling him that he hadn't even started yet and needed to work hard today. I knew the teacher was going to give him all the answers and basic points he needed to pass as he was from a ""low income background"" and it would look really good on the teacher if he could get him to pass. This wound me up but I figured there wasn't really anything I could do about it. 

For the actual revenge itself you have to understand the type of school I went to. To put it bluntly it was crap. The IT department was one room of about 30 computers, and the teacher was a PE (gym) teacher who took a weekend course in Microsoft Office. Nobody there knew how a computer worked and the concept of programming languages was above everyone. I had meddled a little bit at home with computers but I was far from good at anything, but I did know a few tricks. As he was beginning his coursework (typing out what the teacher had written for him) I decided to try something. I opened up the command line on a nearby computer and typed a shutdown command. Every computers name was written on a little sticky note on the monitor so I typed his in (with the relevant syntax of course) pressed Enter, and voila his computer shut down. 
     I was so happy. He started ranting and raving and swearing. He told the teacher but the teacher must of thought Andrew was just being the little brat he was and making excuses not to work. The nasty bully went on to try other computers but no matter which one he loaded up I kept shutting down his computer. He was getting so furious, and the brilliance was just amplified by the fact no-one believed him. 

This continued for the entire day. I would sit talking to my friends, notice he loaded up a computer, and shut it down. Sometimes I would let him get a bit of his work done and then shut it down so everything was lost. He would call the teacher over to watch how it kept happening but I would just back off and not do anything. Then when the teacher turned his back I would do it again. At the end of the day everybody handed in their finished work and he had nothing to give in. 

He got a 0 for the entire course, and out of 5 GCSE's that he needed to get to pursue further education he got 4. Sometimes I feel bad for making him fail. At the time I didn't know that this course was the difference between him passing and failing the entire year. If I had known that I might not of done it, but whenever I think about him spitting in my face and how humiliated I felt then this revenge always brings a smile to my face.

I was not a popular child but even if I had been, it wouldn't have mattered for there was this 'gang' of 4 eighth grade boys that were just jerks.  They picked on everyone and today, during my cold walk home, they decided to pick on me.  I had 10 blocks to walk in the cold and snow to get home and for the entirety of those blocks, those four jerks threw snowballs at me, specifically at my face.  I couldn't run anywhere, the snow in the yards was too deep, so I had to walk, with my head down, slowly starting to cry, while these four guys kept about twenty feet ahead of me, constantly throwing snowballs.  By the time I got to the walk leading to my driveway I was a wreck, tears and snot frozen to my face, the inside of my jacket all wet from snow melting down the inside.  My dad was outside shoveling, he saw what the boys were doing and started yelling at them to leave me alone.  They started to run and as they ran, in frustration I bent down and picked up a large chuck of ice and salt and slush along the curb, the kind of chunk that had fallen off a car.  I hurled this chunk in a large arc, not 'at' the boys, just in the air in frustration.  The leader, let's call him Mike, took this moment to stop, turn around, and start laughing, ""Ha ha, Coffeegorilla, you puss-""  I'm sure he was going to say pussy, but I wouldn't know, because that ice chunk I hurled into the air hit him directly in the face, causing him to slip on the ice, and fall on his back with a huge thunk.  Immediately I felt better.  My dad started laughing and Mike got up, nose bloody, and sort of scream-cried at my dad to stop laughing at him, which only made my dad laugh harder.  Mike sort of shuffle ran home and my Dad took me inside.  There is no way I could have hit Mike if I tried as I am the least athletic person in the history of ever, but he's the one who stopped to turn around for one last dig and put himself directly in the path of my ice chunk.  So, perhaps this wasn't petty revenge, but damnit if I don't smile when I think of it, especially around Christmas.

At this particular lift, the approach to get onto it is a little bit of an ""organized"" chaos method where people just bunch together and then squeeze down further and further as they inch forward until it becomes a line.

My husband and I got into the bunch, and then I bent over to buckle the clasp on one of my boots.  As I do this, a woman on skis inched her way in front of me in the bunch.  Since it wasn't an official line and it was just one person, I decided to let it pass, as it was a quad lift and we'd all be able to take the same chair up anyway.  But *then*, she turns around and waves to someone behind her, while turning to me and says ""You broke up our group, we're just joining back together so we can get to the top at the same time"".

I watched, dumbfounded, as no less than six other people pushed their way past my husband and I as they joined up with this woman.  (And two of the kids actually scraped their skis over my board as they passed by, i couldn't believe it.) They set us back two whole chairs just because this woman wanted to get in front of two people.  I didn't want to get into a dumb ""I was here first"" argument, so I took it to the streets.

Three of her family members got onto a chair, and then she and the rest of her group were waiting for the next one to come around.  I was directly behind the woman, so as she got ready to slide forward in front of the chair, I took my free (unbuckled) boot and stood on the back of her ski.  She lurched forward, and immediately fell on her face.  They ended up having to stop the lift for a few seconds as she got back up.

One lady was always calling for very little things like simple paper jams on her desktop laser printer when she didn't bother to switch between card stock and plain paper settings, etc.  She'd always berate the IT staff in front of her class as we worked, playing up to the students about how it would be nice if the school had people who could keep things running, how we had everything set up ergonomically incorrect, etc.  You know the kind.

Anyway, I was finishing up doing some work while she insulted the IT Dept. yet again and noticed she had a highly prized 25' VGA cable running the 3 ft from her screen to her PC.  This lady wore reading glasses, but didn't want to wear them at her computer because 'they don't look good on me', so she had conned one of the techs into giving her the longer cable so she could pull the screen as close to her face as possible.

When she went to lunch, I swapped the 25' cable with a 3 ft cable and stretched the thing as tight as I could pulling the LCD back against the wall. I then took the 25' cable to the digital media teacher as the principal had asked me to find one for him.

45 minutes later, she came into my lab, interrupting a class, yelling about how I messed up her monitor and that she couldn't pull it forward.

I just told her that I had been asked by the principal to allocate that cable elsewhere and that her screen was now ergonomically correct as it was 20""+ from her face.

&gt;This is unrelated, but a good story that I love to tell when it comes to traffic justice issues.

&gt;The bus terminal in my suburban neighbourhood is on top of a really big hill at the top of a valley. The lights onto the street that goes over the hill at the intersection with the terminal have bus activated lights, so they only change if a bus is waiting to leave.

&gt;The bus driver lays on the horn and slams on the breaks and the woman in the car FLIPS HER OFF. On a red light!

&gt;The woman driving the bus curses her out and carries on. We go down the hill into the valley and there is another intersection. This is often a place police set up speed traps, and sure enough that day they did.

&gt;Who should be pulled over on the cross street on the right? Fancy cadillac lady. The bus driver gets excited, pulls the bus over and calls a cop over. She says 'Did she get caught for speeding?' And the cop says, 'she sure did,' and the bus driver responds, 'Is running a red light still illegal here?' The cop laughs, 'Sure is,' hands her his card,'are you willing to testify in court?'

Some have lap-pools, some have Jacuzzi pools and some just have big-holes-full-of-water-to-drunkenly-party-around-at-all-hours-of-the-fucking-night. 

My immediate neighbor to the east has the latter model.

He’s also single and loves to rev up noisy, raucous pool parties which do indeed last until the wee, wee hours. 

Now, I may be a bit of an old phart, but I like my parties as well; however I also like to sleep and tend to get a small bit, a tiny bit, well, homicidally irritated when this happens on a weekly basis. 

Imploring him to “Shut the fuck up you chapped bastard!” and “Will you turn that offensive crap down?” always either goes unheeded or is greeted with a single digit salute and numerous anatomically impossible suggestions. 

Well, then. Now, then.

He works in the field as well as the office and is sometimes away for days at a time. 

Hee, hee, hee…

Back in the day, I studied hydrology and fluvial systems (i.e., rivers). In order to map currents and flow rates, we would use **P-50 Fluorescein** tablets (slightly smaller in size than a hockey puck) to give a beautiful fluorescent green color to the water at concentrations around 10 ppm. 

Well, fine and dandy for flowing rivers and other open areas of water, but in enclosed bodies of water, Fluorescein dye is exactly that, an organic dye. 

When noisy neighbor had to go out on a job one warm summer’s eve, I slipped over the common wall that separates our two villas, and got into his pool shack (where the filters, pumps and other assorted pooly gizmos were housed). Everything was shut down in his absence, so it was quite simple to open the sump of his filter, and drop in 5 of the P-50 tablets, quietly seal everything up, and retreat to my own domicile; but not before I unscrew every light bulb which would illuminate the pool. 
 
A couple of days later, Noisy Mc Asswipe arrives home and how about that? It’s dark out and he wants to unwind from a hard couple of days of fucking around out in the desert with a nice relaxing swim. He flips on the filters and pumps (switches are located inside the villa) and evidently goes to change into his swimwear. 

In the meantime, the dye has had a chance to liquefy and the way I figure it, at a pool capacity of 25,000 liters of water, quickly ramped up to about 15,000 ppm. 

At that concentration (it is an organic dye and utterly harmless, well, for the most part), the dye acts exactly like a packet of Rit in the wash machine. Everything carbon-based that goes in the water will be stained a nice, indelible fluorescent green. 

Very chic.

Not bothering with the lack of lights, he dives into the pool and does a few laps before floating around and deciding it was time for a cold one. 

The screams and plaintive wails reverberating around the compound were most satisfying. 

“Hey, asshole, keep it down over there!”

One day, she got to work, and in big capital letters written in white paint marker was the word ""SLUT"" on her brand new $220 welding helmet. She quickly hid it and took it to the back room to scrub the paint off. Luckily, it was fresh enough to come off without seriously damaging the helmet. 

When Steve-O, whom she already suspected, walked out of the break room a few moments later, his guilt was confirmed by his greeting ""How's it goin', slut.""

Now, I'm sure most of you would freak out, cuss, call him names, and probably even hit him, but remember how smart my wife is? She hatched an even better idea. She went to the shop supervisor and told him about the situation. He offered to write up a harassment report, reprimand Steve-O, and the usual. She asked if it was okay if she handled it on her own. A few grins crept their way onto the normally stoic super's face as she detailed her plan. With his blessings, she waited until lunch.

The bell rang for the shop to go to lunch, but one person would be missing from the break room that day. My wife spent her lunch hour spray painting Steve-O's work bench and stool with spray paint. This wasn't ordinary paint either, this was the paint they use on roads. Bright, fluorescent pink and orange that could be spotted from 50 yards with your back turned while wearing sunglasses. 

By the time she was done, it looked like Hasbro and Mattel had a lovemaking session on this desk and forgot to clean up after themselves. The backdrop was a beautiful shade of pink, accented by orange flowers and the word ""PRINCESS"". 

The lunch bell rang again, signaling time to return to work. A crowd gathered around Steve-O's desk, and laughter rang through the shop. Needless to say, Steve-O's nickname isn't Steve-O anymore. He missed the next 3 days of work for some unknown reason, and he's a few short days away from his last at this particular welding shop.

tl;dr I don't think he's going to get a good reference from this place.

edit: Bonus justice! I forgot to mention that Steve-O spent his whole lunch when he got back grinding it off his table. Now the name Princess has stuck permanently. If he'd just laughed it off and came to work in a tiara, then it would've been funny for a week.

Get shut down.,1396,261,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1inc58/mess_with_my_movie_experience_get_shut_down/,"Alright, so a few years ago I'm with my friend at the movies, about to watch Insidious (great horror movie, BTW). 



As the movie begins, we realize roughly 8 or 9 young teens (certainly all too young to be at an R-rated movie without an adult, probably 14 to 16 years old) are seated in the row behind us. This is fine, for a while...



Pretty soon 4 or 5 of them begin talking, laughing, switching seats, and literally just walking around in the theater. This is all just awful because it totally ruins a horror movie experience. I feel bad for the rest of their group, who are clearly trying to enjoy the film, but I'm also annoyed at them for not even asking their friends to settle down or stop being assholes.



At first, I turn around and politely ask them if they could please quiet down. They do for a bit, but it only lasts for a minute or so until they start up again, even louder. 



I'll admit, I have a pretty short fuse, so I turn around and ask them to shut the fuck up. Then a real brave kid tells me to fuck myself. 



You dun fucked up, little man. 



I promptly leave my seat mid-movie, grab a manager, and return to the theater with him. 



""Which ones are the problem, ma'am?"" 



""This entire row"", I say, watching all of their faces drop in disappointment. 



He kicks *every single one of them* out of the theater.



 I finish the movie, walk out of the theater, and notice the whole group of kids are standing outside in the cold, because as I had mentioned earlier, they are pretty young and probably don't have cars or licenses.

As I live one station from the airport I chose a good time and thought it wouldn't be that crowded. I was surprised to find the whole train nearly empty. A few minutes later a guy entered the train with a whole bunch of luggage. There were like 8 huge bags and suitcases and by the sweat on his forehead I could tell it was a heavy load. I offered my help but he would refuse.

He was arranging his luggage so everyone could easily pass by, what took him a good two minutes (credits for that!). As he was finally sitting down in the opposite cabin, the train ran into the next station and I see an elderly lady with a kid entering the coach. The woman approached the guy, pointed to a small sign that said handicapped people only and claimed the seats saying she was handicapped. She started flipping off the guy in a very rude way.
The guy instantly got up, when I chimed in and offered my seat for them. I also pointed at all the unoccupied seats in the coach but the woman wouldn't even look at me and kept claiming the seats. 

I felt sorry for the guy and this time he accepted my offer to help him move the luggage. I was boiling inside and I couldn't believe my eyes when she stood there for a whole minute watching us move the bags instead of sitting down with the kid.

The woman mentioned the airport a few times so I thought it would be their destination. I don't know why I didn't get out when I arrived at my stop but my guts told me I'd miss something and it was maybe my time to shine in a petty revenge... so I stayed for the airport stop and helped this guy bringing all the luggage to the door. When the door opened he jumped out and I passed him one suitcase after another and hell, some of them were pretty heavy. About 3 of the bags were out when I heard the lady nagging behind me...

""Let me out of the train, you're blocking me and my kid"" to which I replied with ""use another door then or wait, old Lady.""
She yelled at me and started pushing me (which makes me fucking furious, I hate people pushing near trains and tracks) but I kept passing the bags to the guy as clumsy as one possibly can and told her to shut up.  I knew the train wouldn't wait forever and when the last bag was out I heard the annoying beep of the doors which indicated the train was about to depart. The kid and I hopped out and the lady was so busy with her rant she didn't notice. She was probably expecting someone miraculousy to show up who says something like ""Yeah, you fucking old lady, I got your back here"". 

The doors shut and once they're shut there's no way back. The train slowly departed and I was in shock, I mean I didn't expect that, I just wanted to delay her getting off the train by acting clumsy... but then I noticed the kid and the luggage guy laughing hard next to me. I started laughing too and the woman in the train was pounding the glass, gasping... and I will never forget her swollen red face of anger and rage, oddly no horror or fear.

We talked to the kid and I took him to a cafe where he called his mom (which wasn't the woman in the train) and she came shortly after to pick him up. The kid told her the story and exaggerated a little too much, casting the care taker in a very negative light and that's basically how this woman lost her job. I'm still in contact with the kid's family as we found out we're actually neighbours.

Fun Fact 1:  The woman was far away from being handicapped, she was just a lazy twat who liked to harrass other people.

Fun Fact 2: I chose the cafe next to the escalator so we could see this 'care taker' to come back with the next train to search for the 10 year old kid she's responsible for. Lady kept no-show. What kind of person does that? 

**TLDR:** Care taker harrasses a guy in a train, gets petty revenged by blocking her way out and ends up departing with the train, while the kid she's in charge of, stays at the airport train station.

Edit: typo and some additional fact at the end.

We decided to get cable, so we packed away anything that might get in the installer's way, including most of my shoes. Being summer, I didn't expect to need boots, but the weather proved otherwise. Luckily, I missed an old pair of boots while packing and didn't have to slog through the rain in wet flats. I also take a 9am course at the local community college.

Story: The morning was going pretty great. I woke up early, breezed through my morning routine, and made it out of the house on time. My mom managed to drop me off at the train station early, which got me to school an hour before class started. I was psyched. I actually had time to go grab breakfast from a nearby donut shop. As I was walking back, I hear someone say ""She needs to toss those boots in the trash."" I turn to see some woman and her friend sitting on a wall.

Now, I knew the boots were old. They were well worn, to the point that the soles were starting to rip. I had basically worn them everyday throughout high school (I'm almost 21 and heading into my 4th year in college). I loved these boots and I wasn't going to let some bitch insult them. So I turned to her stonefaced and said ""These boots were the last gift my friend gave me before she died."" To top it off, I thought of something sad to make my eyes water. She looked horrified and her friend looked down embarrassed. I turned and walked away satisfied.

TL;DR: Some bitch insulted my shoes, so I made her feel like a dick.

I happened to have a spot right in front of the shop and, while there were no other free spaces open anywhere up and down right in front of the shops, the back rows of the parking lot were essentially empty.

Like any good freedom-loving American, I checked to make sure there were no oncoming cars and then I proceeded to back out. From out of thin air, this black low-riding sports car (probably driven by a communist) appears and nearly hits me while I'm 1/3 backed out into the street. I stop hard and pull forward again while the sports car doesn't even decelerate in the slightest.

She only begins to acknowledge my existence when she realizes that ""oh right, I'm here for a parking spot and that guy was about to surrender a prime one."" Well, she's already past me at this point and I've once again begun to reverse out into the street. Well, *guess who decides to almost hit me a second time?* (The answer is Mrs. Stalin.)

Once again, I'm 1/3 out into the road when she reverses back and I have to stop abruptly. And once again I pull forward and she passes me completely. But then she stops. And waits... Now despite being home schooled, I realize what social injustice is happening here and I decide that she doesn't deserve my glorious real estate (even though parking lots are pretty much the ultimate form of socialism, am I right?).

So I hold my foot on the brake and she waits. I wait some more and she waits, too. I look back at her and she puts her turn signal on. I put my car in park and just sit there for a while, pondering life, the universe, and pretty much everything, but mainly I'm just staring at her through my window. She starts to make violent waving hand motions at me from behind the wheel. I suddenly realize I haven't checked Facebook in *minutes* and so I proceed to do so. That was about the time Lady Lenin started to honk at me. And not just honk, but lay on the horn obnoxiously.

Of course at this point no one else in the shopping center has any clue what's happening. They all look to see this Karlita Marx just honking for no particular reason in the middle of the road. And by this point, there's a line of cars piled up behind Fergie Castro (okay, now I'm reaching..) and they all start honking at her. Embarrassed and defeated, Girl Hitler gives up and goes *literally around the corner* to the row behind us and parks, which prompts me to back up and give my spot to the lovely Hispanic family in the suv who were waiting patiently next in line.

You know what it is, you've probably gotten drive-through there at one in the morning while drunk and thoroughly regretted that decision the following morning. This chain, to the unaware, recently implemented their version of ""Happy Hour,"" which just made our already-busy location even busier during what used to be the dead period from 2pm-5pm. I've come to expect the lunch rush to last well into the afternoon, and drive-through customers will normally act accordingly--they'll know what they want, state their order and drive through to get their food in a timely manner so the people behind them can get their food, too.

They pull up to the menu and begin by literally screaming into the microphone. I'm still not sure what they screamed when they got there as blood had already begun pooling in my ear from the unholy screech, but regardless of what it was, it didn't leave a good first impression. They then spend the next three minutes discussing with each other what they want and falling into fits of laughter, while I sit there watching my speed-of-service time creep higher and higher with nothing that could be done.

Finally, they order. The line staff is prepped and ready for the sure onslaught of food these girls will want, given the wait time on the order.

One taco and two small Pepsi's. 

They spent four minutes in the middle of the day, a line forming behind them, to order $4 of food.

They pull up to the window and pay. Their food is delivered and they drive away.

Not only was it policy, but it was a nice thing to do to help your co-workers. 

I had this lazy bitch of a woman working with me one evening. She was the only person who didn't help other servers at all. In fact I think she put more effort into not helping then the actual act of helping would have taken. 

There was another policy at this restaurant where you can't leave until the closing server checks your section and your side duties to make sure they are all done. Now this lazy bitch, Jen, was best friends with the usual closing server, Amy. Jen usually got to leave early without cleaning her section leaving the mess for other servers to clean up before Amy would allow them to leave.

One day I was called in to close the restaurant. It was Amy's birthday and they needed someone to cover her shift that she booked off. I jumped at the opportunity, mainly because it meant more money, but also because I knew Jen was working.

That evening I cut all servers except Jen. I made sure that each of their sections were left messy and their side duties were not done. They were fine with leaving a mess for Jen because she had done it to them so many times. 

When Jen's last table left she came and asked me to sign her out. I checked and every section was still an absolute mess, including hers, and none of her side-duties were done. I told her that needed to change before she could leave, and she whined about needing to leave soon so she could make it to Amy's party. I shrugged in the same non-caring way she had so many times and told her that she better hurry up then. 

She rushed and did a half-ass job of everything. I checked it with a fine tooth comb and made her re-do it. Again, she did a half-ass job so I made her re-do it. Then a third time it still was pretty bad, so I explained that she is just wasting her time by doing it half-ass. Finally after the fourth time she was done. I let her leave, but it took her three hours to do that and she missed the better part of the party.

The next day I showed up to my normal non-close shift and noticed I was listed as the closer. The manager said the place was so much cleaner than when Amy does it so they were going to bump me up to the closing server position and try it out for awhile.

That night I did the same thing where I allowed servers to leave without doing their cleaning so that Amy would be stuck with it. She bitched, but I played stupid to whole ordeal and made her stay very late doing a thorough cleaning. I did this day after day to both Jen and Amy - whoever was scheduled to be there later.

Finally, one of them complained. The manager told me they complained and said ""I understand exactly why you're doing that and they deserve it"". After about a month of that they both quit. The managers were not disappointed and the other servers were happy. We went back to being a very helpful group that never stuck each other with someone's elses work. 

**TL;DR:** Two lazy bitches used their impromptu power to screw over other staff, I returned the favor until they quit. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1cxasb,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1cxasb/server_etiquette_is_actually_your_job/,

I was fourteen during November of my freshman year of high school. I had been grounded a few days before by my mother, so I was surprised when she gave me the phone after I got off the bus.

Mom- Call Mandy.

Me- I thought I was grounded...

Mom- Call Mandy.

My best friend Mandy and I went to different high schools, so she would get home before me which is why I missed her call. I called her and she was crying. She told me her parents were getting divorced. She had been talking about how for the last few weeks the piano tuner from their church had been coming by a lot lately to ""tune their piano"", but Mandy had caught his hand on her mom's leg once while they were talking at the table. Mandy's dad found out she had been cheating and asked for a divorce. 

Luckily it was a Friday, so I asked my mom if I could sleep over there. Her mother was moving out the next morning and Piano Tuner was going to be helping her. Mandy wanted to stay at her house while they moved out because her dad would be out on business, and she wanted to be sure her mom and Piano Tuner didn't take anything that wasn't their's. I figured she needed all the help and support she could get. 

Whenever we had sleepovers we would bake a cake, cookies, cupcakes, or whatever we had on hand. We woke up early and decided to make cinnamon streusel [muffins](http://d3w5aos35qel1w.cloudfront.net/img/cinnamon-streusel-muffins-main.jpg) for breakfast. 

We were mixing our second batch when one of Mandy's dogs leaped up and snagged two muffins. We didn't want him getting sick, and he knew how to get in the trash if he wanted to so we put the two muffins on a separate plate so we would know which ones had been slobbered on.

This entire time Piano Tuner and Mandy's mom were walking through the house to bring her stuff to the car. We went back to distracting ourselves from them. Then, both of us saw in our peripheral vision Piano Tuner snagging a muffin and walking away triumphantly. After he left the house, we checked and it was a slobbery muffin that he took. We were in a fit of giggles. We poured the rest of the batch into the muffin tin and we tried not to laugh as he took another on his way back in. We checked again and he took the other slobbery muffin. At that point, we couldn't stop laughing. 

As he was leaving, he had the audacity to ask us why we were laughing. We said it was nothing and put more muffins in the oven.

So I used to work at one of those large retail home-improvement stores as a cashier, and one day I messed up pretty bad. On this one super busy Saturday I had been assigned to be at the customer service desk, and since I was fairly new I wasn’t exactly sure what to do when an angry or suspicious customer came up to the desk. Usually when you suspect people of trying to return stolen merchandise you would call over your manager and they would tell the customer that we weren’t going to take those items back. However on this fateful Saturday, I found myself in that situation and I panicked.

**THE ACT**
I had been doing well with no hiccups at the customer service desk, and I was getting the hang of all the duties. There had just been a rush of customers, and my area around my register was quite messy. I was trying to organize everything before another wave of people came in. That’s when this very large, ghetto, and overall unpleasant lady came around the corner with a cart filled with the largest and most expensive cans of wood stain that we sold. My suspicions were already up since she came around the wrong way and not through the front entrance. She makes eye contact with me, and slowly lugs her heavy cart up to my register. Now this bitch then starts to tell me this bullshit story about how she had left over stain from a project and that she didn’t have a receipt, but she would gladly give me her drivers license and take a store credit. At this point I tell her I need to call a manager to get an override for a return of that amount, but when I try to call their phone they wouldn’t answer. I called one of the head cashiers next (the head cashiers were basically glorified cashiers who told people to go to their lunches and breaks) and told him I have to get an override for a return over $100. He simply replied, “Ok I’ll be right there” and hung up. Now this ghetto bitch starts to get all flustered and tells me I need to hurry up. I scan all of the stain in her cart and the total came out to be $636.48, but in order for me to put in on a merchandise card I had to get that override from my head cashier. He came around the corner looking rushed and held out his card for me to scan, I tried to signal to him that this lady was suspicious-as-fuck, but surprisingly he didn’t catch my subtle gestures (I opened my eyes wide and raised my eyebrows). I was too worried about insulting this bitch so I didn’t say anything. I got the override and gave her the merchandise card and she quickly left.

**MY REVENGE**
As soon as she got out of the doors, I called the paint department and asked them to check how many cans of that stain they had on hand. Sure enough they had less than what our inventory now said. I double-checked and asked the associates back there if they had seen anyone take any of the stain off the shelf earlier that day. They confirmed my suspicions. That bitch had taken them off of the shelves and returned them. I was pretty upset; I was thinking I was going to get written up for the first time for making such stupid mistake. Feeling defeated, I went back to cleaning up my area as I wait for a manager to come by so I can tell them of what just happened. Then, by some random happenstance, I looked down next to my register by the phone and see a lone merchandise card. The cards are usually in a pile on top of my register so I pick this one up and look at the back to see if it had been used. Sure enough the security code had been peeled off, which meant it had been activated. My heart started racing, I grabbed the card and went to check the system to see if that was the card I put the return on. I swiped the card and up on the screen pops, “Remaining Balance: $636.48”. Somehow I had grabbed an empty merchandise card on accident and gave that to the ghetto bitch. I gleefully go to the purchase screen and ring up the same items and used the card and re-bought the stain so our store sustained no loss. My day went on and I had no other problems, until the same ghetto bitch comes storming up to my register again. This time she looked livid as hell and started yelling at me with vengeance. Apparently she had tried to buy some top line power drills with her card, but somehow there was nothing on it. I was thrilled I had the chance to get a redo with this bitch, and so I made sure I wasn’t going to screw this one up. I look at her dead in the eyes and make up the best bullshit story I could think of at the time. “Ma’am, after you had left we checked the security cameras and it seemed that you had taken those items off of the shelf and never paid for them in the first place. We were able to call the credit center and take back the money that you stole. We have all of your driver’s license info and you won’t be able to do any more returns with any of our stores without the Loss Prevention being notified.” At this point she screamed at me “YOU DID WHAT?!” then she turned around and stormed out of the store huffing loudly to herself. 

**FURTHER JUSTICE**
I told my manager about it and he couldn’t help but laugh and commended me on not fucking up any further. He called our sister stores around the area and told them about a potential shoplifter that may come in (they always do that when there’s someone trying to steal a lot of merchandise). And the next day when I arrived at work, I was informed that the same lady tried to push out a cart with several hundred dollars worth of stuff from one of our sister stores, and was promptly arrested because they knew she was going to try something like that. I hate shoplifters and I’m glad she got what she deserved.

This is gonna be a long ride!

So I was working one of those big bike stores. You know, with tons of bike stuff, and a full service counter? I was an assembler and a jr mechanic at times (I was never good as the two older guys who worked there). Well, it was nearing the end of the day and the two older guys had left a bit early because they had finished all the big projects that day. I was left with some easy stuff (wheel changes, trip computer installation, and a few final builds to have out on the floor.

A guy comes in (Forshadowing!) and asks how much it would be to put on a seat and a handlebar on his bike. We, of course had our prices on a giant board, but most people don't look anyways, so I told him it would be around $20. He didn't seem very happy, but said that was ok. He says he will go get the bike out of his car.

What he brought in was a bike in a box. As in completely unassembled.

Me ""sir, this bike is in a box...""

Old Cranky Bastard (OCB) "" and?""

Me 'Sir, this is more than putting a seat and handlebars on a bike...""

OCB "" well, the wheels, but I was expecting you to do that for free"" (just the wheels would be a $5 service charge in itself...)

Me ""Well, sir, as you can see on our price board, a full assembly is $120...""

OCB ""WHAT?! That is NOT the price you quoted me!"" (What is this, an insurance company?!)

Me ""Sir, you told be it was just a seat and a handlebar. For a full assembly, we have to connect everything, make sure it all is in working order, and perform our safety check""

OCB ""I don't want any of that shit. Just put it fucking together.""

Me ""I am sorry, but I will have to charge you $120 for that. I can't bend the rules with the saftey checks""

OCB ""WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!""

Me ""he is at the front desk""

Now, this manager was a nice guy, not really a pushover or anything, but would tend to side with the customers on most things. He was pretty good at finding a compromise, however.

A few miniuets later, the manager walks back and says ""why are you trying to charge 120 for a seat and handlebars?"" It's important to note that he sounded more confused as to why I was doing this than angry. I just pointed to the bike. In an old Peugeot box. Manager walks right back to the customer (who had stayed in the front). I don't go up there because I don't want to deal with this guy.

After a few minuets of yelling and grumbling, manager and the guy comes back. Manager says to assemble Thea bike, and we will give him a $20 discount to make the price 100. Now, I am not really happy that we had to cater to this guy, but I don't sign the checks. Doesn't really matter too much to me how much we make off of him. He still looks pissed however.

So, I get to work on this ancient Peugeot bike. I am super happy the screws and everything were in a little bag, because they were all older types we don't really carry (This is important). Anyways, after working on this bike for around 40 minuets, the guy storms back in and asks if we are finished yet.

Of course we aren't!

He then starts screaming at us to take it all apart, he found a different store that would do it all for 15 dollars. Then comes screaming, allegations of ripping him off, telling us that we are just wage monkeys (he actually said that haha).

My manager is pissed at this point and just wants him out. So he tells me to rip it apart and shoves it back in the box.

Which is exactly what I did. I took this thing apart in the most heinous way possible, shoving everything into the box. They guy had gone back out to his car to wait on us to take it apart. I was pissed at this dude for wasting my time. Manager was pissed for the lost time and money. Other employee was pissed because they guy was an assjack.

So, every fifth screw I took off disappeared into the garbage. Whoops. Looks like he will have to pay extra for specialty screws. I started to feel a little bad about it. Until I took the box out to his car. He told me I wouldn't amount to much and I just just serve burgers or something. He. Actually. Told. Me. That.

The icing on the cake was a phone call we got e next day from said other store. Apparently, he was saying that we would do it for less than them and they were flabbergasted.

Guess what he had told them?

That he had just wanted a seat and handlebars put on.

TL;DR: we find the magical world of Narnia in the back room. Mr. Tubkins gets shot with a spear gun.

When I was growing up, I got sick a lot. Constant headaches, several episodes a year of vomiting for days, got a cold every time it was going around, etc. After a few years of this, I grew to learn and recognize the feelings that preceded getting sick, or how to tell if a certain taste/smell/sensation would make me feel better or worse.

When I was in elementary school, I was home feeling sick. My mom was irritated, she didn't want to deal with me moping around and whining pathetically. I was feeling nauseous and *really* didn't want to throw up. She kept telling me to take some Pepto Bismol since it would make me feel better. Being someone who had taken a lot of it in the past, I could vividly imagine the taste and texture of both the liquid and the chewables and I *knew* it would make me puke. She kept insisting, I kept refusing. Eventually, she decided to force her hand. I don't think she poured any down my throat, but I think she yelled and intimidated my small self into taking some and loomed over me to make sure I finished all of it.

Now, something I haven't mentioned is that just a few days earlier she had paid to have all of our white carpets in the house professionally cleaned. This was a fairly big undertaking, and took some time and money.

Almost right away after being forced to ingest Pepto Bismol, I knew. *Vomiting was going to happen.* I ran. I honestly tried to make it to the bathroom, or at least to a trash can along the way. Instead, I only made it as far as the hallway right outside of my mom's bedroom door. Hot pink vomit poured out of me, all over the freshly cleaned white carpet. Hot pink vomit, right outside her bedroom. 

You know that feeling, right after you throw up, where for a brief moment all you feel is that fantastic sensation of absolute relief? I experienced that times ten, for it was layered on top of the sweet feeling of vindication, of knowing that I was *right.* I *told* her it would make me throw up, but did she listen?

Without getting overly specific, I market our material to agencies, manage our media, do some HTML5 coding and do graphic design work. We are a small company and I am the resident tech person, so I am a jack of all trades. Over the years I have grown to dislike the people that I work with immensely. They have: 

Stolen my food (I am gluten intolerant so I make the effort to make my own food...and people go through my lunch and eat it anyway), stolen my tupperwear, they are completely inconsiderate with my time, they are condescending and I am routinely taken for granted. I have gotten verbally assaulted more times than I can count and I am severely underpaid. I can't even use them as a reference for future jobs because I simply can't trust them - the person that had my position before me used my boss as a reference (and my boss agreed to give him a good recommendation), and I heard my boss trashing my predecesor to a potential employer over the phone. Super classy.

I am quitting this terrible job to go back to school. When they hired my replacement, they got someone as cheaply as they could, and the person they chose didn't have any background in any kind of graphic design/media/web. They think so little of my job that they didn't think my replacement needed any experience whatsoever.

Anyway, training this new guy has been an absolute trainwreck. In 5 days he's nearly destroyed our website and he sent defective media to a sales rep and made a fool of her in a large meeting. At this point I assumed that I'd train my replacement and say goodbye to this company for good with minimal drama - they selected someone without a proper background, they can deal with it. 

Last week had been busy since we have clients in, and I brought my personal computer in to help with the load, since my replacement has been on my company computer to 'learn the ropes'. I have brought my personal computer in before when we have been in a squeeze, and I have been compensated ($10 a day, nothing crazy). I brought up compensation this time around, and my boss gets in my face, and says, ""I didn't realize your computer came with a fee. I thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement.""

I had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement, since we had been working in entirely different offices. My boss had even requested that I set up multiple webpages on my personal computer during this time. He was playing dumb and lying to my face.

I didn't say anything because I knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment wouldn't be constructive. However, I did think, ""You have made a HUGE mistake."" 

I didn't bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement. I was working in the respect that I was going over things that my replacement didn't understand (which was a lot, lol), but I wasn't able to work independently since my replacement and myself were sharing one machine.
At one point my boss asked me why a project that he gave me wasn't done, and I said, ""Well, since I am sharing a computer with my replacement, and he's been really busy with the clients, I haven't had a chance to get to it."" My boss looked unhappy but was unable to admit his mistake - and by the time he realized the extent of his mistake, it was too late. 

Since I wasn't there to shoulder the workload, the under-experienced replacement floundered, the entire company looked incompetent and we lost future jobs with the clients (there were two clients, which equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost) that we had in our office. I watched the world burn. This past week was my last week, and this was a sweet way to go out. 

TLDR: I bring in my personal computer to help make a busy week more manageable, my boss refused to offer the most minimal of compensation, so I don't bring my computer in anymore and watch all hell break loose.

I'm pretty vindictive, but in true Canadian form I'm also pretty passive aggressive. This usually leads to lots of petty revenge. 

This story though, is by far my best revenge. It's long, but it's a good payoff. 

When I was 17, I moved across the country with my then boyfriend (now husband). I was pretty psyched when I got a job at A&amp;W because it was my first real job and the pay was really good (great compared to my former province, shit compared to the pay scale in this province). I was working day shift and my manager told me it was very important to keep my own record of my hours because the computers didn't work to login. 

After getting my first paycheque and being short 8 hours I realized why it was so important. But the owner assured me the hours would be on my next cheque. 

I had worked there for about 2 months before being promoted to evening manager, with a fairly substantial raise of about $4/ph. I was still owed about 24 hours of pay. Technically my boss always put my missing hours on the next cheque, but then I would be missing even more hours from the current pay period. 

Things started getting really shitty. Some of our kitchen staff quit and instead of replacing them he just moved around the 3 remaining kitchen staff so that we only had one person in the kitchen per shift. We were also really short on staff so I ended up working the counters in the mornings (7-10) alone and then coming in for my regular evening shift (3-11). Apparently my raise was only in name because my last 2 paycheques had my former salary on them, my boss assured me that it would be on the next cheque. 

Then came stampede. For those of you who aren't familiar with the Calgary stampede, it's the biggest event in the city. It's a week long rodeo and festival where thousands of people flood the city, drunk and wearing cowboy hats. Our A&amp;W was right downtown so needless to say it was a very busy week. We still only had one kitchen staff and me working the morning shift, the day manager came in early to help with the counter and we tried all the staff to see if we could get extra bodies but only one staff came in. 

Breakfast was a nightmare. A&amp;W breakfasts are real breakfast made to order, eggs, bacon, French toast, none of it premade and there was no time to premake it anyway because the store was packed pretty much round the clock, so with 1 person full time in back and one floater it was taking 8+ minutes per breakfast and the store was lined to the doors and the drive through lined up right into the street. We called the owner and told him he needed to come in right now because we needed him and his wife to help us. We were drowning in angry customers. 

30 minutes pass and we call him again. ""I'll be there right away"" is his famous line. Another 30 minutes and he's not here, we call his house and get VM so we assume he is on his way. This is great because he doesn't live far so he should be here in 10 minutes at the latest. 

It's now 10am, 2 hours since we first called and no answer on his house phone or his cell. We've had lots of people walk out, we've had people demand refunds and leave but the store is still packed and there is still an hour left on breakfast, but we haven't had a chance to prep lunch, not even cut up the veggies for burgers so we were still fucked come lunch. 

I look at the day manager and said fuck it, I quit. He says ""you know what, fuck this I quit too"". We call the boss again and leave a message on both lines telling him we quit (along with 2 other staff, the only one that doesn't is the 1 kitchen staff) and we will stay for another 30 minutes to give him time to get here but then we are walking out. 

30 minutes pass and no word from the owner. We lock the doors and tell the customers in the store that their breakfast is free since they all have been waiting for so long and we are closing the store once all of them are served, but they have to take their meals to go. 

We serve at lease 50 free breakfasts (at around $10 a piece) once the store is empty we do our cash out, the other manager and I look at the previous schedules to confirm what hours the 2 employees are still owed and gave them the cash out of the cash out, took our hours owed (including my raise) and left a receipt in the cash out with our signatures detailing where the money went, but the cash out in the safe and left. People were still coming in the drive through and trying to get in he door, confused to why the store would be closed in the middle of the day during stampede. 

I didn't get a call until 2 hours later (after the lunch rush) from my former boss claiming we owed him all the money he lost while the store was closed/for the free breakfasts. I told him he was well informed about what was going to happen, we knew he got the message because we had filled his inbox and couldn't leave any messages but when we called to tell him he store was closed the inbox was no longer full. He shouldn't have tried to call our bluff because we weren't bluffing. 

Not only did we make sure that some of the staff actually got paid what they were owe (costing hundreds) but he probably lost out on $15,000 worth of sales or more from the store being closed for 3 hours and missing the lunch rush (which on a normal day brought in about $5G but during stampede could easily bring in $10,000). 

This being Calgary in 2006, I got another job the next day. Working as a secretary at Parks Canada making $17/ph and never having to deal with cheap bosses or angry customers again.

Thinking nothing of it, I continued my on with my night.  

The next day, I find out from a female friend why I had been getting all these calls. I had told her in the past that if a guy was ever creepy towards her and asked for her number to just give him mine and I'd deal with him.  

She was in a bar with a friend, just enjoying themselves and having a few drinks. This guy comes up to her and starts hitting on her. Immediately comes across as sleazy and arrogant. He's making her and her friend so uncomfortable they decide to leave. They're on the third floor and it's packed, so it takes them a good ten minutes to worm their way through the crowd and down all the stairs. Douchebag follows them the entire way, while the girls try to ignore him.  

They get outside and he starts following them up the road. They're getting a little worried and it's at this point he confirms their suspicions by yelling out ""it's girls like you are the reason girls get raped.""  

So they're pretty fucking scared at this point and don't know what to do so they both stop. They're in a crowded area so they'll be safer there than if they keep walking. He catches up to them, they start chatting and defuse the situation. He asks for one of the girls numbers. Not wanting to give it to him, she gives him mine instead.  

He then CALLS HER PHONE and DEMANDS TO CHECK IT to make sure it's ringing and she didn't give him a fake number. Somehow, she convinces him it was right.  

After hearing this story, and realising he thought my number was my friends, I decided to have a bit of fun with him. Throughout the week I sent him text messages pretending to be my friend. Apologising for being standoffish as I wasn't feeling well that night and yes I would love to see him again. With the help of my female friend who he threatened we led him on majorly throughout the week

For context, he lived two hours away and was only in town for a special ocassion that night.  

I somehow managed to convince this guy to get on a train for two hours, book a hotel in the hopes of getting laid and come meet me in a bar at a 9pm.  

9pm roles around and I'm chilling in a bar down the road with some friends having a few drinks, female friend was there with me, waiting to see what happened.  

He texts me that he's there at 9pm. I let him stew for half an hour, all while receiving texts and calls that I obviously didn't answer. I send him one brief text that I'm running late and that I'll be there soon. It placates him for a while. We manage to keep him there until 11pm, alone in this bar. It's at this point we do the big reveal. I send him a message saying (from memory) ""This isn't (female friend). This is her guy friend. Don't ever threaten to rape my friend or anyone else ever again. If I hear about you doing anything like that again I'll go straight to the police. Consider tonight a lesson.""  

As you can guess, he went APESHIT. Dozens of calls (which went unanswered) and abusive messages. The best ones were when he threatened to have his ""cop buddy"" arrest me for some made up reason.  

My group of friends all thought this was hilarious. In the end, we got his hopes up for a week and made him waste hundreds of dollars.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1367668659.0,,,True,t3_1do4s7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1do4s7/dont_threaten_to_rape_my_friend/,

Several years ago a major hurricane blew through my hometown and the government issued a damage repair to all houses effected by the storm after evaluation through insurance companies (something to that extent).  Construction contractors took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services.  Contractors get money, everyone gets free repairs, why not?  Whole neighborhoods signed on and work began.

My parents were getting their home repaired and after a time realized the amount they were quoted for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the repairs AND replace all the shutters and window framing for the same price.  While on the phone with the contractor, he tells them they're willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original contractors.

After many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect, except they didn't replace the shutters and window framing.  My father withholds the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract, but refuse to do it because they didn't write up the new contract for my dad to sign so they're not obligated to do it yet wanted our money.  This devolved into arguments with them threatening to sue us.

A couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but discounted amount to do the shutters and framing.  They come back and finish the work.

When the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check.  They realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed.  They get pissed.  My mother snarkily replies to them that since they didn't sign a revised contract she was not obligated to pay them the extra amount.  They left without much of a fight.

It's a two family house and my landlord is an ok guy but can be a dick about things. When we first moved there, we weren't allowed any pets and could not park in the driveway. I understand you don't want animals ruining the house and what not, but his reasoning was his 30 year old son is ""allergic"" to cats and dogs, he lived in the basement we live on the top floor. There is no way he would even be affected by any of the animals, but your house your rules. We also weren't allowed to park in the driveway, a bit of an annoyance because when we first moved in the landlord said it would not be a problem. My mother being a single mom raising two kids didn't have a car at the time so that wasn't much of an issue for us.

 Fast forward a couple of years and we get a car but can't use the driveway. My mother tells him he promised we could and the landlord says he never said that and we can't use it. The rent goes up during the years and my mother speaks with him again and he says ok sure you can use it, as long as it doesn't affect my daily routine. My mother is out of the house by 6am every morning, and he is a retired old man who usually does work around the house and will walk to the grocery store etc. So it never messed up his routine. 

A few months ago he tells us he we can't park in the driveway anymore because his sons need to go in and out and it's an inconvenience to them. They usually block the driveway do what they must and leave. So I didn't understand what the issue was. 

One of his 4 sons lives in Greece and has come to visit for about 3-4 months. My landlord being an old man does not have use for the internet and most likely doesn't know what it is, but his son would like to check his e-mails,skype his family,probably jerk off, in general use his computer. In order to do that you need wi-fi, unfortunately for him I'm the only one who has the wi-fi password ( my mom and sister just ask me whenever they need help with computer stuff, including setting up the wi-fi for their laptops.) The son asks my mother and sister and they both say ""you must speak to ashinkusher17 about that he's the only one who knows it."" A couple weeks go by and we see each other going in and out of the house and finally he asks me for the password, along with the douchey ""allergic to all fucking animals"" brother.  

Finally I get my revenge. And I refuse to use allow them access to my precious wi-fi because "" I don't feel comfortable letting others use it because of the risks to personal information and viruses blah blah blah"" plus I pay for it why the hell should they get to use it for free. The look on their faces was priceless. They were so angry but couldn't do a damn thing  about it.

The industry as a whole and company in particular were sinking fast, and although there were a lot of cool, talented, nice people working there, the upper management were bullies and the environment was just toxic.

In my job, as a low-level assistant, I had to interact a lot with our accountant, who was also the de facto HR guy. Although he kept to himself a lot, in the course of our many emails about vendor payments everyday, we discovered that we shared a taste for dark, absurdist humor. Our daily, existentialist emails about accounting glitches and payrolls and the general sadness of our company became, for me anyway, bright spots in a grey workworld.

Because he was also HR, he knew that I made a minuscule amount of money and was kept just below fulltime so that I couldn't get healthcare. I also didn't get any paid vacation.

Eventually he left for greener pastures and my days were a lot sadder because his replacement had no sense of humor. Then, I got an exciting new job! After a week, the exciting new job went down in flames and I had to contemplate going back to the sad place (they really wanted me back).

Then my last paycheck from them arrived. A month's wages for one week of work. When I looked at the breakdown, I got paid out for several weeks of vacation days--days that I absolutely did not have. Before leaving, my HR friend had booby-trapped my account to essentially give me a severance package when I left. The company was such a chaotic mess that no one ever noticed or cared.

It was enough money to live on while I looked for a better gig, and because of him I didn't have to go back to the bad place.

There are two areas, one specifically for ages 3 and under, and the other for all ages.  We were pretty overwhelmed by the number of kids at the all-ages side, so we went to the toddler area for some slightly calmer bouncy fun.  

There are only two small bounce houses in the toddler area, and when we walked in there were three young women (late teens/early twenties) laying in one of them, taking up nearly half of the bouncing area, staring at their phones and generally being in the way.  Being mostly non-confrontational, I stayed my tongue as my daughter bounced around, oblivious to the douchery as she played in the unoccupied half of the inflatable.  

Then the most glorious thing happened... in order to make use of the entire area that was available, she decided to just bounce on these inconsiderate bitches.  She was happily jumping all around them, on top of them, grabbing their faces for support, all those things that toddlers like to do.  She let them know that they were in HER bouncing zone, and if they didn't like it, fuck it, she was bouncing anyway.

When I was 15/16 I worked at a local video rental place. It was privately owned and was bootleg as hell - pretty sure the owner used it as a front for something shady, but that's neither here nor there. The boss was too cheap to pay more than one person per shift, so I had the slow Wed/Thurs night shifts all to myself. We were in this wiiicked rich, yuppy town (Concord MA) and 90% of our business consisted of local soccer moms bringing their kids in for a movie night. Most of these women were terrible people - overlords to their spoiled flock who would throw credit cards around without thinking twice and would condescend everyone they deemed ""beneath"" them.

We had a very basic computer system at the time, and there was a built-in function that wouldn't allow someone to rent another movie if they had over $10 of late fees on their account. The employees had the ability to overwrite this, at their discretion, or to lower the fees if they thought it appropriate. Generally speaking, I was the guy who would waive any &amp; all late fees - reason being that my boss was a cheap fuck, and I didn't worry at all about making money for him... if the customer was nice to me I'd waive their fees, no questions asked. Anyway... One day this woman comes in with a bunch of kids, if I remember correctly it was 5-6 roughly 12-13 year old boys. The kids were running around, pulling things off the shelves, making lots of noise, punching each other, pissing off other customers, and pissing me off as well. The woman didn't do shit about it, she sat there gossiping on her cellphone not caring about the scene her kids were causing. Being a fairly timid &amp; non-confrontational person by nature I didn't say anything, and just figured I'd clean up the mess when they left.

So the woman finally comes up to the counter with like 8 different movies, a few video games and a bunch of candy. She's standing there on the phone still, shoves the stuff at me across the counter and doesn't even acknowledge my presence. So I look up her account.... Boom. $120 worth of late fees and four titles rented for 6+ months and still not returned. So I tried getting her attention, saying something like ""excuse me, ma'am...ma'am?"" while her back is turned. She gestures me off. So I stand there and do nothing, waiting. She finally hangs up a minute or so later, turns to me and says something snarky like ""well what's taking so long??""

So I explain, ""ma'am you have a very outstanding fee on your account and I can't let you rent any more movies until this is paid and the missing movies are returned"". She flips a shit. Starts ranting that her daughter rents things in her name, never returns anything, doesn't pay fees, and that she herself has done no wrong and the fees should be cleared and she should be able to rent etc etc. I nod but say, ""this account still owes $120 and I can't allow you to rent until it's paid. Company policy ma'am, I'm sorry but I don't make the rules.""

She starts going off again, saying ridiculous things like ""I know the owner he'll wipe out the debt in a heartbeat you'd better let me rent or I'll complain to him about how terrible his employees are and you'll be *fired*"" etc etc. I tell her he's out of the country (which was true) and can't be reached (not true), and she still owes $120 (getting truer by the second). She bitches some more and finally pulls out the card. We had this ancient machine that, for reasons unknown to me, would only read a magnetic strip correctly if you wrapped the card in a plastic grocery bag. I couldn't explain to you why, but it was the only way the damn thing worked.

So, as you can probably guess, I ran the card with no plastic wrap. Denied. Tried it again just for looks... Denied. I printed out a receipt, and asked if she had cash. She didn't, and she was ripshit about the card. I showed her the receipt saying ""Card Not Accepted"" and feigned indifference. She asked (er, violently demanded) that she speak to a manager. I happily informed her that I was the manager on duty and was indeed the only employee in the store. She stormed out and walked across the street to the bank... came back a few minutes later with the money and practically threw it at me. I took the payment.... and said ""now, about those overdue movies... I don't suppose your daughter would like to return them for you so you can rent these movies?"" I got the worst death glare I think I've ever received (and my mother can practically shoot lasers from her eyes) and the woman abandoned her stack of movies and stomped out. Not sure if we ever saw her again but at the time 15 year old me was so proud of myself for staying cool under pressure and fucking with this woman.

1363211308.0,1035,self.pettyrevenge,1a8ryh,Take away a day of my honeymoon? I'll make you buy everyone breakfast. (long but good),1306,271,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1a8ryh/take_away_a_day_of_my_honeymoon_ill_make_you_buy/,"I got married a couple of years ago, and we booked a 5 night stay at a great resort in Jamaica for our honeymoon. We flew out of St. Louis the day after the wedding, change planes in Atlanta, and then on to Jamaica. Or at least, that was what was supposed to happen.

**The Beginning**

For some reason, Delta Airlines was entirely unable to figure out how to get an airplane from St. Louis to Atlanta. There were three or four flights that afternoon and every single one of them was delayed, all for mechanical reasons. By the time we got to Atlanta, the last flight to Jamaica for the day had already left, so we had to spend the first night of our honeymoon in a Best Western instead of the all inclusive resort I had shelled out for.

**The Complaint**

Since we're on our honeymoon, we decide that we'd like to sit down and have an actual meal in the airport instead of just grabbing a sandwich, so we went to the only actual sit-down restaurant in the unsecured area of the airport (it was one of those TGI Friday's/Applebee's knock offs). We get a table, and then I actually take a good look at the meal vouchers the airline gave us. Two vouchers, each worth $6, for a total of $12 for the two of us. The cheapest thing on the menu at the restaurant was $10.

So I was mad. Instead of being on a tropical beach with my new bride, I was stuck in the airport in Atlanta, and the airline wouldn't even buy us a decent meal. So I went back to the ticket counter to complain. I wasn't rude, I wasn't obnoxious, but I was forceful. I told the attendant that the vouchers weren't even worth enough to buy a plate of nachos, and asked him what they could do about it. The attendant looked sympathetic, and told me he would go talk to his supervisor to see what he could do.

**Victory 1**

So I waited. He was gone for almost 15 minutes. I was starting to think that he had either forgotten about me or was avoiding dealing with me, when he came back with something in his hand. First, he gave me two travel vouchers worth $100 each for future Delta flights. Then, he handed me a whole *stack* of meal vouchers, 25 of them, each worth $6. I thanked the man profusely for his help and returned to the restaurant feeling victorious.

**Victory 2**

Meanwhile, my wife had been chatting with the waiter in the restaurant and told him about the delay in our travels and how disappointed she was (she had never left the US before, so flying to Jamaica was a pretty big deal even without the honeymoon). I returned, we ordered and ate, and then gave the vouchers to the waiter to settle the check. When he returned he told us that in addition to the food, he had gone ahead and put our drinks on the vouchers as well, which he wasn't really supposed to do. So the entire meal plus drinks was free. I gave him a *really* good tip (cash, of course, not vouchers).

**The Revenge**

So at some point I started reading the vouchers carefully. I'm not a lawyer but I am pretty good at understanding legalese, and I made two discoveries. First, the vouchers expired in three days, so if we didn't use them before we took off in the morning, we wouldn't be able to use them at all. Second, nowhere on the vouchers did it say ""non-transferable"".

When we got to the airport in the morning, we got ourselves some coffee and muffins. After we ate, we still had 10 or 12 of the vouchers left. So I started handing them out. I'd go up to people, ask them if they'd had anything to eat yet today, and if they said no, I handed them a voucher and told them to, ""Go buy breakfast, Delta's paying."" If they had kids, I gave them 2. I kept at it until I was out of vouchers.

**Post Script**

On the way back to the US from Jamaica, I attempted to use the travel vouchers to upgrade us to First Class. The woman at the counter had to call the airline office in order to redeem the vouchers, but she was unable to get through to them. She upgraded us anyway because ""we had attempted to pay for it"", and let us keep the vouchers.

I'm a girl, not very good, but it's hella fun so I've been playing a lot recently. Gotten a bit better though, my K/D ratio is around 1.0 so hey, I'm happy if I break even.

I was playing a Gun Game for the first time and as soon as I first said something on the mic and my female voice is heard, this guy (Asshole) immediately lays into me, calling me a ""dirty cunt,"" ""loose pussy"", and reminding me to get back to the kitchen, but not before sucking his cock.

What a douchey loser. I'm just trying to play games and have a good time. However, I did not reply to his shit talk.

I mute the mic and hand the controller to my nephew, who is quite good. And Gun Game is his jam. I suggest we fuck this Asshole guy up a little, and my nephew is all for it. I stay on the mic. Every man for himself, my nephew won the game, led the lobby in kills, and had the highest K/D ratio. Asshole goes off again, talking shit, saying I couldn't do it again. 

I turn on the mic and then say, ""Okay, let's do this again.""

Asshole talks shit non-stop the entire game. I do not say a word. Again, my nephew tops the lobby and wins. Asshole then calls me a cheating whore, etc. etc. Do it again.

""Okay, let's do this again.""

More non-stop shit talk. My nephew beats him a third time. More shit talk. I sigh into the mic. ""*Again?* Okay.""

After beating him a fourth time, Asshole is angry. Others in the lobby are telling him to shut up at this point, but he won't. He's going to run this into the ground.

""Hey OP, you couldn't fucking beat me in one-on-one.""

""Okay,"" I say. I haven't said much of anything at this point, and it's pissing him off that I'm not replying. I don't need to reply, the score does the shittalking for me.

We get into a one-on-one game and again, my nephew beats him.

1368124921.0,1022,self.pettyrevenge,1e0mkg,And this is why you do not reward bad behavior.,1224,202,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1e0mkg/and_this_is_why_you_do_not_reward_bad_behavior/,"Was just reminded of this and thought it belonged here: 

So a while ago, I'm working at the front desk of a hotel. It's a couple hours before check-in, but people check in early all the time. If we happen to have a clean room, we'll get you in there; if not, we get all your info, take your luggage, and give you a call as soon as your room is ready. 

So on this day, we had a convention in. Convention people generally get in early, drop off their luggage, go to the convention and grab the keys for their room when the day ends, around 5. Not this woman. She'd tried to check in at 10 am, got annoyed that her room wasn't ready, and then proceeded to check back once or twice an hour. Each time she asked, myself or my co-worker would tell her, ""We'll call you when it's ready."" 

She comes up AGAIN, her 10th or so visit to the front desk, says, ""There has to be ONE clean room by now,"" and at this point I was willing to bend my ""don't reward bad behavior"" policy and upgrade her into whatever room was available just to get her out of my face. We had oversold the convention rate rooms by a few rooms anyway (low floor, views blocked by other buildings, usually not as quiet because of street noises) so we were going to have to upgrade a couple of people anyway, so I thought: fuck it. She's huffing and puffing about how long she's waited and SURELY there is a clean room by now, and I check the computer. There is fabulous corner room (a bit bigger with massive windows on two side) on a high floor with a spectacular view. It's one of our coveted rooms, but it's available and I'll turn an unhappy guest into a happy one and everyone wins. 

So I tell her, ""Actually, you're right! We do have an available room, and..."" Before I can finish, she throws her purse on the counter. 

""MY ROOM IS READY? I HAVE BEEN WAITING HERE FOR HOURS! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE CALL ME! YOU SAID YOU WOULD CALL!"" 

And I say, ""Well, yes, we did say we would call but...""

""BUT NOTHING. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN WAITING! I HAVE CHECKED BACK AND YOU PEOPLE SAID YOU WOULD CALL!"" 

""But Ma'am, let me explain...""

""CALLLLLLLLLL! YOU SAID YOU WOULD CALLLLLL!"" 

It went like this for a bit, me trying to tell her what happened, but she would not let me explain. She kept chanting YOU SAID YOU WOULD CALLLL over and over. Now, I was pissed that I had even tried to help this woman out. I just wanted her to shut up and leave. So I pull a trick I've used before.

""Ma'am, we did try to call you. Is your phone number 555-555-5554?"" I tell her a number that is one number off of her real number; they usually say, oh, ok, simple mistake, my real number is 555-555-5555, I apologize for the mix up, buy them a round of drinks at the bar, and everyone is happy. Not this woman. 

""YES, THAT'S MY NUMBER. I NEVER GOT A CALL."" I was confused. Did she mishear me? So I repeat the wrong number again, being sure to emphasize each number, so she could see what had (not really) happened. 

Again, she claimed loudly that that WAS her number, and this time she said her room should be free because we are idiots who made her wait for HOURS because we couldn't make a simple phone call. My manager is peeking around the corner, actually laughing at me, and I am now flummoxed. She wants free stuff and is not going to back down. She called my bluff.  Suddenly, it dawns on me. 

""Ma'am, do you have your phone on you? Could the ringer be off?"" She said it's on, is still screaming. So I say, ""And the number is 555-555-5554, right? We, let me just call it and see what the issue is."" 

Now her face freezes, as she realizes that she just painted herself into a corner. I call the fake number and not shockingly her phone doesn't ring. As I'm still on the phone, I say sweetly, ""Is it ringing? It's ringing on my end. Could you check it? Maybe you have some missed calls?"" 

She doesn't answer, just picks up her purse, and asks icily for her room key. This is the first time since I told her her room was ready that she hasn't yelled. But now I'm pissed, and I am not about to let her have this room. Instead, I find one of the dreaded ""25"" rooms. These are rooms that we never give out unless we are sold out; they are right next to the elevator, they are tiny, they have no desk, and they don't even have closets. Just little armoires. They're being eliminated during the next renovation, too, so they still have all of the old tvs, alarm clocks and outdated bathrooms. Because no one uses them, they are usually clean. 

So I book her into this room, smile brightly as I hand her the key, and wish her a happy stay. 

POSTSCRIPT: Of course she called down ten minutes later, irate again, and I let my manager take the call. He told her that if she'd like to move, she could certainly do that, but she would have to wait until after check-in and he would see what we had available then. She never bothered calling back.

Yeah.  This is a thing.  Since lots of people just don't want a receipt from a $3 purchase, I got into the habit of placing all receipts on the counter.  Customer could take it if they wanted it, and if not I'd toss it.

So one day this lady comes in, orders a medium hot coffee and a coffee roll.  I ring her up, and she immediately starts complaining about the price.  I tell her sorry, coffee rolls cost more than donuts and I don't make the prices.  I put the change in her hand and the receipt on the counter, but make note of the fact that she's reading our little ""receipt or your money back"" sign.

About 45 minutes later I'm in the way back of the store, and my coworker pages me back.  I come rushing, thinking there's a huge line of people, but it's just that lady from earlier, claiming she didn't get a receipt and she wants her refund.  Well, I knew for a FACT that I laid it on the counter.  My coworker has already gone through all of our trash bins and couldn't find it.  On a hunch I went to a nearby trash bin at the store's pharmacy.  I dig through some papers, half-drank coffees and half-eaten donuts and find the receipt, which she'd clearly taken and thrown out herself, and hold it out for her to take.

""That's not my receipt.""

""Ma'am, I remember your order.  You ordered a medium coffee and a coffee roll, which I remember because you didn't like the price of the coffee roll.  We got 12 coffee rolls today - 6 plain, 6 frosted.  I know this because I've been here since 5:30 this morning when I unpacked them myself.  We now have 5 plain, 6 frosted.  This is your receipt, which somehow migrated to the trash on your side of the counter despite your never having received it.  I'm sure it was just an oversight.  Have a nice day.""  And I handed her that filthy coffee-stained receipt and walked away like a cowboy riding into the sunset.

While in college, I also worked full time for the university IT help desk. As anyone who worked full time through college can tell you, it can make scheduling time to talk to professors a bit tight, so I had to become a pro at sneaking minutes here and there for questions about class(with a lot of walk-and-talks) and sent a lot of emails. Most professors were incredibly understanding. One? Not so much.  
**The offense:**  
After class, I approached the professor as he was packing up his stuff with some questions about a particularly complicated bit of material. 
 
Me: ""Hi, sir, I was wondering if I could ask you a quick question about something we went over last class.""  
Prof: ""I'm sorry, no. I'm very busy.""  
Me: ""Of course, I understand and I wouldn't want to hold you up. I'd be happy to walk with you so I don't keep you from anything. It's just I tried emailing you an--""  
Prof: ""Ugh, I abhor email.""  
Me: ""Right, sure, which is why I thought I'd ju--""  
Prof: ""Look. Let me make it perfectly clear. I have clearly defined office hours when you can come by and ask me any question your heart desires.""  
Me: ""Of course. It's just that I work over at the help desk and my work schedule completely overlaps your office hours so I can't get by to--""  
Prof: ""Yes yes, that sounds like a terrible problem. It's just not *my* problem. I have over 600 students a semester; if I let you encroach on my personal time, then I'll have to do the same for everyone and it'd be chaos. That's why keeping a schedule is so important.""  
Me: sigh ""of course, sir. I'll figure it out.""  
(note: this little lecture on the importance of strict scheduling took longer than answering my question likely would have.)

**The Revenge:**  
A week of so later, in that same class, the professor had barely started into the lecture when the podium he was running his powerpoint from threw a few errors and the display shut off. A flurry of random button presses, colorful language and a mournful ""this is why I hate computers"" later, the prof was unable to get the display to come back up. Irritatedly, his eyes swept the classroom until he found me.

Prof: ""You! You work in IT, right? Do you know what's going on up here?""  
Me: ""Of course, sir.""  
Prof: ""Well then get up here and get this going again.""  
Me: ""I'm sorry, no.""
The entire class spun to look at me and his eyes bulged.  
Prof: ""... NO?!""  
Me: ""That's correct, sir. You see I have very clearly defined work hours at the help desk. If you want to come by during those, I'd be happy to help. It's just that I support 32,000 people each semester and if I provided support for you during my personal time, I'd have to do it for everyone else and it'd be chaos. You understand, right?""  
Prof, clearly mad: ""But if you don't, I can't --""  
Me: ""Yes, sir, and that's a terrible problem. It's just not *my* problem. I'm sure you understand. As you told me just recently, keeping to a schedule is VERY important.""

The classroom was dead silent and the professor stood there, seething with fury and staring me down, and puffed up as if preparing for an epic meltdown... then I saw the flash of recognition of he realized I'd just parroted back his own argument, nearly verbatim, and he just started laughing, tears streaming down his face.  
When he finally composed himself, he just said ""Fine, you win. You..."" he stared narrowly at the rest of the class for emphasis, ""and ONLY you, can ask me questions outside of office hours. No one else. Now will you PLEASE come fix this?""  
Me: ""Of course, sir. I'd be happy to.""

**Epilogue:**

While I was up front, he leaned if real close to speak to me.  
Prof: ""You know I could have kicked you out of my class for that, right? Maybe even gotten you fired.""  
Me: ""Sure. But then I could have just remotely deleted every file on your hard drive, destroying years of work you almost certainly don't keep backed up anywhere else.""  
Prof: ""Wait... you can't do that... can you?""  
Me: ""I hope you never have to find out.""

A few fraternity brothers (they're cousins) invited me to one of their friend's birthday dinners. It was a nice place. It had great food, had a great time. On the ride back, one of them (let's call him Simon) said, 



""Hey Spartan, did you forget something at the restaurant?""



""No, I don't think so.""



All of a sudden he pulled out my wallet. Apparently, I had left my wallet (which was stupid on my part) at the restaurant and thankfully he grabbed it before we headed out. 



""Oh thanks man, I really appreci-""



""Woah, woah. I found this wallet, don't I get a reward or something?""



""Uh.... How bout a 'thank you'?""



""Nope, that ain't gonna cut it.""



WTF.



Now given, I screwed up and was grateful that someone did grab it, rather than me forgetting it, call the restaurant before it closed, and then having to drive back on my own time to pick it up. But this is bullshit.



""Simon, seriously, I'd like to have my wallet back. It was my old man's."" (dad passed a couple of years ago due to metastasized pancreatic cancer)



""I don't give a f***.""



This was big no-no for me. You can call me names, and pull pranks on me, that's fine. I've done it to him too and we all take it in stride (was not okay with it when I first joined the fraternity). But when you don't give back something to it's rightful owner, especially when it they have sentimental value over it, that's a line that shouldn't be crossed.



After a debacle of threats, bargaining, etc. He said I had to pay him $20 at a wedding of another fraternity brother's that was coming up in two weeks. I got my wallet back, but I was **PISSED**...



I thought of ways I could get back to him. Sure, I wanted to beat the living daylights out of him, but that would have been too much. I've never had the opportunity to come up with any revenge scheme... But then it hit me. If he wants his $20, I'll give him his $20. Even if it was messed up I was a man and I will meet up to my end of the bargain.



So on the drive over, I went into a bank with a $20 in my hand. As I got to the teller, I asked for $20 in pennies. The teller gave me a weird look at first. I told him it was for a project for my economics class. He just shrugged and said ""oh cool"". I had to make some BS story on how I was using pennies in my made-up econ class. Before I got to another bro's house, I stopped by a gas station and asked for a couple of plastic bags.



Once I got to his place, I got changed and brought out the box of rolled pennies and the plastic bags. I unrolled each and every one of those motherfuckers into the bag. By the end of it there were plastic sleeves everywhere. 



We go to the wedding, had a great time all the meanwhile he's like ""where's my $20"". I'll get it to you, just have to stop by the ATM I say. Finally, we get to the reception, eat some good food and enjoy ourselves. 



Hey Spartan where's my money?



Oh right, let me get it from my car



He get's back to his table while I go to my car to get the money. When I came back, I dropped it in front of him. It made a huge thud and crash as it hit the table and then some of it fell over with pennies falling all over the place. At first he was stunned and then was all like ""WTF what is this?"" His girlfriend and surrounding brothers were pissed too. Then I explained to them what happened and why I gave him $20 in pennies. Then, they give him the death look and saying things like ""WTF is the matter with you?"" ""Why couldn't you be a decent human being and just give him his wallet back?"" etc. etc. Finally he comes back to me with the bag of pennies and says



""haha, you got me spartan. I was just messing with you, you can have it back.""



""No that's fine you can have it, we made an agreement that I would give you $20.""



""This isn't $20""



""Yeah it is. It's legal tender, you can use it wherever you want.""



Hands him back the bag and he walks away shoulders slumped over, possibly due to embarrassment or the weight of the pennies. I smirked when I saw him bring it back to his car, while his gf was bitching at him. Some of the bros gave me major kudos for planning this out. While he's not the most hated brother in our chapter, he's been known to be a serious dick sometimes. Best $20 I've ever spent.




TL;DR- Went to dinner w/ fraternity bros, forgot wallet, one of them demands $20 for bringing the wallet back. Wallet has sentimental value got pissed. Decide to give him $20 in pennies, bring it to next event we're both at. Embarrass him by dropping bag of pennies onto table, falls everywhere, his girlfriend and other fraternity bros got pissed at him.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1d9zrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1d9zrz/you_want_your_20_heres_your_bleeping_20/,

I'm a pizza delivery driver
...
**End of Prologue**

**Set Up to the Revenge**
I was delivering a pizza and cinnapie to a customer. Pretty routine. I had delivered there once before earlier that week, so I already knew where she lived, but also that I wasn't going to get a tip, which is shitty because of how far she lived. I got there and found her sitting on her front porch with two of her friends and her son. I took her order out of my trunk and before I even reached her, she loudly exclaimed ""Where is my soda?""

I double checked her receipt and said there was no soda on her order, just a pizza and cinnapie. She didn't believe me until I showed her the receipt. She was still giving me hell, ""Well, I did order a soda."" I asked how she ordered and she said by phone. Well, I assumed whoever took her order just accidently forgot the soda or just didn't hear it. Human error, it happens. At least she wasn't charged for it. I told her I could call the restaurant and get this fixed, but she straight up told me not to even bother and that she would do it.

Well, she got through to the restaurant and explained the situation in the rudest way possible, even referring to me as the ""pizza boy"". Really? I'm 23. Well, my manager offered her the same offer I did, fix the order and have me drive all the way back to the restaurant and back with her Mountain Dew, which she was all for until she heard how long it could potentially take. You see, I wasn't going to just go back and come right back with a soda. No, I would have to wait for my next delivery to be ready before I could leave. She wasn't having it. Up until that point, she kept on going on and on about how she can't eat pizza with something to drink. In my mind, I just thought to myself, ""well, why not just go and get your own drink and save me my precious time. Your not going to give me a tip anyway, so this would be a big waste of time and gas on my part. That's kinda inconsiderate, considering this wasn't my mistake."" I wasn't mad at the person who made the mistake, shit happens, but she was so rude to me and my manager, who is trying her hardest to make this upset customer happy, and to no avail. And, while all of this is going on, her son (about 3 or 4) was tugging on my pant leg and pulling on the the pizza bag... AND ALL THREE WOMEN JUST STOOD THERE AND WATCHED HIM DO IT. ""Lady, get your kid off of me and under control, wth"", I thought to myself.

Finally, she just gave up and hung up on my manager while she was still talking, saying she would just pay for it as is. She commented on how stupid the whole situation was and even said that she could probably do a better job that half the people that work there. Every little thing she said just irritated me and she wasn't even trying to upset me. Nope, she just continued to treat me like I wasn't even there.

**The Revenge**
Her order was on a credit card. Company policy for all drivers is to check the card and a form of ID before handing over the order to ensure this isn't identity theft. After all that, I asked for her card and ID. She said it's her husband's card and he's at work. When I heard that, it was like opportunity for petty revenge just manifested itself in a physical form. It was too perfect.

""I'm sorry, ma'am, but I need to see the card""
""Well, I can't show you the card, my husband is at work""
""Well, ma'am, I'm sorry, but I can't let you have this order then.""

Oh, it was a fury unlike anything I had every seen before. She was irate. She was yelling at me, demanding the order. I said that if she could get the card, I would let her have the food. She told me her husband worked about an hour away, there was no way for her to do that. I told her this was all I could do and she was furious.

""I'm gonna report you to your supervisor!"" Oh, you mean the one you hung up on, I'm sure she will take your side.
""I'm gonna get you fired!"" All my managers love me, good luck with that.
""I'm never ordering from you again."" Good, more time spent on reasonable customers.

I got back to the restaurant with the order, explained myself to the manager and he just smiled and gave me a look that said, ""you magnificent bastard"".

**TL;DR**
Customer was upset over a little mistake on her order, was rude and inconsiderate to me and one of my managers. Denied her the order when she couldn't produce a credit card.

Told that to my GM the next day, got a high five.

There is this one ride called the Leviathan which is the newest roller coaster at the park and extremely popular. There are 3 trains and when one train takes off, another one is done its track. So anyways as my train is finished it's course we pull up into the station behind the other train.

However, some jarhead with a spray-tan is giving the employees a hard time. He has an arm cast and is not allowed to ride but will not leave the train because ""he already went on the ride earlier"". No matter how many times the workers told him about legalities and the danger they would be in, he continued to swear and holler at the workers (with little kids around no less). At this point, the workers eventually begin to pull him and his friend out, but not before the guy spat on every open seat on the roller coaster. At this point he had held up the ride for about 15 minutes and there's nothing worse than impatient Canadian ride warriors.

Best part? While he was getting up his phone dropped out of his pocket, onto the floor of the coaster, nearly tipping off the edge of the train. Now, my buddy and I who were both front seat in our train and front seat in the action yelled at the employee that his phone was right there. The worker went and picked it up, held it up for everyone to see and he whole queue line just cheered and laughed at this dope. The worker even pretended to drop kick the phone out of the station. The worker then went to put it in the lost and found and when our spray tanned amigo came storming back for his ""brand new s4"", every single person acted like they didn't know what happened.

I too worked at a coffee shop in college. Our shop brought in a whole slew of people, many of them college age. I always worked the afternoon/closing shift when we got a lot of college students coming in to study. There was this one guy who came in often. Truth be told, he never wronged me. However, the guy was genuinely an asshole. The first time I served him, he referred to the people out front as ""faggots"" (I hate that term) and was making derogatory comments about women. This guy was very conversational and he went on to tell me about how he was training for a triathlon. I believed him as he was fit and rode his bike to the store. This guy viewed his ""latte"" as his treat in the mid-afternoon after his work-out. 

After listening to this guy be a genuine asshole for a few minutes whilst talking about working out and being healthy, I went ahead and made him his latte. Except I made a breve. For those who do not know, a breve is a latte (espresso and milk) made with 1/2 and 1/2 (cream) instead of milk. A large breve with flavor is about a thousand calories. The guy took a sip and LOVED it (I'm sure they're amazing). He loved it so much he came in often and would always point me out and say ""THAT GUY. HE IS MAKING MY DRINK!!!"". He literally thought my ""way"" of making the drink was the difference... like I had some weird ability. Little did the derogatory asshole know I was feeding him liquid fat and sugar. I hope his triathlon went amazing. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1cya3d,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1cya3d/dont_be_a_dick_ill_make_you_fat/,

When my mother was in primary school (about 6 or 7 years old), she was invited to a birthday party for one of the kids in her year. While she was there, this perfect-princess, rich-and-obnoxious girl from her school (who was already on the path to becoming a total bitch) decided it was a good idea to inform my mother that the party dress she was wearing was hideously ugly, because it had been handmade by my grandmother rather than having been bought from a store like hers. She continued to rub my mum's nose in her comparative poverty and insult my grandma's work at length, before eventually getting bored and deciding to go find someone else to be a bitch to.

As you can imagine, my mother was furious. She loved that dress **because** my grandma had taken the trouble to make it for her, and decided she would have her revenge. Now, the girl in question had long blonde ringlets that she was obsessively proud of. My mum had been eating a toffee when Bitchchild came up to her, and as she turned to walk away, my mother very quickly and carefully took the toffee out of her mouth and stuck it dead centre in this girl's hair.


The toffee wasn't spotted by anyone for a while, by which time it was completely stuck. Snobgirl ended up having to have that piece of hair cut off, which in turn required all her hair to be cut short to match. She cried. My mother gloated. And no one ever knew it was her.

A few years ago I went back to school to get another BA because the first time around my GPA could be charitably called ""aggressively mediocre"" and I really wanted to go to grad school. My wife had a full time job at the time so I didn't need to get a part time job or anything but I get bored easily. I applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasn't particularly demanding work. It was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking IDs of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest. It was part of the campus safety initiative. Most of the time I just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last call—this is in Canada so it's pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age. Occasionally, I was asked to patrol around campus and ticket cars that were improperly parked. I didn't mind the walking but ticketing students never sat well with me—who has money for that shit?—so this was not my favorite part of the job.

As an aside, I tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard. Fuck the man.

Anyway, one day in the late fall—still above freezing but not by much—I was outside the engineering building and I saw a newish BMW 3-series—or maybe it was an M3, I don't recall so I'm just going to say it was an M3 for brevity—parked in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags. As usual, I approach the car slowly, like I'm sneaking up on it. I discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive. I've found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud, blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd. It's better to sneak up on the car, confirm that it is, in fact, illegally parked (or has an expired pass), walk away, write the ticket, and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper. 

&gt;Be me, meter nazi

&gt;Use stealthy ticket

&gt;It is very effective

I wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off. I did another walk around the rear parking lot and then, because it was near the end of my shift, I returned to that same building because there was a Tim's inside and I wanted to grab lunch and a coffee. I go inside, get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke. I'm standing by the [smoking pawn](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-22DySWZ92tE/TefG5ONiZXI/AAAAAAAAA2o/pf35mfKs20o/s1600/smoking_pawn.jpg)—I don't actually know what these things are called—drink in one hand, sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket, smoke in the other hand, and just zone out. Next thing I know there's some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly. I zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the M3. He's this skinny dude, wearing a [puffy vest](http://www.gap.com/products/res/thumbimg/quilted-puffer-vest-blue.jpg), and he's got fancy hair. I figure he's probably 18 or 19. 20 tops. He's got the yellow envelope in one hand and he's all, ""Fucking shit, fuck fuck, dick, cunt, shit, fuck, motherfucker, etc."" 

While he's swearing and having a bit of a spaz, he's also looking around, presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind.

Oh wait, I'm the meter nazi! And I'm like 30 feet away! Still smoking. Sandwich in my pocket, coffee in the other hand, parking ticket printer slung across my chest. Well shit. 

&gt;Be me

&gt;Be at the end of your shift

&gt;Expect to be yelled at by Puffy Vest Fancy Hair


I steel myself for the eventual tirade. Policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations. Our interactions should consist of ""yes sir/ma'am"", ""no sir/ma'am"", ""I understand, sir/ma'am"" but overall being firm about why they received a ticket.  He swings his vision around several times but doesn't seem to spot me. I'm not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory, blue, campus security jacket, and a *ticket printer*. He keeps looking around. Left. Right. Left. Right.

I take another drag.

For whatever reason, he doesn't see me. He angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car, bleeps the car with his remote, *and heads back into the building*.

So, I'm still standing by the [smoking pawn](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-22DySWZ92tE/TefG5ONiZXI/AAAAAAAAA2o/pf35mfKs20o/s1600/smoking_pawn.jpg), sandwich in my pocket, half-full medium double-double—the old medium, not the new upsized medium—with one drag left on my smoke. So I finish my smoke, feed the pawn, and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich. I'm sitting on the bench, eating my sandwich, drinking my coffee, and staring at this M3 that is still parked in the handicap space.

""I'm gonna finish my sandwich, drink my double-double, *have another smoke*, and then I'm going to give him another ticket"", says I to myself.

""It's a trap"", replies my brain, making a very good point.

""I dunno man, this is too good of an opportunity to pass up.""

""I'm just saying""

""How could it be a trap? What, he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a [dance off](http://nycxplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/West-Side-Story-2.jpg)?""

""Do whatever you want, just no concussions.""

My brain made a valid point. This would be an excellent trap. I pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth, wash it down with my now lukewarm double-double and light up another smoke—Du Maurier Light Kings with the droopy cigarette impotence warning, no doubt—and stare at the entrance to the engineering building.

No sign of Puffy Vest Fancy Hair. With one hand I start typing out the ticket on the printer but don't press the ""print"" button yet—if I hit the button it saves the data and there's no way to undo it once that happens. I wasn't yet ready to commit to this course of action. I finish my second cigarette, pull out a yellow envelope, take a breath and hit ""print"" as I start walking toward the car. The thermal printer quickly spits out the ticket and I quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and sling it under the wiper. 

Nothing happens.

No ambush.

No screaming.

No Puffy Vest Fancy Hair.

All that buildup for nothing.

I check my phone—if I recall correctly, it was a motorola flip phone of some variety—and shift ended a few minutes ago. I'm not technically in any hurry to get back to the office, we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so I'm not preventing anyone from starting their shift by dillydallying. I use the camera phone—with a whopping 640x480 resolution—to take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper. Then I walk into the engineering building, get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area, and I hope that this kid isn't in a three hour class. I'm now here for a show. I'm going to get yelled at, it'll be a huge scene, I'll have to be all professional about it, but seeing Puffy Vest Fancy Hair have another spaz is totally worth it.

""You're an idiot"", says my brain.

I let my coffee cool just for a bit before I take a swig. Of course, I forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my chin. Son of a bitch. I put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee dribble from my chin just as I hear another stream of, ""CUNT FUCK MOTHERFUCKER WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK"" erupts from the vicinity of the M3. 

""WHO THE FUCK DID THIS?!""

""WHAT THE FUCK?!!""

There's Puffy Vest Fancy Hair: Sack of fast food in one hand, jumbo fountain drink in the other—ah, to have the metabolism of a 19 year-old again—He's whirling around, trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm. He's now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by. For some reason, he still hasn't spotted me. I'm standing a mere 30 feet from where he is spazzing. I am right beside the smoking pawn, wearing a blue jacket that says ""Campus Security"" on it. I have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest. For some reason, his gaze never lingers on me at all. After a few more seconds of spazzing, he gets in his car, throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away.

Why he didn't see me is inexplicable. The only hypothesis I have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else. Maybe a [high visibility vest](http://www.legionsafety.com/high-visibility-safety-vests.jpg) or maybe something [like this](http://www.sjsu.edu/parking/pics/interceptor.JPG), I dunno.

I don't recall how much those tickets  run (a few hundred I think) but that kid had one expensive day. My boss did tell me that the kid's father called in pretty pissed about the tickets. I had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because I figured he'd probably ask my why I wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day. My boss explained to the kid's father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle, remove the ticket, and leave, it counted as a separate parking incident, thus, two tickets were warranted.

Almost always the moms who would come in looking for things would bring in their kids. Now, the kids are not usually annoying, and they were usually between the ages of 9-12. If they were causing trouble I would usually just have to tell them to stop, and it would work out fine. Except this one time. 

It was just like any usual time, mother bringing her son in with her while she picked out some clothing. Naturally, the kid gets a bit fidgety after being in the store for about 2 minutes. He starts to take things off of the shelves, get fingerprints over all of the sunglasses, etc. I go over and tell the kid to ""Kindly stop what he is doing"" and he gives me a quick, ""Whatever"" and walks off.

He stops what he is doing for about 1 minute, then starts to do the same thing that he was before, but this time making direct eye contact with me. Instead of just telling his mom what was going on, I wanted to have some fun because it had been a slow day. 

When they finally come to pay for their things I look the kid straight in the eyes, (He was obviously a boy, but he had hair that was longer than the usual where I live) And I say, ""What a lovely daughter you have there!"" It was like I had taken his ""cool, edgy attitude"" and smashed it with a sledgehammer. His face went from pale, straight to blood-red. His mom sees how embarrassed he is, finishes paying extremely quickly, and leaves without a word. I was so damn proud.

So I'm a jock. But not an asshole. There's obviously a difference. But some people can't make that distinction. You see, in high school, we're all intolerable shitheads without a clue of what we're going to be in life, or who we really are. That's why I hate it when people make assumptions about me without getting to know me first.

**The Backstory** So there's this girl I've been to school with since about 7th grade. I've always been nice to her and her friends I'm not the kind of guy to intentionally ruin someones day by being an asshole, because I mean well and try to keep my mind open. Let's call this girl Suzy. Suzy is very socially gifted. She's in with the popular girls, dates the popular guys, but is generally a very immature person (despite how pudgy and smug she is). (She denies the holocaust existed, even after one of my father's friends, a survivor offered his personal testimony to our 8th grade class.) Suzy used to smile at me in the hallways, but I didn't really pay her any attention. I didn't really connect with her. We never hung out, she was just a face in the yearbook.

A couple weeks ago, Suzy messaged me on facebook, (EDIT: here they are. http://imgur.com/a/Yfpnp   the OP delivers) out of the blue. She said I should kill myself, that I'm an asshole, and DESERVE to get hit by traffic and LIVE, so that I can suffer. (I still have those facebook messages) That hurts, she doesn't know me at all. And she's obviously not mature enough to get to know me. So I'll show her just how mature I can be.

**The Revenge** Like I said, Suzy is very socially gifted. And that's what she craves, attention. So my opportunity struck in the library when our class was working on a project. That dumb cunt left her facebook open. I changed her privacy setting so that only she could see her statuses. She went from 60+ likes a day to zero, and it's been like that for a month and a half. Every time i see her stare at her smartphone with a look of sheer horror on her face (as, no one is liking her statuses), a shudder of pure ecstasy runs down my spine. I'm evil. Don't judge me. Fucking spingy pug cunt bitch.

I work in a big international company, instore as a part of the warehouse operative (basically we do everything for everyone). The manager of the warehouse team is a ~~really nice person~~ cunt. She employed her son full time when he turned 18 and gave him his own pick at what hours he would like. So now he has become her whipping boy when she is around (never), but when she is not he does as he likes. He orders people around, shouts at people and sits on his big fat ass and does nothing at all.

**The Actual Story**

So the other day after feeling bad all day i told him that if i feel this shitty i will not be coming in tomorrow and i will call his mum and tell her. So i carry on working the rest of the shift, i think he's cool, i dont know why everyone slags him off. We are locking up and he asks me if i smoked weed. I said oh yeah im going to smoke some when i get home. We carry on talking and he admits that he smokes to. Shift ends.
I call in sick the following day because i feel really shitty. So when i return to work 2 days later i found out he told his mum that i ""couldnt be arsed to work"" and i was going to lie to get the day off.
Manager pulls me aside bollocks me. He spreads around work i lied to get the day off.

The same day the manager bollocks me, i also get a random locker search. I have some items in my bag that i bought earlier instore. They didnt want to see the reciept, instead they sniffed through my bag saying they where looking for something in particular (obviously the weed).

So by now i know that he snitched on me to his mum twice. i then decided i was going to have some fun with it.

**REVENGE**

So then i asked him if he wanted to buy some cocaine (Something he said he takes all the time) from me. I will be bringing quite a lot in tomorrow at work so he can buy. I hinted that i would have about half a kilo (LOL).

So when i get to work scan in i get a call from the manager to meet me in the locker room. By the time i get in there three private security officers are following me from the staff room. Then i go into the locker room there are a further 8 officers and 1 drug sniffer dog. I get made to open my locker and empty my bag. During this time the manager and her son are standing in the locker room with me smirking. Also the regional manager is instore so he is in there to.

No drugs in my bag. 
Store gets fined a lot of money for wasting time. 
his mum gets demoted for calling in the search
he gets the sack and trys to fight me. 
he gets arrested for assault. 
he gets 7 months in prison.

A nice added bonus to my last pay packet. 
I leave the company the next week to go to University.
We are even.

**Prison**

Basically i was coming in work one day and he was waiting for me in the staff area. I thought nothing of it and just got changed when i was getting changed coincidentally the a security guard was just starting his shift to. So then when the guy saw me i was with the security guard.
He walked up to me and basically punched me in the back of the head whilst i was walking away (cheap shot). But it was all on camera and the security guard was a witness to it all. His mum got a new job after this.

EW looked good on paper, but she was not a nice person.  EW worked mornings with a lady I will call Ann.  Ann's son John worked afternoons with me.  


One day, John told his mom something rather surprising and his mom, shocked, confided in EW.  By the end of the week, EW had outed John to the rest of the staff and embellished how Ann found out to include her walking in on John and another guy.  Fortunately, the staff loved John and rallied around him, but what a nasty thing to do!


In addition to being a bitch, EW was also an alcoholic.  (One time, she brought her six-year-old son to work, where he spent the balance of the day whining that he wanted a lemon drop.  Finally, a coworker - a sweet girl who liked to make people happy - bought a bag of lemon drops for the kid, who informed her that she must be stupid because a lemon drop is vodka, lemon juice and sugar.)  


Anyway, although things started out alright, eventually it got to the point where, if we scheduled EW to work on a Monday morning, she failed to show up a full 50% of the time.  It had been about 6 months since we hired her, which, coincidentally, was how long she needed to work before being eligible for unemployment benefits again, when we stopped scheduling her for the 6-2 shift on Mondays.  We gave her the 11-3 instead, which, obviously resulted in her losing some hours.  EW did not like that.


It was about 11:00 at night and I was at home when my phone rang.  It was EW, drunk and yelling at me about her hours.  She called me a stupid bitch a few times and kept repeating a simple mantra: ""FIRE ME FIRE ME FIRE ME!""


So I eventually hung up and I called my boss and told her what had happened.  We talked a bit and decided EW was more trouble than she was worth, so I called her back and said ""I've thought it over, EW, and I have decided to take your advice and fire you.  Goodbye.""


But that isn't the revenge bit.  The revenge is when she filed for unemployment.  I know a bit about how bureaucrats work, so I decided she wouldn't be getting unemployment benefits this time around.  We contested her claim and gave the Unemployment Office my contact information.  When they called, they asked me why I had let her go.  It went something like this:


Unemployment Guy: ""EW says you cut her hours.  Can you explain why that happened?""


Me:  ""Well, EW does a good job when she's there, but unfortunately, I think he has an alcohol problem.  She hasn't been dependable on Monday mornings, so we decided to let her sleep in.


UG:  ""But she was a good employee other than that?""


Me:  ""Yes and no.  She's good at the work, but she outed a gay coworker to the whole company last month and the last straw was when she called me at home and started swearing at me.  She called me a bitch while I was in my own home.  I don't have to put up with that!  I was in my living room and she's yelling at me saying 'Fire me, you stupid bitch,' and I am not going to be called a bitch in my own home.""


UG:  ""Wait... she asked you to fire her?""


Me: ""Yeah.  While calling me a bitch.  In my own home, no less!""


UG:  ""But she said the words 'fire me'?""


Me: ""Over and over again.  But I seriously don't need to be called a bitch in my own home.""


UG:  ""But she asked to be fired?  Okay, I think you've answered my questions.  Thank you.""


I hung up with a huge grin on my face.  It was a week or two before the letter from Unemployment came: EW was denied and would have to get a job.  Boo fucking hoo.


Tl;dr: Pickled bitch has to get a job.

So my parents work in the same city, but different places. They often meet for lunch. My mom drives a car that dad bought, it was a pretty nice car, only 4 or 5 years old at the time.

They decide to meet for lunch. My mom arrives to the restaurant first, parks her car, and is waiting for dad to get there. While she is waiting, some guy flies into the parking spot next to her, opens his door, and *bang*. His door hits the car mom was driving. 

She does the reasonable thing, gets out of the car, laughs it off, politely asks for insurance information (the dent was big enough, car was nice enough, it might've cost more than the deductible). The guy looks at the huge dent, and says ""It's not that big of a deal, don't worry."" And he just walks into the store without another word. 

Shit. What the hell just happened? Mom panics, not sure what to do. This guy just messed up the car that dad bought for mom, refused to give insurance info, and is now eating in the restaurant they are planning to eat at. She feels terrible. So she calls dad, and tells him what happened, worried he will be mad. He says only this, ""Move your car."" 

""What? Why? Don't you want to eat somewhere else?""

""Just move your car.""

So she moves. A minute or two later, dad pulls in. He drives a ~~work~~ daily driver car. A POS Honda. He parks next to the asshole's car, shuts his car off, grabs the door handle, and SLAM. SLAM. SLAM SLAM SLAM. He hits this guys car with his door, hard, over and over until it is obvious the door is *fucked*. 

Then, he calmly walks into the restaurant with mom following him. They get sat close to the asshole. Dad remains calm, unphased. The asshole left before they did, and dad never heard about it again. I assume this guy didn't have any insurance at all.

Tl;dr, if you door ding someone, offer insurance info or cash. Don't be an ass.

Edit. This blew up since I went to bed. Thanks for the comments! And whoops, I didn't mean work car, I meant a daily drive. You know, just a beater that barely cost anything, doesn't look good but still runs.

2nd Edit: Thought I'd share a story that is much more petty. I got white-girl wasted towards the end of high school. Friend drove me home (he was sober), and since my parents were home and I was being insanely stupid, he told me as strictly as he could ""Go straight to bed. Don't do anything else, just go to bed and sleep.""

So, I went inside, shut the lights off. As soon as is car left, I giggled like a maniac and showered. Fucker told me to go to sleep, I wasn't having any of that. So I showered.

Rich, assholic men with serious issues against women (especially in the workplace). Recently, I’ve been having trouble with the head hauncho here. We’ll call him Dick. Unfortunately, Dick pretty much owns the company so going to HR for a wink or a comment about my cleavage is kind of pointless. But it’s OK, I have tough skin. And petty revenge…

Dick is the only one here that uses the ice in the bin that the freezer makes. Most of us are pretty happy with the ice cold filtered water that’s readily available and don’t need ice.  For the past few days, I’ve been sticking frozen green beans in the very front of the bin where he can’t see. This makes pretty much all of the ice in the bin taste and smell like green beans (You’d never know the power of a green bean until it’s in your water supply).

 I’ve heard him complain about the green bean flavor several times now and yet he can never find it because I'm always really careful to take the green bean out before his usual refill times. Today he went postal and took apart the whole freezer looking for green beans- and even threw the ice bin in the dishwasher. He just replaced the ice bin and turned the ice maker back on… Better go replace the green bean… heheheh.

Update: He's called maintenance in our office building because ""There's something that smells like vegetables in the water"". I considered intercepting the maintenance man to let him in on the joke but he'd probably tell him. Thoughts? Suggestions?

Update 5/17/13: A coworker just used a bunch of ice after bashing his knee into a plotter. The green bean turned up and luckily, I interfered before he could run to Dick's office to ""solve the mystery"".

Every year, there'd be some super big band festival that schools from all over the nation would travel to in order to compete, then spend the next day at a local theme park and watch the awards ceremony. In my 8th grade year, the majority of the band didn't feel like traveling, so we opted to compete in the festival being hosted in our town.

Flash forward to the festival. We played 3 songs. I don't remember them too well, but I do remember that towards the end of our last one, I had a solo. No big deal. I had practiced the solo hundreds of times. When the time came, I started the solo off beautifully. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I see a bright white light, like one of those keychain flashlights. This distracted me a thew off my timing very noticeably. As I was walking off stage, I could feel my director's eyes burning a hole in the back of my head. 

After the performance, he pulled me aside in the hallway and asked me what the problem was. I told him that someone had shined a flashlight and it threw me off. He told me to go tell the director of the high school band, which was where the festival was being hosted. So, I walked down to the bandroom and explained what had happened. He asked if I could identify who had done it. I didn't get a good look at the kid, but I did see that it was someone in a group of Hispanics wearing floral shirts. The director said that he'd figure something out and I went on to watch the other bands perform.

The group of kids who messed up my solo weren't just spectators who decided to color coordinate for the day. It turns out that they were a percussion ensemble who had came from Miami, Florida. Our band flew to any location past Atlanta, so it was safe to say that they likely spent a large amount of money to come perform. They played steel pans. When I recognized the group, I relayed the information to my director, who passed it on to the high school director.

Apparently, when a director says that shit will get done, it gets done. Word had made way to the director of the festival and the director of the Miami ensemble. Before the night was over, the Miami director apologized to me and promised that if they find out who did it, that kid will face punishment. The next day, at the award ceremony, I found that the band had been disqualified for ""unsportsmanlike conduct"".

1357227294.0,963,self.pettyrevenge,15w3ia,Two tales of very petty revenge against bad drivers at my security gate.,1152,189,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/15w3ia/two_tales_of_very_petty_revenge_against_bad/,"**Background info:** I work security for this business research campus. The campus is closed overnight so droparms come down at every entrance and the only way to gain access to campus is by swiping your ID badge at these roadside pedestals near the gatehouses.

For the first hour of my early morning shift, these droparms are still down and all employees are required to badge in no matter what, but as entitled as everyone is who works here, they all try to tailgate the first guy who badges in so they don't have to swipe their cards. I can't do anything about that. Worst still are the people who don't even stop at the pedestal; they drive right up to the closed droparms, expecting me to open it for them.

**Petty revenge #1:** So I just stopped opening it for them. I let them sit there as long as they want, waiting for me to let them in. I used to wait about twenty seconds (an eternity itself in traffic time) before walking all the way out there to their cars to talk to them. But now that it's cold I'll just wait inside my warm shack until they reverse back up to me. They *hate* that, especially when I stop traffic behind them to prevent the next guy from badging-in and inadvertently letting in the douche waiting at the droparm. Inevitably, I have some variation on this conversation with tools like that:

*Spoiled Adult:* ""Hey! Aren't you going to let me in?""

*Me:* ""Oh, I'm sorry. The signs clearly state that all visitors must check in here before I can allow them onto campus.""

*Spoiled Adult:* ""I'm not a visitor! I'm an employee! Don't you recognize me?"" (Note: I usually do recognize them but I've learned that nothing pisses off self-righteous people more than not acknowledging their status.)

*Me:* ""Sorry, but I don't. There are over 8,000 people who work on this campus alone. Anyway, all employees are required to badge in before 7am. If this is your first day, I'd be happy to direct you to the Photo ID Office."" (If they hate not being recognized as an employee, being called a ""dumb newbie"" is even worse to their egos.)

*Spoiled Adult:* ""It's not my first day!! I've worked here for over 20 years! I come through your gate all the time!""

*Me:* ""Good, so then you have no excuse for not already being familiar with the security policy. Now if you'll go ahead and swipe your badge, you've been holding up the queue and I need to get it moving again.""

*Spoiled Adult:* [indignant scoffing and/or obscenities, but eventual compliance.]

Even if there does start to become a line, no one ever gets mad at *me*; the other drivers get pissed at the guy who thinks he's so important that he gets to waste everyone else's time. I have to admit, there's a certain bit of schadenfreude in seeing a grown-ass man driving a Porsche being scolded like a child.

**Petty revenge #2:** This happened the other day. One particular obscenely overweight female employee is always difficult to security and yesterday she kept speeding around campus and tailgating people -- though campus police can't do anything about it unless they catch her themselves. I tried to stop her whenever she came through my gate but she ignored me each time and I have no real authority to do anything else about it. Then, right before the lunch rush started, I saw her tailgating another employee really closely down the long road that led up to my gate. The first driver stopped at my gatehouse to complain about it:

*Employee:* ""Hey, can you say something to the woman behind me? She's been riding my ass all the way down [the main street] and then down [the side street]!""

*Me:* (I look back and see the tailgater has hot take-out food in her passenger seat and is obviously in a hurry to get back to her office to eat it. I look back at the employee and notice he has his daughter in the backseat.) ""You know, I've been trying to stop her all day because she's been doing the same thing to everybody. She refuses to stop and I honestly don't have the authority to do anything about it except write down her license plate.""

*Employee:* ""Really? Well damn.. (Suddenly he seems to get an idea.) Hey, is there anybody behind her?""

I tell him no and I smile as I realize what he's probably about to do. He turns to his daughter and asks her to tell me about *every single toy* she got for Christmas over the break, which she does excitedly and in great detail. And then she goes on to excitedly tell me about what they all did for the New Year's holiday.

Meanwhile the tailgater is fuming inside her car behind them and tries to honk her horn. I give her the hand signal for ""hold on"" and go back to listening to the little girl. Eventually Tubby McLeadfoot gets fed up and does a U-turn to go in one of the other campus gates. As soon as she's gone and the girl finished her story, I thanked the father profusely and they drove merrily along onto campus.

TL;DR: Street justice got served, fool. *Twice.*

The girl was one of those obnoxious sorts of people that become more and more difficult to like with every time she opened her mouth. And unfortunately, she never shut up. This girl was constantly rattling off how bitches need to stop giving her attitude, because she don't take shit from no one, and other, similar phrases. And she was LOUD.

So one day, the teacher forgets something from out of the textbook, and so this shy Asian boy, who probably spoke up twice altogether throughout the whole semester, raises his hand and tells the teacher what he had forgotten.

And of course, the girl has something to say.

""OH MY GOD, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH A SMART-ASS? THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS!""
She'd given me a lot of attitude, because I sat right by her and she gives EVERYONE attitude, but that was far enough to where I felt obligated to do something.
Naturally, this girl also went to the bathroom to text all the time, claiming ""girl emergencies"" at least once a week, but of course, that excuse works every time, because a male teacher has to let her go, on the off chance that she's actually not lying. And then she'd come back and whisper Facebook drama to the girl beside her. Go figure.

I guess her period excuse was why it dawned on me that I was holding a red pen, and I got kind of inventive. While she was out in the bathroom, I took my red pen apart and tried to extract some ink. I couldn't make it happen, so I took a piece of lead from a mechanical pencil, dipped it in so that thick, goopy red ink stuck to it, and I broke off the wet part of the lead and tossed it onto her chair.
She came back and sat right on it, and it took all the willpower I had not to burst out laughing until the bell rang. It had smeared beautifully all over her white pants, right around the crotch, yet she walked out completely unaware. My life felt complete.

TL;DR A bitchy girl lied about being on her period for the tenth week in a row, so I put red ink on her seat while she was in the bathroom.

My 4 year old daughter was invited to a birthday party for one of her little friends that just turned 5.  The party was hosted at an amusement center that has multiple bounce houses and other large inflatable slides and obstacle courses.  Parents are encouraged to partake in the activities with their children so you can help them if needed.  As a father that is very involved with my daughter and her activities I played in the bounce houses with her.

There was this one girl, I believe a cousin of the birthday girl, that was about 7 years old, I will refer to her as QB (Queen Brat).  QB had the attitude that if you didn’t do things her way, it was the wrong way.  Being that she was one of the older kids there she tried to get all the younger girls to follow her and do what she wanted to do.  Now imagine her displeasure when a bunch of 4 and 5 year olds don’t want to listen to her and do what they want.  QB immediately started acting out and being a general pain.  If she was going up a ladder to a slide, she would stop in the middle of the ladder and not let any of the other kids pass.  Seeing her actions, and me not being one to make a scene with a small child, I simply told my daughter to play somewhere that QB wasn’t currently causing problems. 

All was well until we were moved to another room with different bounce houses and activities.  As the kids are playing, I notice QB is laying in one of the bounce houses by herself.  The look on her face was that of utter defiance as she refused to play with any of the other kids because they would not listen to her and follow her.  Unfortunately  this was the bounce house that my daughter wanted to play in, so to make sure nothing went wrong, I entered the bounce house with my daughter.  We started jumping and kicking some small soft balls around and the following conversation between me and QB occurred.

(Try to read QB’s side with an entitled attitude.  Try to read mine with a calm, caring, monotone father)
QB: STOP JUMPING! I am trying to just lay here and rest…
Me: This is a bounce house and its meant to be jumped in.
QB: But I am trying to lay her by myself!
Me: Sorry, we came here to play and we are going to play.
QB: THIS is the ONLY place for me to lay down!
Me: Go lay on the floor.

We continued jumping and playing with the balls that were in the bounce house and QB would try to grab and hold onto the balls to keep us playing with them.  This continued for maybe only 5 more minutes when my daughter wanted to move to another activity.  She started for the exit and QB decided that she wanted to exit first and pushed my daughter out of the way.  Before this, I was only slightly perturbed by QB, now she pissed me off… How could I get some petty revenge on this little demon child?  I didn’t have to wait long…

There was a small arcade machine in the corner of the room called the CYCLONE.  The cost of said machine was $2. You then stand inside said machine and close the circular door and then the machine creates a vortex of wind that supposedly simulates a cyclone.  There is even a wind speed indicator that tells you how fast the wind is blowing.  QB see this machine and starts playing with it, however she has no $.  I see her out of the corner of my eye asking her grandma if she would pay for it, but grandma refused. That’s when I called my daughter over and pointed to the machine and asked her if she would like to try it…

Take that QB, hope you enjoyed watching my daughter in the CYCLONE with a huge smile on her face…

She's been a flight attendant for almost 35 years now and has earned numerous accolades from her airline and high-level frequent fliers for her phenomenal service. I've never met anyone who works harder or who loves his/her job more.

She is an extremely patient person as well, and can usually diffuse a tough situation and calm folks down (her thinking being hey, everyone just wants to take off and get to Boston/Anchorage/Honolulu on time). Technically, however, post-9/11 the FAA granted flight attendants a lot more jurisdiction over whether P.A.L.D.s (Passengers Acting Like Dicks) fly or not. My mom hardly ever exercises this authority (certainly not as much as other flight attendants), but the douche canoe in this story earned it.

My mom was working her favorite trip - Portland to Maui - and was greeting passengers on a Thursday morning flight boarding in PDX. The airline had recently begun flying to Hawaii, so things were festive (Hawaiian music playing, free Mai Tais, even new Hawaii-themed uniforms for the flight crew). Everyone was in a great mood, passengers and crew, until this guy boards.

He's immediately rude, loud, crude, and obviously drunk off his ass. Behind him is his exasperated young wife, towing a horse-sized diaper bag and their two young, tired-looking kids. The guy remarks to my mom ""You gonna get those drinks comin', hun?"" and laughs like a loon as soon as he steps foot on the plane.

Once they get seated (the guy refuses to sit down or help his wife get their two kids situated), this guy will not shut up. He begins calling friend after friend and has the ""Yo bro, guess where I am right now?"" conversation with each, complete with LOUD profanity. There are a lot of families and young children on this flight, including his own.

All his antics so far are annoying, yet no reason to kick him off the plane. That comes when the guy refuses to put away his phone, meaning my mom can't close the door, meaning a delay, meaning less time my mom has on the ground in Maui to snorkel (this bitch LOVES her some snorkeling). Another flight attendant had asked him politely three times, the third request receiving a ""Jesus, calm the fuck down!""

Oh heeeeeelllll no. My mom PAs the crew in the back galley saying she's booting him. This guy will only get drunker, and any aggression towards flight crew is not fucking tolerated. She prepares to go into the cockpit to get approval from the pilot to deplane the guy. Pilots can be notoriously uncaring about what happens behind the cockpit door -- ""just take care of it"" is a common response to complaints -- so my mom was prepared to have to argue her case.

But she remembers this flight's captain is Steve, a seasoned pilot who's flown with my mom for 30+ years and has always been famously protective of his flight crews (he always buys dinner for the crew at the hotel, he gives my mom a Christmas present every year, and his connections in Seattle helped me get my first job). Awesome guy who won't let anyone do anything to ""his girls"" -- and says so again to my mom. She heads back to deal with Asshat McGee.

She informs him, simply and quietly, that his behavior has thus far been unacceptable, that the captain has deemed him a security risk, and that he must deplane. This guy naturally goes apeshit, screaming things like ""So you're gonna ruin my kids' vacation? What the FUCK!"" My mom maintains her composure and tells him that the airline will book him on the next flight, provided he deplanes peacefully (without security) and sobers up.

The guy continues his tirade, when my mom sees his now crying wife starting to pack up the toys around her kids who had finally calmed down. Seeing the distraught look on her face, she tells her, ""Ma'am, there is no need for you or your children to deplane. Your husband can meet you in Maui if he takes this evening's flight."" The wife looks a bit torn for a second, then turns on her husband with a look of pure ice. ""Don't ruin this.""

My mom's been divorced, so she and plenty other women know that look. They also know that the ""this"" could mean anything from that flight to their entire marriage. My mom also lives fully to the mantra ""Don't you dare fuck shit over for your wife."" Whatever it was, it worked; the guy grabbed his carry-on, muttered ""Man, this is bullshit"", but deplaned. They were able to take off only 10 minutes behind schedule.

While the kids cried a bit at their dad leaving, they soon settled down. My mom ended up talking to that woman quite a bit, and comped meals for her and the kids. The wife was embarrassed and extremely apologetic, but the flight crew and even neighboring passengers consoled her. My mom gave the woman a bottle of wine from first class when they landed.

A few weeks later, my mom got a call from her supervisor. Two separate high-level frequent fliers on that flight had written to the airline commending her for how she handled the situation. My mom got a congratulatory letter from corporate and a small bonus (almost unheard of for flight attendants nowadays).

TL;DR my mom kicked a guy off a plane for being a doucher.

Sorry for writing a novel. I could have shortened this, but I like to narrate. I've got loads more PettyRevenge stories from my mom's years of flying if people are interested.

I set one of my interests to what is known to be a pretty girly show which we'll call ShowX. (I'm an 18 year old guy, but love the show) 

Anyway, right away this stranger says ""heyy asl pls?"". I sigh but I give it to him and of course he disconnects right away.

Several minutes later after a few more failed conversations I get another person who likes ShowX. First words they type are ""heyy asl pls?"" Now I'm starting to get ticked off. He's obviously using this show as a way to find girls. 

I decide to play along and tell him I'm a girl from the US, age 19 and big surprise! He doesn't disconnect. Perfect. I ended up spending 15-20 minutes flirting with this guy and leading him on until he asked to video chat.

I signed up for a new account quickly, launched it and added him. I'm a pretty skinny guy, not a lot of muscle or fat from years of swimming, so I decided to use that to my advantage.

During the summer, every hotel in town would sell out every weekend.  Even the crappy roach motels would fill every room, usually with poor bastards who didn't realize that the rooms at the decent places needed to be booked far in advance.

Inevitably, every weekend we would get dozens of people showing up without a reservation assuming we would have rooms available.  When we informed them that we were sold out the reactions would range from ""Okay, thanks"" to the ass clowns who said something to the effect of ""You're going to have to do something, because I need a room.""  

The latter reaction is the one that always really pissed us off, not just because they were rude, but also because they were stupid.  Were they not aware that we are in the business of renting rooms to people?  That this is how the business makes money?  We didn't have some secret wing of the hotel that was only available to the people who really insisted.  We had X number of rooms, and once those rooms were spoken for, we were out of rooms to sell.  Seemed simple enough to me.

Anyway, the one night I'm working the night shift and this car pulls up under our canopy.  These four young guys who looked straight out of the frat club come stumbling in obviously hammered.  They tell me they need a room, and I tell them, sorry, we're sold out tonight.  Instantly the one guy jumps in with ""That's not going to work.  We need a room, and you're going to have to figure something out.""

My dad has been renting a room from his work friend, Kurt, for nearly two years now. Kurt is married, but until recently his wife lived in another city. They weren't technically separated, but weren't together anymore either. She is CRAZY.

One day this woman showed up on their door step in a ""Honey, I'm home!!"" fashion, and moved right on in. This was two weeks ago and since then she has made a consistent effort to make my dad and David, the other roommate, feel unwelcome. She even told my dad that she and Kurt were trying to have a baby! My dad congratulated Kurt, who obviously hadn't heard the great news just yet. HA!

She walks around saying things like ""Are you gonna clean that up?"" and ""Is that the way you found that?"" and sighing and ugh-ing and generally being a pain in the ass. She even told them that she didn't want to hear their alarms in the morning because she doesn't have anywhere to be and therefore doesn't want to be disturbed. THEN she posted notes on my dad's and David's doors listing the new HOUSE RULES. By then they'd had enough of her shit. Here's where it gets petty:

**#1**
One of the rules on her list was that the bathroom doors must remain shut at all times. Even when the bathrooms are unoccupied, the doors need to be closed.
My dad takes it upon himself to open the bathroom door whenever he possibly can. He sees a closed door, he opens that shit.

**#2**
another rule of hers was that my dad and David had to take all their belongings out of the common areas and store it in their bedrooms. What she didn't know was that nearly ALL the furniture belonged to my dad and David. The only things Kurt owned were the dishes in the kitchen and a recliner in the living room. My dad and David have now moved all THEIR stuff into their rooms, leaving her with nothing but a recliner and some cookware.

**#3**
She uses the internet/watches cable constantly. All day. The internet and cable TV that MY DAD pays for. He decided, while moving his belongings, to change the WiFi password and move the cable box to his room. MUAHAHA!

**TLDR;** My dad's roommate's crazy wife moves in and starts all kinds of shit, he gives it right back in the most petty, most satisfying way.

UPDATE # 1:  Dad came home last night. (He works in another city, hence the renting, but he still lives with us on the weekends.)  He said crazy bitch is acting like none of it happened, and discussing taking a Skiing trip with Kurt.  Dave has started looking for a house to rent, and Dad is probably going to move in with him if the twat doesn't go soon.

I was 17 and dated a 19-year-old, ""Josh,"" for a month. I was impressed because he had moved out of his mom's house, wore a suit to work (retail furniture) and drove a new truck. I was a complete virgin at this time but I read a lot of my mom's romance novels. We would make out standing behind his truck in my mom's driveway. He was the first person to go up my shirt.

One day he came over and asked me to sit on the front porch with him. I was excited to see him because I'd been grounded for sneaking out to meet him so he'd been going to the pool hall without me the past few nights. He asked if I knew someone named ""Lisa"" with long dark hair. I mentally went through everyone in my class. No Lisa. He kept asking me if I knew this chick. Finally he said he had met a girl named Lisa who knew me. She told him I was a super slut. He had already had his suspicions that I wasn't what I claimed to be because I was ""too good"" at making out to be a virgin. This only confirmed it. He also believed I was lying when I said I didn't know her. He did not want to be with me anymore. He took his garish class ring back and drove off in his truck. I cried for hours. Not because of losing him, but because this was the first I had ever heard of someone going behind my back and calling me a slut and I felt completely blindsided and betrayed. (I know, I got lucky that it didn't happen until 17. I was an early bloomer physically but a really late one socially.)

The next day I was still thinking about it, of course. It finally hit me. Lisa. The chick with long dark hair from my church youth group who dropped acid in the bathroom at my 15th birthday sleepover. I hadn't really invited her over much after that. In fact I hadn't talked to her in two years. We were two grades apart at school (she was younger) and never saw each other. That's why I couldn't figure out who she was when he mentioned it.

*(Side note: Over the next couple months Josh noticed my little sister working at the movie theater at the mall. The way it's set up, she sat at the front desk in a big picture window right by the curb. He started driving by a lot. And staring. And coming in to talk to her a lot while he was ""just hanging out at the mall."" He never asked her out because she had a boyfriend, but through her I learned how he was doing in general (besides stalking my little sister). Details to follow.)*

Three months after the breakup I had an awesome new boyfriend. One night our plans got canceled and we went to the pool hall where I had hung out with Josh. I didn't see his shiny truck outside though, so I knew we were safe to go in.

We weren't safe. Josh was there.

Worse, he saw me and kept trying to get me to look at him and beckoning me over with a finger. I finally told my boyfriend and friend that I would be just a minute and walked across the room to see what he wanted.

He wanted to apologize. To say he should have believed me. To say he's found out since then ""what kind of person"" Lisa is. To ask me to take him back.

I waited out his spiel. Calmly perched my fantastic ass on the edge of his pool table while he was talking. Finally he ran out of steam and I looked him in the eyes.

""It's okay, Josh,"" I said. Waited a beat. ""Because I'm not a virgin anymore.""

I pushed off, walked back across the room to my new boyfriend, and gave him a nice sloppy kiss. Josh never tried to talk to me again.

**Epilogue**

Here is what my sister told me later about him:

He had lost his job and was now working at McDonald's.

He had had to move back in with his parents.

He had had to give the truck to his uncle who took over the payments.

He still dated high school girls because no one older was gullible enough.

And here is what I have found out by accident about Lisa:

She shows up in the city paper's Most Wanted section from time to time for drug dealing, prostitution and failure to show up in court.

I've been with ""new boyfriend"" for 14 years now. We're married.

**Edit:** Wow, I didn't realize how many details I would be able to drudge up from my memory about this by posting the story and answering all the questions.

It was a long trip with three connecting flights, the second of which was a layover in Philly. We stopped for a bathroom break in the airport (you know, as you do) and I noticed the girl ahead of me had left her purse in the stall. I called after her with little success, she was already gabbing away on the phone. I took a couple steps away from the stall and called her again, still no response. So I gave up my stall, despite the fact that I had to pee like a racehorse, and chased after her. I tapped her on the shoulder to tell her she'd left her purse. She turned around and before I could get a word out, gave me the finger. Now I understand that you're not always in your best mood in an airport but seriously? So you know what? No purse for her. I left that thing in the stall right where I found it, because fuck you too lady.

Edit: Wow, thanks guys :) Just to clarify (since GoldenDeLorean pointed it out) the reason I didn't do anything to the purse and just left it where it was, was because I'm only 90% sure that it was hers. I remember her going in with one and leaving without one but there's still a chance I could have been wrong and really fucked someone else over because of an error in judgement.

They're desperate for a reality TV show but they're clearly not professionals. Enraging stuff, to me.

So I went to their website, got their phone number (which they dub the ""tip line"") and told them that I found one of their bounty targets at a hotel in San Diego, so I made them drive all the way there from LA at 1 AM to find out he wasn't actually there.

All was going great until one flunked out and we had to pick up a new roomate fast.  The guy we found to fill the empty room seemed alright at first, but it all went downhill fast.  It started with him eating our food.  All of it, and never buying any food to replace what he ate, or food of his we could eat in revenge.  Then he was late with rent, or didn't have it all.  Then came the borrowing money.  

Finally we had enough, searched around and found him an easy job and we took turns shuttling him to and from work to help him out.  Rent was still late, he still asked to borrow money, but atleast now he bought himself food so we didn't feel bad about him starving.  Great right?  Wrong.  

He never cleaned up the dishes from what he cooked.  He would use 5 pots and pans and leave everything on the stove until one of us got fed up and cleaned it.  He cooked a big ass meal and left it all then went home for fall break.  We took the pans and left them in his room, it smelled like hell when he got back, but he still didn't change.  So we got creative.

After an evening of cooking himself something delicious, not sharing, and leaving all the mess for us to clean we decided to act.  Craigslist has an area for ""Casual Encounters"" and a sub of ""Men 4 Men"".  Perfect.  We made a post ""Looking to suck some big dick while you clean my dishes""  In the rest of the post we post stuff like:  Just looking to suck some bbc while you do my dishes, and I got a ton of dishes.  Send pics of your dick to (roomates number) so I can pick out who is the lucky one.  

It only took minutes to hear a loud ass What the Fuck! come from his room.  For the next two hours he got over 40 dick picks and dozens of texts and calls from gay guys looking to get their dick sucked and clean dishes.

A tale of evil clients and knights in shining QA departments. &amp;nbsp;

**The Setting:**  
Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data, all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but don't want to manage a database to sit behind it.   
  
**The Heroes:**  
I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about 8. I've been working in this place for about 5 years now and I'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything I want to ask about.  
  
My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect. The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. Great boss.  
  
My good friend (who we'll call Greg) works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department. Greg's got my back and I've got his. If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then I'll help him out.  
  
**The Villain:**  
The client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... Douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. When paired together, these things often mean that bad things will happen. To make things worse, this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it. After all, he is a paying customer.  
  
**The Pledge:**  
The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface. It was a good feature, and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time. Implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off. All my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails. One exchange with Douche on this topic went thus:  
  
&gt;*Me:* Hi Douche, its Derp at &lt;Company&gt;. Just calling abou...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh hi, yeah, the slacker at &lt;Company&gt;. Hows it going?  
  
It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call, hence why this was obviously MY fault.  
  
&gt;*Me (biting my tongue):* I'm... I'm OK... thanks. Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh this again? Haven’t you finished that yet?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Well, no. You'll remember that we've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you've been infor...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh for the love of.. Why is it taking so long?  
  
&gt;*Me:* That's what I wanted to ask about. Requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. The problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Look, you're supposed to follow the specification I'VE written, so just do it! I don't want to hear about this again until its done!  
  
The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager, saying that I was being offensive and was questioning his competency. (He can read minds?!?) I then completed this piece of work, ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction.   
  
**The Turn:**  
After the best part of 6 months, and the client is about to go live with their site. They've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it, and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that's when their marketing campaign said it would. Because of these tight deadlines, they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche.  
  
About 3pm Friday afternoon, Greg from CS calls me up says he's got an issue with Douche. Greg now knows first hand how douchy Douche can be. This is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system, any issues they had integrating were not development issues, but customer support issues.  
  
I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun.  
  
&gt;*Me:* 'Sup Greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features)  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Hey Derp.You ever worked on this new API that went up for &lt;Client_Name&gt;?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Yeah, I did the verification process on it. What do you want to know?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* The Client seems to think it doesn't work.  
  
&gt;*Me:* It was implemented to the letter. Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out, haven't they?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Yeah, that's what I thought when I read the documentation. Ok, leave it with me and I'll let Douche know.  
  
I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly what's coming next. After not too long, Steve (the account manager for Douche) storms into QA and straight into Boss' office. There's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually I'm called in.   
  
&gt;*Steve:* Would you care to explain this?  
  
Steve points at an email on Boss' screen. I go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has “obviously not been tested at all”. I'm surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and I've worked on various projects for him in the past.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! It doesn't make sense!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Derp, what did the specification say about this?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* I think that would be a good idea.  
  
I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me, wanting to know what's going on. On the way back, I see Boss trying to calm Steve down.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Here it is.  
  
I slide it across the desk and take a seat. Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But that makes no sense!  
  
&gt;*Me:* I know.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Why didn't you raise this with the client?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I did. I then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Who wrote this specification?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Douche over on their side did. I'm pretty sure you two would have been CC'd on the email when it came across.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Well what are we going to do? We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday! (it's now 3:45 Friday Afternoon)  
  
&gt;*Boss:* No chance. We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. Even then, this is an API that multiple clients are now using and we'll have to be careful not to break their integrations.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Steve, You might want to look at section 21 on that document.  
  
Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. That and I've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* OK, wait there.  
  
Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. The client wrote the requirements, signed off the requirements, signed off the work in Acceptance Testing, and have only 32 hours before they launch. They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight.  
  
***The Prestige:***  
It's 4:45 and I am considering what I'll spend my weekend doing. Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Can you just join me on a conference call?  
  
&gt;*Me:* If it's quick.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* That's up to you really.  
  
Intrigued, I follow him into his office where I can hear a much more humble sounding Douche on the phone, explaining to Steve what needs to be done.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Steve, I have Derp here, do you want to explain what the plan is?  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Derp, we really need to get this sorted. You worked on the original feature so you'll know the best way to test this. We're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for Sunday. We reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* I really need you to help me out here mate, otherwise it'll really hit the fan over here.  
  
I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I've already made plans for this weekend and...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Derp, seriously, you HAVE to help me out here.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I don’t really feel like it.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* It's 5pm on a Friday. Most staff are on their way home or out the door. Sorry Steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week.  
  
Douche rages down the phone and, once this torrent of abuse subsides, Steve lets me go back to my desk.
I'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings.  
  
&gt;*Me:* &lt;Company&gt;, Derp spea...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I need you to do this.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You need to sort this out and calling me won't help you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I'm sorry, just help me out.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. I am not helping you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please...  
  
He's actually crying. You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. So I hang up and leave for my weekend.  
  
**The End:**  
Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the API.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* So, Derp, this is Herp. Another project manager for &lt;Client_Name&gt;.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Is Douche not working on this project?  
  
&gt;*Herp:* Douche no longer works here.  
  
Tl;DR: Douche PM for client writes Spec for API. SPROC logic makes no sense, PM thinks he's infallible. QA Tech questions logic, gets reported for being insulting. Client doesn't test the API, signs it off anyway. It hits the fan, release date is ruined. PM is in DEEP and pleads for help.

I got the cell phone number that I currently have over 10 years ago. I used to live in the 941 area code and have since moved but kept my number the same because it was too much to go through and call 600 people and tell them that it changed (I'm in construction). Ever since, I've gotten phone calls for a tree service that has the exact same exchange and extension, but is from the 863 area code.

This guy must not have his area code on the sign on the side of his truck and must also do quite a bit of work in the 941 area code. I lliterally started receiving calls for him the day I turned my phone on and continue to this day to get at least two per week. At first, I would tell the caller that they had the wrong area code and give them the right one... then after I continued to receive his calls I started calling him and telling him every time I got a call for him.. I'm too damn polite I guess. At one point he even offered to pay me $5 for every call I forwarded to him. I never saw one red cent of that.

Anyway, after a couple of years of doing this, and watching my minutes on our plans get eaten up.. I decided, hell, I'll start referrring them to a friend of mine in that area who has a lawn service... and he will DEFINITELY pay me for it.. So he went out and bought a bucket lift and went into the tree-trimming business.

Now, today, I make up to an extra $100 a week or so redirecting calls from one tree service to another. I doubt home boy there in the 863 even knows, but I do.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_16p7ru,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16p7ru/turning_wrong_numbers_into_profit/,

Except that those interviews I set up were being handed to someone else and instead she told me I had to go and talk to orphans and ask them how the economy was effecting them. I laughed, and said ""No, Gary can do the orphan story, I'll do MY story, thankyouverymuch."" At which point she launched into a tirade, belittling me and basically speaking to me like she was my mother. This has happened a bunch of times. I hung up and texted her. ""Please don't speak to me like that again or I will have to quit."" I got an immediate response: ""Your fired."" I was gutted. But as I looked at my phone again, a wry smile creeped across my face and my thumbs went into action....

*you'RE

We haven't spoken since.

**EDIT:** I suppose I should add that I was at my wick's end (EDIT EDIT: FINE. ""WITS' END"" YOU GLORIOUS PEDANTS) with the company and her as my editor. She was extremely unprofessional. What made this argument special was that she constantly told me I was not delivering enough stories of my own, that she was setting up too many interview for me. Naturally once I start doing this, she hands the best interviews of the day, set up by yours truly, to the chief reporter-- who has stopped talking to me after she handed one of HIS interviews to ME-- and sends me to do some filler about the economy.

He is a fat, lazy, arrogant son of a bitch who loves his lawn more than his own kids. Seriously, he mows the thing in those stupid little patterns and this shit is the greenest I've ever seen.

**The Wronging:** Between both of our property lines, this douchebag planted about 80 evergreen trees as a sort of fence. Well, my dog loved to shit right next to these trees for some reason (on our property of course). My neighbor would get pissed as hell and come onto *our* property and shovel the dog shit up and throw it farther into our yard. It was annoying, but not dickish enough to get a response from us. One day, this prick shoveled the dog shit, and threw it. Only this time, he threw it at our fucking *house*. It was splattered all over our tan siding and even in our driveway.

**Revenge:** That was the last straw. Knowing this motherfucker loved his lawn more than life itself, I exacted the perfect revenge. I snuck out one night and walked over into his lawn. His grass was sooo perfect that you could literally cut out a section with a knife and pull it up like carpet. Well, that's exactly what I did. With a friends help, we cut out a 25 X 25 foot square in the middle of his lawn, took all the grass and threw it on top of his roof. The next day, he stormed onto my porch and knocked furiously. He looked as if he was about to cry. My mother answered and the asshole demanded to see our shovels because ""he will bet there is dirt on it"". My mom replied, ""of course there will be dirt on our shovels you idiot, I don't use it to bake cakes. Get off my fucking property."" Funny thing is, I used a pocketknife to cut it all up. I wish I would've taken pictures. Dickhead.

**Edit:** To answer some questions, we cut up the grass and ripped it up by the handful. Then we threw all the little pieces on the roof as we went. It took about an hour to do, but being as I had a friends help, we managed to do the roughly 25 x 25.

EDIT: This was in Southern Mississippi at the time.

When I was in 7th grade, I was in a private ""christian"" school. Spent the 3 years there. I was spanked many times due to ""problems"" they had with me, including ""demonic"" drawings I made during free time. (They were drawing from the video game, The Legend of Zelda.)

I was spanked for many issues that were non-issues but a biased problem they had or came up with. I was always spanked by the vice principal, normally a male, but witnessed by the offended teacher, normally female.

One day, I had enough. I was spanked for ""fighting"" with another student. (We were playing flag football, he got pissed and physically punched me. I did not respond and we were tattled on by two girls who witnessed and improperly reported the incident.) The vice principal paddled me (it was always three licks) and I turned around, severely angered by the injustice that happened and said, ""you will never strike me again."" The female teacher who I had issues with and was the witnessing party said something along the lines of, ""we'll spank you until you finally learn your place."" I said with all the bitterness I could muster, ""The FUCK you wont!"" The assistant principal, who was paddling me at the time swung me back onto the desk and said, ""you just bought yourself three more licks.""

Before he could swing, I grabbed the long scissors he had on his desk and swung at him, nicking his hand in the process. I swung erratically until he and the female teacher vacated the room and locked me in.

I knew I was in deep shit, so I decided to make the most of the situation, figuring I'd make a point as I went down. I took some autographed bat off his wall and destroyed his office, breaking everything in the room, the nicknacks on his desk, the windows, the phone, everything. I spent a good ten minutes in that room until the police arrived. I surrendered to them without any problem.

This led to the local media getting involved, which worked out to my benefit. The media investigated the school and reported on the issue of the opposite gender witnessing my punishment, the improper reasons for my punishment, and the fact that most of my teachers did not even have a college education.

I was expelled for the incident, but I already had my revenge. I caused a major embarrassment for the school, so much so that they had a high degree of students withdrawn from the school (which caused them to lose a lot of money in tuition funds) and also caused them to change their school name.

It was worth having to repeat the 7th grade. I enjoyed public school from then on.

TL;DR: FUCK THEM ALL!

EDIT 1: Here's some FAQ:

To be honest, my parents didn't believe me up until the incident because of my ""troubled history."" Now looking back, they can see the obvious catch-22 flaw in their logic.

When they picked me up for the police station, they were furious. Ironically, I was given a spankin from my father. My parents had what they called a ""two-for-one"" deal, if I get a spanking at school, I get a spanking at home. Keep in mind, this is the deep south Mississippi where Christian values overrules critical thinking and obvious logic.

It wasn't until the T.V. station called my parents and requested to do an interview with me or them. My parents refused, trying to shield me from any public damage. My parents tune was changed when the reporter basically laid everything out for them, basically proving everything I was saying the whole time, something that doesn't happen very often.

During my time off, as I was expelled, my parents sent me to a counselor. After about a week, I was diagnosed with some type of depression resulting from a repressive atmosphere, and that a drastic change was needed. This is when they decided to send me to public school. The problem with that was that my parents, during my private school days, used public school as a ""threat"" for problems related from school: poor grades, punishments, calls from teachers. They spun public school as a prison-like atmosphere in the roughest part of the ghetto where I would be surrounded by ""blacks."" (Keep in mind I'm the deep south of Mississippi, the REALLY racists part.) The concept of public school had forever been etched in my mind as a sever punishment for the poor and bad. So, when the counselor recommended public school, by parents were faced with another problem, trying to convince that this was not a punishment and was going to be good for me. I spent the time up until the next year of school in a deep depression because of the lies and threats my parents spun towards me.

As far as the teacher's lack of college degrees, no one knew. It wasn't until the tv report that that knowledge was hidden. I can't remember for sure, but either the fact that they were a ""private"" school may have skirted state requirements or that they were discovered and had to make drastic changes. Either way, all my former teachers either quit, or were switched to other position-titles that didn't require degrees like librarian and such. Either way, the school changed names to avoid confusion with this dilemma. (Ironically, the church under the same name as the school, kept its tarnished name.)

If it wasn't for the counselor or the television station's intervention into my already repressive life, I would have been in a worse situation afterwards. I found out that I loved public school (as you don't get any real-world interactions), black people are not the poor-evil people my parents led me to believe (this is cliche, but one of my best friends through high school was African-American, much to the dismay of my racist parents), and that my chaotic-problem child ways were nothing but the over-exaggeration of the private-school's staff.

With all that said, I love my parents, and after all that's happened and the time leading afterwards, they have ""grown-out"" of their ultra-conservative ways. However, I do hold the staff from that school mainly-responsible for my lingering physiological problems (still have a streak of fear shoot through me every time I hear the phone ring at my parents house subconsciously believing it's a teacher calling to get me in trouble). I hope they have already, or will pay in the future, for the unnecessary damage they've caused me and my life.

TL;DR: I already told you, ""FUCK THEM ALL!""

Most of the people work, a few are retired, and some have children. Everyone tries not to be a jerk, out of sheer common curtesy(?), and it works for the most part. Except for the neighbors who moved in last year, right above my dad. The owner decided to upgrade the crappy carpet to not quite wood floors, in all the units, right before they moved in, it's relevant. They look quite nice really and everyone is happy with the results.

My dad likes to take vacations a lot, maybe 4-5 a year, and always invites my BF and I to stay at his place. Partly so we have a space to ourselves for a bit, and partly so someone is watching his place. I don't mind, there's a pool. So, while he was gone last spring new neighbors moved in right above him. Hispanic family, two teenage boys, nothing special. As their moving in the first thing to go in is a nice stereo system. They wanted to listen to music as they brought all their stuff up and unpacked, I can dig it. It wasn't bad, a little eclectic, but overall some pretty good songs. But now, they play that stereo all the time, at all hours of the day and night. Keeping up people who have to work the next morning. 
Offense #1
Remember those wood floors that were put in right before they moved in. Apparently they let their sons skateboard across it, I've seen their oldest do a kick flip over the door jam and have heard the wheels going across the floor.
Offense #2

After a year of this going on, my dad has had it. Numerous calls to the landlord/owner do nothing. Dad went around to talk with the other neighbors to see if they are as fed up with this shit as he is, ""You are!?! Well, as it just so happens I have a plan, but I wanted to run it by you and see if you're ok with it.... YOU ARE!?! Have a nice day.""

Remember when I said dad lives right below them. 

Now everytime they start making too much noise dad calmly puts in his ear plugs he uses at the shooting range, and lets loose a 15-20 second blast of an airhorn.

Said he's only had to do it 4 times and already it's had amazing effects.

I admire my dad for his asshole-ery and can only hope to emulate it one day.

There was one douchebag waiter (let's call him Carl) who would always leave without cleaning up his section first, as we were supposed to do, so anytime someone took over for him, he'd jolt out and leave an apocalyptic mess that the server taking over the section had to clean up.  

We'd all complain to management, but whenever they talked to him he'd claim it was an isolated incident and that he didn't mean to leave a mess, it'd never happen again, etc.

They spilled drinks, melted ice cream, crumbs, all kinds of crap everywhere.  I'm talking all over the table and on the floor.   It was frightening.

The head of the table tipped me very generously and they started to get up to leave.  At that moment, I saw Carl walking in to the back break area to put his apron on and get ready for his shift.  I could smell the sweet aroma of revenge.

I walked into the management office and said ""Carl's finishing up my section now, so I'm leaving, okay?""  The manager on duty said ""yeah, sure.""

I told the hostess ""Carl's on and he'll take care of table 32 (or whatever number it was).""

Then I walked out and watched through the window outside as Carl was told by the hostess that he was cleaning up that horrid mess and then proceeded to flip the fuck out.

I called the property manager and told her that chicken chain had left several boxes in the back hallway that were unbroken down and had raw chicken in them and I would call the health department if something wasn't done because it will attract rodents. The next day when the chicken chain manager got in she came over to ask me if anything strange happened and if we had boxes in front of our doors when we came in too.

We had a few arguments about it, and I laid down the law that he was not to eat ANY of it without asking. He continued to poach and hamburgle, so I began adding more hot sauce. He continued to poach, so I escalated the severity of the hot sauce every week. Eventually I got entirely sick of this, made a HUGE batch, and added most of a bottle of 'Z', an oily black concentrated extract of pure burning misery. I told him in no uncertain terms not to eat it.

Not only did Landfill eat it, he ate the entire thing. Over a gallon and a half of chili. I was enraged. I ran to his room to confront him, and was assailed with the most miserable stench. What he did to the bathroom can only be described as a holocaust of feces. He recreated the Hungarian sludge disaster. There was feces and vomit in the back of the linen closet. The smell of feces and vomit was strongly scented with pure capsaicin. I open his door and there is a vast fetal heap laying on a orange-stained, flattened mattress. His eyes are crimson, a filth-soaked towel under his freely running mouth and nose. He weakly gestures towards a stack of money on his table. It was over twice what I paid for ingredients.

So it was 11:45 and I was just arriving back at Papa Johns after finishing my route. It was a Saturday night and I wanted to get back home to the wife and kids. It was only me and my manager clean up as it was a very slow day.

All of a sudden, we get a call from a very rude lady. She needs two large pizzas and a 2 liter bottle of Coke as soon as possible. This lady lives at the edge of our territory, about 30 minutes away. I look at my boss to see if I can just tell her we're closed. 

He says no, we must serve this lady. It is policy. I sigh to myself, but it is my job. 

So we heat up some pizzas in the oven that was going to be dinner for me and my manager, and I grab the Coke and head out to the customer's house. At about 12:25 I arrive. I answer the door and immediately she complains why I had taken so long. She demands free pizza. I say no, that is not policy and I cannot do that.

She gives up, and just wants the pizza. I give her the pizza. I go get Coke from car. When I arrive to the front door with the Coke, the woman starts to act crazy. She specifically ordered Fanta, she says. I show the woman, on the receipt, she had ordered Coke. My manager took the order, he heard Coke.

She demands free pizza for this. I tell her again, ""This I cannot give. You can either take the Coke, or I will take the Coke. No refund.""

This woman is still acting crazy, so I decide to call boss and explain situation. He says, ""You must drive back here and grab a Fanta and deliver it to her.""

This is the moment where I had given up getting home while my wife was awake. I tell the woman it will take another hour before she gets her Fanta. She is fine with that.

I drive back and I grab the Fanta. My boss says sorry, it is policy. I understand. There is no problem.

I have never shaken soda before. There is no reason, it fizzes and explodes. I had a reason this time. I shook that soda up and down, left and right. I shook it with one arm and drove with the other. I released all my anger onto that soda for 30 minutes. Shake. Shake. Shake.

I walk up to the door while still shaking the soda. There is no anger anymore. Just shake. The woman opens the door. I give her the soda. I tell her to have a good night.

She is thoughtful enough to leave a tip. 2 dollars. I take, thank for business, and go back to my car.

On the way home I receive a call from my manager.

""Can you believe it? Now the woman's making up a lie that the soda exploded in her face to get a refund. I can't believe people these days. Sorry for keeping you up late for this bitch, James.""

""No problem boss, see you tomorrow.""

She lived 9 hours away and I was the only one with a car, so naturally i drove us there and back. I missed easter weekend with my entire family, just so i could finally meet her family for the first time. I really wanted to spend easter with my own family because there were relatives from out of country that i had not seen in a few years, but I chose to meet my girlfriends family instead.
The weekend went fine and we returned home without any problems.

However the next day my girlfriend went out to a birthday party for one of her friends i didnt know, so i stayed at home and just hung out with a few of my friends.
My girlfriend ends up getting black out drunk and returns home, puking on and off for hours (she always ended up this way when she drank). I take care of her for a little while until one of our mutual friends sends me a text saying we need to talk.

He came over to my house the next morning, informing me that my girlfriend had had sex with a dude at the party. I was furious. One day after meeting her entire family, she decides to cheat on me. So right after finding out i decide to confront her about what our friend had just told me. She owned up to it all, and telling me she also had sex with 2 other guys throughout our relationship, one of the guys she banged was my neighbour, and to make it worse, it was on my own birthday.

I broke up with her on the spot.

I decided the only thing to do was facebook inbox her mother. I started by saying thanks so much for the easter weekend and it was great to meet her family, then i explained that her own daughter had cheated on me with a few guys and that we are no longer together.

Her mom flipped out and eventually her entire family found out that she was a whore/cheating girlfriend. She hated the fact that i ruined her image of herself for her family, and her image her friends had of her.

She also ended up getting an non-permanent STD from this guy, making her life even worse for the next month or so. Dodged a huge bullet there, because i would have likely got it if i hadnt broken up with her that day.

Telling her mom was extremely petty, but it did feel good to fuck up her life a bit, after what she did to me. 

Lesson: Don't cheat.

tl;dr: GF cheated on me and got an STD from the guy, i told her mom/family about it all. Ruined her image.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_15akv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/15akv9/cheating_girlfriend_ruining_her_image_revenge/,

I worked in a high-rise building and a few people did not understand elevator etiquette, particularly letting people off the lift before entering.

One woman was particularly bad about this. She was older, probably in her 50s and just a miserable person. For one reason or another, we always found ourselves running into each other, sometimes quite literally, over the course of years that I worked in that location.

Every time she would sigh and give me an indignant “Excuse me.” 

Now I’m a pretty easy going guy and it takes a lot to get me frustrated or angry but over the years, this woman had me hot. I tried to change my routine to avoid her but it seems like she just rode the elevator all day. I would still run into her at least once a day, every day.

Word came down that I was moving to a new location. I wasn’t even planning this, but on my last day there, I ran into her again. The same indignant “Excuse me.” Not having matured past the age of 13, I let out a fairly nasty beer fart into the elevator. “No, excuse me” I said, exiting the elevator. As the elevator doors closed, I watched her face change from surprise to absolute disgust. 

I know it was petty, disgusting and immature, but I regret nothing.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1i618h,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1i618h/elevator_etiquette/,

They were packed as usual and was settling in for a long wait.


It wasnt long into the wait that I began to take notice of a small group of children, maybe 6-8 years old, and running around the store laying their hands on each phone, being loud, and trying to one up each other on the amount of toys or games they had.


Unattended children already annoy me and here's a group of them stuck in the store with me.  Great.   But it got worse.


The loud brats kept going over to one phone in particular to play that ""Crank that"" song by Soulja Boy.  Sometimes back to back.  The amount of hatred that I have for that ""song"" is astronomical.  So they're just rubbing salt in the wound now.  And they wanted the whole store to hear.  They maxed the volume on the phone to the point where the speakers were bottoming out.  So yes, it was loud.


After about the 4th or 5th time of them circling back around to the phone and having a loud dance off, I looked at my wife and said ""I have to deal with this.""  She wasnt sure if I was going to deal with the children or the phone so she was slightly concerned.


They all had their backs to the phone when I picked it up and the song suddenly stopped, they spun around and looked up to a 6'2 215lbs scowl.


Not one of them said a word and my focus stayed on the phone as I went through the menu and did a factory reset on the phone.


Feeling quite accomplished, I walked back over to my wife and sat down and explained what I did.  We both sat there watching the kids trying to bring the song back and finally giving up after about 5 min.  My wife glanced around the room and said there were quite a few people watching them and giggling to themselves.


The icing on the already delicious cake was when one of the kids went to their mother.  She was about what you would expect of someone that would let their kid annoy everyone in a store.  Around my age at the time, 25ish, and obviously not that interested in being a parent.  The kid whined about the phone and then looked around the room to point to me.  I was watching out of the corner of my eye when he pointed and his mother looked up to me with a squinty look that you typically give an unfamiliar far off noise youve just heard.


Fortunately for me, my stature is already intimidating, Ive been 6'2"" since junior high, and the default setting for my face is an expression that always looks pissed off.  Its just the card Ive been dealt and Im always asked if Im mad at something and have to reply with a laugh and ""No, this is just my normal expression"".


So when I saw her squint in my direction, I turned my face toward them with enough speed to tell them that I was watching indirectly and gave her a wide eyed stone face stare.


I could have stared straight at them while the kid whined, but it wouldnt have been as startling.  The snap to reaction I gave her should have planted that thought that I was going to keep an eye on them.


Pretty sure it worked because when I reacted to her look, she jerked back and looked back to her brat, grabbed him by the arm and sat him down beside her.


Every so often I would catch her glancing in my direction, to which I would reply with a slow glare back, but she would snap back straight before I fully got around.


Thats when I learned just how uncomfortable people can be when they realize they're being watched.

(As in deftly strumming and hooting and hollering to music)

  They got a new cat last night and they kept me up past 1am by meowing back at it every time it meowed therefore egging it on so it meows more... (this would be cute in the day time... not while I am trying to sleep)

My petty revenge? Oh its so sweet and simple and deliciously petty. ""What did you do?"" You must be asking.

 Well here's how it went:

*Picked up cell phone, text the apartment manager (no not at 1am... during the daytime when he does the early morning cleanup around 8:30am) ((no he cant hear the loud noises either because he is in another building)) ""Did you see the neighbors new cat? I can hear it meowing through my walls, sounds really cute.""* Sounds harmless right? NOT. Now the apartment manager will have to charge them a monthly pet fee! Petty revenge is served!

OK let me put something to help you people out who obviously don't know what PETTY means...

I have tried to talk to them nicely, I have gotten the manager involved and tried to make a truce, i HAVE tried beating on their door at 1am on a night that i work at 5am the next morning to ask them to stop. It doesn't work because they are DRUNK that means that they don't know what the fuck they are doing. So instead of constantly trying to work out peace with them I do petty things like tell the manager about the new cat.

My job is already low on hours because my boss doesn't want to give medical insurance , I'll be damned if I'm going to loose more hours or even get fired because I was LETTING my next door neighbor be douchebags because its the NICE thing to do.

AND for the record: I LOVE CATS! If they played with it all fucking day long until 11pm or something I would NEVER say anything. (even if they where drunkenly singing to their cat during the daytime)

So, for me to find a restaurant that will cater to my needs and wants is pretty difficult, but if and when I ever did you find one, I am a very regular and loyal customer.


One of my favorite dishes I like to eat is a good ole Southern-style steak and potatoes. One of my allergies is a severe cheese allergy (not a milk allergy; I'm not going to get into a discussion or an argument with anyone online, just take my word for it) and I've never been fond of large chunks of garlic.


This one major-chain restaurant that I found offered this meal at a reasonable price. The only alteration I had to make what's to the potato. In the morning, they would take the potatoes out of the refrigerators and add cheese and garlic to them. The manager there was nice and said that she would happily prepare my potato by taking a fresh one out of the freezer and microwaving it, bypassing the additives that I could not eat and did not like. All I would have to do is ask for the manager when I was seated, and she would take care of the rest.


This was not a major problem for the manager. It could easily be done, it just required a little extra effort on her behalf.


So I made this a weekly tradition. I would take my girlfriend-at-the-time out for lunch, make my special request, enjoy my meal, and leaving nice tip for the managers and waitresses efforts.

I did this for a good year. 

Then one day, when I ask for the manager, I was greeted by a younger lady. I was told that the previous manager had been shifted to another restaurant. I proceeded with my order. When I made my special request, I was told that was not possible. I told her about my history with the restaurant and the previous manager is she quickly retorted with a story that they had switched difference food suppliers, and that the cheese and garlic was added prior to the freezing process it was delivered to them prenate. I was irked by her callousness but succeeded my goal of eating a cheeseless potato.


Flash forward a month or so, I traveled about 60 miles north to visit my been girlfriend at her college. We go out to eat at the same name restaurant. Once we were seated, I notice that the manager was the same lady from my hometown restaurant. she comes over and takes my order, asking if I wanted my usual.


I hesitate a moment, informing her of her restaurants change in policy. She informs me that there has been no change, the new manager straight up lied to me, and that manager has been known to be lazy and a liar. She further tells me that she only gets all her ass to serve customers only if there is a group of eight or more, and she only cares for getting the large tips at the efforts of her help.

Armed with this knowledge and a birthday coming up in the near future, I gather my parents and a group of my friends (totaling 14 people in all) for my yearly treat of a birthday dinner.

Before going into the restaurant, I discuss my plan with my entourage. everyone goes in with their knowledge of what's to come.


We are all greeted and seated by the manager. she goes to everyone around the table and takes their drink order. Everyone suspiciously orders water with no lemon.


After everyone had their chance to look at the menu, everyone places the order with the manager. are you insisted everybody go ahead of me as I was "" still deciding.""

After everyone that placed their order, I make my move. I order my state with my plane potatoes. She immediately tells me that that is not possible. shop in slightly disappointed, I asked her why that is. She gives me a similar yet slightly different excuse than she did before. When she finished, I said that was funny because the previous manager (I drop her name, which seems to spark an aura of worry) is a good friend of mine and still works for the company and that she told me that that story was a load of bullshit, and that's a feeling my order as requested it is easily capable. 

Irked by my ever so clever game, she defiantly refuses my order as requested. I sheeplishly ask since it was my birthday, and a special occasion, if an exception to be made. She seem to enjoy telling me ""absolutely not.""

 I slump my shoulders and defeatedly say ""alright."" and with my command, everyone at my table stands up in unison, almost as if we had practice this all before. 

Realizing she's about to lose a big payday, she quickly backpedals like I have never seen. she says that she'll go back and check with the cook to see if an exceptions can be made.

Curiously I ask her, ""but I thought you said ' absolutely not?'"" She says, ""well... let me just double check!"" I thanked her and asked her if she didn't mind.

She quickly scampers off to the kitchen, during which we all leave because we had a reservation at the restaurant across the street.

This whole flight was extremely delayed and overbooked, arriving about three hours later than intended. Everyone was tired, everyone was pissed off. 

Then the plane landed, and we were held on the plane for a couple minutes while they de-boarded the first class people first.

Her uncle (and mine) was born to a family of 8 children. In that environment, there is not much room for bratty selfishness if your siblings can gang up on you and humble the crap out of you. So he was babysitting my cousin one day (we'll call her BC for bratty child) when she was 7 years old. Now, she believed that any object of interest belonged to her. Every toy another child played with, any book you were reading, any food any anything. It was hers. Her favorite word was ""MINE!""

My uncle was not going to put up with this and decided to plan a devious and petty revenge. If she wants to play that way, then my uncle was going to stoop to her level.

My uncle walks into the room with a paper bag in his hand. BC cannot see what is inside.

BC: ""What is that?""

Uncle: ""what is what?""

BC: ""The bag! What's in the bag! Give it to me! IT'S MINE!!""

Uncle: (with extremely calm voice) ""no...no this is my bag and you cannot have it.""

BC's face crumples into rage as she turns red and starts to scream at the top of her lungs.

BC:"" MINE MINE MINE! GIVE IT TO ME IT'S MINE!!""

Uncle: ""No, BC, you can't have everything you want. This is my bag and everything inside it.""

BC is havin' none o' dis. She lies down in the floor, screaming and kicking her legs and pounding her fists into the ground. Tears streaming down her beet red face. It's a wonder she doesn't lose her voice. My Uncle continues to calmly assert his claim over the bag to BC for another five minutes. Which is a long time to deal with a brat of such magnitude. He has the patience of a saint. A devious saint. Finally, my Uncle yields.

Uncle: (smiling) ""Okay BC! You can have the bag. It's yours!"" (his smile turned from calm to evil. BC doesn't notice)

BC jumps up from the floor, all anger wiped from her face and replaced with the smugness of a spoiled victor. She smiles and gives my Uncle one of those ""I knew you'd give up, I always get my way"" looks. BC greedily snatches the paper bag away from my uncles hands and excitedly opens it like a child on Christmas morning. Her smile replaces surprise, then shock. Her face turns white as she realizes what just happened. 

BC: ""W-what I, b-but I... It's empty!""

Uncle smiles back at her.

BC: ""Y-you...YOU TRASHCAN HEAD!!""

Yes, that was the worst insult my cousin knew at the time. The shame was too great for her. She bolted to her room and slammed the door, giving my uncle complete and utter peace and quiet for the remaining hour or two until her parents came home. Victory at last.

And for those wondering, my cousin grew up to be the sweetest most loving person. She is a wonderful sister, daughter, and friend. She still can't believe she acted that way when she was young, but trashcan head became a running joke in my family for years to come. Good thing when bad kids are humbled enough, they can turn out alright!

Edit: thanks for such great response! More petty revenge funny stories will come soon!

I was having a grand old time riding my Razor scooter around my apartment complex and thought I would ride by the pool and see if my friends were there. My friends were not there, but there was a kid who was a few years younger than me, maybe 3rd or 4th grade.

Anyway, for whatever reason this kid ran up to me brandishing some shitty made in China water gun, the kind that can shoot maybe a few feet. I was fully clothed and didn't wish to be squirted with water, and I said as much to this kid. But no, with the biggest shit eating grin on his face he squirted me with water and ran away. Annoyed, I rode my Razor scooter back home and changed my shirt.

A few days later my mom and I were driving by Toys R Us and I asked to go inside. Somehow I managed to convince her to buy me a $40 Super Soaker, an absolute beast. I could hardly contain my anticipation on the drive home, the fires of revenge burned bright in my heart. 

We got home later that day and I immediately went off on a scouting mission to the pool, booking on my Razor scooter as fast as it would go. I get to fence separating the pool area and look inside, sure enough the kid was there and he was actually running around squirting people with his shitty water gun still. It was perfect.

I hustle home and fill up my massive Super Soaker and make my way on foot (it was too heavy to ride a scooter with) to the pool. I get to the pool and pump this motherfucker until it can't pump anymore. I open the gate, walk in, and beeline straight for this kid. 

He has his back turned but as I approach and people behind him see me and exclaim at the size of my water gun he also turns in curiosity. As soon as he turns I unleash a massive torrent of water at him, it's as if somebody turned on a high pressure hose because that's how badass this Super Soaker I got was. He yells ""stop"" and futilely puts his hands up to try and quell the torrent, but it won't let up. He begins to cry but still the torrent doesn't let up.

Finally, the Super Soaker ran out of pressure and stops, and the kid is sitting on the ground sobbing. My dark work complete, I leave.

The ONE bathroom was beyond disgusting.  Apparently aiming was something only done with a gun while hunting.  They never bought toilet paper and weren't even considerate enough to replace an empty roll with a new one from the stash (I bought) under the sink.  Besides the fact that they were inconsiderate slobs, they guys would devour all of the food I purchased.  One time I made lasagne (from scratch).  I took it out of the oven and set it on the stove to cool.  While it was cooling I figured I had time to shower.  During the twenty min. I was showering those assholes ate the entire pan.  I was fuming and they thought they were hilarious. 
After a month I had had enough and decided to move out.  My best friend moved at the same time because she had caught her boyfriend cheating.  The guys were at work while we packed boxes and loaded them in the truck.  In addition to taking everything that was mine, (including toilet paper) I also packed up every newspaper, magazine, and paper product I could find.  When everything was safely in the truck I went back into the house and proceeded to bake a large pan of brownies containing the secret ingredient, ex-lax.  The guys came home from work just as I was pulling them from the oven.  I told them I had to take a load of my stuff to my new place and I would be back to get the brownies and ""some other stuff"" in about 30 minutes.  They exchanged looks and grins amongst themselves and said, ""Ok.""  I left and came back 30 min later; just long enough to pop my head in the door and see an empty pan of brownies. 

At the request of many I am editing the follow-up into my post.  A few months later my friend got back with her boyfriend for a short time. (She had bad taste in men, but was a loyal friend and never ratted me out.) She said that after three months the house still didn't smell right and there were several large, dark stains on the carpet that had not been there when I left. Her boyfriend told her that while they were broken up, he and his buddies all got food poisoning at work. (They all worked in the same restaurant kitchen .) His words to her were, ""Horrible explosive diarrhea."" As I type this, I feel an overwhelming sense of pride to report that numerous pants were shat, a bucket and trash can became improvised commodes, and t-shirts utilized for wiping. (Apparently they discovered that socks not only weren't absorbent enough; they were quite abrasive to a raw asshole.)

1359165752.0,848,self.pettyrevenge,17akqr,It took almost twenty years for this one...,1053,205,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17akqr/it_took_almost_twenty_years_for_this_one/,"I was just reminded of this while chatting with some friends. I know it's a wall of text, but trust me: it's worth the read.

When I was a child I was severely dehydrated because I had no natural thirst. In attempt to get me to drink more often, I was allowed to take a small cooler to school that contained different types of juices, which I would be more inclined to drink than straight water. This generally worked out fine, but my second grade teacher was a real miserable bitch. She was grossly fat (morbidly obese), always wore sleeveless muu-muu dress-things that displayed the horrific growths in her unshaven armpits, sported a steel-wool mustache... You know the type.

There are many examples of shit she did to me: constantly keeping me inside during recess, kept me from going to lunch one day (I went home and told my mother about that one, so it never happened again), she *cut my fucking hair* in class when one of the other kids got gum stuck in it, but the constant battle was the drink cooler. At first, she tried refusing to let me drink in class. I was accustomed to having drinks at my desk and was always quiet about it, never spilled, and never taunted the other kids about it... mostly because I really hated drinking, even delicious juice, and never saw having a ""special circumstance"" as something worth bragging about. When she was overruled by the principal/my doctor's note, she started enforcing random rules about the drinks. One instance I remember was while we were trying a new juice... only it turned out to not really be a juice, but was a weird Jell-O consistency thing in a bottle that was similar to a Mondo drink. I've always been repulsed by Jell-O (IT'S FUCKING CREEPY DON'T JUDGE ME ;_;) and the taste made me gag even if the consistency wouldn't. I wasn't allowed to throw it away: I had to finish it in front of the class, gagging and crying the whole time. Keep in mind, I was not the only object of her torment throughout the year. There were a handful of other students she loved to single out and humiliate.

My attitude toward this hateful bitch may come across as petty, but I *loved* school until I had to stay with this bitch eight hours (or longer, when she kept me after school, too) a day for nearly a full year. She killed my love for school, I won't even begin to guess how she contributed to my subsequent depression and severe anxiety, and I struggled right up until the day I graduated.

**The revenge**: almost twenty years later, I am a receptionist (and a returning college student!) at the front desk of a nursing home. One of my duties is control of petty cash, which includes releasing funds from a resident's private account. I come in one morning last autumn to see a familiar surname on our resident roster. Curious, I check his personal information. Sure enough, his spouse is a certain miserable bitch who tormented me and destroyed my budding passion for academia.

One of my other duties is to accept guest meal orders. It wasn't really intentional, but the circumstances were perfect when she came down the first evening looking for food. She showed up at my desk with labored breath (from that *dreadful* elevator trek down one floor down from her husband's room...) and asked about how to get dinner. I patiently explained the ordering process (two choices for full meals, a full variety of à la carte items to choose from, etc.) and took her order. When I told her it would cost $5, I got a blank stare.

""But my husband is staying here.""

""Yes, and his meals are covered by the cost of his stay here. As a visitor, your meals are not.""

""Well, that's stupid. I don't have any money down here."" Annnnnnd it hits me. 

""Of course. It's possible to withdraw the money from your husband's private account. Would you prefer to do that?""

""*Annoyed sigh* YES."" This could be a beautiful thing. Due to a recent unrelated incident, we were cracking down on family members accessing a resident's private account. So naturally, I respond cheerfully...

""Okay! Are you your husband's Power of Attorney?"" OH, THE HATEFUL GLARE. YES.

""No, my sister is."" Internally, I'm so excited I'm practically squirming. I don't even wonder about why her sister would be her husband's PoA (though I later check out his information and see that the sister is his *health care proxy*, which is completely different)... Of course, I remain coolly professional.

""Unfortunately you aren't authorized to withdraw money from his account, then,"" I manage an empathetic frown as I pull out a withdrawl form for her, ""however you can take this and have him sign it, then have one of the nurses witness it, and bring it back! Once that's all taken care of, I can order your meal right away.""

""But I'm his wife! I have authorization for all of his bank accounts!"" YOUR TEARS ONLY MAKE ME STRONGER, BITCH.

""Yes, but this is a personal account through the care facility, we are very careful about the security of these accounts as a patient's trust in all aspects of the care they receive are of utmost importance to us. It also prevents any legal complications that may arise from miscommunication."" She tries to argue some more, but, wielding a vocabulary full of syllables, I quickly send her waddling back upstairs. I know, by this point, that all of the nurses will be busy performing their evening care duties and she will have to waddle from one end of the unit to the other to find one that isn't elbows-deep in bathing, changing, or feeding a resident. It's almost half an hour before she returns, panting for breath and covered in sweat.

I made that bitch go get a withdrawl request every single time she wanted to feed that fat fucking face, 3-4 times a day.

This second bar was just down the road, about a brisk 5 minute walk, and is a very busy spot in my city (pretty big lineup most nights, especially weekends). Now, I do admit, I was a little drunk, but nothing major to the point I was making a fool of myself.

Anyways, I depart from my friends at the first establishment, and start to walk to bar 2. I dont usually go to a bar myself, and nobody else does really my age or in my city. So I guess I kind of look like a loser while Im going to the second bar. This group of really good looking girls (4 of them) walk by me. I innocently smile and say hello.

Well, I guess that was a demonic move, because one of the girls turns around and starts yelling at me, calling me names, and pretty much just making me look like a loser (which i already kind of looked like i guess because I was alone).

Whatever. 

Fuck it, no big deal.

The girls move quicker than me and move on ahead of me. All of a sudden, a green crisp $20 bill flies out of the purse of the girl who yelled at me. It floats ever so majestically towards me in the strong wind, and I happen to grasp it out of the air gracefully. Now, I would typically be the gentleman and return the money to whoever dropped it, but this female was so rude to me just a moment ago that i instead thought: ""fuck dis bitch yo! dis mine!""

I waltz in front of the entire line, pass those bitches, and walk right up to the bouncer, give him the patented ""sup-bro-hand-slap-one-shoulder-hug"" maneuver and make my way into the packed bar.

The look on the faces of those girls in line was one of pure astonishment and surprise. it was classic. to make matters worse, i come out for a cigarette an hour late with some girls and some friends and see the group of girls that have finally reached the front of the line. they are arguing with the bouncer because the girl yelled at me has no money left to get into the club.

So I had just started getting into philosophy and history, and was doing a lot of reading. I had heard nothing but great things about kindles, so after a few days of research I ended up getting the regular one without the backlight. I really wanted it because I was going on a long road trip, so I went to best buy to pick one up. It worked great for my trip, and I was really happy about it. About a month later, I go to bed and turn it off, going to its ad screen. I put it on my nightstand and go to sleep. When I wake up in the morning, I grab it to finish a chapter before work. When I push power, half the screen goes on and half stays stuck on the ad in this weird ink looking mixture. So I take it to best buy to get it replaced.

Get to best buy, and of course the line is 20 people deep. Oh well, I just sit back and wait. After literally 30 minutes I get to the rep and explain the situation, she takes one look and says I broke it, must have dropped it. Tells me I am Sol and ""should have bought the warranty."" I asked for a manager and was told the same thing. At this point I am practically foaming at the mouth with anger. 

After a number of unheard complaints I called amazon in a last ditch effort. My jaw practically hit the floor when she told me I'd get a replacement shipped for free in one day.

Now as happy as I was about this, I really didn't want it anymore through best buy, so I came back to the store to see the same bitch behind the counter. Came up, returned the new one amazon sent me, and told her thanks for not telling me about the amazon warranty. She didnt say a word. 

Then I returned the 700 dollar TV I had just bought from the same store. Her face when I pulled out the receipt and asked for help with it out of my car was pure gold.

Last year, I was sharing a flat with a friend of mine - I have since moved in with my girlfriend, though we are still good friends. 

Due to working different hours, we would generally buy/cook/eat our own food. Every now and again, I would buy bag of nuts/raisins/other snacky food. Sometimes, I would share, sometimes I wouldn't. Flatmate never bought snacks, but I was fine with this. Sometimes though, he would use the last of something we would share (toilet paper, for example), but would not replace it. This annoyed me.

So, one day, I buy a large bag of delicious, salted pistachio nuts in shells, which I put in a bowl with the intention of them lasting a few days. The bowl is placed on the table in front of the couch and I tell Flatmate he could have some if he wants. Flatmate proceeds to eat some nuts and put the shells back into the bowl. No problem, except he keeps eating them and eating them until there are only about half left. By this point, I've only had about a handful and decide to tell him to take it easy, as I would actually like them to last - *pistachios aren't cheap*. He stops.

The next day, I return late from work to find that he has finished the remaining nuts, leaving me with only those inevitable closed little bastards that you can't break into - there are usually a few in each bag - and the empty shells. This annoyed me, having specifically requested that he leaves some for me.

Knowing my flatmate, he will have gained some enjoyment from eating them all in my absence, which irked me more.

I took my revenge the next time he was out by distributing the empty shells throughout his bedroom and personal property, including his pillow cases, duvet, mattress, socks and toiletry bag amongst other things...like his milk and yoghurt. 

The pièce de résistance though, was depositing a few of those hard little shells into his running shoes, underneath the foam insoles. Not so obvious that you can feel them if you put your hand in, but hard enough that when you run in them, it's uncomfortable.

It took him weeks to find most of them, but he didn't find the ones in his running shoes for months, during which time he complained that he had found running uncomfortable and that his calf muscles hurt - I assumed this was from adjusting his running style but I may be wrong. He found them eventually, but said nothing.

Back when I was in high school, I worked at a local Stop and Shop as a 'porter' (cart bitch and mess cleaner). I hated it a lot, but I liked some of the people I worked with and it was a really easy job where I got to fuck off a bit and just hide behind the store or something and listen to music or watch movies on my iPod.  


I hated it, though, in large part due to the customers. If you have ever worked in a food store or any service job, you already understand. People are miserable, people are rude, and they will take out their frustration on the minimum wage high school student.  


More often than not, I worked the 6-10 closing shift on carts. They had 4 hour shifts and I wasn't home from school until 3:15 or 3:30 most days, so I never could work the 2-6 shift. This story takes place during the night shift.   


I was pushing a long line of carts, maybe about 20 of them. They become a bitch to steer at this point, but it was more efficient. Maybe. Probably not. But the managers didn't like us doing this, and I did it just to feel rebellious. So I'm pushing this line of carts, and I have it angled perfectly to go into the store vestibule where the carts are. It's going to be flawless. I just gotta get it up the slight incline (pain in the ass, but good for water runoff).  

This is where Douchebag comes into play. Douchebag comes flying into the parking lot off the highway in his Nissan Versa. Cool car bro. Anyway, he's definitely driving at an unsafe speed for a grocery store parking lot. I'm about 1/4 of the way into the road (really just the space between the store entrance and the parking spaces) and pushing the carts pretty hard. Douchebag doesn't care and doesn't slow down. He finally realizes he's not going to make it (I wasn't really aware of how fast he was going because it was in my peripherals) and slams on his brakes and honks his horn. He then just drives up the curb behind me and goes around the long way of the parking lot.  


I was on my way back into the parking lot and he was on his way into the store when we crossed paths. He's probably in his late 20s or early 30s with a goatee, sunglasses (it's like 9 pm in February, get real dude), wifebeater and tatted arms. He looks at me and says, ""Watch where you're going with the carts, fatty.""  

So that was pretty uncalled for. It didn't bother me that much because the guy is a loser and people are rude anyway. But I still want revenge this Douchebag because it's a pretty shitty way to treat people.  


I walked over to his car, stuck two fingers down my throat, and vomited up stomach acid on his driver's side door handle.

But then it's clear that she has to figure out what she wants, and the what the 3+ kids in the car want as well. Okay, whatever. It happens.

Anyway. It takes about a minute or two for them to look over the menu. Then each kid takes about a minute each to decide what they want, and even once that's done she doesn't know what she wants. Annoying... but at least the cooks are able to start making the stuff the kids want while she orders.

So after a bit of ho-humming she decides she wants a cheeseburger meal. Awesome! Finally done with the order!

.... Nope. Now she's decided she doesn't want one of the kids meals and wants to make one of the meals just larger fries and drink, and instead of a cheeseburger she wants a hamburger. This means we have wasted junior meat and buns and chicken nuggets. Not to mention the cheeseburger has to be remade because you can't just scrape the cheese off...

So when I ring her up, instead of deleting the cheeseburger and ringing up the hamburger, I change it to a cheeseburger with no cheese.

We were both under eighteen (her 16, me 17) and she wasn't supposed to be dating (or at least, that's what she told me).

Fast forward a few weeks and not only has she stopped talking to me altogether, I find out that she's got a new boy toy. I was a little hurt, alright, but whatever, you get used to that sort of thing.

Now, she'd always told me stories about how she could get into bars and clubs, since she looks older than she is, and claimed to be friends with a lot of the bouncers. I'd never been to a club, but I took her word for it. 

Fast forward to last weekend. I'm experiencing clubbing for the first time (DDing for some friends). Well, she shows up. I immediately feel all that pent up frustration towards her come shooting out of my chest, much like how many of the patrons would feel while spending the night next to a public toilet. I try and get her attention, but as I approach the group she's with, she quickly darts away from me and refuses to acknowledge my existence.

Wrong move, bitch.

Being sober in a club doesn't have many advantages; however, the bouncers are always willing to listen to a sober man's word. So when I told one that I'd trade him the location of an underage drinker for a Coke, he happily obliged. I pointed her out, and watched from afar as her fake ID was checked and declined. After a small shouting match, I watched as her and her entire posse were escorted out through the back doors.

Needless to say, it was the best Coke I'd ever had.

***Tl;dr.*** *Bitch threw bleach on my clothes in the dryer and she got what was coming to her.*

I joined the Air Force in 2010 and went to my first duty station in 2011. I was stationed at Osan Air Base. Anyway, between joining and getting to Osan, Tech Schoolers usually spend much more on nice things then they probably should. I, too, fell into this trap. I had been poor for the last few years, so having a steady income was great. I purchased neat shirts with a bunch of Air Force and Career Field regalia on it.

Well I settled in nicely to my first duty station, made some friends and even had a girlfriend. Things were pretty good. Girls, sometimes very catty, end up in petty disputes. My girlfriend was not immune to this. This girl, we'll call her **B**, was passively fighting with my girlfriend **L**.

One day, someone stole **B**'s fleece jacket out of the dryer while she was away from her laundry. This wasn't uncommon; people left their laundry in the community laundry room and accomplished errands on their day off. Unfortunately, because of the fighting between my **L** and **B**, my girlfriend was probably first to be blamed.

I can attest that she never had her fleece because, 1) she had her own, and 2) I never saw a third fleece around either my room or hers.

Anyway, sometime in the early spring of 2012, **B** decided to get back at **L** for [not] stealing her fleece jacket. **L** decided to get some of my laundry done and because she was a night shift worker she did her laundry overnight. Like a great girlfriend, she threw in some of my things too, including my uniforms and pricey, tech school t-shirts. When **L** joined me in bed for a bit, before I woke up early in the morning (this is when she planned to pull my laundry out and give me a fresh sand-tee to wear to work), **B** threw bleach in the dryer on (mostly) my clothes, ruining it all.

I suppose it could have been anyone. **L** said she had seen her up and about while **L** was doing stuff and hanging out with other night-shifters. Later on we did catch wind from one of her fickle friends that gave us some circumstantial evidence to further our assumption, nothing concrete however.

My clothes were ruined. **L** lost some stuff too, unfortunately it was mostly my stuff. There wasn't much room for recourse because I didn't have any concrete proof, and my First Sergeant (the sympathetic uncle in the ~~military~~ Air Force* family, if you will, who has some pull between family members) was unwilling to do much about it.

______________

Fast forward to about an hour ago (10:00a.m. CST), my (now) ex-girlfriend **L**, who is still on good terms with me, messages me out of the blue. They're currently deployed together somewhere in the desert. She had this to say to me:

""hey just wanted to tell u what happened to me today...**B** is deployed with me and someone was doing laundry today...just letting u know when she walked away i kinda maybe spilled a little bleach in her washing machine. thought that would make ya smile. l8r""

Today, justice was served.

We were seated and our waitress introduced herself, she seemed really nice, she also seem relatively new. She gets us our menus and asks us if we want anything to drink, I ordered a glass of wine, she carded me (I'm 24) and she goes off to get it. In comes in the bitchy waitress (now referred to as BW); she demands to know, from me, if our waitress carded me, I told her she had and she stalks off. Our waitress is trying to bring my wine when BW stops her within earshot of our table and demands to know from her as well if she had carded me because 'that girl looks 17, are you sure her ID isn't fake?' She assured her it wasn't and that I was indeed old enough to drink. From that moment on BW wanted to complain about everything she thought our waitress was doing wrong. Side note; I've been a waitress, I know it can be stressful at times but it was pretty slow when we were there and I thought our waitress did a great job. BW complained about everything she could; I personally overheard her say our waitress was going fast enough (she was), she didn't talk to us (she talked plenty, I don't go out to eat to converse with the staff all night), she said she put to much wine in my glass (subjective, but I wasn't complaining:D) and had told her on multiple occasions that she could do better. It seemed as though she just wanted to tear her down. That became aggravating because I thought she was doing really well, regardless of her being new or not.

The revenge:

When we finished our dinner we had tipped our waitress 30% because she did very well and we thought she deserved it. On the way out I stopped at the hostess stand and asked for the manager. It took him awhile to get up front but by the time he did BW was near enough so she could listen in (assumedly, of course). I told him, in a voice loud enough for BW to hear, our waitress had done an amazing job and deserved to be recognized for her great work. The look on BW face as we left smiling at her was priceless.

One morning a couple of years ago, having just left home, I could see that the bus was approaching the bus stop - and I reckoned that I had enough time to run to the bus stop to catch it.

I was not wrong.

However, having clearly seen that I was running to catch his bus, the bus driver decided not to stop - despite the fact that I was at the stop as he drove past. He had no passengers on board, and his bus was clearly in service.

This angered me greatly.

I had a plan.

I decided that I would try to run to the next bus stop to catch the bus there.

Just after the bus stop at which he passed me, he stopped at a traffic light. I figured I'd need to sprint almost flat out for 250 metres to catch the bus - as well as get lucky with the traffic light sequence to slow the bus down.

So I sprinted hard. I sped round the corner at full tilt, cut across an open green to take the most direct route possible, stormed through a mass of waddling pigeons, and hurdled a waist-high metal gate.

In turn, the bus driver got unlucky with the traffic lights.

Completely out of breath and feeling like Jason Bourne, I managed to reach the next bus stop about 10 seconds before the bus arrived, and I stepped one foot out into the road to make sure he had no choice but to stop.

He opened the door to the bus, looking nice and smug.

I set one foot onto the step of the bus, and instead of getting on, I just gave him the finger, turned around, and carried on walking down the road, only to hear him shout ""Fucking jerk!"" before he closed the door of the bus and sped off.

It was the most satisfying 20 seconds of someone else's life I've ever had the pleasure of wasting.

I looked for the box containing the wax paper but it was empty and I didn't see another one near it so I was really careful to only touch the rolls I was buying. 

At this exact moment, I hear from behind me a loud shrill voice exclaim ""You should be using wax paper, THAT'S HOW DISEASES ARE SPREAD YOU KNOW!"". In a low calm yet somewhat sarcastic tone I responded ""There weren't any left ma'am, but thanks for the tip.""

She mumbled something under her breath that I didn't quite hear so I finally turned to face her and I said ""Excuse me?"" to which she responded loudly again ""DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE I WORK?"". She was wearing scrubs so it was obvious but I quickly responded both loudly and dripping with venom:

""Oh I don't know, THE UNWANTED ADVICE FACTORY?"" 

Since she brought everyone in the small store's attention to herself with her first 2 comments everyone was staring at her and laughing at my response. She got flustered, put her basket with her items still in it down on the floor and promptly walked out.

The guy slicing my lunch meat behind the counter smiled and gave me the thumbs up and the girl that rang me up smiled and said ""The rolls are free, that was awesome.""

I went home and told the story to my wife—she made me a delicious sandwich.

""So, how are you?""
""Where you from?""
""Where you staying? Can I see your room?""

Nope, she's a prostitute.

I wanted to her to leave, but didn't want to say ""Fuck off whore"" or the like, so I started cold-shouldering her. Sadly she wouldn't shut it or leave.

So I stood up, and asked her politely to leave.

""Why? You no like me?""

""No, I just don't like people.""

This means we only pay two bills every month, rent and internet.

Being the only responsible person in the household I take care of making sure internet is payed on time personally every month then ask everyone for their parts (11$).

At this point I'm irritated so I confront him.

Me: Mike I really need your internet money

Mike: I don't have it, The Government hasn't sent me my check yet.

Me: When are you going to get it?

Mike: Tomorrow, but I have bills I need to pay. Money's tight.

(this really pissed my off because i know he has spent more money on alcohol in the last week than he owes me for three moths of internet)

Me: I know for a fact you only pay two bills monthly, and internet is one of them. And money's tight for everyone, especially when i spotting you month after month.

Mike: Well I'm not going to pay because **I have to buy books**

I should mention that Suzie's register was at the end and mine was right next to hers. So I decided to start on the close registers. By the time I got to mine, I had just enough ice to fill it up. She was helping someone and didn't notice that I didn't fill her's up too. Fast forward to when the manager is checking all of the registers. Hers is the last and he says that she doesn't have ice.

The problem though... We had some snooty rich parents (rich here meaning upper middle class) who must have thought that giving gifts to everyone you know was what you do for birthdays. So all 30 of these kids had a birthday. Even the ones whose birthday wasn't during the school year. 

And of course these mothers (in true pinterest fashion) decided they needed to outdo each other. So the favors became more elaborate and more annoying. My kid brought home so much plastic shit for our dogs to chew on it was a damned outrage. I know they either meant well or just likes shoving candy and annoying shit down other people's throats.

**SAND ART!!**

Not just any sand art. Oh no. Sand isn't near messy enough and it doesn't stick to everything. We found glitter to match the sand colors and put little baggies together, stuffed them inside baby food jars and tied one bag to the outside. We would have stuffed all the bags into the jars but they weren't big enough. 

Well, the teachers thought ""OMG, so cute and clever..."" 

We didn't have issues with any of the teachers so we instructed the teachers ""do not let the kids have these until it's time to leave."" But we didn't say why until later. When all the other kids were gone we let the secret out as to why we sent Sand Art home with all my daughter's classmates. The sand bags were roughly 25% glitter. Each and every one of them were shimmering, glittery powder kegs just waiting for some impatient tot to grab, rip or spill all of this glitter all over themselves, all over someone's car, someone's house...

He draws worse than a 5-year-old in kindergarten, but he can't help it.

So one day, the teacher in his art class collects all assignments, looks at my brother's work, starts laughing and commenting at it and parading it around the class saying ""this is the kind of crap you're not allowed to bring in"" and ""did you use your toes to draw this or something?"" among various other things in front of the whole class. 

My brother naturally didn't want to attend art class anymore and told my mother about this afterwards and mentioned she's been saying mean shit to him for the entire 3 months he had taken her class, but not as bad until now.

Just a note: at this point, she had no idea who my mother was or what she wanted, she was just shitting bricks because she knew my mother had heard the how she talked to her students.

So they started talking about my little brother and her remarks and once my mother was done explaining his situation regarding shitty artwork, she handed the teacher her business card with a date and time on the back and told her to be sure to show up.

Oh yeah, I probably forgot to mention that her title on said business card says: ""Head Inspector"" of the ~~Censored~~ County Department of Education.

The teacher was suspended without pay for 30 days and was made to take some sort of classes on ethics and communication.

tl;dr: my little brother who was born prematurely was made fun of by his art teacher since he can't draw well due to being born early, my mother who happens to be the head inspector of the county's Department of Education confronted her; teacher gets suspended without pay for 30 days and has to take mandatory classes on ethics and communication.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1372162175.0,,,True,t3_1h0012,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1h0012/teacher_humiliates_my_prematurely_born_little/,

On this particular day, I noticed the one I was heading for was out of order because of the large yellow bag placed over the pump handle, so I pulled forward to the second one. About a minute after I stepped out of my car, a huge truck (this is the south, so it was one of those extended cab, elongated side view mirrors, all the bells and whistles kind of truck) pulled up directly behind me and simply waited. There were other pumps, but no. He wanted this one. I don’t mind people waiting but the problem with this guy was that he had his headlights on. Since it’s a suped up truck, his headlights were directly in my eyes. So not only am I now feeling a little freaked out by a guy idling his bigass truck at me, but I can’t really see and the sound of his engine is making me uneasy. I continued on with attempting to get my gas.  I swiped my card and noticed that the buttons weren’t really responding right on the keypad. Every time I tried to enter my pin, the screen would simply refresh. That’s when I looked down and noticed that someone had tied a plain grocery store bag around the hose to the nozzle in an attempt to indicate it was out of order, but the bag had fallen and looked like another piece of trash on the ground. Keep in mind I had been standing there for about 5 minutes fiddling with the buttons and that’s when I heard the man laughing. 

He had his head leaned out his truck window while he smoked a cigarette and said something to his passenger about “Women can’t pump gas”. After hearing this, I felt no particular need to inform him that the pump was out of order. I simply got back into my car and I pulled around to another pump on the other side of the station and watched as the man went through the same game I had. He fiddled with the buttons, repeatedly swiped his card and attempted to enter his numbers, with none of it working. He was pretty persistent too, because by the time I was done filling up my entire tank (from empty), he was still standing at the out of order pump, scratching his head and pressing buttons. It was beautiful.

12 years ago, I was an A-level student at a ""technical college"" here in the UK studying for my IT and Business a-levels.

After a few months of borderline attempted bullying (He wasn't bigger than me, whoops) and of me just ignoring it, I snapped, pinned him against a wall in front of about 40 people in a canteen and calmly told him that next time he laid a finger on me, I'd break both his arms.

The attempted bullying then changed to snide remarks thrown from range and nothing but politeness to my face. Fair enough I don't care about that. I'd made my point.

Finishing school, I made it to University and he didn't, but he made sure to go off on one at a few of us about how he was going to get a job working for his uncle, he'd make money, we'd fail hard, the usual rubbish. Completely forgot all about it until Friday night.

My pregnant fiance has had 2 cravings so far - Chicken McNuggets, and Pickled Onion crisps. So Friday night is now McNugget night! And lo and behold, who serves us but Ronald! He gets the order wrong. Forgets my drink. He doesn't recognise me at all (The beard helps). When I'm leaving, I calmly say ""Nice seeing you Ronald, been a while since we were at college together. What ever happened to your job with your uncle? I ended up getting a masters, guess it worked out!"", smirk, and walk out while he stands there with his jaw wide open.

It takes me a few minutes to muster the courage, but I start reading my book out loud. This continues for about 2 stops before he gets off the bus.

Not sure if passive-aggressive or petty revenge, but I thought I'd share.

All is as usual, the bag is filled to the brim and I'm just about to be done when a woman pulls up right in front of me, and gets out with both hands filled with garbage from Burger King. She walks up to me and demands that I let her throw her trash away. She walked up immediately as I was tying the bag, and I explained to her that it was already full, and if she would wait just a moment I would get a new bag in the bin.

I was serving a group of kids. They were a bunch of punkasses. They were running me ragged, constantly sucking down their sodas just so I had to get more. I swear, everytime I went up to the table they needed something else. You're probably thinking ""Well, that's your job, dumbass"" but I could tell they were doing it on purpose cause they thought it was funny. Also, I had other tables of guests that wanted their kids fed so they could go to the movies or something. These asshole kids were monopolizing my time.

Anyway, one was ""of age"" and had ordered a drink. He proceeded to let the others who were not 21 drink his Long Island ice tea. I told them they couldn't do that but they just laughed t me and asked ""Do what?"" mockingly. Me and my manager couldn't catch them in the act.

Time came to pay, they suddenly wanted separate checks. They had been moving around the whole time so I couldn't keep them straight. They were saying they were getting charged for stuff they didn't have. It was a mess. I think their total bill was about $110. I got about $100 off the table, no tip, and they left. I said ""fuck it."" I was just glad to see them gone, even though I lost money. Then, an ""opportunity"" presented itself...

As I was cleaning up the filth they had left behind, I noticed one of the little shitheads left their iPhone on the table. I snagged it and told another waitress they had left it. She came up with the idea of checking to see if they were logged into Facebook. They were. We made up a nice little ""status update."" This was before I discovered Reddit so it was nothing clever, just something along the lines of ""my mother was born with a dick and I have a fecal fetish."" Pretty standard fare.
One of the kids had the balls to come back and ask for it about an hour later. I was like ""No, sorry. Didn't see anything. Let's get your info in case it turns up"" a blatant falsely polite tone. On the way home from work, I threw it in the Mohawk River.

I would have to get out of bed, out of the bathroom, etc and let her in several times a day. I would always say pointedly something like ""Didn't you take your keys?"" and she would usually reply that she's either forgotten them or (this pissed me off the most) that they were somewhere in her bag at the bottom.

Me - I'm sleeping. How did you get in then?
Sarah - ...I had my keys, but they were in the bottom of my bag.

I wouldn't mind working with someone who doesn't understand the material, but he's not *just* stupid. He's lazy, and he's an asshole.  
Examples:  
  
* First day of class, he blunders in 15 minutes late (to an 8am class), shouts his apologies loudly, and then refuses to take the quiz because ""I just transferred in from [another Chemistry 2] class, so I shouldn't be responsible for this quiz."" (all the classes cover the same material). The TA made him take the quiz anyway, saying she wouldn't grade it, and he got a 90% anyway.  
* Second day of class, one of the girls at our table asks if he can move his chair closer to the table so she can walk by, and he shouts that he can't possibly move a chair (with wheels) so she (a 100 pound, little asian girl) can walk by. He then mumbles something rude about her when she walks away.  
  
So, by the third class, I've had it with this guy. Its a Friday morning lab, and I'm not a morning person, so my patience is already worn thin. He decides that he wants to get out of the lab as soon as possible, so he decides that we should only perform the experiment once instead of 3 times so we can get out of there, and just fudge the data.  
Now, I'm all for taking shortcuts, but this is just plain dishonest. But, he's a big guy, really intimidating, so I become a pushover and let him do this.  
The first time we (I) did the experiment, I ""messed up"" and requested that we do it a second time. So, after this, I had data of two experiments, and he had nothing, since the lazy ass won't write anything down.  
As he is surfing twitter on his iPhone, I take out a sheet of paper and say ""I'm writing down the data for your lab report,"" and completely skew my data so his is all off. Add ten here, subtract 4 here, take the average wrong, etc.  
He snatches the paper off the table and runs out before 10am.  
Since it is a 4 hour lab, I still have 2 hours to finish the experiment by myself and do the report. So, I finished it, did the report, and gave it to my TA before 11:15.  
  
I can't wait to see his face next Friday when he gets a big, fat 0 on his lab and I get a perfect.

I just moved into my current apartment three months ago, and to help with the bills, I found a roommate via craigslist. Let's call him Ron. Ron seemed like a decent guy. He's in his mid-twenties like me, is a musician like me, said he was a clean guy, had a decent 9-5 job downtown. Everything seemed like it would be great.


It was right about a month after we moved in -- one morning I went to take my pill for the day, and noticed that it seemed like there were a decent amount missing. I counted, and sure enough, I was short by 10. I only take 1 a day, every morning before work at 7:30 AM on the dot, and I've never given any out, so I knew something was up.


I asked Ron about it casually, not wanting to sound accusatory. ""Hey man, I just noticed I'm missing a bunch of my ADD pills; have you had anybody over recently who might've taken some? I'm not pissed, just curious!""


""Nope."" He sounded totally uninterested, and didn't even look up from his laptop.


""Alright man. Just checking."" I shrugged it off, even though I knew *someone* or *something* had to have removed ten pills from my bottle. I decided to start keeping them in my room instead of in the bathroom cupboard, just to be safe.


Because of this theft, I had to go 8 days without my pills. I take a relatively low dose, so it wasn't that big of a deal (I didn't go through any sort of withdrawal that I'm aware of), but it certainly threw me off at work. I work with computers and have to deal with quite a lot of text -- something that without Dexedrine I find almost impossible to do without my mind wandering haplessly.


When I finally got my prescription refilled, I made sure to count them out. There were exactly 30, the correct amount for a month. I decided to start counting them every 5 days, so that I could (hopefully) notice if any went missing with some sort of accuracy. Sure enough, when I counted for the second time, I noticed that there were 5 missing. I began to think it could be Ron; I usually keep the door to my room closed, and none of his friends seemed like the type who would go through a stranger's room.


On top of this, Ron and I were already at each other's throats. He turned out to be a lot messier than he initially led on. I'm not very anal about cleanliness; the policy I had adopted with him was sort of a ""do whatever you want in your room, just help me keep the kitchen and living room clean"". He had a hard time adhering to this policy: he would never do his dishes until there were no clean dishes left; he would leave beer cans and pizza boxes all over the living room; he would use my shampoo, bodywash, toilet paper, and *towels*; and he was always so late on rent that I'd have to cover him for a couple weeks each month. He'd torrent things, stream videos, and use so much bandwidth that I could barely use the internet connection *I was solely paying for*. Ron was turning out to be not a very nice person.


I confronted him about the pills again, and this time I was very forward about it. ""Ron, do you have *any idea* why I'm missing 5 of my Dexedrine?""


""No man, would you fucking leave it alone? It wasn't me, okay?"" He was incredibly defensive.


""Alright, alright. If you are taking them though, I need you to stop. I shouldn't have to hide my pills in my own apartment."" I was trying to keep my cool.


""Whatever dude. I'm heading out. Later."" He left.


I decided if I couldn't get him to admit it, and if I couldn't find out who it was, I could at least make them pay for it. I had a plan. I bought some empty capsules from a vitamin shop, and some maximum strength ex-lax pills. I went through the pain-staking process of opening the dexedrine capsules, and putting the little beads into my new capsules. I ground up a bunch of ex-lax pills and filled the old dexedrine capsules with the ex-lax. I only made 7 *fake* dexedrine pills, as I was feeling lazy and it was hard to get the old capsules to stay put back together.


After putting the fake pills back in my original bottle, I put it back on my desk exactly where it would normally be, and put the real Dexedrine in a baggy and hid it. The fake pills didn't look too believable, but I figured whoever was stealing them probably wasn't examining them very carefully anyway. Now it was time to wait.


A mere *three* days later, I get home from work, and go and sit at my computer. I notice that *all* of the fake, ex-lax filled pills are missing. A few hours later, I hear someone go in the bathroom. I immediately hear some of the most awful, disgusting noises I've ever heard in my life, along with some pretty intense breathing/groaning. I go and knock on the door, and say, ""You okay in there?""


""Ugh, yeah, I just have the shits man. *Reallllly* bad shits. It's gonna be a while, sorry."" Lo and behold, it was Ron's voice coming from the bathroom. Victory was mine.


Ron has since moved out. After not paying rent for a month, I explained the situation to my landlord and he asked him to leave. But, for the next two days after the original diarrhea episode, on more than several occasions I heard Ron groaning in the bathroom. I can only assume that he didn't make the connection between the pills and his shits, and continued to take them. Moral of the story: don't steal shit from your roommates, and don't take pills that aren't yours. Not only is it potentially dangerous, but (in Ron's case), *it's just a shitty thing to do.*


**TL;DR: My ass of a roommate keeps stealing my pills, I swap them with laxatives, and instead of a buzz he gets massive diarrhea.**

Everyone was keeping it quiet and until it started throwing errors at weird times. Suddently IT starts getting all sorts of emails requesting these errors to be fixed. So behind his back, some of them pointed a few of us in IT to his program to find out that he had programmed security into his application and intentionally locked out IT. Without getting too technical, I went about hacking into his system. I got in and gave an IT network account administrator privilages to his program. When I opened his program with the administrator account, it showed that he even wrote himself a personal hello pop up box for when he opened the program. After laughing uncontrollably for around half an hour, I went about getting petty. I give the guy props that he did write very clean code, but I could leave the personal love note alone. So I changed the hello pop-up to say, ""Hello, Maverick. Why did you let Goose die?"" After hearing his exclaimation of WTF and bitching to several people in his department trying to find out who hacked and pranked him, I then changed it to, ""Hello, Dr Falken. Would you like to play a game?"" This guy is still griping as this is posted. I am considering coding him out of the program and completely usurping it. If I'm going to have to maintain something that I was kept in the dark on and was had it made clear that he thinks not only the IT department as a whole is stupid, but that I suck at my job, then I'm sorely tempted on taking his half assed program and actually throwing on the bells and whistles. There is a reason I get paid for this shit.

But somehow I always happen to attract copiers, and I would always let then copy off of me. I have more recently been trying to have more confidence and stick up for myself more, and I did something recently that was much easier than just saying ""No"" and a lot more satisfying.

Anyway, there's this Junior in my Freshman Algebra class. Let that sink in your mind for a second. Not only is he a complete idiot, he's a jerk, the kinda guy who always wants your gum and says ""nah screw you"" if you ask for some of his. Anyhow, in that class we were having a big midterm test that I had studied quite a lot for. I sit next to him, and he always copies off of me. And he makes it completely obvious as well, he even asks me to move my arm sometimes. Anyway, when I sit in my seat in the begging of class, the first thing he says to me is ""Dude, I didn't study for this test at all, and I might need some help, if you know what I mean."" Then he smiled this smile that basically said ""I'm going to copy off of you and you can't do anything about it."" So I go to the teacher and politely ask to move seats. She says yes I can, so I go take a seat in the back where no one is near me. Before the teacher hands out the test, he asks to use the restroom. She says ""Yes, do it quickly please."" She explains the test and how we sit quietly after we finish and no food or cell phones ect. As she is handing out the tests, I see the jerk come back in the class room, and I kid you not, sit RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I stand up to move back to my old spot and the teacher immediately tells me ""Please stay in that spot until the test is over."" I walk back and see the jerk with the biggest smug grin on his face. At this point I'm pretty pissed, and before I start the test I try to think of what I could do to screw him over.

The test is composed of two parts-The test booklet, and the answer sheet. I look over at him and sure enough, he is just staring at my test booklet, waiting for me to start writing down answers. I start solving the problems and writing down the correct answer on my answer sheet, but on my test booklet, in big letters, I write the incorrect answer. Sure enough, he copies down the wrong ones. I do that for the duration of the test. But my revenge was not yet over.

The next day, we all came in and the teacher had a graph on the smart board. She uses a program that show all the test scores in a way that is anonymous. Most are in the 90-70 range, but all the way on the right is 1 single 8%. I was smiling the biggest smile as I saw the look of horror on the jerk's face as he got his test passed back. Moments later he turned to me and said ""Man, that test was pretty hard, wasn't it?"" I looked at him and smiled while saying ""Not really."" I casually moved my hand so he could see the 92% on my paper. His faced turned the brightest colour of red and he just turned and stared forward for the remainder of class. And the icing of the cake was hearing the teacher talk to him about it as I left the room. I didn't hear all of it, but what I did hear were the words ""Lowest score on this test EVER."" And that is why he doesn't copy off of me anymore. :)

That was one of the first papers) She actually took me outside and asked me if I actually believe in such nonsense and I said yeah.  

Well she didn't like me after that, she would pick on me constantly, I was late once and absent once while many others would come in late all the time and miss classes, yet when I did that she raised hell (lol) and just tried to embarrass me. A few times I let my friends copy my homework and I'd get a lower score than them.
One day I told her that my answers were the same as other people's on a homework but I got points taken off and they didn't. She first accused me of cheating and then wanted me to show her who has the same answers. I declined not wanting anyone else to fall under her radar.  

So that was a very brutal semester for me, I tried to work my ass off to at least get a C. I would answer all her questions about the readings, I participated in all the discussions. She told me I didn't and a girl gave her a WTF? look and when asked what's wrong she defended me saying that I'm always prepared for discussions, probably more than most people there.  

A few of my friends from my table tried talking to her midway through the semester, and their assignments started to have slightly lower scores.
By the time the final paper came I was super pissed but decided to just make that the best paper I've ever written, even though that was only a 5-8 pages essay. I worked my balls of, I had people from the Help Center read it, I had my English professor read it (He knew what was happening and decided to help me because she and him didn't get along well) and he fixed the hell out of it. I of course wrote about how I don't really believe in God, but also how I like different religions and what we can take from the bible etc.  

Bitch gave me a C on that which is what I had in that class. I went straight to her office, she wasn't there so I waited. Then my English professor came by and asked me what I got. He looked pissed as hell even though he is the nicest guy in that school I got kinda freaked out. He told me to come back at 5, and said that he has a meeting with her then so to just come into his office.  

I go in, she gives me a dirty look as usual, and he asks me to sit down next to her. He actually printed out copies of my paper and made her read it out loud to him and tell him what was wrong with it. She tried to refuse but he was the head of the department. I think he was just doing this for fun but he would stop her every once in a while saying things like ""This can't be right. Oh no it's good keep going"" or ""Wait do you think that's correct? Does that sound right to you?"" We were in there for like 30 mins and after we went through the whole essay he asked me to step outside.  

The people passing the office looked mortified as they heard the professor yell at the nun, call her names etc while I tried my best not to piss myself from laughing.  

He then called me in, and went through the paper with me again showing me that I missed a comma here and there, and then just commented me on the good ideas and then turned in my newly graded paper.

He sometimes worked up to 70 hours in a week. He was a good employee, he was on time, dependable, helped with certain jobs when he didn't have to - nothing to warrant the treatment he received when it was time for him to move on from the company. 

As soon as the company discovered that my husband had put in his two weeks, his managers treated him like shit. They cut his hours as much as they could in the first week in an attempt to punish him (no hours = no money). Because they had already cut his hours so low, he decided to not work the second week and help me pack. Our son was barely an infant at the time and I had no family around to help, so it was the logical decision for us.

The second week a big job came in and they needed him. My husband said no. A few weeks later, when it was time to receive his final paycheck, we received a check in the mail that said ""VOID 000.00""
My husband wanted to let it go (??) but I knew that shit could not be legal. Sure enough, I found the state and federal laws and discovered that ""deductions"" from a paycheck can not total more than minimum wage. Translation: People have to be compensated at least minimum wage for the hours they worked. You can't just take shit from them. 

So I sent an email, explaining that I required all contracts my husband signed and all the deductions that were taken from his paycheck. They sent me an email that explained that they took out 700 dollars worth for uniforms and tools and ""Damage at a job."" The uniform stuff was legit, the tool stuff was iffy, but the vague ""damage at a job"" was definitely not legit. My husband had not signed a document that acknowledged he was in possession of the tools (my husband said that he did not have any of the tools they claimed he did, nor was he aware of any damage he had done. They had not made him aware during the course of employment, but when it was over, they decided he was responsible.

I called our state's department of labor, read them the email, and asked what I should do. The department of labor person was all, ""Ohhh no. Get yo money girl. Give them this information (information about the laws) and if they don't send you a check, we'll give them a call.""

So I sent an email. The email I received back was something along the lines of ""Well he caused 40,000 worth of damage at a job, so we're being nice enough by only charging him 400."" I sent an email asking first of all: What job was it? When did it occur? Did you charge the other employees for it? Please send documentation of the damage, proof that it cost what they claimed did, proof that my husband was in possession of the tools they claimed he was in.
I received no response.

Called the department of labor back, and that afternoon I received an email from the company. 


This time it read something along the lines of, ""We'll be sending your check in the mail shortly.""

There were few dryers available, so I placed my basket in front of the dryer I planned to use in literally two seconds. I just needed to grab my clothes from the washer and transport them to the dryer. Seriously. Two seconds. 


So I grabbed my wet clothes and turned back toward the dryer (a mere 5 feet from me) and some woman had come up, kicked my basket across the laundromat and was loading her laundry into my dryer. All of the other dryers were taken, so this meant I would have to wait 20 - 30 minutes for a dryer to be free. I was really busy that day, and in no mood to deal with her shenanigans. 


An important thing to note about the dryers at this particular laundromat: if you don't hit the start button when you close the door, your time still counts down, but your clothes don't actually dry. 


So this woman puts in 5 or 6 quarters, presses the start button and then heads out for a cigarette or some such. I take this opportunity to open the dryer door, which stops the drying process, and close it again without hitting the start button. 


I watch the dryers like a hawk and as soon as one becomes free, I load my stuff up. In 20-30 minutes the woman returns to her dryer, finds her things still sopping wet, assumes the dryer is broken, and as such -- in her eyes, anyway -- there are no dryers available.

My sister is openly gay, and has been for 7 years. Everyone in our family knows, and everybody is happy for her coming out. After all, how does it affect them?
Everyone is happy for my sister, except for my Grandma.
My Grandma is a nice caring lady, a vegetarian to care for the animals (important), always looking after people, and don't get me wrong is a great woman. Except for the fact she is ridiculously homophobic, to the point that if a character in her favorite show turns out to be gay, or even the actor, she stops watching it immediately. Everytime she visits, she gets into a rant on who homosexuality is wrong, and everyone's going to hell and the usual rubbish. All of this, in the presence of my sister. The outcome is normally my sister being uncomfortable, and us steering the topic, but we've confronted her about ""keeping her views to herself"" and warned her not to talk about something so personally, so negatively. 

THE INCIDENT:

One particular visit, we were ready to have our Sunday roast and she got into the usual rant on how she saw a ""poofter on the bus"" and immediately decided to get off and wait. Oh, also note that my Granddad, her Husband, thinks homosexuality is fine and is proud of my sister. She then started berating how that if people don't change their viewpoints, they're going to hell, and their's no excuse because ""It's a choice!"".

THE REVENGE: 

As we were dishing up the dinner, my sister decided to get some petty revenge on Grandma. Instead of giving her a nice helping of Quorn (Vegetarian meat replacement), my sister decided to give Grandma a nice big helping of roast chicken, and drowned her plate in chicken gravy. Of course, my Grandma, none the wiser ate everything on her plate, and asked what kind of new brand the ""meat"" was. At which point, my sister said ""Chicken and chicken gravy"". Grandma was devastated and started spluttering how she's a vegetarian, at which point my sister exclaimed ""Oh, but vegetarianism is only a choice!"" and gave her a big shit eating grin. Grandma's face proceeded to turn crimson, and worked out why this had happened. She then muttered something about going to the bathroom, where we all had a good giggle.

The monitoring team and the ops person's manager would get a summary email organized by team. 

So one day a mistake occurs. It turns out that an email address was in the system wrong, an issue was missed and it cost the company some money (not a huge loss but enough to raise some flags). We promptly correct the error and institute an auditing process to make sure it doesn't happen again.

However, this isn't good enough for one of the account managers. He basically goes off in a big rant to all the team heads about how the monitoring system can't be trusted and how people aren't doing their jobs. He then demands to get email copies of issues reports. Keep in mind his role is really quite separate from the ops group.

So we add him in as a CC in the system, but instead of just the summaries, he's now getting a copy of every email the thing generates. 2 days later he humbly comes by our little cube and asks to be taken off the recipient list.

They scammers told me they worked 9-5, M-F, so when I picked up the phone on Saturday morning I was surprised to hear my ol' pal. ""Sir, let me tell you. About your Windows security. We need to help you."" Etc.  I started by telling him how impressed I was that he was calling me on a Saturday, but he assured me his office was open to help me. 

I was planning some errands and didn't have time to muck about with the computer, so I told him it was a bad time. Would he offer to call back? I was curious to see how he'd respond.

He said something about Windows warranty and activating it. ""Well now, my computer is ... let me think ... two and a half years old? My cousin gave it to me for Christmas ... it wasn't this past Christmas, I know that, but was it the Christmas before or the Christmas before that?""

""Sir!""

""My cousin knows more about computers and he picked this one out for me, but ...""

""Sir! Let me tell you ...""

""I figure it's been at least two years. How long does a Windows warranty last? It's only like a year or something, isn't it? I'm sure this one is expired.""

""Sir! The Windows warranty needs to be activated.""

""You know, my fridge had a *ten* year warranty. That was a good fridge and it lasted longer than ten years. I think we got at least fifteen years out it so I didn't mind when it didn't work so good any more. I tell you, though, it was a pain to move. I'm just glad ...""

""Sir! Please, let me help you. You need to activate ...""

""So the warranty is no more good, right?""

""No. Sir. Please. You need to activate the Windows warranty and it will cover you for three years for ten dollars, five years for fifteen dollars and a lifetime warranty for twenty dollars. Which one do you want to choose.""

""Ten dollars for one year and only twenty for lifetime? That's a good deal!""

""No sir. Ten dollars for three years ..."" he repeats the script.

I ponder over whether or not to get a new computer and he assures me that the warranty can be transferred to the new computer. How convenient! I tell him how happy I am to hear that and if he can tell me how much a new computer costs since my cousin, etc. He says three hundred bucks for a new laptop and the warranty can be transferred. 

He wants to know if I want the three-year, five-year or life-time warranty. I muse again about whether I should fix this one or just buy a new one. I mean, if the warranty will fix this computer than I don't need a new one, but it would be nice to have a new one and my cousin would be impressed, etc.

He pesters me for a decision and I have to admit that I'm not sure and really should discuss it with my wife because she uses the computer, too, and maybe I should ask my cousin, etc. He does his best to interrupt me but I keep rambling in in Grandpa Simpson mode.

""Are you married?"" I ask, hoping to throw him off his script.

""Yes sir. Now, I need you to make a decision. Do you want the ...""

""So you know what it's like, right? You can't make any plans without ...""

""... or the lifetime warranty. Sir! I need you to make a decision!""

I go about something else and he's practically yelling into the phone about needing me to make a decision and which credit card I want to choose. I string him along for as long as I can, but I really do need to get going. 

""Well, you know, I'm just heading out the door and I only picked up the phone because I thought you were my sister. She was supposed to come by this morning and I don't know if she's late or ...""

""Sir! It will only take a moment. I just need you to tell me which credit card ...""

""You see, I have this ceiling fan I bought and it doesn't work. I was going to return it yesterday but the weather was really bad and if I don't return it today I might not be able to so I have to really get to ...""

I swear I heard him yell ""Shut up!"" at least once. I pretended not to notice and suggested we should try again another time after I talk to my wife and maybe discuss the situation with my cousin because he knows about computers, etc., etc. 

I had the bastard on the line for at least half an hour. I have a recorder around her somewhere. If I can get it working, I'll try to get the whole conversation recorded next time. Sorry I can't do voices and am a terrible stand-up comedian, so it won't be funny ... just petty.

It was much to his mother's dismay, as well, that it happened. She was a very young mother and he was her only son. She must have felt like I was taking him away from her. I would, time and time again, receive emails from her describing how great of a wife she was to his father, and how I could never live up to that. She would say insensitive things to me, and even subtly imply that I was not good enough for her son. Needless to say, I never really had a rapport with her at all.

And yes, our marriage went downhill, and we split. The divorce was painful and rocky for both of us. It was a mutual decision because the stress of rushing into adulthood was too much on our relationship. I didn't hear from his mother much anymore, and started to get over him, while we were going through our divorce. This is when I found out from a mutual friend that while we were married, my ex husband had an affair- with a child on the way!

This really made things much harder to cope with, as the divorce was nearly over, and I was almost done with the whole ""mourning"" process of it all. 

To top it all off, my ex husband's mother found out where I worked, and would show up about once a week, pretending that she was there for ""business"" reasons, when she would just sneer at me while otherwise pretending not to know me.

Turns out, she knew nothing of the little ray of sunshine my ex husband had created with his bang buddy, which set up a lovely retort when she finally chose to speak to me. She finally approached me, and stated, as if to clarify, ""So I heard it was my son who decided to divorce *you*."" And although my stomach twisted into a million knots, and I felt like I could toss a whole slew of angry word vomit her way, I simply stated: ""I heard it was your son who decided to make you a grandmother."" Her expression- and the silence- oh, it was golden.

I was on an escalator and this tiny waif of a woman was standing in front of me with bundles of carrier bags by her sides. She was talking on her hands-free kit to her presumably half-deaf friend, which is the only reason that could justify her screeching so loudly into the air. I didn't really want to stand behind her Royal Highness, so I tried to walk past her but her god damned bags were in the way, and she was standing right in the middle of the path. I didn't want to crash through her stuff, so I tapped her on the shoulder and  chirped, ""excuse me"". This bitch *waves me off* without turning around while continuing her banal conversation. 

Now I'm pissed. It wasn't enough that she took up the entirety of the escalator, which in itself was almost commendable seeing as she was the size of my arm. No, she had to be intentionally rude and obnoxious while expending the same amount of effort in shooing away a fly to dismiss me.

There is an excellent smoothie stand at the top of the escalators I knew Ms Shit-For-Brains was heading towards since she was prattling on about whatever crossed her mind, which I presumed only ceased when something was put in her mouth. At the top, I hurried past her when she stood to the side arranging her ridiculously cumbersome carrier bags and strode up to the stand before her. I could hear her huffing and rolling her eyes at me to her petri dish companion on the phone, but I wasn't done with her yet. 

I ordered drinks for my entire family, and I thought, fuck it, get some for the house staff as well. This equalled 12 drinks in total, and with a limited number of blenders, it was going to take a while. I chatted happily to the staff and tipped them handsomely, emphasising that I was in a bit of rush, so they happily obliged and concentrated on making my drinks.

Mind numbingly boring, but hey it paid the bills in college.  In this office there was a guy that was the jokey joke guy.  He would hide annoyatrons and whoopie cushions, all that jazz.  Well, Jokey Jokerson found a Shock Pen some place and was working it through the cube farm.  The guy across the hall from me had gotten zinged with it and it wasn't a light zing.

A couple of days after he got hit, I found that my couple of pens were out of place and a new shiny metal cased pen was there in their place.  I quickly deduced that Jokey was trying to get me.  I politely returned his pen and told him I didn't want to play the game.  Went back to my desk and thought it was over.  He got found out and called out.

That Friday the pen shows up again.  I again take it back and tell him that he doesn't want me to play his game because I play to win.  He chuckles and says ""Whatever, I'll get you with it soon enough.""  Being so challenged I stopped by the supply closet and took a couple of pens that matched the one that Jokey used.

Over the weekend I gutted out a pen and rigged a Booby Trap firecracker into the body of the pen so that when the cap was pulled off it'd pop.  Nothing explosive, just a sharp crack.  However I decided that I would give him a final chance.

It was about a week before I saw the pen again. Jokey had played his hand well, but I was ready for him.  When the pen showed up again I went back to his office to return it he wasn't there.  So not only did I leave his shock pen, but I dropped off my rigged pen while also taking his matching one.

About an hour later I can hear him talking loudly on the phone and then BLAM! followed by a string of profanity and then a rapid apology.  Turns out Jokey Jokerson was on the phone with a client and went to write something down.  With a phone in one hand he put the cap of the pen in his mouth and pulled to open it.  That sharp crack was amplified just right somehow in very close proximity to his face.

He came by my desk and demanded to know if I had rigged the pen.  I put on my best poker face and let him know that I'd have no idea where to buy a trick pen like that and that I hope that he's ok.  And man these tricks are getting crazy in here I wonder if they should stop before someone gets hurt.  Somehow I pulled every bit of deadpan that exists in my being and kept it perfectly straight faced.  He later blamed it on another guy he kept trying to hit with the shock pen.

However, most of us aren't stupid enough to take it to the extreme.

Last night, I'm about to get onto the freeway, and this king douche passes me on the shoulder going at least double the speed limit, to cut in front of me getting on the entrance ramp. I'm honestly surprised he didn't clip me with his car...he really pissed me the fuck off.

Once we get onto the highway, he moves over to the left lane and starts booking it. He's in a Ford Taurus though, so 'booking it' is subjective. I easily catch up to him (sports car), and I flip on my brights (high beams + rally lights) to get his plate number, most likely blinding him in the process. At this point, we're probably going 110, and I must have irked him further, because he slammed on his brakes and reduced his speed to 20mph, cutting over when I would in an effort to hit me / run me off the road. I finally get in front of him and easily outrun him trying to chase my ass down. 

Now I'd been on the phone with dispatch for a few minutes, letting them know exactly what was going down. They informed me they had an officer waiting on the next entrance ramp for him. I timed coasting down to the speed limit, so when this colossal douche shot by me (while swerving into my lane, mind you), he did it directly in front of the cop. He immediately got lit up, and I drove by with my dome light on and my finger up high.

Petty revenge felt good. I don't give a flying fuck if anyone speeds, I'm a lead-foot myself. But don't endanger other lives, and don't drive like a complete twat.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that the dispatcher said that he (or at least whoever the car was registered to) had outstanding felony warrants, and told me to back off. So I guess the lesson here is don't drive like a royal cock when you have a fucking warrant for your arrest.

They get victims to allow a remote computer to access their machine and install whatever spywear and malware they want. I had some free time so I thought I'd entertain myself.

When he said he wanted me to open my computer, I told him ""OK, but this will take a little while."" I'd make all sorts of metal-sounding noises and grunt occasionally. ""OK, it's open. Now what?"" It took several minutes of nothing happening and my naive descriptions before he clued in to the fact that I had taken the case off my computer and unplugged it from everything. Actually, I was just doing the dishes. 

It took several more minutes to get the case back on and figure out which wires went wear. ""You know, my cousin set this up for me so I don't know about it so much. It's pretty hard, you know."" 

""Now how is it you know that my computer has problems?"" He goes on about TCP/IP and whatnot and I'm baffled, of course. ""Does that mean Microsoft is spying on me? No? That how come you know my computer is so slow."" He goes on about junk files but his pronunciation is so bad that I hear something entirely different and have to make him spell it phonetically. ""Oh, *junk files*. I thought you was saying something different.""

My computer is very slow, naturally, so it takes some time to boot. ""OK, I'm putting in my password ... dang, I spelled it wrong. Just a minute. Dang, I got the big letter key stuck or something. It does that sometimes. Say, how come they have that key anyway? Why's it so big? How come it's so much bigger than the Delete key? I use the Delete key a lot more than that one. Hell, I never use that one.""

He has me look for the Windows key on the keyboard. It's next to the control key. ""Control key? Is that a key I'm supposed to use for something? That sounds important.  Can I control stuff with that? My buddy can control his TV with his computer. Is that what that's for? That should probably be a big key if it's so important ... bigger than that big letter key, anyway."" 

It takes several minutes to get him to finally get me to the ""run"" dialog box. By that point I've had to shout to someone ""off camera"" that I'm busy and I'll be with them soon. I did this three times before finally telling the helpful technician that I have to go because ""some idiot needs my help. I don't know what the hell they'd do without me here."" I tell the technician that he can call me later ... when I'm out.

He calls the next day and let him run through the whole script again, careful to have him repeat stuff we covered before. I apologize about not being able to stay on the phone with him before. ""You know, I told those guys to take the doors off before they go downstairs with the fridge. I told 'em! But, they got stuck and the guy at the bottom couldn't get the door off so we had to get a guy to get the tools and climb over the fridge so he could the other guy get the door off. I'm glad that wan't a good fridge. You know, we had that fridge for the longest time. It was a good fridge but it was just running all the time and the ice didn't get cold enough and so, anyway, we decided ..."" He hands me over to another tech and I have him go through the issues about my computer again and he has to step me through the process.

When I press the Windows key, I'm careful to release it before pressing ""r"" so instead of the ""run"" dialog box, Windows pulls up all the  programs starting with the letter R. It takes some minutes for the tech to figure out what I've done. I finally get the Run command. I'm supposed to enter a web address and he gives me every letter phonetically and makes me repeat it back. ""Yeah, I got it, shown my pc, spelled SHOWN ... MY ... PC."" He hears that as showmypc and can't figure out why it's not working. After several re-spelling we get it right. 

At this point I'm editing some images and can quickly jump between his requests and my real work on the computer. So, I'm not wasting too much of my own time.

""Yeah, well, something popped up, but it's all white. What? Oh, it says something about not being able to find it."" After some re-tries I ask if my computer should be connected to the internet. Oh, OK, let go find that wire. You know, I don't use this so much, just to check e-mail from my cousin. Maybe my wife should do this. You want to talk to her. No, it's all right, she downstairs. It'll only take a minute. No, just wait here, she uses this more than me."" 

He's still on the line when I get back. ""Naw, she says she's too busy. I don't know why she so busy when this is so important."" I ramble on about something. I have no luck connecting to shownmypc (of course) so he tells me he's going to transfer me to another technician. During the transfer I hang up. He calls back a few minutes later, apologizing about losing me. 

I make the new tech run me through the commands to get to ""run"" and I screw 'em all up again. Just when we get to the point where he can almost taste the access to my machine, I start into a rambling story and hang up. He calls back a minute later and apologizes. I go back to my story and just as we get to the climax, I hang up again. 

Before he gets a chance to call back, I call a talkative friend and spend an hour shooting the breeze. Within minutes of hanging up, the phone right. I let the machine get it, but the caller does not leave a message. It rings again and again and still no message. I'll wait until later today and pick up the phone and make up a good story. 

I wonder how long I can keep this fish on the hook?

Unfortunately every one of my friends are single and they enjoy watching me suffer as they go around hitting on girls.

My best friend, lets call him G, is the definition of a homophobe. Every time we go out, he takes pride in telling girls I'm his gay friend and I hate women. All my friends find it fucking hilarious. After we arrived home from our trip, I had enough. 

He had a HUGE party a few nights ago and was trying extremely hard to get this one girl, lets call her S, to sleep with him.

These are their stories.

I was behind this lady in the grocery store in an upscale part of town. Older lady, dressed nice, but totally oblivious to anyone else's personal space. You know the type: she emerges from the end of an aisle at breakneck speed without yielding to shoppers who have the right-of-way or even looking down to see how many children she's run over. These sort of people aren't unheard of but this one particular bird kept repeatedly doing it to people, and somehow to me specifically. More than once she nearly sideswiped my cart and one time she even managed to plow straight into me after she exploded from the end of an aisle. I received a very curt ""excuse you!"" from her for my troubles.

If this had been all it was, I would have chalked it up to her being an inconsiderate person but she started scowling at me after the first time she violated the Law of the Lanes. Add in the fact that she blocked people from passing her in what were not even narrow aisles, and then had the nerve to hold up the express lane with her *way more* than ten items to dispute sales prices with the cashier, and you officially had a Grade A &lt;redacted&gt;.

I beat her out of the store because my line -- while longer and not Express -- went faster by virtue of not being filled with a-holes. An elderly lady on one of those store-provided motorized scooters had driven one out to her car (which was parked far away from the handicapped spot, since those spaces were full) and was attempting to return it to the store's lobby but it was apparently running out of juice. Done putting away my own groceries and forgetting about the Harris Tarder (get it?) for a minute, I offered to take her scooter back to the store so she wouldn't have to. [Important note: these scooters can only be operated if you sit on them and will lock up the wheels when not in use or powered off.]

Well, guess who I discovered was parked in a handicapped spot despite clearly not needing one, nor having the tags or placard for one? In a bit of fortuitous timing, the scooter I was riding was essentially dead and unmovable about a space away from this piece of work. She finished loading up her groceries into her suv and I got out and used all my most manliest muscles to heave the scooter forward until it sat right behind her rear bumper, with only the front of it peeking out so it'd be visible from her rear view mirror. Okay, so it wasn't *that* heavy but it was heavy enough that she wouldn't be able to move it by herself.

Anyway, she saw it in time and thankfully didn't back over it but she screamed at me from out of her window as I walked away, alternating between demanding that I move it, insults at my social standing in life, and incredulity that anyone would dare hold up a woman whose time was as important as hers. I just waved politely back at her and yelled ""excuse you!""

This was when the Nintendo 64 was only out for a little while, so few kids had it in my area and pokemon cards were incredibly popular. 

One of my friends got a 64 as a gift from his mum. Back then they were on welfare and she was supporting 3 kids - so this 64 was a big deal for him. 
We had been sitting down playing it for damn near 8 hours straight. From memory we were trying to do Wave Race time trials or some shit. - Anyway, his aunt and uncle turned up for a visit bringing along his little cousin. This little cunt - for lack of a better term - was spoiled by his parents something fierce. He got away with murder - Ok not murder, but he could tell his mother to ""Fuck off bitch"" and she wouldn't bat an eyelid. He always got what he wanted if he threw a big enough tantrum. 

So they turn up and my friend and I are trying to ignore him as best we could and focus on the game. His cousin started bugging us to have a go - constantly. We told him no several times cause we were playing. He goes off and yells at his mother to tell us to let him play. She comes in and asks if he can have 1 go. We reluctantly agree. 

He started trying to do a particular course in a set time - and failed. Again and again and again. He eventually got so angry he rage threw the 64 controller at the wall - it shattered. The only controller barely a month out of the box destroyed by this little shit. 

My mate was devastated. I could almost see tears but before they started the look in his eye flicked to anger and he was going to get his revenge.

See, this cousin of his loved pokemon cards to the point where he carried them around in a little case with him. And his most prized possession was a charizard. They were rare as fuck and he had 1, out of the hundreds of cards his parents purchased for him, this was his most important card. 

This cousin had this smug look on his face as if he was saying ""What are you going to do about it?""
This was when my mate calmly stood up, walked over to this pokemon case, opened it and took out the charizard. 

Instantly the cousin flips and starts demanding it back. 
My mate refuses and holds it out of reach.
Cousin runs crying to his parents demanding he give it back. As they all walk in my mate drops his pants, bends over and firmly shoves this charizard card up his own arse (Well, not the whole card but a good section in the hole and the rest trapped in the crack when he clenched)

He then took it back out, put it back in the case with the other cards, and shook it up. 

I was completely gobsmacked. I mean, it was possibly the funniest thing I'd ever seen at that point but at that exact moment I was frozen in the sidelines looking at the reactions of the aunt, uncle and cousin. 

The cousin flipped his fucking mind. I have never seen a dummy spit like this. He screamed at my mate, screamed at his mother and father calling them ""Dumb shits"" for not doing anything. Started punching walls kicking the furniture and at one point his own dad.

Then something happened I never expected. His father (the uncle) caught him mid tanty, flipped him over and proceeded to smack his arse red raw. He then pulled out a $50, gave it to my mate to replace the controller and left - son still under his arm crying. 

-I Apologize for any errors. I'm tired as hell.

We were in a fraternity, so he had regular access to sorority girls and he made the most of it. By the time we turned 21, George had hooked up with a girl (or 2 or 3) at most of the sororities on campus. 

One night we were out at the bars and my friend is doing his thing and talking to a group of girls from the sorority with the “rich girls” reputation. One of the girls in the group (we’ll call her Susan) had heard about George, and did not approve of his ways. She proceeded to tell him how she felt and then finished it off with a brisk slap to the face. George may have been a player, but he wasn’t stupid, so he gave up and moved on. After a little while we decided to head on to the next bar. Unfortunately, when we left the bar those sorority girls were outside waiting for a cab. George, now a few more drinks down, couldn’t help himself and went back to talking to some of the girls. Susan came over and slapped him even harder. 

Side note: The cops in this small campus town were mostly assholes, and they clearly had nothing but contempt for guys in fraternities (I knew from experience). However, I had previously worked in the campus legal aid office, so I knew that the cops had to respond to complaints.

At this point, I had to act. I told her that it wasn’t okay for her to assault people, and she slapped me. I explained to her that she was breaking the law and told her that if she slapped me or George again, I would call the cops. She apparently didn’t believe me (or was too drunk to care), so she reared back and slapped me as hard as she could. 

I called 911 and reported the assault. Since officers regularly patrolled the campus bars, a cop was there within minutes. I calmly explained the situation to him and told him that I wanted to press charges. The cop didn’t approve and berated me about my lack of manhood. But I knew that as long as I wanted to press charges, the officer had to go along with the arrest. By now the girls’ cab had come and Susan had gotten in. The cop pulled her out of the cab, then cuffed and stuffed her. She quickly figured out that it no longer was a game, and started to cry. After the cop put her in the cruiser, he came over to take our official statements. I had no intention of actually filing charges, but I used this time to get a little more revenge. The cop was incredibly annoyed, but I made him go through all of the questioning while Susan sobbed in the back seat. And then finally, when he was about to take her downtown (literally), I waived my charges and she got to go free. 

TL;DR: Rich girl slaps friend twice, then when I tell her it is wrong to assault, she slaps me twice. I call the cops and she gets cuffed and stuffed before I waive the charges.

It just occurred to me that one of the stories I like to tell fellow web design geeks is a perfect fit for this delightfully passive-aggressive corner of reddit.

Back in 2005 I had a full-time web development job and was also doing some freelance web design on the side. I managed a few of my clients' websites on a shared hosting account and would occasionally review the built-in analytics to see who was hitting my sites and what they were looking at. This was before the days of Google Analytics. 

One day, I noticed a significant amount of traffic coming from [Xanga](http://www.xanga.com/), which appears to be some sort of blogging community now but back then was basically a MySpace clone. I figured out that all of the traffic was coming from one *very* active Xanga profile, which was using an image hosted on my account as its background image (it was a Smurf, which he had tiled in the background, making the page pretty difficult to read). I was annoyed in the most petty sort of way - how dare he hotlink *my* image and use *my* bandwidth! 

I perused his profile and discovered that he and all of his friends were all born-again evangelical types who inserted pictures of Jesus into every other comment (of which there were dozens posted on a daily basis). Jesus was everywhere on this profile. It looked like a bunch of Jesus clones were partying with the Smurfs. 

Suddenly, it hit me - the background image for this page is *on my server!* I can change this kid's profile background to anything I want!

I considered my options. Goatse immediately came to mind, but given that this kid was in high school, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Same went for any other porn/gore/etc - too mean, and not particularly funny. I then realized that the image he was hotlinking was a gif - animation was in play! The possibilities were endless.

I opened the Smurf image in Adobe Fireworks and turned it into a repeating pattern so that it would look exactly the way that it did tiled in the browser. I then turned it into an animated gif that every twenty seconds flashed an image of [Linda Blair from The Exorcist](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/447/the-exorcist-73209.jpg), kind of small (about 200px high), near the middle of the page. She'd only appear for a half-second so you'd just barely catch a glimpse of her. Then I told a bunch of friends what I had done and we enjoyed the show together in an AIM chatroom (oh 2005, I miss you).

I'm not sure how I was expecting them to react, but these kids *freaked the fuck out*. I don't think any of them had any idea what The Exorcist was, so to them this was just a terrifying demon inhabiting their online hangout. A common comment was ""I don't know what's happening but I'm praying for you and crying."" Not one kid had the technical wherewithal to figure this stupidly simple problem out. If they had just reset the profile's design/theme/whatever-Xanga-called-it, the bad face would have been gone forever. Instead, parents were involved and there was talk of consulting with their church. This went on for two days, and then the profile was deleted. 

Sadly, I don't think they even learned the lesson I was attempting to teach: Don't hotlink someone else's images, kids.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1358524828.0,,,True,t3_16tjor,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16tjor/dont_mess_with_a_web_designer/,

I'm next up when a harried-looking 50-something assmunch in a power suit walks right up to the window, shoulder to shoulder with the lady already there taking care of her mailing needs, and proceeds in a loud voice to ask through the small plastic window hole whether this is the post office that sorts mail for the XXXXX Zip code, and that he got a notice to pick up his mail somewhere or other, and is this the place?

The clerk behind the window, clearly no stranger to D.C. power player wannabes, tells the man she's dealing with a customer, and to please get in line. He repeats his question, even louder. She tells him he's being rude, that he needs to get in line like everyone else and she'll help him when it's his turn. She then goes back to helping the lady.

So assclown stands directly behind the lady customer, mumbling loudly that he just has a simple question, for chrissake, HE's not the one being rude, isn't this typical of D.C. and federal bureaucracy, has to stand in line for an hour to ask a question, blah blah blah. 

Now, I happen to know that there's another employee circulating, helping people with forms and to use the automated machine at the front of the store -- I had asked him a question when I came in. And as I'm next in line and on my lunch break, I don't want Mr. Fucknuts messing with MY precious time. So I tell him, ""Sir, I believe there's another employee in the lobby who can help you -- that guy in the blue sweater,"" and hook my thumb at said fella. Dickhead looks at me, then turns and walks back to find the guy -- without acknowledging or thanking me, of course. I can hear him back there haranguing the poor worker as I wait. 

Now the customer at the counter is finishing and I'm getting my stuff ready and wallet out, when Dr. Douchely returns. Now he's my pal, standing at my shoulder, saying that guy couldn't help, can you believe this place, just need to get a question answered, he's sure I won't mind if he just gets this thing taken care of, what IS it with these people? *These* people. 

OK, I was annoyed before, but now I'm pissed.

So as the lady at the counter moves off, he starts to step toward the window, and I step up with him. He gives me a look, and I say, ""I think the line's over there,"" and point. He steps up to the window anyway, and starts talking to the lady. She promptly tells him to get in line, puts her ""Closed"" sign up on that window, comes over to the window where *I'm* standing and starts helping me. Shithead-in-suit makes a grumphing noise and goes to the back of the line. The clerk and I have a delightful transaction, commiserating about how many self-important assholes there are in this town (loudly enough for those in line to hear) and then I head out, making sure to make full eye contact with Mr. Douchetastic. Nice petty win for US Postal Service and myself, not so much for rude self-important dickhead.

Now your whole family knows you were snooping around.,837,123,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1coykx/entitled_and_rude_on_the_phone_now_your_whole/,"I work within a University campus, as such we usually get calls from parents asking about their child's information, grades, GPAs and whatnot. For this reason the state has instituted a nondisclosure act, meaning that if the student does not want to give you the information themselves we are not allowed to either. This is to obviously protect the students privacy, and most parents or caller understand once we explain this to them and have no further issues. 
However, once in a while we seem to get a caller that does not understand that we can not give them the information no matter how loud they yell or how entitled to that information they believe they are. Legally I cannot give you this information without the students permission. It is to the point that I could be fired if I do. 
I had the delight of dealing with such a customer today. No pleasantries exchanged as per the unwritten code of phone conduct. Nope, just straight demands to know a students GPA and enrollments status. Well hello to you too mam. I then went ahead and informed her, as nicely as I could, that sadly we did not have her on record as a information recipient but that if she could contact the student and have them list her as a recipient we could gladly give her the information. 
The, um, wonderful lady on the over side of the phone then decided that rather than be understanding what she needs to do is berate me. fast forward to ten minutes of her yelling about how she is the godmother of the child, how she raised him and filled out all the paperwork for him, questioning my own intelligence and finished by saying that if her child did not hide anything from her how dare I, a simply inbreed phone pusher deny her the information she wanted.
I decided I was past the point of calling my supervisor and that I would handle it myself. I let her know that inbreed phone pusher as I may be I still cannot break federal law and I suggested that if in fact 
the student did not hide anything from her that she could ask the student directly. This did not go over well as she began to wind up again I simply told her that I could not give her that information but I would gladly help her with anything else. She promptly yelled that no she did not want any help from a idiot like me and thanked me for making such a large issue out of nothing. I told her your welcome and then heard the phone slam down. Now, I don't react to insults well, but my hands are tied by what is considered job etiquette so what can I do? I was about to give up and just fume to myself when I realized that I had all the students information on file including his phone number, and that being the caring and courteous worker that I am I should notify the student that a screaming harpy is illegally pursuing his information. The student was not at all pleased to hear about the snooping into his account and informed me that the only reason that she was calling for was because he refused to give her his left over scholarship money which he had told her he had not received (thus the GPA requirement), something that she had forced from him before. He then also told me that he and her family had spoken to her before and informed her that is she did it again they would pursue legal action, something he confided he and his family were quite eager to do and that this was the last straw. He sincerely thanked me for this information and I told him that I was simply doing my job and to have a wonderful day.

My ticket put a solid dent in my pitiful after-school-job finances, so I was really hoping the experience would be worth the investment.

We got inside, and the house was pretty packed. That was totally okay, we found a few seats off to the side and made ourselves comfortable. The seats themselves were white leather and rocked back and forth like La-Z-Boys. Also, the room had theater seating, so that each row of seats sat a foot or so higher than the row in front of it.

Cue the group of obnoxious weasel dudes who came in and sat right in front of us. They were loud, chewed with their mouths open, threw stuff, etc, but hey - the movie hadn't started yet. 

Then the kid in the seat directly in front of me started violently rocking his seat back and forth, laughing as he went. He didn't stop. The previews came and went, he kept rocking. He would frequently bang right into my knees. I cleared my throat loudly, in case he somehow didn't know I was back there. He kept rocking. The movie started. He kept rocking.

About five or ten minutes into the actual movie, I gave up on patience and let my petty side take over. I lifted my feet, placed them firmly on the back of his seat, and jammed them all the way forward. I held them there.

He tried to push back, to no avail. He was stuck in a pretty awkward position, I definitely had the advantage as far as torque or whatever. 

I held him down like that until my legs were exhausted. Then I eased back so he could sit up straight again. Miraculously, he no longer felt the need to rock himself back and forth.

On the same month I lost my job due to too many absences (mother was terminally ill) then my mother passed away and at the time husband drains the bank account and leaves me (telling me over the phone on the day I returned from my mothers services in Baltimore) that he wants a divorce. 

He worked a low wage job and was college student when we met and he had very little. When he moved into my place, all he had was his antique dresser, suitcase with his clothing and a bookshelf. 

He rarely contributed to *any* household expenses so when he left, I told him he was taking only what he brought in- suitcase, bookshelf and dresser. I had him sign a statement that he took all of his belongings and there was nothing left he was entitled to. 

A few months later I get a letter from his attorney demanding I send an itemized list of all items we purchased *together* during our marriage. 
My blood boiled  at the site of this after what he had done to me and the kids. 

So the beautiful internet helped me. I went to sites that sold some crazy sex toys and devices and made a list of 300 items we had ""purchased"" together and sent the letter to his attorney and stated I could drop them off at his office whenever he was ready to receive. 

Never heard from his attorney on the matter again. 

Fast forward to after the divorce and ex is still a bitter asshat- I get a letter from his new attorney claiming some BS that I am not in compliance with the standing court order for visitation because I had moved and did not inform the courts of my new address thus a ""direct violation of the order by not advising the court 10 days after move"" 

It's not that I was hiding, my ex had the address, he was picking the kids up and dropping them off at the new address, he just wanted to be a dick.

The letter also stated that he was represented and that I am not to have direct contact with *his* client. 

Oh, thank you for opening that door! Cha-Ching! 

So, I called his attorneys office and asked about the hourly price for services and how much a phone call or fax would be to read. 

The attorney charged $300.00 per hour and each call, if under 15 minutes and each fax would cost $75.00. 

So I came up with the dumbest questions and most ridiculous things to fax his attorney for: 
Oh, let your client know I will be 15 minutes late from work today so he may have to wait to get the kids. 

I lost the insurance card, can you get a replacement? I think our son left a toy, can you check with your client. Did his clothes get dried with downy, cause he is having allergic reactions, etc. 

I sent 40 faxes per day- oddly after two weeks, my ex was no longer a client of said attorney.

This story took place just over 10 years ago.  I worked for a pretty upscale hotel night manager for a few years.  I had two other night auditors on my team, one of them being the relief night manager who had become a really good friend.  This hotel had a real bitch of a GM but working nights I just heard the horror stories from the day staff and I never really had to deal with her until one morning when she came in really early with the operations manager to have a talk with me.  Apparently they read the key log from a previous night and wanted to know why I was going in and out of a vacant guest room that had been left dirty by housekeeping.  I explained my laundry machine had broken down at home and I was washing doing some laundry at the hotel while on my shift.  I was severely reprimanded and threatened to be fired which was a bit excessive in my opinion by I understood that it was wrong.  I was a loyal, hardworking employee and that was the only thing I had done wrong, a lapse of judgment by me.

Fast forward a year later and I am finding that working nights is not working out for me anymore, I have trouble sleeping during the day and its really taking a toll on my health.  I love the hotel and the company though so I stick it out until two day opportunities open up.  One is a daytime duty manager position on the front desk and the other is an accounts payable position.  I have the experience and knowledge so I interview for both and am told by the controller and the front office manager that they both want me and I just have to make a choice.  I am quite excited and I have a meeting with the bitch GM to discuss where to go but during the meeting she puts the brakes on my daytime employment dreams.  She tells me she doesn’t want me in either position and she wants me to continue working nights.  I explain my reasons for wanting a day position and she says I will not get any of those positions but she will find me a housekeeping or janitorial job in the day if I really want to.  

FUCK THAT.  That night my drunk girlfriend pops into the hotel to visit and we let ourselves into the bitch GM’s office and have sex all over her desk, not cleaning anything up after.  I type up my resignation giving two weeks notice.  Upon seeing what was happening the relief night manager says, and I quote, “fuck this shit, if you are quitting then so am I!”  He types his resignation as well giving his two weeks notice.  We want to be fair to the third night auditor so we call him up the next morning and explain what happened and he decides to give his notice as well.  The next night the three of us are scheduled and we celebrate by showing up a few hours late and quite intoxicated.  We make it through the shift and the three of us spent the remainder of our two weeks notice either calling in sick or taking lieu days.  Having the whole night audit team up and quit with no notice left the hotel fucked.  We heard stories of the operations manager working nights and even the GM having to pull night shifts because there was nobody else, never mind the lack of training and the fact that nobody else knew how the night procedures.  

The aftermath… the positions I applied for were both filled by hiring from the outside.  The girl who was hired for the DM position was fired within a couple weeks for sleeping with one or more or the bellmen.  The accounts payable person was fired about 6 weeks in for being useless.  I went on to find a great job for an extremely great company as an accountant and they are paying for me to become a CGA.  I still see the old bitchy GM around town and I make sure to give her a big smile and wave.

TL;DR: Bitch GM holds grudge, fucks me over so I fuck someone in her office, fuck over her hotel.

All of the lots were full so we always parked about a 25 minute walk to our buildings. I don't mind the long walks, but some days the weather makes it pretty painful. 

We were parking here for about a year or so and we got to know the other vehicles in the lot. We worked longer hours than most other people and were usually amongst the first to arrive and pretty much always the last to leave. There was one other woman on our same schedule so we ran into each other a lot.

Our city sucks for cold snaps. We were about a week into a cold snap that was staying constantly below -35C and felt like -45C with the wind chill. Pretty horrible conditions, but that is where I live.

One day I got to my car and realized my engine block heater stopped working. My car was frozen and needed a boost to get it going. The problem was we were in an area where there are few people around. The only two vehicles left in the lot was mine and this woman's. We had a rough idea that she should be around soon, and sure enough she was. 

I had my booster cables on my battery waiting. When she arrived I asked her if she could boost us. ""Nope"".

Normally I would chalk it up to it being a jerk, but this time my wife and I were freezing and had a 25 minute walk back to our office which was closed. Meaning other than getting lucky and finding someone, we would likely need to wait for a tow company to boost us. So I asked her again and reminded her how cold it was.

Her response: ""No, you should have plugged it in"". Then she drove away before I could explain that it was plugged in. This is extremely rare to have someone so unhelpful in Canada. In fact it was a first for me. 

I was livid, but I decided to go to the nearest main street and wait for someone to drive by. An hour later I found the first car. My wife let me keep the warm clothes and she went to the lobby of the office to stay warm. Some nice guy pulled over and boosted me and we made it home - although I am sure my ears had a little frostbite on them.

The next morning the weather was equally bad so we decided to take my wife's car. It was less reliable but it had command start that worked great. So we just programmed it to start every 30 minutes just to keep the engine warm enough.

Once we arrived at the lot I noticed the woman's truck was already there. I went over and unplugged it just enough that there was no connection, but it still looked like it was plugged in. Then we went to work. I forgot about it the whole day until I was walking back to the lot in the freezing cold.

When I got to the lot there were only the two vehicles again, mine and hers. My wife started her car without a problem and while we were waiting for the car to warm up the woman appeared. On cue her truck has a very slow turn-over that only slowed until all that was left was a clicking noise. Same thing that happened to my car the day before.

We waited a minute and to our surprise she had the nerve to ask us for a boost. I told her that she should have plugged her truck in, then drove away. 

That was the last time I seen her at that lot.

How about a ticket instead.,834,142,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16c0ba/you_want_to_race_how_about_a_ticket_instead/,"Driving home from work, I ended up getting out later than usual so traffic was already tapering off from rush hour. One of the main roads I take was closed for construction, so I took my own nice, relaxing detour through some side roads. I'm tooling along, about 3-5 over the speed limit, whatever...just want to get home, when some jackwad in his Mustang GT blows through a stop sign behind me and comes speeding right up my chuff. 

I guess he wanted to go faster? He can deal...I'm on a somewhat unfamiliar road, it's getting dark, the road is twisty and hilly and I'm already doing 45 in a 40. Deal with it guy. 

Deal with it he does not. Spends most of the time swerving around behind me, honking, flashing his lights...whatever. I don't have time to deal with some meathead trying to impress his bimbo Snooki wannabe in his convertible.  The best part is there is enough traffic coming the other way, and enough twists and turns, that there is no way for him to pass. I hate slowpokes just as much as the next guy, but 5 over isn't that unreasonably slow.

So I finally make it to a point where the road splits into 2 lanes in my town (familiar territory! Yay!). There happens to be a stop light right at that point, so we both get stopped at the light. He pulls up next to me and just starts RAGING. Then he starts revving  his engine. Okay...so you want to race? Suuure, like that's going to happen.

It's then that I notice, behind a little hill just up the road, the tippy top part of police cruiser's lights. There's a cop up there...and the road is about to hit 35. This is a well known speed trap. I'm sure this guy doesn't see him because he's too busy cussing me out.

So I rev up my engine and finally make eye contact with the guy. Oh yeah, let's race! When the light changes I drop the clutch in (manual) and let my tires spin a bit to give him reason to lay his foot down as he takes off, and then I slowly pull forward. He probably got up to about 70 MPH by the time he passed the cop. In a 35 MPH zone. That's reckless driving folks.

Cop wastes no time in flying out, sirens and lights going. Pulls him over not a quarter of a mile down the road as I went by, still doing about 5 over.

1355002152.0,684,self.pettyrevenge,14ijp6,How I got revenge against a compulsive cheater,844,160,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/14ijp6/how_i_got_revenge_against_a_compulsive_cheater/,"I apologize for wall-of-text and if this one is a little too technical.  This involves a somewhat popular card-based trading game (MTG).  I tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read.  Plus, I don’t remember them all.

I usually am not the one to take revenge since I’m risk-averse.  However, in this case, I found it was the most logical thing to do since I knew ahead of time that the other guy was going to try and screw me.

There was this fellow in my high school.  His name was David.  He was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole, a compulsive liar and a compulsive cheater.

Often times during lunch hour, students would get together at the tables to play card games and such.  I usually got involved in these games as well.  David did too, but not as often.  

When he did, I watched him.  Honestly, this kid fascinated me since he was completely blatant about his lying and cheating.  I remember distinctly watching him play a game of Magic: The Gathering with another student and I would watch him take 2, 3, even 4 cards at a time when he should have only been drawing 1.  His opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what David was doing.  I just kept my mouth shut.  Pretty soon he had something like 20 cards in his hand while his opponent had 4-5.  It was very ridiculous.

I usually avoided playing with him, but I must have played with him at least once.  He would continue to cheat in the open until you called him on it.  Of course, he would try to lawyer himself out of it or tell me I got it wrong.  He would try to change the rules of the game to benefit him in the moment for his specific situation.  He would throw a fit if you tried to argue and would only back down if you got the whole audience to agree unanimously that he was wrong.  Playing him was an exhausting experience since you spend more time arguing and watching him than playing the game.

It was 1995 at the time, and I had played some Magic: The Gathering (MTG).  I was nearly finished with this game since all the great expansions came out before I even got involved, and people with money held all the power cards.  I had dropped my own money in the new expansion “Fallen Empires”, which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the game’s history.  Therefore, I was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since I didn’t see how I could ever catch up.

A guy I knew, Alex, decided to organize a starter pack tournament, where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack.  This sounded like an interesting variation on the game, and I thought I might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game I was quickly losing interest in.

Incidentally, David joined this tournament.  Now, his reputation was well known by Alex, but he let David join anyway.  The logic being that he needed people, even if those people were assholes.  There was only something like 5 people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with that.

Can you guess whom my first match was against?    That’s right.  It was fuckface himself:  David.

Now, I didn’t want to lawyer and argue with David the whole game since that was no fun at all.  If I was going to play him, I wanted to completely royally screw him over and embarrass him in front of the whole player tournament.  A sort of preemptive revenge for the shit I know he was going to pull on me. 

Knowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities.  I felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game.  I needed to stack the deck in my favor, so to speak.  Let me explain what I did.

So, each player was given a starter pack and one booster pack (MTG Revised Edition for those who care).  This gave you an assortment of cards that made overall fairly weak decks.  Most games resulted in waiting for the person to get enough land to play a monster and start doing damage against their opponent.  Any sizeable monster in play usually results in that player winning since our decks were so weak.

In order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards, you need to strip out all the fluff that was going to do you no good.  So your cards were divided into your active playing deck and your reject pile.  You only played with your active deck.  At the end of the game, the winner gets to draw at random a card to keep from the loser’s active deck or your reject pile.  It’s the winner’s choice.    This is important later.

My deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a Demonic Tutor.  It essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want.  If I ever got this card, it would be my key to winning since I could pick out the only monster I have that actually does damage.  So now I have two chances of winning.  If I draw my monster or draw the Demonic Tutor.

David also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well.  I think it was some kind of rare card and he cherished it so much.  I don’t remember what card it was, but I remember it did him no good against me.   My goal was to completely win the match and then pilfer his Precious Rare “at random”.

To prepare, I took my uberpowerful Demonic Tutor card and oh so gently, put a tiny fold in the top right corner of the card.  This way, if you put it in a deck, you can see it stand out from all the other cards.  You only see this if you know what to look for.  

When we met for our match, we get to browse each other’s cards so we know what to expect.  I browsed through his deck and took out his Precious Rare to admire.  While David was too busy looking through my cards, I put the same tiny fold in his rare card and put it back in his deck.  I didn’t have time to check if it stood out, so I crossed my fingers.

Next we shuffled our cards.  Since I could see where my Demonic Tutor was, I shuffled it carefully so that it was below the 75% mark in my deck.  So when he cut my deck, there’s a good chance that the Demonic Tutor would end up near the top.  If I didn’t end up getting this card, I have a second chance of getting the monster instead.

Luckily, when he cut my deck, he cut it above my Demonic Tutor’s location, so I was good to go in that department.  Next, I cut his deck, but since I could see where his Precious Rare was located, I made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldn’t show up during the match.  David was too self-absorbed to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentions.

Things are going well so far, and I’m starting to feel bad for David.  I’m starting to question whether what I’m doing is the right thing.  These doubts are quickly erased by subsequent events.

We start to play.  My job here at this point was to watch him like a hawk and call him out every time he tries to cheat.  And try he did.  He tried to do the whole multiple card-draw on me.  I called him out on it.  David tried to act like it was an accident.  This got the tournament organizer’s attention and David a verbal tongue lashing from Alex.

Alex basically told David to stop acting like an asshole and play the game.  This had the effect of crucially destroying David’s credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side.  I shined a spotlight on his douchey ways, so to speak.

Next thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules.  Of course, I made a calm but loud enough scene for everyone to notice and eventually called Alex over again to adjudicate.  Alex told him he’s full of shit and ruled in my favor.

Soon enough, I had the Demonic Tutor in my hand after several turns since it was near the top.  By this time, I had all that I needed but the monster.  I pretended to act joyful and surprised when I threw down my Demonic Tutor and went rifling through my deck to get that monster.  David’s face started to go red and his body was very agitated.

The next round, I threw that monster on the table with gusto!  I celebrated with “Yes!” and “I can’t believe it!”.   The other people in the room were starting to admire my skill and good luck.  They were really watching my game now and clearly wanting to see me win.

The best David can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster.  Knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his Precious Rare safely at the bottom of his deck, I was inwardly confident, but acted nervous to lead him on that he actually had a chance of pulling one out.

Every subsequent round, I would attack him with the monster, pinging his life down.  Of course, during this time, nothing good came out of his deck.  Slowly, his chances for winning dwindled and his fury grew.

Then it was over.  I celebrated and other people in the room marveled at my amazing play style.  David was so mad he was shaking.  Whenever he spoke, he was petulant and angry.

While I was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune, David had already planned and executed his next cheat.  He took both his active pile and his reject pile and mixed them together as soon as the game ended.  If you recall, these piles are supposed to be separate so that I could choose which pile to pilfer from.  By mixing them up, he reduces the chance that I’ll randomly take any of his good cards, including his Precious Rare.

I immediately called him out on it as he’s mixing them together.  He starts arguing about the tournament rules and his interpretation of them.  I make a big show of arguing and acting like I was cheated.  Honestly, it didn’t matter that he did this since I could still see where his Precious Rare was.  This final act of cheating showed his petulance and completely ruined any reputation he had in the room.

I called over Alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution.    Clearly there was no way to unmix the decks unless you have an entropy reversal device, so the damage was done.  Alex called David an asshole for what he did, and Alex tried to placate my hurt feelings.

Acting hurt and angry, I told him “Fine!  Let’s get this over with.”  David had a smirk under his face, thinking he’d finally pulled one over on me.  Oh, how wrong he was.

While making a show of concentration and trepidation, I spread his deck out and made a show of going after a card, but changing my mind a couple times.  Finally, “at random”, I pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the Precious Rare.

Immediately David let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent.   He quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room.  But I had his Precious Rare.

Everyone was overjoyed that I had completely and totally demolished David and dealt a slice of righteous karmic justice at the same time.  We all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved.  Honestly it was the highlight of the tournament.

David dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him go.

I never told anyone about my deception.  I think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against David to deliver justice.

tl;dr  I outcheated the cheater by knowing the future.

My playground now, bitch!",794,116,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/14dtol/in_my_second_year_of_primary_school_a_kid_lied_to/,"**WARNING: WALL OF TEXT AHEAD! Also, this was a long time ago for me, names are replaced and whatnot.**

I was on a piece of playground equipment known as the 'Jetty' at my local primary (elementary) school in grade 2, enjoying some time to myself during lunch. This ~~kid~~ entitled little shit from the year below me - We'll call him Trent - decides that he wants to play on the Jetty instead. He strides up to me and tells me to leave, to which I tell him that I was here first but I'd be happy to share it with him. 

Trent didn't seem to like the sound of that idea. Instead, he chucks an absolute tantrum and wails at me with language no five or six year old should even know, let alone repeat in public. I try my best to ignore him at first, but then he started pushing me. I made the fatal mistake of pushing him back just as a teacher walked around the corner - We're both dragged of to the principal's office. The whole walk there he keeps leaning over and whispering to me; 'Oh, you're in *so* much trouble now"".

The principal sits us both down and calmly asks us one at a time to tell our stories. He starts with me. I calmly tell him the abridged version: Trent wanted the playground to himself, I offered to share but he hit me. When it's Trent's turn, the *little fucker* breaks down and cries like a baby seal getting clubbed while watching the Arctic equivalent of Bambi's mum's death scene in slow motion. He tells the principal about how I threw him off the Jetty, called him names and swore at him (""I... I don't want to say what he said. It was the F-word but I don't want to say it because I know it's a bad word Mr. H, he was just so *mean!*). 

I sat there, wide-jawed and absolutely gobsmacked at this lying little turd, watching the principal hug him and tell him everything's going to be alight. Mr. H kept glancing at me like I was some sort of devil-spawn sent from hell with the soul purpose of making poor little Trent's life utterly miserable. I try telling him that he's lying, but it's just no use. After all, I was the older kid in the situation - I should have known better, right?

The principal asks me to step outside his office to have a chat with him in person. He tells me how disappointed he is and how ashamed I should feel for hurting poor innocent Trent. I was given a punishment I wouldn't have (at the time) wished on my worst enemy - Garbage duty with Ms. Hanzel. 

Ms. Hanzel was a rotten old lady that seemed to absolutely despise students. She was about sixty years of age and physically looked like a female version of Jabba the Hutt with glasses (**EDIT**: Anodesu suggested [Roz from Monster's Inc](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110515131745/pixar/images/4/43/Roz.png). - Much better example!) . I could constantly hear her shouting at her pupils from outside the halls, she would scream like a damn banshee and wouldn't stop until someone started crying. One time she (apparently) grabbed my younger cousin by the wrist and yanked her outside when she tried to ask a question during 'silent time', leaving a large red mark all down her arm. But that's a story for another time. The point was, Ms. Hanzel was an absolute witch, and I was going to spend the next few hours picking up rubbish in front of all my peers with her.

The principal walked me outside her office and made sure I knocked on the door before heading back to check on poor little Trent. I slicked inside, dreading talking to the wicked she-beast inside. I had a little note with me asking her to give me rubbish duty until the end of the day, then to send me back to the principal's office after school. She looks at it briefly, hands me a plastic bag and stares at me for a good thirty seconds. ""What did you do?"", she asked me. Frustrated and scared, I broke down crying. Between sobs I managed to tell her about how Trent lied to get me in trouble. She sat down, and I'll never forget the story she told me.

She explained that back when she was my age, many teachers would spank students for misbehaving. She told me how the boys would usually get a paddle across the butt, but the girls would get a smaller but still painful ruler across the back of the hand. One day when she was at school, another girl accidently knocked over the teacher's inkwell and blamed it on her. She got 10 hard spanks to the back of the hand (Demonstrating the first three with her ruler in mid air, one after another). She told me how much she despised this disgusting little girl, and how badly she was treated for the rest of her time there.

Then, she went to the bin in the corner and poured it's contents in to my plastic bag. ""I believe you. Go back to class, I'll tell Mr. H that you picked up all the rubbish you could find, okay?"". I couldn't believe it. I was standing right in front of the nastiest teacher in the whole school and here she was giving me the equivalent of a royal pardon.

To make an already long story short, I did go back to class. At the end of the day I got another yelling from the principal and a call home to my parents, but it wasn't until the next day that everything fell in to place. I was on a different part of the playground when Ms. Hanzel came storming by with a little boy at her side - Trent. I was overcome with an emotion I didn't recognize then, but one I now associate with sweet, sweet revenge. I strode up to the Jetty and played on that damn thing all lunch while Ms. Hanzel made the little shit pick up all the rubbish down below me. I don't know what she got him for, but she made sure I could see the brat at all times, and more importantly, the little brat could see me playing on the playground he so desperately wanted to himself. I like to think that she helped me achieve the revenge she never got.

**TL;DR: Feral kid wanted playground to himself, tried to fight me then told principal that I punched and swore at him to get me in trouble when I wouldn't give him what he wanted. The school's most evil teacher doesn't fall for his lies, shares a touching story with me and makes the little shit watch me play on the playground while he picks up rubbish, enacting her own long-overdue childhood revenge in the process. No one asks for tree fiddy.**

Despite her poor luck with her first roommate she decided to place an ad to find a new roommate. She went through several interviews and finally found a really nice  - or so we thought - girl who seemed down to earth. 

Being new to looking for roommates we overlooked a couple of things that we really shouldn't have. For example, on her move-in date she was supposed to have damage deposit and first months rent. She had the rent, but no damage deposit. She said she would have it that night, but it took about a week until it was all collected.

Through the first month my wife noticed this girl was a complete slob. Her room was just a series of garbage bags packed with her lifes possessions and she never cleaned up after herself. 

The roommate came home one day with a cat. My wife didn't mind since she only has me stopping her from becoming the cat lady with 50+ cats. The problem was the roommate never fed the cat. She would leave for days on end with no one taking care of the cat. My wife always took on that responsibility. Good thing cats are pretty resilient.

Then, as per their arrangement, she was supposed to pay the rent prior to the first of the month. That date came and went, and she had only paid about a third of the rent by the time the next months rent came around. 

At this point my wife hadn't seen her roommate in weeks. We only knew she was there because she is a complete slob and left a massive mess in her wake. Finally my wife had a sick day and managed to see her roommate and asked for the rent money. The roommate said ""yeah I will go get it right now"". She never came back that night. 

We knew she was getting the boot at that point. The next day my wife went to class and came home to an empty apartment. Her roommate moved her stuff out and even took the kitten she never took care of. No forwarding address, nothing.

We were out about $1000 in total. After about a week of searching we managed to get her parents number. After explaining the situation to them they gave us the phone number where she was staying - but not the address. Reverse look-ups weren't as easy back then (at least to me).

My wife called several times and received some pretty rude responses from her now former roommates boyfriend. At this point we were suing her for the money she owed us and needed to serve her the papers. So without the address this was pretty difficult. 

After a bunch of unsuccessful calls, I decided to try myself from my home in a different city. I called and the boyfriend answered. I told him he has a chance to win a brand new big screen TV if he can answer three skill testing questions. I made up some BS match question and a couple other BS questions that I didn't even listen for his answers.

I then told him, congratulations you've won the new TV. He said ""BS, this is a joke"" and I re-assured him it was no joke. I told him the TV would be delivered in a couple of days between 6pm-9pm and asked where he wanted it delivered. He gave me the address. I said we would have someone come by and confirm the address this evening and asked if he would be around. He said his girlfriend would be. My wife went directly over there and rang the buzzer. When she answered she said she was there to confirm the address for the TV delivery. When the former roommate came to the door my wife handed her the court papers and walked away.

The roommate never showed up in court and for obvious reasons was ordered to pay my wife the amount she was owed.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1847g2,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1847g2/youve_won_a_tv/,

I keep a small container of coupons next to my register, because certain purchases qualify for a coupon that customers can bring back for later use. Most customers know to keep their hands off, but this kid dumped all my coupons onto the counter because he wanted the paper clips and rubber bands attached to the container. His mom told him to leave my stuff alone and placed everything back, but he did it again two or three times. Finally she pushed the coupons out of his reach, and this kid had the nerve to jump and swipe across the counter to reach. I hadn't done or said anything at this point, because I firmly believe it was his mother's job to parent and not mine, but I felt like I had to do something to this kid for refusing to listen. So instead of giving him a plain blue boy's bag, I put all his clothes in a pink, glittery shopping bag covered in hearts and stripes, with the name of the girl's store in HUGE LETTERS across the side.

Last night he told me a story that showed me a side of him that I did not know existed (and is deliciously evil!). 

As he explained, in their youth, guys are kind of confused/terrified of women. As they get older, most guys go through a transitional ""asshole"" phase, like a rite-of-passage, when they realize girls are just people and not all that scary/special. He happened to be in that phase while he was in law school. 

He and a friend had gone to a local bar and, while there, met two young ladies (too young to be in the bar but utilizing fake IDs) that they seemed to really hit it off with. From what he explains, the night went well. They partied after the bar, had a blast, drank and partied until 6 or 7 AM, and passed out, although they didn't hook up (save your breath - he has no reason to lie about this as we share laughs about most of his ""exploits""). The next morning he and his friend drove home, feeling successful. 

They each wait the requisite three days before texting the girls, only to receive no response. No big deal. They shrug it off. He calls again a few days later and again receives no response. His friend has no better luck with his chick. Eventually they move on/let it go/forget about them. 

Weeks later they go to that same bar, accompanied by a female friend of theirs. It was packed, but they manage to score three chairs at the bar. He and his guy friend hang their coats on their chairs and leave their female friend inside while they go smoke. 

When they return, who is sitting in their chairs but the girls from before, accompanied by two new guys. Annoyed at being brushed off, he immediately approaches the girls and asks what was up, why they had dodged contact. The girl he had liked responds smarmily with, ""It is what it is."" He says that's fine, but could she get out of his seat because he and his friend were sitting there. She brushes him off again and replies, ""I said it is what it is,"" and turns to her ""date"" to ignore my boyfriend. 

That sent him over the edge. To allow guys to pay for all of your drinks, party with them, pretend to be friendly then ignore them, and then be a complete bitch when bumping in to them was unacceptable in his eyes. 

Attending a law school in the South, he explained that there were cops that pretty much patrolled all the local hot spots. He found one and explained to him that a girl in the bar had been bragging about using a fake ID and, as a law school student, it was his obligation to inform the authorities. The cop asks what she looks like, and my boyfriend explains that she's a pretty blonde girl. The cop looked at him like he was crazy (as my boyfriend said, ""stared at me like what are you doing bro?"") and asked how he was going to know which girl it was. My boyfriend just told him he would give her a hug ""goodnight"". 

He walked back into the bar, gathered his friends, and then (acting as if it was an afterthought) returns to the girl and says, ""Look. No hard feelings. Have a good night!""

He said the look in her eyes as she watched the police officer approach her from over his shoulder was priceless. She went to jail that night after being dragged out of the bar by a cop and having the contents of her purse dumped all over the street in public.

Except for some reason she focused all her energy on me, so for a long time, like years, I had no friends in my class.
I did have a neighbour who was my friend. She was a year ahead of me, so I didn't see her much at school, but she was cool, always invited me to birthday parties where none of my bullies showed up.
One time, she defended me in front of the bullies. It was pretty simple but pretty awesome, since no one else had stood up for me before.
My neighbour friend fell out of touch when she moved away. I was 12.
Recently I looked up the bully on Facebook to see what she was up to. I had kind of hoped she would get fat and miserable and work at Walmart. She's still pretty, with a new baby and a husband and their own house in a nice neighbourhood. Yes, I got all that from Facebook. I was a bit disappointed. I thought karma was better than that.
Then I looked up my neighbour friend. She's an engineer now, living in Switzerland and working on the CERN supercollider. Cool. Like, probably the coolest person as an adult I can say I knew growing up.

My number was 12X-3456, their number was 12Y-3456. At first I thought people were simply misdialing but then I would ask them to confirm the number they were calling. They would read back to me the number that the installers had left for them to call to complete the installation and it was always my number. The odd time this happened would have been fine, but living in a university city, you would get hundreds of installations (and thus calls) when classes started.  
  
This actually went on for a few years and every time I called them to fix it they would either say that it had already been fixed or that there was nothing they could do about it, even though they were the people giving the installers the number.  
  
After a particularly busy fall installation season, I had had enough and called the IP one last time to resolve it. When they once again said it was beyond their control, I told them what I was going to do. I was going to tell their customers that I was no longer an internet service provider and that I would be unable to complete their installation. That they would need to get a hold of competing company B that was authorized to finish the installation (and thus get the contract) at the following (correct) phone number. The customer was never to call this number again and that I thought the customer was stupid for even using company A to begin with.  
  
The IP flipped and said I couldn't tell their customers that! I replied that I'm not really saying anything untrue, and that if they really don't want their customers to hear that, then they can get their customers to stop calling me.  
  
Over the next few weeks I had about 20 calls that I gave this reply to. And then, after years of annoyance, the IP was somehow able to figure out how to fix the phone numbers and I was never bothered again.  
  
Edit: Just adding a few things -  
  
I didn't want to change my phone number as I had had it for years and was worried about losing touch with friends.  
  
What worked with the customers that I told this was that while I never claimed to be the company they were calling, I did not deny that I was the IP, and the little script I used could certainly have sounded like I was the IP. In no way did I lie though or cross a legal line.

My friends and I had been there several hours. Watching the shows put on, walking around, looking at what the venders were selling, eating giant turkey legs and having a ye olde good time. My friends wanted to see the afternoon joust so we meandered our way in that direction. We got there with plenty of time to spare so my friends are doing things like taking time finding a place to sit, getting on line for beer and checking out what is on this side of the faire. Near the jousting field they have a blacksmith shop and demonstration area. Since the joust was soon the guys working there are just hanging out. 

I'm looking at stuff and eventually strike up a conversation with the guys at the blacksmith booth, who are around the same age as me. I'm asking stuff about how they got into metalworking, how long they have been doing it and stuff like that. I've done some gold/silver smithing in my time so we are talking about our experiences.

Now would be a good time to interject some relevant information. I am female, mid-twenties and like many people there, I was partially in renaissance garb. In other words my ""huge tracts of land"" are lookin' good. But not obscene because this is a family place, too.

My friends wandered off to watch the joust so it's just me and the blacksmiths and some neckbeard who showed up. I skip the joust because this is some good conversation and I am interested in metalwork. As the conversation continues Neckbeard starts interjecting. Apparently, he has done metalwork, too! 

He is not particularly polite. I start asking the blacksmiths about projects they have done. Every project the blacksmiths mention, he has done, too. Oh, you got injured doing something? He did something similar but got hurt worse. So on and so forth, in a rather smug manner. The blacksmith are not enjoying Neckbeards company.

This goes on for most of the joust. Maybe I had just been in the sun too much that day, but it was getting pretty grating and eventually I'd had enough.

**""You know, all your one-upmanship stories are just making me think you have a small penis!""** I hear myself say.

During my time at uni, I had some really loud neighbors downstairs. I was on the third floor, and they were on the first. They had a little garden on their apartment that was right under my room's window. When I looked down from it, I saw the garden, all of it's plants and it's cold stone floor.

Being women in their 20's who were in college, they used that space to party. Hard. I would not normally mind that, but they did it VERY frequently - often everyday -, disregarding the fact it was an all residential building, filled with families and other students that did not share their willingness to party at home.

They studied only in the late afternoon, so they could party all night and sleep during the day. I studied all morning and afternoon. The obvious result: While they were OK, I had many nights without proper sleep.

Me and some other neighbors tried to solve the issue friendly, only to be dissmissed by spoiled bitches that thought what they did in their apartment was their bussiness only. Then we tried to solve it by legal means, calling the police and some other stuff. We even got them to pay a couple fines. But $400 to be shared among 4 rich spoiled bitches was not going to stop them from doing wrong, of course.

So I decided to prank them. It was small stuff at first. Very petty. One night, while they were partying, I cut the power to their apt. in the electrical box on the street. Took them a whole week to figure out the problem. Another night, I peed on their car. I threw poison on their plants from my window. That petty, silly kind of thing.

The other neighbors were at it too. I heard (although I'm quite sure it is not true) that one of them went down the underground, cameraless garage one night, with sandpaper, and took all the paint out of one of their cars. I wish I had at least seen the car afterwards, but I never did. I'm sure we annoyed them, but not enough for anything to change.

This went on for a long, long time. More than a year, I'm sure. Maybe two. A couple years can be a lot, when you have to study for your tests, has a lot of personal problems and can't get enough sleep.

One glorious day, a rat poped up at my own apartment. I never knew where it came from, since I was on the third floor and my place was always very clean and tidy, but it was ok. I got lucky and was able to trap the creature into a corner and kill it with a broom. Since it was so easy to get rid of him, I never told anyone about the rat.

It was a fairly big rat. About the size of both my closed fists side by side, excluding it's long tail. It was pretty hairy, all black. Not very unusual, I guess. But I had never even seen a rat this close before, so I thought it was interesting.

The thing is, I have a mild interest in biology, so I decided to preserve the cadaver in formaldehyde to dissect it later. I had dissected plenty of frogs before, since I loved the electrical impulse/muscle contraction experiment, but had never even touched a rat.

So I decided to keep it in my room (yeah, I know...) inside a little bottle for a few days. I was honestly hoping to dissect it for some first year students later, but then...

One night my loud neighbors started to party as usual. It was a wednesday. But that night, there was something different in the air... A smell. Delicious and meaty, a barbecue was being held in their little garden. It was easy to spot from my window, since it was night and it had coal burning bright and smoke climbing all the way up to meet me.

When I saw that, my mind suddenly cleared. I knew exactly what to do. I took the dead rat out of his wet sarcophagus, and out of the third floor window he went. My aim was true that night, as it felt right over the rest of their cooking meat. The formaldehyde, flammable as it is, proppeled the fires beautifully, and the sound of what I believe was a small explosion followed the sound of the rat hitting the grill.

I did not see anything, as I immediately retreated my face back insede the room. Screams everywhere, friends of the bitches running to the door, sounds of beer bottles breaking... The party was over in a minute. They called the police right after.

I did not sleep that night. Nor the rest of the week. I was sure they knew it was me, and was expecting either retaliation or legal action. But, to my surprise, they moved out a week later.

A mutual friend told me the reason: someone from the top apartments had thrown a rat filled with alchool on their grill. The police investigator that came that night somehow deduced it was from very high, above the fifth floor.

Nobody got hurt, but the bitches understood the gesture as a death threat and left. According to my friend, they moved out to a new apartment, but they don't do partying at their home anymore. They are scared as fuck that they might have an even crazier neighbor than the last one.

I was the only witness to my own crime. They never saw me.

Sweet, petty, ratty revenge.

Everything my wife and I do is taken as a slight against her, and when she doesn't get her way, she constantly makes passive aggressive remarks about it. She's always complaining about how we never visit even though we only live an hour away. (Please note that she has not once visited US since we moved where we are now.)   
  
Setup: This past weekend my wife and I were in town where her mother lives. It's also where our alma mater is; where we met, etc. We were there to attend a festival that we go to every year, but in order to appease my mother-in-law, we agree to go early in the day to have a late lunch with her. Of course, she decides we HAVE to go to this place that's 45 minutes in the next town. She suggests that I drive all of us (me, my wife, MIL, and brother in law).  
  
Petty: Here's the thing; my mother in law HATES Led Zeppelin with a passion. The first bars of Stairway send her into fits. However, being the passive aggressive person that she is, rather than say anything, she'll silently fume and make offhand remarks, or try to talk over the music. So here I am sitting in my car waiting for my extended family to get in for an hour and a half round trip. I load up my iPod to my handy-dandy Led Zeppelin playlist consisting of several hours of playtime, and decide that's what we're listening to on the whole ride to and from brunch.

Now my friend is a nice woman, but she doesn't take care of her yard and it really looks bad especially in the fall. Making it look worse is the fact that her neighbor really keeps up her yard and it looks spotless all the time. Well I had a few minutes to spare so I got out of my truck and started to blow the leaves into a pile so I could remove them. I'm a landscaper and..well its what I do. No sooner than I get started when the neighbor comes out screaming at me, ""you'd better not get any leaves on my property. I pay good money to have my yard cleaned and I don't appreciate you blowing leaves on it, blah, blah, hell to pay, blah, blah."" Really rude, over the top, abusive. I tried to explain that I was a neighbor just trying to do a good deed not only for my friend but for her as well, but she wasn't having any of it, talked right over me. ""I don't care who you are or why you're here, I'd better not find one leaf on my yard when you are done or else!"" Well I finish up the yard and meekly get back in my truck and drive away thinking no good deed goes unpunished. I mean my friend never even thanked me because she probably didn't even notice.
A little over a year later the neighbor's yard starts to look really bad and upon asking my friend I learn that the husband has gotten Cancer, the insurance has run out and they are having a rough time financially. Obviously the first thing you cut back on is paying for lawn maintenance and it showed. I made a decision, much to the chagrin of my wife and bewilderment of my friend, that I would secretly clean up their front yard whenever I could because..well its the right thing to do regardless of how I'd been treated.
Well she came out and caught me one day, her car was in the shop and I thought no one was at home. I heard her voice behind me saying, ""I want to meet the person that has been so sweet as to take care of my yard these past few months and say thank you from the bottom of my heart."" When I turned around and she saw my face I swear she turned first white as a ghost and then almost as quickly red as an apple. ""No problem, neighbor,"" I said with a smile, ""just glad I could help you out."" I wished her a good day and went on my way. 
I found out later from my friend that she remembered me and how badly she treated me and was fucking mortified when she found out that it was I who had been maintaining her yard. 
Her husband has since passed away and I continue to this day helping her out when I see the yard looking bad. Sure I'd like to think that I do it out of the goodness in my heart, but there is a part of me that takes some satisfaction knowing that I'm slowly, as my Mother used to say, killing her with kindness.
Sometimes the best revenge is kindness in the face of rudeness, for it acts as a mirror reflecting an image to the recipient that they are often mortified to see. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_19ada8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/19ada8/killing_em_with_kindness/,

It was raining outside and I was braving the elements to bring in carts for customers, and a lady, I will call her ""Mrs. Wonderful"", decides it is my fault that none of the available carts are dry, directing her very loud and aggressive voice past the stand with paper towels to dry the carts, right at me. I begin fuming inside at this entitled bitch who is too good for the elements, but I smile and wipe down her cart for her. I tell her that if customers brought their carts up to the front after unloading their groceries, none of them would be wet, but she disregarded my statements, and later left her cart in the middle of one of the handicapped spots, for it to get rained on. The gears have begun to turn in my head. 

Months go by, with her coming in about twice a week to buy $300.00 dollars worth of expensive wine and vegan groceries, for her very wealthy husband I assume, based on her massive ring and Porsche Carrera GT. And then I became a cashier, and I saw my opportunity. Whenever I worked, I would watch for her, and when she got in line I would hop on a register and call her over to my line to checkout. Everything was ready for my revenge. 

At our first encounter behind the register, I slipped her salt off the belt to the side, because the only reason people buy salt is because they are out, and basically everything needs salt. I don't ring it up, its not on the receipt, its not in her bags, and its not hers. Perfect. She comes in the next day, only for salt, and with a very unhappy look on her face, I smirk. I do this a couple more times, not every time, because this is a long play, and I cannot get caught, but about every third time. 

But I think she is about to put 2 and 2 together, so I move to phase two of the plan. I start to take items off her belt at other cashiers register. She comes in screaming at my manager because her items keep going missing. On the day before, I had taken the Cumin from her belt on another cashiers register. Mrs. Fantastic speed walks in, arms a-swinging, and walks up to the 58 year old gentlemen who had rung her up the day before, and yells ""WHERE IS MY FUCKING CUMIN"", and he started laughing. Made this all worth it, and made me want to continue this to the next level. Mrs. Compassionate then storms over to my manager, who says she will look into it but never does because she thinks Mrs. Forgiving is just looking for free groceries. 

Then Mrs. Giving begins to stare intently at the belt when she is checking out. Fuck, what am I going to do now. So whenever I am sweeping the floors and I see her. I steal an item from Mrs. Sharing's basket. Even watching the belt she sees nothing happening, yet her butter, an egg (yes, only a single egg from the carton), some spices, the occasional meat, and when I'm feeling really ballsy, a bottle of wine, gets put swiftly back on the shelf. I can visibly see her breaking down week after week. Looking in her cart to make sure everything is there every minute, watching the belt, being aggressive and hateful to the cashiers.

I step it up another notch. I start to not steal her groceries, but swap them with the competitors brands. I have no idea if she notices, but it makes me feel good inside to think that she is confused when she gets home. One particular night I replaced her 50 dollar bottle of wine with a 3 dollar bottle which I had stored under the register, one that looks eerily similar to the one she bought, and I think I saw her start to tear up when I rang the correct one up for the next day. At least I hope that's what I saw. 

1 month ago I decided to lay off this woman because I think I broke her enough to say I've gotten my revenge. That didn't stop her from still checking over her shoulder, watching the belt, staring at the screen that tallies up the order every time she is in the store. BUT, she still leaves her cart in the lot and doesn't put it away, so I am still taking items out of her cart every once in a while, just to keep her on edge, anxious, and fearful, and will continue to haunt her shopping experience, Forever. 

So Mrs. Delightfull, thank you for shopping at Ralph's, where you get Real Low Prices, and a Fast Checkout.

The scene: my dorm room, freshman year. Though the rest of my floor was going out to a party, I decided to stay in for the night. Still wanting to socialize with whoever was still around, however, I left my door open. Later in the night as most people were leaving for the party, I heard someone stumbling in the hallway outside my room. Upon further inspection, I found it was a girl from down the hall. Let's call her ""P"". P had a reputation for getting incredibly drunk and sleeping with the guys on our floor. I never had much of a problem with her (I didn't care who she slept with and her drinking wasn't any skin off my back), except that she never seemed to acknowledge me unless she wanted something. Sure enough, when she saw me standing in the doorway the first thing she asked was, ""Do you have any vodka?""

My immediate response was ""no"" because (1) I didn't have any vodka, (2) she was clearly already drunk, and (3) I'm a firm believer that if you're going to ask for a favor you should at least offer something in return, especially if it's someone you don't know very well. However, P kept pestering me and stumbling around my room even after I asked her to leave. After about fifteen minutes of unsuccessfully trying to talk her out of my room, I formed another plan.

While P was distracted by something on my roommate's side of the room, I took out two shot glasses. I poured water from a nearby bottle into one and old water from the vase of my bong into the other. ""Here, I'll take a shot with you and then you can go to the party,"" I said, and handed her the shot of bong water. We drank them together and she immediately got wide-eyed, saying it ""tasted like ass"". I covered it by saying, ""Hey if you wanted good liquor you should've bought your own.""

TL,DR: Drunk girl wants free shots, I gave her bong water instead.

periodically, the cops would go up and down the line to keep people from getting to rowdy or doing something illegal.

then a bunch of high schoolers came and cut line right in front of us. it was extra annoying because there were about 10 of them and they clearly didn't know the artist well (they only knew his most famous song because it was on the radio; they didn't know any others). we were angry but let it go. things got worse as they began to litter and talk extremely loudly/annoyingly. then these kids whipped out a few joints and some vodka in water bottle. you could tell they thought they were the shit because of how they were acting with every sip and hit they took... yet you knew that they didn't really do it often (i.e. one girl took a gulp of coke, a tiny sip of vodka, another gulp of coke and then spit the whole thing out, exclaiming how disgusting it was). they were obnoxiously blowing the smoke our way and throwing the water bottles everywhere. i mean i don't care that they were underage and smoking/drinking, do whatever you want...... but don't be stupid about it.

at this point, the police had stopped making their rounds and were just up by the front. i walked over and suggested he walked by my general area in line... and he did.

he immediately smelled the weed &amp; vodka as they tried to cover up the smell unsuccessfully. the officer removed them from line and they were unable to go to the concert. not sure what happened with them exactly but they all had to follow him to get reprimanded. their faces were all panic-y as they were being led away. it was great.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_18suor,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/18suor/annoying_high_school_kids_dont_get_to_go_to_a/,

I had some friends over one day; well, really just two friends, and they brought their kinda-shady friend along with them. I knew the guy, but we were not what I would call friends (we'll call him, well, we'll call him Thief). Anyway, I need to run to WalMart and they all agree to come with me, so we get in my truck and head that way. I get there and get all my supplies, then I mention that we should get lunch somewhere.

One day, one of my friends came to school with a sprained wrist in one of those braces you Velcro on to keep your wrist in place. Well, he was showing us how he could take the piece of metal that holds it straight out of the brace. I began to devise a plan.

I walk up to this group of friends and tell a really bad but very sexist joke, and wait for the punches. She went into a wind up for this one, and landed it right where my tricep should be. But in between my jacket and my arm was a good sized piece of metal. 

She screamed, loud, but I laughed even harder. She never punched me in the arm again, from there out. It was a glorious day.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1cpjan,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1cpjan/punch_me_again_go_ahead_do_it/,

Enjoy not sleeping tonight!",821,173,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hepfm/park_in_my_driveway_then_blatantly_ignore_me_when/,"Background: I live in condos that have attached garages, and each unit's garage door and driveway is right next to each other. This is nice because it was hard to find a condo with an attached garage in this area, but comes at the cost of the bedroom of some units being directly above a neighbor's garage. I'm one of those garages, and as such take care to be quick and reasonably quiet whenever I come and leave late at night, although some is of course not reasonably avoidable. Most times I'll just drive my truck instead if it's late, because it's parked outside on the street, so I can come and leave quietly, without my garage door opener shaking my neighbor's bedroom.

Today: It's the early evening and I leave for a short trip in town. I see my next door neighbor talking in Russian with her family in her driveway, right next to mine (a common occurrence; a bit odd, but I don't mind). I come back 20 minutes later and find that another one of her family's cars has parked in my driveway, fully blocking my garage door, despite her driveway being extra wide (end unit). Now there are also four people out there standing around and loading something into the trunk.

I pull up and wait for them to see me and move out of the way, but nothing. They know my car (it's very distinctive), and they can hear it, but I now also put on my left blinker to politely indicate that I intend to go into my garage... still nothing. They're slowing walking and loading stuff into the trunk of the car, and I'm fully in their view, but it's like they're making an effort to look elsewhere and not acknowledge me. I yell out the window, ""excuse me"", and they ignore it. I yell again, louder, ""excuse me"", and they turn their backs and ignore me again.

Wow, there's about ten ways they know I'm there and what I want by now, but each one of them refuses to even acknowledge me. Oh, fuck you! I apply more than the necessary amount of throttle and go down the street to park... not burning rubber, but enough that it's yet another thing to catch their attention. I get out and walk to my door, glaring at them, but they still wont even dare look at me. They continued to be parked in my driveway for another 15 minutes, and finally leave.

Tonight: It is now 10:45pm and I've been making a point to no longer limit my garage noise. It's still a bit ""early"" in the night, but I've already completed my noisy garage projects (drilling and hammering) that I had previously intended to save for a reasonable hour during the day tomorrow, and of course I've opened and shut the garage door a few times, mildly slammed a few doors, etc.

I have also decided that I should go ahead and finally go see the late showing of World War Z tonight, so I'll be leaving for that in about 15 minutes. And of course, I'll be driving my car that's now parked back in the garage... No need to be polite and take my street-parked vehicle for the sake of being quiet, I'm going to use every luxury and convenience available to me. Come about 1:45am, jackass neighbor's bedroom will be shaking yet again from me operating the garage door as I come home. I feel like I might also need to go buy milk at about 3am...

TL;DR: Neighbor has jackass family park in my driveway, blocking my garage, then repeatedly refused to even acknowledge me when I showed up. Said neighbor's bedroom is right above my garage, there's not much soundproofing here at all, and I'm suddenly finding myself coming and going a lot very late at night.

Don't let me use my own garage at a reasonable hour, so now I'll use it five times as much when you're trying to sleep!

I think this fits well here, but I guess that's up to you.  To the petty revenge!

I was driving over to my parent's house to help my little brother with some Spanish studying.  It was raining and I have a personal rule to never drive over the speed limit during any type of weather that could affect my car's ability to operate safely.  Also, when I say raining I mean getting out of your car and closing the door will get you just as wet as jumping into a pool with all of your clothes on.  I'm minding my own business and this dbag driving a Lexus LetterLetter came speeding up behind me and chose to stay behind me on our four lane road (2 in each direction).  I don't know the model and since car companies don't like to give their cars names anymore I know it has to be some letters, but I digress.  This jerk is seriously riding my bumper.  It's a major pet peeve of mine on the road and even more so when there's bad weather.  If I have to slam on my breaks I know he'll just end up crushing the back of my car causing all sorts of inconvenience and possibly injuring me in the process.  So I slow down well in advance of the next light to prevent this a-hole from wrecking my car or myself.

As I sit at the light I happen to notice he's got his blinker on ('turning indicator' to some of you, also known as the 'thing never used' to even more of you).  I'm the only car in front of him at this point too.  Normally I would inch out a little into the cross walk to let people turn but at this intersection there isn't one for me to inch into, and I refuse to inch into the freaking intersection.  So I sit there like any other car would.  I wasn't even going to try to fuck with this guy's day.  He's obviously got somewhere to be, and so do I.  

Then the fucker honks his horn the second the light turns green.  He hadn't honked at all while tailing me, nor when we pulled up to the intersection, nor while I sat there not inching out.  He did it so that he could be driving off so that he wouldn't have to deal with me retaliating, but unfortunately for him I drive a manual.  So instead of driving away I just let my car ""die"".  I start it up and let it die again (just to act like i've got a problem).  I roll down my window and do the wave to get people to pass me up.  There's no reason everyone else's day should be slowed down too much due to one dbag.

While doing this I see the guy behind me is super unhappy and yelling and flipping me off because he can't get around me because he pulled up so close to my car.  I would have just sat here for a second light change to make him even later to where ever he was going, but I noticed he had no jacket on.  At this point I don't mind getting a little wet.  I open my door and while my awesome rain jacket keeps most of me dry I 'try' to push my car.  Apparently this guy's lady friend in the car told him to get out and help me move my car.  So this bastard gets out of his car in flip flops, shorts, and a t shirt screaming and yelling.  I just smile and continue to 'try' pushing my car, and as soon as he touches the back of my car i jump in, start it up, and leave him standing there like an idiot.

I hope you enjoyed your day asshat.

Edit:   I guess I should clarify some things.  First off I was driving in the right lane and he came up behind me.  I know some people disregard weather and will speed so I was keeping my ass in the travelling lane I guess.  Never heard it called that, 'round these here parts it's the ""slow lane"".  Secondly, I wasn't turning right at the light this whole thing went down at.  I was going to be turning right in a couple of lights.  So, no, I wasn't being THAT guy in the passing lane going slower than other traffic.  Hopefully I addressed your questions.

1372977075.0,642,self.pettyrevenge,1hnr5c,High school revenge on racist bullies,769,127,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hnr5c/high_school_revenge_on_racist_bullies/,"First, a little background.


When I was a freshman at high school, I didn't really ""fit in"". I wasn't an outcast by any means, but I just didn't have a certain clique that I stuck with. I didn't play sports, I wasn't into video games, I didn't get very good grades -- my passion has always been music (and, at the time, skateboarding). I like to think I made friends indiscriminately. And I did; if I met you, and you were a nice human being, I never saw any reason to not become friends with you.


Because of this, I was friends with older kids, geeks, band kids, jocks (the nice ones anyway), nerds, drama kids, etc. I never got into any fights or instigated conflict. I was always sort of the ""class clown"", and I got the nickname ""Swiss"" for usually being neutral on most things and always trying to make peace. The only time I was a loud mouth was when I was goofing around.


As y'all probably know, even if you do your damnedest to avoid trouble, in high school it will inevitably find you. I rarely had problems, but when I did I tried to stand up for myself, and usually they'd resolve themselves. But there was one group that started giving me trouble my sophomore year, the senior jocks.


Not all of them, mind you, but there was a group of about 5 of them that were absolutely obnoxious and picked on EVERYONE. Most people would just take their shit because they didn't want to get beat up. These guys were textbook meatheads; all of them were on the football team, all of them dipped (mouth tobaccer), drank, had pickup trucks, lifted weights, cursed all the time -- the list goes on. But, when they first started picking on me, I stood up for myself. I don't mean physically.


Basically, in the past, the best way I found to deal with bullies was to make them laugh. It's hard to stay aggressive and angry if you're laughing your ass off. But with these guys, I guess they interpreted my humor as arrogance. So, instead of leaving me alone, they decided to single me out. Any time I saw any one of their group in the hall, it was *guaranteed* that I'd get called a faggot or douchebag, and likely that I'd get the old bully go-to ""shoulder bump"".

It got worse and worse as time went on, and I found myself having to choose my routes to classes carefully, and I found I had to leave a certain time, because often they'd follow my car when I left, honking, yelling, etc.

One day, I'd had just about all I could take. School had just gotten out, and everyone was walking to their cars. They started following me and laughing, and called me an ""inbred jap piece of shit"". 


I'm 25% Japanese, and I guess they'd gotten tired of calling me the usual names. Now, this insult finally crossed the line for me. My dad got a *lot* of shit growing up for being half Japanese in a conservative white neighborhood, and his mother even more so. Instead of ignoring them, I turned around, looked directly at the dude who insulted me, and said, ""Your mom should've swallowed."" They took off running after me. I managed to get in my car and speed off towards home. I thought I'd lost them.

About 10 minutes later, I see a red pickup truck flying towards me. Lo and behold, there they are; one of them driving and three of them in the bed of the truck. I stop speeding and slow down to about 30 mph. They get right up on my tail and start throwing rocks at my car, leaning on the edge of the pickup, screaming all sorts of shit.

I kept slowing down until I was going probably about 20 mph, and they were RIGHT on my ass, throwing rock after rock at my car.

Then I brake-check them, HARD. I smashed my foot into the brake-pedal, looking in my rearview mirror. They slam on their brakes. I hear ""oh shit!"" and see ALL three of them fall off the truck. One had been standing, leaning over the top of the cab; he fell forward over the windshield and hit the ground in the front. The other two had been sitting precariously on the sides of the bed. They both lost their balance and fell backward onto the road. I couldn't stop laughing.

I sped off, and within seconds they were all back in their truck, furious, and started tailing me again. I drove to the local police station (happened to only be a minute or two from where we were -- small town), and they follow me into the parking lot, still yelling and hollering. They get out of the car and start walking towards me, and two police officers come out. 


They sit all of us on the sidewalk and ask what happened; I told the police they were following me throwing rocks at my car. The dudes denied it back and forth. One of the cops saw the rocks in the pickup bed, and saw a bunch of little dents on my car. I go free, they get arrested for criminal mischief. Their parents managed to get the charges dropped, in exchange for taking away their cars. For the rest of their senior year, they had to ride the bus to school.

I've been going through rolls of pennies, saving copper pennies, looking for rare dates or errors, and finding the odd foreign coin.  It's cheap entertainment and easy to go through several rolls a night while watching T.V.  

My credit union has several branches near me so if I'm running errands near a branch location, I'll pop in and buy anywhere from a few dollars worth to a $25 box if they have it on hand.  Every single branch I've been to has been very friendly and helpful...  except one.  

I went into a recently opened branch.  There were no customers in the lobby and three tellers were manning the windows.  I walked through the little cordoned maze and stood there for way too long before one of them finally acknowledged my presence and called me over.  I asked if they had a box of pennies in the vault I could purchase and the teller instantly said no.  Didn't look, didn't make a call, didn't offer an explanation.  I know hauling a heavy box of pennies out of the vault can be a hassle and the teller might have been having a bad day, so I let it slide.  I'd seen a few penny rolls on the counter at the next teller's window, so I said if she or the other tellers had any pennies on hand I'd buy a couple of dollar's worth.  Again, she said no they didn't have any at all at the moment and didn't bother to look or ask the other tellers.  I didn't call her out on it; I smiled and thanked her and said I'd check back in the following week.  

At this point in time, I had accumulated more than a couple of hundred dollars worth of pennies that I needed to deposit and hadn't decided on a ""dump"" location.  Lazy teller seemed deserving of this honor.  So every week for the past 4 weeks I've been bringing in around 30 pounds of rolled pennies to this branch and managed all but once to drop them off at her window.

It was raining that night so I had to pick everything up by hand because the sweeper can't get it when it's wet. I had noticed that one car in particular had a large amount of trash around it and sure enough the people in it were eating and throwing their trash right out the window even though they saw me cleaning the lot. When it rains the bags that fast food comes in disintegrate and spilt, spilling cry thing in it on the ground (soggy fries and hamburgers are not fun to pick up by hand even with gloves). So I waited until the people in the car were done eating and went inside to get my revenge.

About ten-ish years ago, I was in 6th grade. In my math class, our teacher had assigned seats at random. Of course with my luck, I was seated between the two most obnoxious kids in my entire graduating class. I'll call them Justin and Corey.

They were *those* kids, the ones everyone hated. We all knew one growing up. They were beyond annoying, and they just didn't know when to stop. They were a lovely combination of socially inept and attention-starved. To add to my misery, Corey and Justin hated each other. They would constantly bicker and fight, sometimes trying to swat at each other and usually hitting me as well since I was the only thing separating them. It was hard to pay attention with this going on around me, and one of my favorite classes was quickly turning into a nightmare.

My math teacher was a good guy, and a good teacher. After he would give the lesson, he'd sit down at his desk. If you had any questions about the work we were doing, you could form a line at his desk and he'd give each student one-on-one help. 

On this one fateful afternoon of class, Justin was being particularly obnoxious and decided to focus all of his energy towards making my day awful since Corey was absent from school. The whole class period, he was hitting me, saying mean things, taking my pen, etc. but back then I was too nice (read: doormat) of a girl to do anything in retaliation, and I didn't want to get in trouble for disrupting class. 

I had just about had it up to here, and I was thankful that I didn't understand one of the math problems we were supposed to complete in class. I practically skipped up to my teacher's desk to get some help and take a little break from Justin, but lo and behold, guess who also needs help on the in-class work...

There was another kid getting help in front of me, so I patiently waited my turn and tried to ignore the fact that Justin was in line behind me, elbowing me in the ribs and trying to drive me up the fucking wall. 

At that moment, I had finally had enough of it. Weeks of pent up rage and frustration boiled to the surface. Just as that other student walked back to his desk and my teacher was waiting for me to ask for help, I swung around to face Justin and, with all of my 11 year old strength, I bitch slapped him as hard as I could and told him to go to hell, consequences be damned.

My teacher saw the entire thing. I was expecting him to drag me straight to the principal's office, but his reaction was quite the opposite. He was failing miserably at concealing one of the biggest smiles I've ever seen. Of course, Justin yells out, ""Mr. [Teacher], vondahl just hit me! Make her get in trouble!!!"" 

The teacher, trying to look serious, says, ""Well, Justin, you kind of deserved it. As you can see, your behavior towards others has consequences.""

The look of utter disbelief on Justin's face was priceless. As he sulked back to his desk, cradling his freshly slapped face, my teacher gave me a little smile as if to thank me for slapping a kid he found just as irritating as I did. I got a new seat that day and Justin never bothered me again.

My whole life Ive suffered from extreme insomnia. It's gets so bad at times Ive been hospitalized. When I actually do get to sleep, I tend to sleep through alarm clocks.

When I was in highschool my mom would put a cordless phone in my room and call it from her job all morning until I woke up and headed to school. 

She owns her own business so alot of times shed just have a secretary call our house and let it ring until I answered. This worked great until senior year. 

One morning I couldnt take the phone ringing anymore so instead of waking up I just picked up the phone and threw it into my wall as hard as I could. Smashing it to peices. 

My mom was rightfully pissed when she got home from work and saw not only a smashed phone, but a hole in the drywall in my room. She didnt punish me and barely said a word to me that night. She went and bought a new phone and I assumed everything was cool. I promissed her Id fix the wall and pay for the phone, and she told me to just fix the wall and everything would be cool.

That night I took an extra sleeping pill so I could fall asleep at a relatively decent hour, and be able to answer the phone when she called. I fell asleep and waited for the phone to ring. 

What I didnt know was my mom was plotting something evil for me. 

That morning she woke up early and unboxed her new cordless phone, plugged in the base, made sure the handset was charged and then hid the handset in my basement. She also placed one of my cordless microphones next to the phone. 

My band practiced in my parents basement in highschool so there were microphones, amps and a pa with monitors taking up a majority of the basement. 
My room was directly above where we practiced. 

She then took the mic reciever and plugged that into my Crate BXL 500w bass amp and 4x12 cabinet and turned all the levels up to 10, then went to work. 

When she called the house about an hour later the whole house began shaking and all I could hear was what sounded like a washing machine being raped by gladiators and a small goat. I shot out of bed and began frantically racing around the house trying to put an end to the sound. I was half asleep and crashing into everything. After about 20 seconds I heard a fizzle and a pop and the sound stopped. I though I was losing my mind, when I heard the smoke alarm in our basement going off. I ran down stairs and saw a small amount of smoke comming out of the speaker cabinet of my bass amp. Upon further inspection I saw my mom's new phone and the microphone placed near it. 

After I finished getting ready for school, I called my mom to tell her that I got the message and was wide awake. 

She ended up blowing three of the 4 speakers and fried part of the amp head, but I respect the shit out of her for it and besides it was shitty amp anyway.

I coach the only girl team at the camp and they compete against the other boy teams of the same age. The boys are much taller, physical and overall quicker than my girls but I teach them to compete and play hard since there is an obvious mismatch. Well one of the boys at the camp is a hot shot, you know the type. He thinks he's the star of the camp and he won't listen to a thing the staff members tell him to do because he's better than us. So this little prick starts talking shit to me about how I'm a terrible coach because after a week of playing 2 games a day we've only gone 4-6 and he has yet to lose a game at camp. Ok whatever I'm not going to get into an argument over something like this with a kid going into 7th grade while I'm finishing up college so I deal with it and laugh it off. Then he crosses the line and says ""It makes sense that your team is in last place with shitty players and a scrub coach."" Oh hell fucking no, I've been coaching this group of girls for 5 years and have loved every second of it and I will not let you talk bad about them. 


Well we get to the last day of camp and it's playoff time for the teams and since we were the last place, we play the team that is in first place aka little shit head's team. So of course he's mouthing off to me about how he's going to destroy us etc. Well like I said, my girls play tough and with only 30 seconds left in the game we were up by 1. Little shit head made his move to the basket and he missed a point blank lay up from literally a foot away from the hoop. He is devastated and complaining that the got fouled (no girl of mine within 2 feet of him he just plain missed). So with 10 seconds left he has the ball again down 2 and decides to take a 3 pointer to win the game. Only problem was as he was dribbling up I told the ref next to little shit head to make sure both his feet were behind the 3 point line. This caused little shit head to look at his feet and one of my girls took this chance to steal the ball from him. We won the game and he was crushed, like on the verge of tears crushed. 


I walk over to shake hands with the other team and give him a shit eating grin but he rages off to the corner before I can even get to him. Not too bad for a scrub coach and shitty players.

It usually doesn't bother me too much, but last week I had the perfect opportunity to get some pettyrevenge!
     As I was walking to my truck after school, I saw a kid throw a bag full of crumpled up tacos and other trash into the back of my truck. I just so happened to know who he was and exactly which truck he drove. This kid was also your typical swagfag douchebag, and i had better things to do after school so i didn't feel like wasting the time to confront him about it.
     The next day at school, I had five trash bags almost overflowing in the back of my truck that i was going to take to the dumpster after  school. I pull in and see his truck parked nearby, so i put all five trash bags in his truck, took my pocket knife, and cut each one of the full, five trash bags open. I then proceeded to  park my truck elsewhere and walk away. 
Serves the bastard right.  I wish I could have seen the look on this douchefag's face after school that day, but the warm feeling of pettyrevenge was satisfying enough. Yeah it was pretty fucked up, but no one liked this kid anyway.

We were going on the rides, and playing the games, and enjoying the ""fair food"" that is always available at these things. Fried dough, etc.

Well, of all the people on our group, I was the only one who was wearing a jacket with a zipper pocket, so everybody asked me to hold on to their money and stuff while we went on the rides, so it didn't get lost when we'd get flipped upside down or whatever on the rides. 

So, everybody gives me their money. I zip it up tight in my pocket, and we all go enjoy the rides for a while. After a couple of hours, a couple of other kids showed up that I didn't really hang with, and my ""friends"" decided it would be cool to ditch me and go hang with them while I was on one of the rides.

Well, I got off the ride, and they were nowhere to be found. I was going to be honest, so I looked around for them for about an hour, but didn't find them.

I opened my pocket, and I had about $50 in my pocket that they had apparently forgotten I was holding.

I left the carnival, walked to the local pizza place, ordered 2 large pizzas, left a nice tip, and called my mom to come pick me up. Told her not to fuss about dinner, that I had it covered. 

She showed up, and saw me standing there with 2 large pizzas, and started asking questions. I explained what happened to her. She said, and I quote, ""Fuck them! Serves them right!"" And we went home and enjoyed our pizzas, and I went out the next day and enjoyed what was left of the money.

I run a recording studio in an industrial complex, and my apartment is above the offices of a contracting company. We get along pretty well, they stay out of my way and I don't make any noise during the day as my soundproofing budget is non existent. I have a private gated section and driveway that leads out onto the road. The contracting company has offstreet parking and access through a right-of-way down a separate driveway, but they have a fire exit that opens into my driveway that they leave open sometimes when it gets hot. I don't usually mind so much, but we have had run-ins in the past with their guys wandering into my section and lounging around on my downstairs furniture, smoking or making phonecalls.

Today I walked out into my yard and there was a shiny, signwritten Mercedes parked DIAGONALLY in my driveway, blocking all three carparks. I made a quick phonecall to the office downstairs to ask them to move the car, and the girl at the desk said that it was a clients car and they were currently in a meeting. I heard her ring the boss who was in the meeting and tell him about it, and he said it would be moved right away. Fair enough.

Well, 30 minutes goes by and the car isn't gone. I'm a nice guy, but I get petty about things like my private property. Besides, it was 3:30 and I needed to buy some stuff before the shops closed. 

**The Revenge**

I stomped back up to my apartment, making as much noise as possible, and crashed around making 'getting ready to go noises'. When this didn't get a reaction, I jumped behind my drumkit and tore out a MASSIVELY loud fill, complete with ear splitting crash cymbals and double kicks. Seconds later I heard an alarm chirp and three giggling executives came out and jostled to move the car. They waved in the general direction of my tinted studio windows and headed back inside to finish their meeting. No bad blood, but perhaps a lesson learned :D

Well, maybe not quite, but she stands at a whopping 4’8” (142cm for you yanks) and is also very slender of build.  In addition, she’s Asian which makes her look even younger since we live in England.  By comparison, I’m an averagely tall white guy, so we make something of an odd couple.  Ironically, she’s older than me at 28 to my 27, though no one would ever guess that to look at us.

One day we are eating at a restaurant that we often frequent (lovely chips!) since we usually eat out for Saturday lunch.  A middle-aged couple sits at the table opposite us and the woman seems to have some kind of problem with the way she’s looking at us every now and again.  I try to write it off as me being overly sensitive and assume that at worst she’s one of those assholes who are offended by interracial couples.  Well, I ain’t stopping for you, lady!

Well, the meal wears on and we’re just chatting and joking like any normal couple.  At some point the waiter approaches to just check that the meal’s alright, which it is.  He then walks over to ask the other couple if their meal is okay.  You can see the man about to affirm when his wife (I guess they’re married) jumps in with both barrels.

“How can I be okay when you allow that to go on in your restaurant?”  She hisses.  The waiter looks a little perplexed (she hasn’t pointed at us or anything) and asks what she means.  She jabs her finger right at me and says; “How can you let that paedophile get away with that?”

Now, I’ll admit that in retrospect I had a dozen comebacks.  But this is real life and nothing was forthcoming in the moment.  The simple fact is that my girlfriend could pass as a schoolgirl if she wanted, but I never saw her that way.  I was mortified, and I’m not a confrontational or aggressive person.  A.K.A, a wimp.  My girlfriend though, is a damn sight brighter than me and jumps in with a quick retort.

“What did you call me?”  She demands.  You can see the woman shrink back with sudden confusion.  She’d been accusing me, after all.  My girl strides out of her seat, towering to her intimidating not-quite-five-feet and faces the woman head on.  “Just because he’s younger than me doesn’t make me a pervert!  He’s twenty-seven!”

It was pretty funny to watch.  The woman went an odd shade of purple, clearly not used to being in a position where she couldn’t bull her way through or one where she had to apologize.  Well, that’s my take on her character anyway.  Not that I’m biased against her or anything.  Her husband(?) looks half-embarrassed/half-amused, so I stick with that.

Anyway, the banshee mutters a vague apology and calm returns to the restaurant.  I think the waiter was just relived that it all ended, the poor bastard.  He got us a complimentary drink.  Made sure to tip him a bit extra for that.

As satisfying as that was, I’m sure you’re all asking where the petty revenge was.  I have no idea how she pulled it off to this day, but my girlfriend managed to snatch their little jar full of condiment packets while she was at the table without anyone noticing.  We heard them have to ask the waiter for some later on.

**TL, DR;** My girlfriend is the world’s smallest condiment thief.

During my off time, I got a phone call from a guy I knew a few years earlier.  Kind of a good-for-nothing, but generally harmless.  He told me he'd started a painting business, and had a huge contract, and could use any help he could get, fast, and knew I was off and might want some work.  He was based out of a city about 70 miles away, so he said I could stay with him if I wanted, he's got room.  So I took him up on it.

I get there, and the guy doesn't have a truck, and asks if we can use mine.  His is ""in the shop"" - total bs, he didn't even have one, but I didn't know that yet.

We go to the first house to paint(he really did have a contract to paint several houses), and he points me to where he'd like me to start.  I have painting experience and he knows it, so I don't need a lot of supervision.  But I don't notice him doing anything at all.  Just going to the bathroom every 15 minutes or so.

Well it becomes obvious pretty fast, guy's got himself a coke problem.  To the point where he can't do any work, just gotta inhale powder all day.  Now I don't begrudge a man his sunstances, coke, weed, acid, alcohol, whatever, as long as you're meeting your responsibilities, and not dragging down others around you.

Over the next couple of weeks he hired a couple more people who came and went, and didn't get paid for their short stints.  But both those people were, to be fair, absolutely terrible, and caused more damage than they were worth, so not paying them was reasonable.  

Over those couple of weeks, when he'd get good and high, he'd get talkative(as blow tends to do to a person), and he'd let slip how he can't have any utilities in his name, cause he owes them all hundreds or even thousands of dollars - phone, internet, electricity, water, gas, even car insurance somehow - the works.  He's got a Good Girl Gina at home, who's pretty sick of this shit, but is too nice and trying to fix him instead of helping herself.  So everything's in her name.

So a couple of weeks go by, I do my work impeccably every day, and it's time to get paid.  There's no money to pay me.  He's making excuses about how he didn't get some money the customer had promised, like I'm too stupid to see where the money really went.  Anyway, I had nothing else to do, so I worked another week, listening to his promises that I'd be paid the next friday(the end of 3 weeks or work).  Sure enough, friday came and there's no money to pay me(but there's been blow every day for 3 weeks now).

So, I leave.  I'm not working for free.  And for revenge on getting 3 weeks of work out of me for free, I sent an anonymous letter to every utility he owed money to, telling them where to find him.  He immediately had collectors on his doorstep, filing summonses against him, for thousands of dollars.  Plus, with me not doing any work, the customers went from being impatient with how slowly work was being done, to firing him for breach of contract.  Good Girl Gina had enough and dumped him.

He had to leave town pretty much immediately.  He had no vehicle either, so packed a bag and hitch hiked out of town.  Last I heard, he was in and out of rehab, still a junkie(about 10 years later), and still going from town to town burning bridges and only concerned about his next high.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1fgxue,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1fgxue/good_luck_spending_my_paycheque_on_blow/,

Let's call it space dollars. It was a small store but got a lot of business because of the drive-through. So we would make coffee and occasionally small food items for customers and a good 99% of our customers were great, but there is always that 1% who are complete asshats. 

   Well one morning i was assigned to the task of making food for all the customers and taking drive-through orders. So everything was going great the first few hours of my shift. It was just another morning trying to start off our customer's days the right way. Then a woman pulls up to the box outside in her car and I answer ""Good morning welcome to space dollars."" I hear her talking on her phone and receive no reply. I'm thinking who could she possibly need to talk to at 8 in the morning. So i wait patiently listening to this woman talk about nothing important for a good 30 seconds. 

  Finally, I decide I've had enough as she is holding up the line. I get back on the headset and say ""Good morning"" again. This time with a why the hell do i have to deal with these kind of people tone on my voice. She finally responds and says ""Excuse me! Can't you tell I'm on the phone?"" I wait a few second not quite sure if she really said this. I'm wondering how people can be this self entitled. Within these few seconds she calls me a ""little idiot"" to the person on the other end. Then I respond with my best customer service I am replaceable answer ""Could you please place your order ma'am? You are holding up the line and people are trying to get to work."" She then tells the person she is talking to politely to hold on ""She guesses she should take her order"" and then laughs.

  She orders a latte of some kind I can't recall because this story is not about that. My coworkers and I have by now decided that we collectively hate her. So when she orders an oatmeal that takes a minute alone to make I am fuming from my ears with hatred. She wants me to put splenda and steamed milk in her oatmeal which we make with water.

  She gets to the window and rudely holds out her money and doesn't look at us while she continues her conversation about nothing. She is driving an old beat up minivan which makes me realize her life may suck. Still having manners and being decent to other humans shouldn't be a problem so I made her oatmeal, handed out her drink, gave her the change, and sent her off. 

Here comes the revenge. I know this woman. She comes in everyday and gets the same oatmeal and eats it on her drive to work. So I made it perfect with beautifully frothed milk and 6 splenda nice and boiling hot and put a plastic knife in the bag(instead of a spoon). She had to stare at her favorite morning breakfast and not eat it. Good luck lapping up your oats with a knife on the highway. It was probably cold before she at it. Ahhh sweet vengeance.

I still to this day picture her at a red light trying to get a couple of little morsels balanced on her knife only to drop them on herself when she brings it to her mouth.

One night, a lady calls in and orders one of the specials with pineapple on it instead of pepperoni. However, since it automatically comes with pepperoni in the system, a new employee neglected to remove it, and as a result had both toppings on it. To this lady, this was un-fucking-forgiveable. She wanted her pizza, she wanted it free, and she wanted it delivered to her house when it was remade. Yelling up a storm, calling everyone in the store incompetent, telling us to get real jobs, etc, because a newbie happened to mess up once.

Wouldn't you know it, I was the lucky one to deliver the pizza to this dragon-lady. I arrive, and there she is waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs to her apartment. I start apologizing, futilely attempting to soothe bitch incarnate. She just looks at me. And as soon as I hand her the pizza, she spits on me. Not on the ground, not near me, not at my feet. On. Me. I was stunned. Shocked. I was at a lack for words.

We blacklist her in the system, so she can never order from us or our franchise owners stores again. But this wasn't enough for me and my friend.

On my day off, we waited until she left her house. Went up to her door, and emptied an entire bottle of super glue into the lock. Wadded up the tumbler good and nice. Nothing turns your day into pure misery faster than being locked out of your own home.

The store was one of about five in an L-shaped strip mall, and the parking was minimal. I noticed someone pulling out of a spot almost next to the entrance, and thinking ""Hey! My lucky day!"" I pulled up to the side of it, signalled, and waited to get in.

The person pulled out (by backing towards me, and driving away) and I pulled in -- and I instantly heard someone LAY on their horn. Apparently, some guy in an enormous truck had been waiting to park in the same spot from the other side, and I had taken it. (Granted, had I noticed him, this would have been a huge dick move on my part. Still kind of was, but by accident, I swear.) I was about to pull out and give it to him (and tried to signal this), but he roared off, swearing out his window at me. I felt like a huge jerk, but I figured that was that, and went up into the store.

As I'm rounding the first corner of the store, I feel a rush of wind approaching, and this guy goes stomping by me. As he passes, he turns to me and goes ""That was my fucking spot, I was there FIRST."" And then he's gone in a whoosh of cologne and fury. Okay, I get it, you're pissed. I tried to say something to the effect of, ""I'm really sorry, I didn't see you, I can go out and move my car,"" but he's moving at Mach 5 and just shakes his head at me and takes off, and I refuse to sprint after him.

Okay, fine, I maybe deserved that (even if it was an accident). I continue shopping, and no more than three minutes later, this guy does the same thing -- jog-by bitch-out, something to the effect of ""That was incredibly rude. What the hell is wrong with you?"" Again, I try to say something to him, ""I'm really sorry, did you want me to move?"" but he rolls his eyes and sprints off. Now I'm getting pissed.

I am shopping for maybe five minutes more before, out of the corner of my eye, I notice this guy put it in cruise and get ready to do it to me again. Now, normally I'm completely anti-confrontational and am a complete gutless wonder (despite being 6'3"") but at this point I'd had enough. He's almost past me and starts in with another ""You have absolutely no respect --"" and without thinking, I pivot and slam my feet down in front of him, and shout, ""**HEY!**"". He freezes in his tracks.

I am inches from this guy's face now (and yes, I am taller than him, though not by much). ""This is the third time you have come sprinting by me to chew me out. I told you I was sorry, and I will say it again. **I'm sorry**. It was an accident, and I did not see you before I  pulled in. I have apologized, multiple times, and I have offered to move my car. Now, you have two options. You can come outside, and I can move my car, and you can have the spot. Or, you can decide that it is not that important to you, you can accept my apology, and you can **MOVE ON**. Now, did you want me to move my car? Because I will go outside right now."" 

This guy's mouth is half open. He just shakes his head and stares at me. 

""Fine. Then **GROW UP**."" And I turned on my heel and left.

I really did feel bad about it at the time, but I just could not handle his raging indignance. A few minutes later, I saw him skulk out of the store empty-handed. Pretty sure he just came into the store after me so he could tell me off, which frankly makes it even more pathetic.

So me and my bro there went to help her load it. It was a big heavy one, so we had a third guy help us. As we were lifting it into her minivan, she saw that there was a dent on the underside panel. Upon seeing it, she began freaking out on us and insisting that it was our fault. Due to where the dent was at, there was no way it could have happened other than during the assembly. So as she bitched and yelled at us, we took it back to customer service where it was offered as an exchange. We politely asked if she would accompany us back there to ensure that we got the right one. She flatly refused and commented along the lines of it is the red one and that hopefully we weren't too dumb not to find it. Back in the grills, my friend commented it would be funny if we brought back the wrong one. Agreeing, I grabbed the first red one we saw, a model that was at least a hundred dollars less and brought it back. She didn't even check it. So we loaded it and she was on her way.

This road was normally two lanes in either direction, but because of construction it went down to one lane  for several blocks in the direction I was traveling. I am driving in the right lane at first, then switch lanes just prior to the lane cutting off for construction. 

I've seen it a lot, but can't explain what is running through these people's heads, but prior to moving over there was a truck about 100 meters back in the lane I was moving into. They were the only vehicle around and had been traveling at that distance for a long distance which leads me to believe we were traveling roughly the same speed. Once I moved over this truck accelerated and moved right in on my bumper. Then unlike most idiots I've seen do that, she took it a step further and began honking incessantly. 

Through the construction the road went from its normal 60km/h to 30km/h. I let off the gas until I got down to just above 30km/h. This woman didn't back off even a little. I tried barely touching my brakes so they would flash without actually braking in hopes that she would get the message and back off - she didn't. 

A little ways into the construction zone there was a large metal grate on the road. It was about 3-4 inches thick and did not have a lip to help ease onto it. I was in a little and low sports car so I had to slow down. As I approached this thing I had to brake regardless of how close this idiot was to me. As expected when I braked she had to lock up her tires to avoid rear ending me. The thing was, I didn't brake hard - just gradual but she was so close it didn't matter.

There were four of these grates in total and at each one I braked and she came within millimeters of hitting me. Each time the frequency of her honking increased. 

Once construction ended I moved back into the right lane. This woman passed me then swerved into my lane and slammed on her brakes. Seeing her previous stupidity, I was expecting it and was able to brake without there being any problem whatsoever. Once her road rage attempt failed she floored it ahead and out of sight. That was the end of that - or so I thought....

Late that evening I received a call from the police. Apparently someone reported me for dangerous and reckless driving. The police asked me to go down and give a statement, which I did. When I arrived the cop explained that some woman told them I was not letting them pass by swerving from lane to lane blocking them in. They also claimed I was slamming on my brakes to try to cause an accident. I was pissed that this bitch was lying and tried telling the cop my side of the story, but she didn't seem to care at all. She handed me a few tickets totaling about $500 (I don't remember exactly what they were for but I believe stunting and dangerous driving were two of them). 

The next morning I woke up still pissed and decided to go back to the police station and get more information. I spoke to a different cop that explained the womans report claimed it all happened between such and such a street. Immediately I knew I could proof she was lying about the swerving from lane to lane to not let her pass part. There was construction through the entire area she mentioned and one lane was a giant open pit because of it. I explained this to the cop and he was slightly more receptive, but still told me that if I wanted to fight it I would need to go to court on a specific date. He also mentioned that since she was the only witness, she would need to be there to testify or else I would likely have the fines dismissed. I figured she was aware of that law and this was just a bitches attempt to make me lose a day of pay from work and/or my time. But I was definitely fighting this.

I went to court about 6 weeks later to fight the ticket and step one is going to the counter to speak to a court clerk. This is the person that weeds out the people who either want to just pay their fine, or have absolutely no chance of winning their fight. 

As I was standing at the front of the line I was close enough to hear the people in each of the three windows talking to the court clerk. These two large women directly in front of me began yelling at the clerk and saying ""this is bullshit"" before storming out. I figured ""oh great, I'm going to have the bitchy court clerk who hates the world"". On the contrary. I made a joke as I got to her window about those angry girls in hopes that it would score me some points. I gave her my fine numbers and she began laughing. 

I was confused and a little worried. 

She then proceeds to tell me there is good news and bad news. The good news was the second cop I spoke to hand apparently been on patrol shortly after we spoke and was in the area this all went down. He confirmed my story and dismissed my tickets. The ""bad"" news - well one of those two large women who were angrily berating the court clerk was actually the one who filed the complaint. The police now believed my story and gave her the same fines I just had dismissed in addition to another fine which was in regards to filing a false police report. Total of which was slightly over $2000. The bad news part of that was that I needed to stick around and testify. I did so - happily.

We sat in the traffic court waiting area for about an hour. The entire time those women had absolutely no idea I was the guy who was going to testify against one of them. When the time came the crown prosecutor called us into court. She explained her story then I explained mine. Then to top it off the cop who issued her the tickets and dismissed mine made an appearance and explained his portion of the story. She was guilty on all counts and out a couple grand. The judge even gave her a lecture on lying to police and how she could have been sentenced to jail time for it and told her she got off lucky.

Walking out to my car afterwards I made sure to smile from ear to ear and walk as close to them as possible. It was a great day.

**Background:**

I babysat for my niece and nephew one weekend, and after I put them down for their naps, I checked out the Craigslist video game section in hopes of finding something to purchase on my way home.  I found a listing with a bunch of SNES games, a bunch of them rare games that I wanted.  I calculated their worth to be around $250 (eBay averages), and contacted the seller with an offer of $200, having told him how I calculated their worth to be around $250.  He replied that he'd go $225.  I said I'd go $210, and he accepted.  Nice!

The guy was located about 35 miles north of the interstate I used to drive home, but I didn't really care about the added hour of travel because I was going to get a bunch of awesome games!

When I arrived at the meeting spot (McDonalds parking lot), I messaged him and he said he rethought the offer and thought he could get $250+ for the games, so unless I was willing to go up to $250 then he couldn't go through with the deal.  I was pissed...I drove an hour out of my way to make this deal - a deal we agreed on - and this douchebag had the audacity to pull this grimy shit

**Revenge:**

At first, I tried appealing to his integrity, but he brushed it off and said that he was sorry, but that's the way it is.  I had no intention of paying more than our agreed amount, so after my initial appeals failed, I took a couple of minutes to think about how I could inconvenience this guy for wasting my time.  After I had it figured out, I began driving home.  

I messaged the guy saying that I would do $250.  He said ok and asked if I was still at McDonalds.  I told him I was and about 10 minutes later he messaged me and asked which car was mine.  I told him what to look for and he said he didn't see my car.  

Me: ""Oh no, is there another McDonalds nearby?  Did I go to the wrong one??""  (I looked it up to make sure there was).

Him: ""Yeah there is another one nearby.""

Me: ""Should I go there or do you want to come here?""

Him: ""I'll drive over there quick.  I have a get together soon, so have the money ready so we can make this quick, please.""

Me: &lt;waiting a couple minutes&gt; ""Oh hey, I just got your last message.  I figured you not responding quickly meant I should just go over to the other McDonalds.  Are you not at this one anymore?""

Him: ""No, I'm at the one you were just at haha.""  Ok, come to this one again.  I'll wait here.""  Ten minutes later: ""Where are you?""

Me: ""My GPS lost signal and I don't know how to get there now!  I think I got lost trying to find it!""

Him: ""Ok, what street are you on?""

Me: ""I don't know...What should I look for?""

Him: ""Look for &lt;street names&gt; and then tell me if you see any of them.""  Five minutes later: ""See any yet???  I have to go soon.  Please hurry.""

Me: ""I don't see them, but I see a Subway (restaurant).  Do you know where that is?""  

Him: ""There are a couple of them.  Is it the one near the pizza place?""

Me: ""Yes.""

Him: ""I'll be there in about five minutes.""  About five minutes later: ""Your car was a &lt;car details&gt;, right?  

Me: ""Yes.  What are you driving again?""  

Him: ""&lt;car details&gt;.  I don't see you.  Are you sure you're at the right Subway??  The one near &lt;local pizza place&gt;?""

Me:  ""No, I saw a Dominoes when I was driving around (shot in the dark) and thought that's what you meant.  

Him: ""Hahaha WTF!?!  I don't even think there's a Dominoes around here.  You mean Pizza Hut??  It's not even near Pizza Hut anyways.  There's a Walmart near it.  I really need to get going, though, so tell me exactly what's around you and stay there.  If I can't find you, then I have to leave. Sorry."" 

Me:  ""Yeah I see the Walmart.  I'll stay right here until you get here haha""

&lt;five to 10 minutes later&gt;

Him: ""I still don't see you, man.  I have to go, though, so I'm sorry we couldn't make this happen.""

Me: ""Oh I'm sorry you can't find me, but it's probably because I started driving home as soon as you raised the price like an asshole after I drove an hour out of my way.  I hope you enjoyed the runaround as much as I did, dick.""

Him: ""&lt;string of obscenities and threats&gt;""

Me: &lt;smiling all the way home&gt;

During my sophomore year in college, I dated a guy who introduced me to probably the greatest apartment I have lived in to date. Great location, awesome parties, and lovable roommates. Four people lived in the apartment (boyfriend included) and two significant others would stay over frequently (myself included).

For most of the school year, everyone got along fabulously. Unfortunately, drama slowly built up between the other significant other and her partner. This significant other (let’s call her Tina) was overly dramatic, self-absorbed, and extremely two-faced. Around March, her partner figured out Tina was cheating on her and promptly dumped her ass. This became a problem because both had signed on to continue the lease for the next year. Tina kicks her ex-girlfriend off the lease for the following year and throws a hissy fit when we all aren’t moved out a week before our lease ended.

We begged her to let us keep a few pieces of furniture in the house before our next lease began, as we had nowhere to go, but she had no sympathy. She logged into another friend’s Facebook account to tell us off, so it looked like she did nothing wrong. Frustrated, we packed up our shit and got out.

By now, I was beyond frustrated with her, but I decided the best course of action would be to just ignore her and move on with my life.

My junior year rolls around, and I start my second year at an internship on campus in our LGBTA Office. There are about 7 or 8 interns every year working in the same space but with different assignments. Who walks in the first day? Tina. Fuck.

From day one, she started a crusade to ruin my life. Being passive aggressive, she would often leave notes blaming me for things or broadly stating how she hated drama and anyone who starts it needs to find a hobby. Everyone in the office fell in love with her after the first week, which completely got under my skin. What everyone didn’t see was her setting people up to fail so she could come in and save the day, her leading other girls on only to break their hearts intentionally, and her saying incredibly hurtful things to anyone who dared cross her path.

At first, I tried to tell everyone what she was doing and how she hurt people. This led to a meeting between the head of our department, Tina, and myself. I was scolded for spreading hurtful rumors as Tina cried crocodile tears. Later that day, she “accidentally” deleted a rather large Photoshop file I spent weeks on. She must have “accidentally” emptied the recycling bin too, my work was long gone.

I felt defeated. Since the LGBTA community was so tight knit, you couldn’t risk rejection. Otherwise you lose all your friends. By this point, a good portion of my friends weren’t returning calls or texts.

Eventually, she dated a close friend of mine then publicly dumped/humiliated her. My friend comes to me crying, telling me everything that happened. Apparently, Tina started spreading rumors about me throughout our community. She told them I lied because I was still bitter about losing the apartment to her. Finally, I figured out the perfect revenge. 

The Revenge:

The rumors were already out about me, so my credibility was shot. I did the only thing I could think of.

I was nice. Nice as FUCK.

Suddenly, I was friendly with her in the office. I laughed at her jokes, admired her work, and complimented her fashion. When we were out with friends (especially when Tina wasn’t there), I laughed about the good times we shared and how much fun she brings.

Tina had no idea what to do with my sudden kindness, so she started getting nastier in return. While I did not see it, current friends filled me in on what happened when I wasn’t there. Whenever I came up in conversation, Tina would start spewing hate about me and how I’m trying to get back at her. But when they talked to me, I would only sing her praises. During this time, she was also continuing to lead girls on and break their hearts.

Slowly but surely, I regained every one of my friends. After a year, every one of them apologized to me and told me everything she had them believing. The ENTIRE community turned on Tina afterwards. The administration asked her to leave her internship after discovering the mess she caused for me and other interns, all of her previous friends now unfriended her on Facebook, and she ended up leaving the community in a huff.

Best part? She could have prevented all of this if she didn’t try to spread rumors.

TL;DR: Bitchy ex-roommate spreads lies to make people hate me, I’m kind in return, everyone ends up hating her and she loses all of her friends.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_17xqxp,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17xqxp/dont_start_rumors_about_me/,

So tonight, I go into the gym and see this kid again, benching this time. Now, benching is the one thing that people at my gym actually do, so he is using the last available bench. So then I happen to look up just as Captain Asshat is heading to the bathroom. Boom. Time to act.

I walk over to his bar, take his weights off and start throwing every 45lb plate I can get my hands on onto this bar. At four pairs of 45s, I see him come out of the bathroom.

5 pairs.

He sees me

6 pairs.

""Hey bro I'm using that!""

Ignore him. 7 pairs. 675lbs.

He smoked small cigars, I smoked a pipe. (This was in the early 70s, when rampant indoor smoking was the norm. And yes I am old.)

Chas was quite the fun-loving prankster. One day he found my pipe lying on my desk when I had stepped away, and he took the stem. Not the bowl, but the stem. When I returned and found it gone, he refused to return it, getting a big kick out of my discomfiture (and quickly growing nicotine fit). Hours later, just before leaving, he returned the stem to me. I assured him that there would be consequences. He just laughed.

This called for revenge.

I bided my time.

Many weeks later I bought two of the small cigars that Chas favored. I also bought some cigarette loads. I used a toothpick to insert not one but two of the loads into the business end of one of the cigars, taking care to plug the hole with tobacco when done.

Before walking into the newspaper office, I put the loaded cigar into my shirt pocket, and carried the other one in my hand. Walking up to Chas, I offered him the cigar in my hand. He reached for it, then abruptly withdrew his hand and laughed. ""I know what you did. Thought you could trick me."" He then snatched the loaded cigar out of my shirt pocket, amused with himself over seeing through my clumsy stratagem. 

Stuck the cigar in his mouth, flared his lighter, touched the flame to the cigar and inhaled. Puffed some smoke. For a long moment nothing happened -- I had the sinking feeling that the loads hadn't worked.

But then: snap-crackle-POP. 

The two loads had gone off at the same time, enveloping Chas's head with a huge cloud of smoke. When it cleared, he was nodding as if to say: ""You got me, dude.""

I agree, but my need for anonymity is still there:

My ex was an avid gamer. My ex was also a douchebag, who ended up lying and cheating on me. He started seeing one of our coworkers behind my back, using the guise of going to the bar with our friends as an excuse (I wasn't old enough to drink, as I was only 20.) His bar of choice was right next to the diner I'd hang out at. Before I caught him cheating, I was always scared of him walking home drunk. He had already been hit by a car doing so before I met him, and wound up in a coma. The police in our town were also pretty strict, and would bust you on public intoxication. So I'd frequently ask him if he needed a ride home. He refused, and said one night he was going out with the guys. I decided, that since he was going out, I would, too. My friends and I went to our favorite diner to hang out, eat, and sit around for a few hours, chatting (the waitresses loved us. They were never super busy at night, we ordered a lot of food over the course of the evening and not just coffee/soda, and we tipped well.)

We got our normal booth, which had a view of the bar if your back was facing the door. I wasn't the one initially in the seat, my best friend was. We were chatting, eating, when he went PALE. ""ahoythrowaway, you need to see this."" When I looked, my boyfriend was kissing our mutual good friend. And it wasn't an innocent peck, they might as well have been eating each other's faces.

I was hurt, more by her than by him. I then decided to get my revenge on both of them.

I got her kicked out of the National Guard because she was smoking weed and taking her mom's percocet. I contacted the Military Police anonymously, and she was drug tested.

First, I took the top of the line graphics card I had just bought him out of his computer. The thing cost me around $1,000 and had been installed 2 days before. I got a refund. I packed up his shit, took it to his parents (he didn't own much. Just a few boxes that easily fit in my car and his computer.) His parents weren't home, so I left it on their porch (I wasn't a total bitch. The porch was enclosed and I could lock it with the key I had.) He was also on his final warning before this at work, because he and another coworker never did their work, leaving it for first shift (my shift with my mother, who managed the store, which meant we had 3x the amount of work they did, as we were a gas station/coffee &amp; baked goods shop. The day shift was the busiest.) Before he left, he was supposed to bake muffins and cookies for the next day. He didn't, because ""he didn't feel like it."" Which meant I had to go into work 2 hours earlier (at 3 am) when I had already worked 55 hours that week. I reported it to our boss, and he was fired. 

He came in for work when he came back, he didn't even stop at the house. So, his sister drove the 3 hours to come back to work just to be fired, went over to the house to find the locks changed, no one home, and a note on the door telling him that his shit was at his folks, the graphics card was gone, and that he had to find a way home because he didn't drive and I wasn't driving him. I also turned off his cellphone, as it was in my name. It was shut off within minutes of him even stepping out of the car.
She ended up losing her mind and moving to a different state because she felt her life in ours was destroyed. She never knew I reported her. He ended up unemployable (not just because he was fired from that job, but a few others,) living with his mother and stepfather, living in a ghetto. He never even replaced his graphics card because he never had the money to.

**TL; DR: my ex was cheating with a coworker. Got her thrown out of the army for drug abuse, got him fired, threw him out, and left him stranded an hour away from his parents with no cell phone**

Called me names, humiliated me, hit me, abused me, just generally made my life not worth living. I never told anyone and he ended up moving away.

I haven't seen him in a couple years, so imagine my surprise when I finally see him at my dad's house when I went to pick up my daughter. It was Thanksgiving, so the entire family was there, including his wife, who is one of those wrongly arrogant and all-knowing-but-really-knowing-nothing type of people. I notice that my step brother has gotten fat. Not chubby. F.A.T. Which is something he used to make fun of me for, even though I was 100 lbs soaking wet and it led to a bad eating disorder back in the day. (I'm not exaggerating when I say he made my life HELL.) He's one of those types who really can't take his physical flaws being pointed out, by the way.

So I engage in small talk. I wait until everyone is sitting at the supper table and eating quietly, look at him and say, ""Well your wife must cook well, because, my God, you've gotten FAT."" 

I finally got to sit back and smile as, for the first time in my life, I was alpha dog over him. He looked me right in the eye and knew that I was alpha. I sat there and challenged him with my eyes to retaliate and he backed down. It was glorious. 

Everyone busted out laughing except him and his wife, who oh-so-intelligently responds, ""Well, he's lost weight, actually! He's doing really well!"" Which made it even better. 

I know it sounds petty and awful and it makes me sound like a buttwipe douchebag, but for the first time I felt powerful and victorious over him, and he knows it. I smile every time I think about it. 

EDIT: It wasn't about calling him fat. Everyone in my family is a bit overweight except for my daughter and I. It was about sending the message that he had no control over me anymore and that I was in control and unafraid of him now. 

Also, my family is a huge wad of jolly old rednecks who don't take anything seriously. They thought it was hilarious and just some sibling play fighting. Only he knew otherwise. He's made more jabs at me where everyone laughed more times than I can count. It was all about the message, not the weight thing.

Him: Is there a fucking problem with that? Hurry up.

Its fine if you want a specific slice and ask for it, but she comes behind the counter without asking, a big no no and demands the best looking slice after proding them all, again a big no no. She is rude about it, no pleases or thank yous. We usually put the slices in a box or on a plate, but she demands them sandwiched between two plates and wrapped up in a bag which is annoying and time consuming. 



So one day I saw her coming in and hid all the newer slices and left just the biggest nicest one on the tray with a few shitty old ones I had to throw out or give away anyway. She won't come behind the counter if we are there but if we're somewhere out of direct sight of the counter she will sneak back there incredibly fast.

I am going to the oven to heat up her slice and put my thumb on the smallest shittiest one on the opposite side of the tray from the one she wants. I grab a shit old one next to the fresh one she wants, slowly and deliberately so she can see what I'm doing. When she sees this again she screams so loud ""that's the wrong one"" I act startled and whip around to face her causing the good slice and 3 old ones to fall on the ground, leaving only the worst one that was under my thumb on the tray.

1360023251.0,589,self.pettyrevenge,17wekr,You obviously don't understand how Amazon.com works. (Alternatively: Enjoy losing business!),715,126,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17wekr/you_obviously_dont_understand_how_amazoncom_works/,"I went to a local car AV shop to purchase a new subwoofer box and after a couple of minutes inside the shop, the owner and an employee from the business next door (a window tinting shop) came in and started accusing me of stealing one of their tools. I had brought a mini-drill from home so I could install my subwoofer in to my new box when I bought it and it just so happened to be the same model of drill they used.

After trying to reason with the employee and telling them that I could show them proof of purchase (from Amazon), the employee threatened me (""It's a small town, I have your plate number, You're lucky I'm at work right now"", etc). They called the police and stayed very near my car. I called the police as well because the owner and his employee had made me feel threatened. I got the manager of the business that I was in to print out my order form from Amazon. When the police arrived, they took the owner's story then came inside to talk to me. I showed him proof of purchase, as well as my ID and the card I used to order it. The officer took that and showed it to the owner of the other business and when the officer came back in he claimed that the owner would apologize.

When I went outside, the owner ""apologized"" in probably the most begrudging and accusatory way. He again accused me of stealing from him (claiming that ""he knew"" i stole it from him) and that it was ""some sneaky s*** you pulled, having your friend list it on Amazon so you could buy it"". Continuing to feel like I was in a hostile atmosphere, I got in my car and drove off.

Well, that's where the story *used* to end. It gets better.

You see, that chunk of text, along with the actual business names, which have been redacted, and a small summary, are what I posted to Yelp. And Google Reviews. And Yahoo.

Fast forward a few months from that point, and I see the employee who was being the most threatening at my work. He's hard to miss. He's a big, bulky dude with a huge beard. He came through my line at the grocery store and I bagged his order. He looked me dead in the eyes and we obviously recognized each other.

A few days later, I get a call, at work. This is pretty rare and usually it's my parents if anybody, and it's only if there's a family emergency.

So imagine my surprise when I answer the phone and it's the business owner from the window tinting place. He wants to talk things over and rectify the situation. I get his number and after a few days, call him.

Apparently, my reviews did some damage. The business is pretty prominent, in a big purple building on the main street in town. Everybody drives by it, so chances are if you're thinking of getting your windows tinted, you're gonna think of that place.

Well, he tells me that my 1-star review on Yelp knocked them down from 4 stars to 3. He tells me he's lost some of his old customers, and he hasn't been getting new customers as often. He even told me that I cost him an estimated $20k in profit over the four months the review was up. I checked the Yelp review every now and then, and at last count, well over 100 people found it ""useful"", who knows how many other people had seen it and decided against going to his shop.

So anyway, I took the opportunity to lay in to him a little bit. I told him that if he treats people like he treated me, he deserves to lose business. I tell him it's a shitty way to be and basically just tear him a new one. Even after my verbal beatdown, he's still really apologetic (though I knew he really just wanted that review down), but after hearing that he lost around $20k in profit over what is a $200 tool, I got the warm fuzzies inside and decided I'd done enough damage, and took the reviews down.

tl;dr:
**douchebag business owner accuses me of stealing his tool, even when provided with evidence to the contrary. I post a factual account of our interaction to multiple review sites, he loses a bunch of business. I cost him around $20k in profit over his accusations of me stealing a $200 tool.**


edit\\

To everyone saying I should have left the review up:

I felt like I made my point. I put a measurable dent in his business and I taught him a lesson. Even if his apology may not have been authentic, perhaps he would consider his actions a little more carefully before accusing somebody else like he did to me. Or, perhaps not, and then they go and do the same thing that I did, but decide to leave it up. Either way, I felt like I got my payback and I'm all for letting bygones be bygones. If he continues to be a dick, it'll come back to him, so I'm not really that worried about it. Myself and everybody I know have all pretty much agreed that he's a dick and would all rather take our business elsewhere because of it.

I don't feel like I'm censoring myself. I feel like I let him squirm long enough and now I'm letting up. Maybe I'm a more forgiving person than some of you in this instance but that's my choice. He took the time to talk to me calmly and politely, like an adult, and we worked it out together.

This is a long one, so sorry for the absolute wall of text! If you really don't feel like reading a lot, please skip to the TL;DR. I Hope you enjoy my first crack at this! 


Just a little relevant information;

When I was in elementary school I was a decent student. I wasn't the ""star pupil"" or anything close to it. I was always in the B+ to A range. Our school had a rewards program (very similar to Mrs. Puff's ""Good Noodle"" star program) where if you got good grades, you got stars and little candies at the end of the month. So, everyone in the class knew if you were doing well or not. There was also permanent seating plans that were set for the whole year, so you never changed seats.

Into the story now;

I was seated next to a loud mouth boy, hereby dubbed SH (Short for Shit Head). SH was one of those kids that would take your pencil crayons without asking, steal your snacks from your backpack, blatantly ridicule you and just make your life an all around hell. However as soon as he was confronted by a teacher he was the perfect angel, therefore he was never caught doing anything wrong. He also didn't give two shits about school, so he never even bothered to look at his marks, this ends up being in my favor.


About a month into the school year, I started noticing that my work was going missing. Now, I was a forgetful kid so I just assumed that I had put it down somewhere and forgotten it. This went on for about two weeks before I started to get kind of suspicious.


Then one day I was called to the principal's office and I was scolded for copying SH's work! I was outraged, I broke into a crying fit and screamed about them being wrong. I got my first ever detention and a stern warning.


When I went back to my class and sat down, SH was watching me with the smuggest face I have ever seen. That's when I pieced together where my work had been going. SH would wait until I went out for recess or he would ask to go to the bathroom, then when no one was looking he would steal my work from my homework folder.


Being a shy kid, I didn't want to tell a teacher. Instead, I sat down at my desk that night and devised my master plan. Sure, it would mean extra work but who cares if I got my revenge! I decided that every time I did my homework, I would make two copies. One of the copies would have my actual work, and the other would be complete bullshit. I would put the fake copy in my homework folder and simply move my real work to a different binder.


SH continued to take my homework from my knapsack, and I continued to cackle to myself when he was out of earshot. Every time he got it back, he threw it in his desk without even looking. He assumed he did well because he was stealing a smart kid's work.


Skip forward to the end of the year when he received an envelope that had his parents name on it. This usually means that the principle wants to get a message to the parents directly. It also read ""OPEN ONLY WITH YOUR PARENTS"" in big red letters on the back. He, of course, dismissed this warning and tore into the envelope. As he read the letter, his face fell a little and began to tremble a bit. I overheard him whisper to his friend that he failed the grade and had to stay back a year!


The feelings that filled me were glorious. I felt terrible of course, because I caused someone else pain but man did I feel good! The thing is, he couldn't tell anyone why he had failed! The kicker is, he confronted me after the last bell. Our confrontation was short and sweet;


&gt;SH: HEY! CitySecrets what the fuck happened?!

&gt;Me: I don't know what you mean? (I knew exactly what he meant)

&gt;SH: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN (he shook the envelope grasped in his sweaty hand)

&gt;Me: Oh, you failed the grade and now you have to stay back, that's what happened.

&gt;SH: YEAH I KNOW, HOW COME YOU DIDN'T FAIL TOO?

&gt;Me: Because i'm smarter than you.

&gt;SH: Fuck you! I'm gonna-

&gt;Me: (I cut him off) Gonna what? Gonna tell the teacher that you were stealing my work?

&gt;SH: Fuck off! (A man of many words)

&gt;Me: Have fun repeating this year.


Before he could say anything, I left. Yes, I felt bad, but I also felt good because I stood up for myself to the biggest bully I have ever faced. I graduated before him and ever since I haven't seen him.


Mind you, this also happened quite a long time ago so the confrontation is obviously a very vague explanation of what I may have actually said.


Thanks for reading! I'm glad I could put this somewhere, because to this day I have kept this secret.

TL;DR: Snot nosed kid would steal my work and copy it, never got caught. So I started making two copies of my work so he would always take the wrong copy. He failed the grade and had to stay back a year.

EDIT: Broke it up more for easier ~~reasoning.~~ reading.

EDIT 2: Please feel free to reformat, or edit my grammar. I'm new at this, and typing a lot tends to make me lose track of my grammar skills :(

EDIT 3: I have gotten a few skeptical messages and comments about how this wouldn't have caused someone to fail a grade, and how there would have been more warnings and stuff. Thats totally okay that you are skeptical! Like I said in the comments, I wouldn't know if there had been conferences with parents, or if there was any other follow up. Considering that a school really doesn't publicize a failing student and me and him weren't exactly buddies. Just wanted to clarify this.

I was in need of a roommate after my boyfriend and I split so my friend decided to take on the spare room. Since the gas bill was the ex boyfriends I asked if she would transfer her already existing account to the house to which she agreed. So we decided that I would pay the electric and she the gas. Any difference between the bills would be split.


Well one month in and we receive the gas bill claiming there is a $300 balance so I ask her why she has such a high balance and she says its just the deposit and that she would have them waive it after she set up direct deposit and they would send us our ""normal"" bill next month.


Another month goes by and they come by and shut off our gas and stick a non-payment flyer on the door. Understand that this is the start of winter the temperatures are getting colder day by day at this point it was between 15-20 degrees (Fahrenheit) each night. Thankfully it wasn’t mid winter and we hadn’t gotten into the negatives yet. Still was cold and I worried about the pipes freezing.


I give her a call and let her know what happened. She puts on the whole fake sorry act and says she will call them right away and fix it. I once again believe that she’s going to take initiative but of course she doesn’t. 


I know that she is not doing anything about it and that she is just going out partying everyday. I had known from the beginning that she was not very responsible but didn’t think she would let it go on that long. I tried calling the gas company myself but they would not do anything since it was under her name and I did not know her SSN. I had resorted to taking showers at my friends’ houses, making microwave meals for dinner and having to buy an electric heater and be secluded to my room for any kind of warmth.


This goes on for three weeks that I am asking her constantly if she has gotten it fixed and all she continues to do is give me ridiculous excuses. Always blaming the problem on the gas company or the bank.


I decided enough was enough. One night while she was staying out at a friends house I went into her room. Just for a minute I stared at her electric heater thinking of how badly I just wanted to start kicking it but then decided that might be a bit much and she would know I did it. I grab some tools and start to take the thing apart. I clipped one of the wires inside and then put the whole thing back together set it back in the same spot and casually left the room snuggling into my bed with a smirk.


The next morning I hear her walk into her room and just seconds later a loud whine comes from her about how her heater won’t turn on. It’s easy for me to hear since her room was right next to mine. I get up and walk to her room and with a look of concern say “What’s going on? You ok?” she just replies with the same whine about how her heaters broken and her room is freezing. I shrug and say “Oh sorry that sucks I’m going to get ready for work.” And not but five minutes later I hear her on the phone with the gas company working on getting the gas turned back on. They make it out a week later and get everything turned back on. Yes the satisfaction really was that she had to freeze for a week. While I still had my heater in perfect working order.

Not sure whether it counts as a revenge but I guess it's worth the share.

I used to work in this small cafe as a part-time job when I was a teenager. So one day, this middle-aged lady came in with her kid, about 5 or 6-ish years old. I knew she would be a demanding customer by the looks when she stepped into the cafe (had a fair-share of experience of it). Since it was lunch hour at that point in time, it was already quite busy and the cafe was under-staffed, I tried to get all the orders as quickly as possible. The lady, who I assumed was a strict vegetarian, kept asking whether are there any vegetarian dishes available and constantly clarifying whether each dish that she pointed out on the menu had meat in it, even corn soup. She finally settled for this assorted veggie sub that she ordered for the kid.

6 minutes in, Mrs Vegetarian was getting super impatient at having to wait for the food to arrive, constantly asking about how long is it taking every time I passed her table. Next to her table, there was this little window where the kitchen staff places the finished orders, ready for the wait-staff to take them to the customers' table. Her order is finally done and I took it to her.

To my surprise, her kid was already happily eating a sub! I asked her how did she get her order (as I was the only one manning the tables at that time), she said that she saw a wrapped sub placed in the window, assumed it was hers and took it behind my back. I immediately told her that it was another customer's order. I think she didn't realise that her kid was happily chomping down a chicken sub as she ""screamed"", slapped off the sub from the kid's hands, made him spit whatever he was chewing and started to pick out the bits of chicken on his tongue.

I went to the kitchen, told the rest about it and laughed.

Let's get into the story. Out store sells clothing for middle aged-senior men and women who want to look a bit younger, if that makes sense. So one day, I'm the only one in the shop. This one lady walks in. She seems to be around her mid 40s, and judging by the style of her clothing and her makeup, she wanted to be in her teens. So I go up to her and ask her if she needs any help with anything, and she says she is fine. 

After about a minute she calls me over, and politely tells me that the shoes she is looking at are *waaaaayyyyyyyyyy* too overpriced. I told her that I am not the one who determines the prices, but she continues to argue with me about it. It finally ends when I tell her I will speak with the manager when he gets back.

Another two minutes pass and she calls me over again. This time she asks me if a certain shirt is made in a different color. I tell her that it is only available in that color (I think it was a bright pink or orange) She then starts to scream at me again, because she thinks that it is way to flashy for her style. I try to tell her in the most polite way that the clothes are not made specifically for her, but she would have none of that. I told her once again that I would talk to the manager about it. 

So after literally an hour of her telling me how something shows off too much skin, or how the color does not match her wardrobe, or how things are too overpriced, she settles with a pair of sunglasses. One pair. After an entire hour. I decided that I would get some revenge on her. 

She steps up to the register and throws her sunglasses on the counter. She then throws a 10 dollar bill next to them. I tell her that the sunglasses are usually $15. I look her strait in her eyes and say, ""But you get the Senior Citizen Discount, so $10 will do. It was like I had drained all of the bitchiness out of her. She just kind of stared at me in shock, said a quick, timid ""thanks"" and got out of there as fast as she could. I was so satisfied.

My girlfriend and I had just moved in together and our one year anniversary was coming up.  We decided to visit the zoo and were very excited about it.  It should be noted that at the time we were both part of the goth scene, and that emo was really popular (it was 2006).  

There were lots of school groups at the zoo that day and these little fuckers from one particular school decided to follow us around calling ""emooooooo!"".  If it had just been that, we would have shrugged it off and ignored it but after they saw us holding hands they started yelling ""oh my god, lesbians, gross"" and making comments about how we were going to hell.  It got to the point where we felt like we were being stalked because they seemed to be wherever we went, and we ended up leaving much earlier than we'd planned, missing out on one of the exhibits we'd been excited to see.  

On the way out, I snuck a look at the uniform of one of their classmates to find out the school name.  Once we had that, we looked up the school's phone number, rang and complained.  Bitterly.  Made sure to emphasize that the kids were walking around without a teacher.  

A week later, three of these turned up in the mail: http://imgur.com/A4FKyD3 the awkward line breaks and the fact they were all identical clearly indicates they were copied down from the board.  

The best (and petty revenge) part was knowing that on any future school trips, the teacher would be watching them like a fucking hawk. If they were even allowed to go at all.

Well, go figure she cheats, gets caught and my dad kicks her out after finding out about the abuse. She comes to my dads house while he is gone unannounced to take some of his things (Coffee maker , TV, really petty things that she ""needs"" for her apartment he got her )  
Well as she is making her way out the door from the kitchen she says to me. ""I hope you know that you are why your father and I divorced, you should feel ashamed of your self ""


I fucking exploded. ""No! You and dad split up because you were too busy drinking and sucking cock to see your relationship falling apart, too see what a shit mother , what a shit PERSON you are!"" the words will always be as sweet as the moment I said them. 

She was INSTANTLY pissed, and I could see what was about to happen as she came around the counter and gave me one swift hit to the face. I was still pumped up from what I said to her, and for the first time, I hit back, and it scared the crap out of her.

It's an unwritten rule that we give police officers free coffee.  There's not a sign up or anything stating this; it's just something we do.

Well, a few days ago, a group of police officers came walking in.  Whenever a cop comes in, I usually say something like, ""OOHH, giiiirl!  Someone is gettin' arrested today!""  And they laugh and it's a good way to start my day.  So, they each grabbed a huge cup, filled it with coffee, cream, and whatnot, and strolled up to my register.  I recognized the first 3, as two of them coached my old baseball team and one used to teach at our high school.  Then, Captain Douchebag rolls up.  

This guy made my life hell...from kindergarten until the day we graduated.  He would lap me on the track and punch the back of my shoulder every. fucking. time...he called me a band fag, a fat-fuck, curly-headed fucktard, dick licker, butthole-sniffer, among other names.  He also spread a rumor around school that I got my cousin pregnant.  Yeah, he's a winner.  

So, the first three gentlemen get their free coffee and head outside.  Then, Cap'n Douchebag strolls up.
  
    ""Hey, rbfjunkie! I haven't seen you in ages!""  
    ""yeh..."" I reply. 
    ""How have you been?  Anything new?""  Said Officer Douchebag.
    Trying to be nice, while holding in as much pent-up rage as I could,
    ""Yeah, life's good.  Got a new job here a month or so ago.""  
    ""Oh wow, man, that's awesome!  Well, take care!"" El Douchebag-adora said.

Then, he starts heading for the door as he said his goodbyes.  I told him very loudly, trying to make sure the other PO's could hear through the door, 

    ""Stop right there! What do you think you're doing?""  
    ""What do you mean?!"" Sir Bag of Douche replied, perplexed.  
    ""You have to pay for that coffee...if you don't, I'll be forced to press charges for theft.""
    ""Pfft...I...we...whatever dude! We get free coffee here all the time! What's goin' on??""  
    ""No, employees are given the power to discount up to $5 per transaction at their discretion. 
    We don't HAVE to give you anything.""
    ""And you don't wanna give me free coffee, even though you know me??""

I just stood there, staring at him. The other PO's were outside laughing their asses off at him.  He grunted and said something under his breath, and pulled out his wallet and threw $2 at me and said, ""Keep the change, you fuckin' BAND FAG!""  

Little does he know, I have the power to ban people from the store.  So, I got a picture from the security footage and posted it on the front door with a heading that said ""This person is not allowed on company property for 30 days (July 16th)""  A few hours later, my supervisor came in and asked about it.  We had a good laugh, and she agreed that we'll keep it up for 1 month, or if he comes in and apologizes before then.

Even though it was over $1.67, it will made me feel like a million bucks.

My dad decided to take both my brother and I out for a guys night out while my mom was away on a work trip, keep in mind that I was about 8 and my brother 9, so we decided to make the one hour long trip to go to this one restaurant because it has great Italian food. 

When we got there most of the parking was nearly taken up but because it was after hours of the credit union they allowed anyone to park in their multiple lane drive-thru, so excited about the open parking we parked behind a car that was already parked in the drive thru (nobody was in front of them and they couldn't get blocked in). 

After a fabulous time eating at our favorite Italian restaurant we came out to see that someone had parked behind our truck, which nearly blocked us off completely from being able to leave. But my dad trying to keep a cool head decided to go into the mall and have the person called over the intercom but this came with no success. After possibly a 50 point turn and hopping a curb we finally were free from our troubles. After keeping his cool through all of the fussing with getting the truck out he couldn't let this person leave without a little bit of revenge. So my dad tells my brother and I to sit in the car for a few seconds as we watch him get out of the truck walk calmly over to the car who parked behind us and smoothly removes both of his/her windshield wipers and tosses them under their car.

---
So, growing up, I lived in a house in a quiet, small town in california. Our house was a corner house, and because of that was one of the biggest lots in the neighborhood, and right on the edge of a seasonal river. Having so much space, I had dogs as a kid - normal, exciteable animals; Our dogs barked at strangers. Not excessive barking, but the usual ""Hey! Who are you? Why are you outside MY yard?"" 

Most of the neighbors had dogs, many of which were small, yappy and obnoxious. Whatever. We made our share of noise - BBQs on the weekends, loud music from time to time. Neighbors made noise, we made noise, nobody complained. 

My first dog grew old and died, and I got another dog(actually, two. I found a pair of twin puppies abandoned in an alley walking to school one day. Carried them around in my backpack all day. I kept one, gave one to my girlfriend's dad; Cute little queensland/terrier mutts.) Anyways, the new dog had the same political views as the first one, and was pretty good at restricting barking to when strangers hung around. We had a good fence, and the dogs couldn't get out. Cool beans.

So, I'm a teenager, and the new dog is four years old. We're both pretty set in our routines. Neighbors across the street have medical problems, and move out to be closer to family. They rent their house out to first a series of teenagers and short timers, and eventually a middle aged couple. New neighbors are, at first, standard strange new people. We talked with them a few times, the wife described herself as an artist - she created gaudy yard sculptures, and made attempts at landscape design - she was way off base, planting things like poison oak and nettles because 'they were naturally growing in the river, and added a california ambience to her yard'. Cool. The plants ran rampant, took over her yard and overgrew the sidewalks around her house, which many, many families used for afternoon walks. Good times.

After a while, maybe two months or so, she started complaining about our dog barking. First she would just walk across the street and admonish us for having pets that interrupted her creative moods. This escalated to phone calls, and complaints to the police. Mind you, our dog barked about twice a day most days, though he really got excited when the trash truck came by - he loved to run back and forth across the yard yelling at it(one day he actually caught it - escaped out an open gate, tore ass down the street to catch it, and plowed right into the back when it stopped.)

We never did get a ticket, the cops got to the point where they stopped responding to her. She was furious about this, and came over to our house several times to scream at my parents about the dogs. My mom was fed up with her, and decided it was time to take this further. Neighbor asked 'If I buy one of those electric collars, do you think it would work?' My mom responds 'I don't know, would you wear it?' 

Her screaming fits were met with first ironic responses, then loud music with the stadium speakers pointed at her house, etc. 

Then she bought the statue.

She must have found it at an estate sale, this HUGE Jockey statue that she thought was the bee's knees. She bought it, spent a week very carefully painting it white, and proudly displayed it in her front yard.

Around this time, the fights over our quasi-noisy dog had reached aclimax, and one day I came home to find my dog very sick. He died at the vet's office, and the vet informed us the dog had ingested a very large quantity of rat poison(which we don't have or use). Of course we suspected the neighbor(She smirked at us from her yard when we got home), but couldn't prove anything, and the police couldn't do anything; No evidence, no witness, nothin.

So, late one night after a month of no complaints, I snuck over to the neighbor's house(at my mom's urging) and a couple friends and I confiscated her 400 lb concrete statue. Snuck it back to our house, stripped of the recent coats of paint, and lo and behold, the jockey was restored to its original racist black! Snuck back across the street and left the statue on the sidewalk, several house away from the neighbor. 

Come the next morning, the good neighbors all notice there's this horribly racist statue, with a hobo stick propped in its arms, a run-away note taped to its chest, escaping from its owner. Neighbor's husband isn't strong enough to move it back home, so gets on his bike and takes off before his wife wakes up. 'Somebody' called the police, complained about a racist art display, and they come to talk to the neighbor. Surprise surprise, they look in her back yard as they talk things over, and notice an owl propped on a tree to scare away crows that looks a bit off. They inspect, talk to her some more, and leave with her in custody.

Turns out she had shot and killed an endangered owl, hung it with chicken wire on a tree, and now had a federal charge against her. All because my dog barked a couple times a day.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1jkzt8,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jkzt8/not_all_neighbors_are_mr_rogers/,

Anyway a few moments later she's hustling herself in the line in front of me using her suitcase-with-wheels to block. I let it go because she was initially there first and she's pretty old and I take a step back. (she doesn't acknowledge the fact I've let her in front of me).

The gas station was family owned and the gentleman that owned it treated me like family. He worked with me on scheduling while I attended community college and was a downright nice person. 

I worked my way up to the position of assistant manager by showing up for every shift, speaking English, and being overly responsible for 19. The other guy that worked my shift with me was Antonio, a flamboyantly gay Mexican. He spoke English well after you spent enough time around  him to pick up on his dialect of Spanglish.  

One day I receive a page from Antonio to come to the cash register. Standing at the register are two fake tab blonde girls in their early 20's. I walk to the register and ask what's up. I'm informed by Antonio that the girls wanted a water. I offer them a courtesy cup and point toward the soda fountain. One of the girls explains with a semi valley girl twang (obviously from CA) that they don't drink tap water and that they've already explained to Antonio that they want a bottled water. I say alright, go head and purchase one and I'll ring you up. Valley girl is getting irritated, ""We shouldn't have to pay for water.""

""Well, the fountain has a filter and is essentially the same stuff as the bottled water, you can have some of that for free or you can purchase a bottle."" I responded, ""I'm sorry, but we have to pay for the bottled water and so do you.""

The girls are visually upset, they huff and sigh and I finally walk toward the back of the store. I go back into the cooler to go about my business assuming its handled. A couple of minutes later Antonio calls me back to the front. He shows me two water bottles in a trash can. The girls had emptied water bottles in a fountain cup and told him they got water from the fountain. This absolutely set me off. I look out at a gas pump and see them getting ready to pump their gas. I wait for the girl to start pumping her gas before I stop the pump after less than .25 G of gas. This occurs 2-3 more times before the girl comes in to complain about the gas pump. I explain that maybe it's broken and she should try another pump. She moves her car to another pump and we replay the same scenario. She comes back into the store even more upset and shorter on patience this time. I explain that there must be an issue with her card and that she should call her bank. She then asked why the pump said ""Stopped by Attendant"". 

Shit. I'm busted. What do I do? 

I ask to see the card and say that I'll try running it inside. I promptly ring up the two stolen waters as a credit transaction, hand her card back and tell her that she can buy gas somewhere else. 

TL:DR bitchy girls think they're too good for tap water so they steal bottled water from a gas station I was working at. I keep turning their gas pump off when they're trying to get gas. When they come in to see what's wrong I ask to see the card, ring them up for the water and tell them to leave.

**Background**:
I work in a coffee shop inside a family owned grocery store. I usually work the evening/night shift because I also attend school in the morning, meaning I have to close a lot rather than work mid day shifts. I have a lot of cleaning and chores to do before I can leave at the end of the day when we close at 9, and when I say we close at 9, I mean I'm walking out the door and punched out at 9. I have worked there for about a year and a half and I've never really had a problem with customers and I generally like helping people, always giving great service to people who deserve it. But sometimes, once in a blue moon, I'll get someone coming in right before closing who really gets under my skin.

**Situation**:
I'm rushing to close on time because my inconsiderate coworker didn't do anything she was supposed to do. It's around 8:50 and I'm mopping the floor, relieved to finally be finished in a matter of minutes. I was just about to lock my door when out of the darkness on the other side, this ""woman"" (who will know henceforth as ""bitch"") reached for the door handle and yanked it open as if she was suffering from withdrawal from coffee. She practically knocked me over with her boobs, which could only be fake, and her mini-me of a daughter in tow. Both were dressed as if they were about to go clubbing. I was fuming at their lack of apologizes and behavior, never was treated so poorly (and I have been treated terribly, but thats another time). They stood at the counter, obviously wanting a drink. I put on my best customer service smile and forced myself to wait on them. Since it's a family owned business, quality service was mandatory and I'm expected to smile and bend over-backwards while juggling 3 whales on a unicycle atop Big Ben and swallow swords if the customer asked me to. 
I start out asking: ""What can I-"" when I was cut off. ""I need 2 large mocha shakes, now."" I was less than pleased. I had everything cleaned and she orders the most complicated drinks requiring I dirty almost everything. Fortunately, we're about to close and I couldn't do it, right? ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything is in the dishwasher and soapy,"" I have a huge sincere smile on my face that I get to tell this bitch she's not getting her damn shakes. ""We close at 9 and it's 8:55."" She completely loses her mind yelling, ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Are you saying that I can't get 2 drinks?! You close at 9, it's not 9."" My smile faulters as I see my manager charging over. ""Can I help you, mam'am?"" My manger asks her. Bitch whines ""Yeah, SHE,"" Pointing at me ""Said that it's too late for drinks but it's not 9 yet!"" Suddenly mini-bitch pipes up and says, ""I want a shake, now."" My manager turns to me and tells me to go make the drinks, I can't really argue with him so I just frown and say ""Fine,"" He leaves. My smile has almost completely disappeared, you can tell I'm annoyed. I ring them up and the total comes to $7.84, nothing special. She digs out her wallet from her purse and starts counting out quarters, dimes, and pennies. *Really?* After she finished bitch was short a good $1.34, then thats when she did the *unimaginable*, she **REACHED INSIDE MY TIP JAR AND TOOK A DOLLAR** AS MINI-BITCH HANDED HER 35 CENTS. I was so appalled that I just stared at her, mouth open, when she tried to hand me the money. I protested ""Ma'am, that dollar is mine, you can't have it."" She looked shocked I told her no. ""Yes, I can."" ""NO, you can't, that's MY tip jar, MY property, MY money, you just basically stole my dollar."" She let out a frustrated sigh as she shoved my dollar back in the jar and asked mini-bitch for a dollar, to which **she pulled out a $5**. I had an angry frown on my face as I cashed them out, I was FUMING. That's when I knew I had to get revenge....

**The Revenge**:
I grabbed the blender out of the dishwasher and kinda washed off the soap. I poured the ice in and added significantly less chocolate, vanilla, and cream so it would be too thick to suck up through a straw, they would have to use a spoon. Then, I used coffee instead of espresso, same flavor just not good quality. I blend it for half the time leaving huge ice chunks in the bottom which is unpleasant to get around and is useless. When I poured it into their cups I ""forgot"" to add the chocolate around the outside, this doesn't change flavor, it's just not as cosmetically pleasing. And finally, I ""ran out of"" whipped cream so I used flat lids instead of the nice dome lids that hold the whip cream. I felt satisfied in my work and I decided to take an extra minute to clean up my mess, stealing another precious minute from them. I gave them my biggest smile as I handed them the drinks. I ran to the back and punched out, meaning I no longer work or do anything or else I get into trouble. I walked out as bitch approached me, ""You need to remake these!"" I played dumb. ""What do you mean?"" ""These are awful! It's too thick and doesn't have the chocolate or whip cream!"" I smile and politely tell her, ""I'm sorry but it's currently 9:02, we're closed and I punched out. I can't help you."" She stares me down but I keep my smile firm. Bitch gives up and sits down with mini-bitch who tries to eat her shake with a spoon. I walk over very slowly and lean down to their level and calmly tell them: ""Ever hear that you shouldn't mess with, or be rude to people who handle your food/drink?"" And give her a smile as her face gets pale as if she saw a ghost. ""Have a nice night,"" I yell as I walk out the door. I laughed all the way home.



TL;DR Bitch and Mini-bitch come in before closing, rude and tries to steal my money. I mess up their order and give them a life lesson.

I eventually made my way to a ford dealership, when I pulled up with my buddy. One of the salesman looked at my car and started laughing at it with his buddies. All I could think was ""yeah, I know it's a piece of shit, that's why I'm here...""

A few minutes later, when he noticed me browsing a lot, he asked me if I needed any help, to which I firmly declined. I wasn't about to buy a car from a dickhead who made fun of my valiant civic. a few minutes later another, much nicer salesman approached, and I ended buying a Mustang GT Convertible off of him, fairly painlessly.

Ned is a [douchebag](http://alden-tan.com/wp-content/uploads/douchebag-posing.jpg). Really. Just with less blow-out-hair than the referenced image, and more crappy tribal tattoos. Ned was hired right out of college as a firefighter, and loves leaving his T4 slips around - showing that he makes over 100k a year. Yet despite working 7 days a month (*edit I'd misstyped and wrote ""week"")  (granted, 24h shifts) he fails to give proper care to his dog and cat. 

He'll do things like leave the dog in it's crate for 16+ hours a day, run out of food for the animals then claim they're on diets, hardly walk his dog to the point where it's socially dysfunctional and has overgrown nails.

When my boyfriend and I are at the house he shares with Ned, we do the best we can to take care of the pets. Any attempt to discuss their neglect is blown off by Ned. 

Over the years, Poof and I have become very attached. I take him to the vet, get him groomed, buy him food. The only reason I haven't adopted him is because I'm away from home so much.

Ned told my boyfriend he needed to move out for June 1st. Totally fine. Ned is just as horrible a roommate as he is a human - but BF has stuck around because rent was cheap &amp; the house was nice.  He'd been planning on buying a house - so getting the boot from Ned's place put that plan into motion. I'm not going to leave Poof with Ned, so I ask him one night if I could buy the cat from him. (He'd often bragged about how the cat was a 'good deal' at $50) Ned, who loves his possessions, was unsure and said he'd get back to me. 

Next day, he says I can have Poof... for $350.
I cry. I've paid way more than that in food, vet bills and medication for this creature. I was laid off and have been underemployed so I'm not really in the position to drop that much money on someone who's emotionally already my pet.

*Fast forward three months.*
This weekend, I'm back at Ned's house - helping my partner pack. I haven't been back to the house since Ned's absurd offer of $350 a 9 year old cat with kidney issues. As we're almost done, Ned comes up and says Poof has died. Or, at least, he can't find Poof so he figures he got out the house and died outside. He shrugs it off. Happened about a month ago. 

Once again, I weep. I let loose my years of fury on Ned. Telling him how I feel about his constant drunk driving, abusing women, pathological lying, animal neglect, and horrible narcissistic personality. 

My partner and I get into the rented truck, and drive to his new house. Open the front door and I'm greeted by my beloved Poof - mewing for attention.

Fuck you, Ned. Two weeks after he said I'd have to buy my geriatric cat from him, I came over during the week and took Poof. I wonder how long it look that douchebag to notice Poof was gone. Ned frequently comes home and passes out with the front door wide open - so the cat running away was absurdly plausible.  

Now Poof, myself and my boyfriend have a little house, where Poof can sit on the windowsill and be a happy, heavily loved fluffball. 
I've also reported Ned for animal cruelty for his dog. Wanted to kidnap the little mutt as well, but it wasn't possible. 

**TL;DR** Rule number one: don't be a douchebag.

About 5 years ago the company I was working for was called by a realtor we had dealt with in the past to winterize a home she had listed because the owner had already moved into their new home.  

Now I have to explain something to everyone that reads this, realtors are the single worst group of people for a service plumber to deal with.  As a contractor they tend to hold no value for your time as a commodity, usually want to be billed and, almost always want a discount because they ""bring you a lot of work"" (which is bullshit); this particular realtor was the worst of the worst, she also happened to be a major bitch.  

I was sent to the job and arrived with everything I needed exactly when my dispatcher said I would, I waited in my truck another 45 minutes for the realtor to show up and then she bitched because she wanted the spot where I parked; I moved my truck for her to make her happy.   

Once I got inside I started my work which was pretty easy;when you winterize a home you shut off and drain the water from the water lines, water heater and, fixtures; after the water is removed from the fixtures you pour RV antifreeze into the p-traps and toilets.  Homes are winterized to make sure water in the plumbing doesn't freeze and get damaged in case the furnace fails or the power goes out, realtors and banks usually do it to protect a property that isn't occupied.  

I was just about done and I noticed that the main water valve into the home had a very slight drip, the valve was at least 50 years old and was showing its age.  To be honest, this didn't matter much because when I was done in the house I was going to shut the water off at the street anyway and I could easily replace the leaky valve at that time if they wanted to (it would have taken 5 minutes) or just leave it alone; it really was no big deal, until I mentioned it to the realtor.  

Upon hearing that the main valve had a slight drip the realtor just flipped out, she started yelling about how this was going to ruin her day and then she called the homeowner; the homeowner left his work 30 minutes away to personally examine the situation.  By the time the homeowner was called I had been on the job for about 2 hours including waiting for the realtor.  The homeowner shows up about 45 minutes later with a very arrogant attitude and accuses me of purposely damaging his valve, I explain that the valve is 50 years old and that replacing it was no big deal; Because he was being a pain I offered to replace the valve for free.  Replacing the valve for free wouldn't work for him so he and the realtor decided I should just fill the plumbing back up (this made absolutely no sense) and bitched about wasting their time with winterizing.  

When I was done I wrote up an invoice and presented it to the realtor, while she was going over the invoice with the homeowner I went into the basement to make sure I didn't leave anything behind.  The basement was clean so I began heading back up when I heard them deciding not to pay me because ""I didn't do anything"".   I was very pissed off, as a rule a service plumber is only paid for the time he bills out and collects on; I was out more than 1/2 days worth of pay.  At that time I walked over to the furnace and shut the gas off to it long enough to extinguish the pilot light which will prevent it from working and turned the main water valve about 1/2 way on.   

After a curt yet polite exchange with my two newest enemies I decided to let the office handle them.  


About 2 weeks later we had a really bad cold spell and we received a lot of calls for frozen/burst water lines, one was from the realtor for the property I wasted her time at.  Because the realtor didn't pay us for our last encounter we turned her work down.  

I ended up working down the street from the house I winterized a few months later, it was off the market.  It turns out the water piping froze and then thawed flooding out the entire home and because nobody was living in the house at the time insurance wouldn't cover the damages because they were ""foreseeable"".  

Edit: TL:DR- I am a plumber that was sent to winterize an empty home, I did the work and mentioned a leaky valve to the customers, the customers flip out for reasons I couldn't comprehend, I was told to just put things the way they were before and I do, I overheard the customers saying they wouldn't pay me so I shut off the pilot light on the furnace, 2-3 weeks later the plumbing in the home burst and flooded the home, good times had by all.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1352146513.0,,,True,t3_12mk6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/12mk6z/how_a_plumber_deals_with_a_bad_customer/,

Anyway, a bunch of my buddies and our girlfriends all decided to move out of our old college apartment and upgrade to a shitty house, since most of us had jobs now and it was time. So, let me start with the place itself: pretty big 4 bedroom lot, front and back yard, some fruit trees, single story, big driveway. It also had a dark side though: 12 foot tall pile of trash in the middle of the driveway. A garage FILLED with junk and refuse. Broken windows everywhere. Black widow spider infestation in the house (yes, you'd come how from work and find them hanging in the middle of your room). The heating system was not hooked up to any pipes in the attic, so when it turned on, the attack got nice and toasty, and we froze. The yards hadn't been tended to in probably a decade. There was a rotten home-made jacuzzi, which we hated due to its ability to spawn black widow spiders and other wooly-bubs. In short: this place was a dump, and we got it because it was cheap. We knew a slumlord situation could be sucky, but we hoped that our slumlord would be one of those who takes your money and disappears, allowing us to do whatever we want. But no....oh no nono nono.....this was not the case AT ALL. The first thing she said was ""ooo you have girls around, I know how that goes. first they stay a day, then a week, then they move in!! I don;t want them here! They can't come here!"" Next thing she noticed was my friends drum set: "" oooo noooooo, you don't play that here. It's somewhere in the contract. The neighbors don;t like me so they will be mad if you play music. (we are all completely taken aback by this psychos audacious attitude). Then she sees the same roomates truck (an old international scout) that he like to work on sometimes. she didn't like this one bit ""ohh NOOOOO you dont work on cars in my garage! I know what you wanna do, you wanna mess my garage up (it was a horrid pigsty already, she never clean her junk out it even though the contract said it would be clean and useable for us). Next tragedy occurs when we try and make the landscape look nice (it was only long dead plants and huge stick bundles prior). Us roomates and ladyfolk get to it and pull out the decades old overgrowth, hidden junk, and weeds. We pile them all conveniently in the front driveway so the landlord can come pick it up. Now we have room to do nice things like grow veggies and fruits like we've always talked about! Wrong. ""NNNNOooooooo is my HOUSE! You no change it. Put it back!!"" But, psycho, we just want to plant vegetables and stuff. We want to tend your fruit trees that have been ignored for a decade. Don;t worry, we are good at this kind of stuff"". Angry psycho ""NNOOOOOOOOOOO its my house and you cant do that, you dont like it, you dont leave (she always pronounced ""Live"" as ""leave"") here!' ""Look, we pay a lease, which states that this house and property are basically ours to do with as we please without you coming around all the time and arguing with us. I mean, we just want to plant vegetables, we dont want your flowers or whatever you think you're going to plant instead 6 months too late."" 

And then came those fate-full words, the crossing of the Rubicon ""FINE then you get out! I wont renew your lease!""

So here's where the serious revenge-porn section begins. Keep in mind that this lady is a bitch-psycho-slumlord, who would park her car in OUR driveway for weeks, show up unannounced and decide to grind tiles for the walkway at 6am on saturday next to our windows, never clean up anything she made like the pile of junk that filled our garage or the full fridge we inherited with rotting food. Anyway, now shit got serious. I told her she doesn't have the right to do all of this stuff, she said ""get out"". And so I began my battle plan. First I documented the place by video and stills, because I knew those would come in handy later for the inevitable court case. And just as expected, she charged us for most of our deposit based on all the damages she left. What a scumbag. So I plan a three pronged approach: small claims + City Housing Dept + IRS. All of which worked beautifully. Small claims was funny, she showed up with her ancient mom as her....lawyer? (who actually fell asleep the whole case lol). She didn't prepare at all and was unfamiliar with the whole process. We stated our case and showed our media evidence to the judge. Landlord-scum tried to interject and say it was all made up. He didn't buy her game though. I'll always remember this part of the court hearing Judge: ""Mrs. Landlord-Scum.....I'm looking at these pictures these boys hove given me, and I must say that your property looks like a terrible dump. I am in no way surprised that they are fighting you on this."" Of course she just started stammering about us being liars and shes the victim etc. We got the whole deposit back. On then to the housing authorities at the city. I brought them a VERY detailed report we made indicating every illegal/non-code issue we could find on the property (there were sooooo many). We had pics and everything. That place was janky and McGeyvered together like only a cheap, psycho lady could do. On top of that, I reported her to the IRS. Her neighbors HATED her and would tell us about all the problems she causes everywhere she goes. She also had a big mouth and admitted that she used our house as a tax shield (claiming she lived there and actually living somewhere else). I dont remember all of the details about the tax stuff, but I wrote down everything they told me and headed on down to the IRS office in my town. I filled out a form (anonymous of course) which basically allows you to rat on someone you know and suspect of committing tax fraud. I filled the form front to back and handed it in. 

Shortly thereafter, our deposit check arrived. Then a few weeks later I heard from the neighbors that her house had a lien against it. I never found out more than that, but I think I pretty much fucked her. I hope she saw that the power tripping and attempts to cut corners with us just ended up costing her 10 or maybe 100 times more time, energy, and money. She may have even lost a property because of her behavior. I'm getting a justice boner just thinking about this all again.

We usually go with about 10 regulars, and there are usually a few randoms that show up to fill the roster on our baseball team. We all usually cram into a couple of campsites right in the middle of the festival grounds.

Prior to our first game we were having our usual pre-game beers. I put my half-full beer down on the table while I did something else for a brief moment. When I turned around my beer was missing. I look over and one of the randoms is drinking it. I knew it was mine because I was the only one drinking that particular brand of beer. 

I thought that was uncool, but no big loss.

That evening I made a rookie mistake and left my cooler outside of my tent, thinking I would hear anyone trying to get into it. I woke up that morning and every beer in my cooler was gone. I look over and sure enough there is a pile of empties beside the chair of the random who took my beer the day before. I can't blame him, but I am pretty sure. A few people we were with were pretty certain it was him, but were pretty drunk.

I was a little more pissed considering I had two flats of beer in my cooler.  

That evening I paid attention to this guy. He arrived with a backpack containing only a couple beer (which happened to be the same brand I had stolen from me the night before). After about an hour he was drinking a different kind of beer. Then one of our friends open drinks went missing, and he had the same drink. 

It became a bit of a game and we started drawing on our drinks so there would be no doubt about whose it was. Still he kept stealing them. No one was being confrontational since we were all drinking.

The petty revenge came in two forms.

**Petty Revenge 1**

We all quietly hid the rest of our beer or locked it in a vehicle so he couldn't steal it. Then whenever he would put his drink down for a second or two, the group of us made an effort to grab it and hide it or pour it out. 

We are pretty certain he started stealing from other campsites at that point so we kept pouring it out. I hate seeing beer go to waste as much as anyone, but it was a sacrifice we had to make.

**Petty Revenge 2**

Our friends were playing a show at the local pub and we all went there to support them. This thief became such a side-show for the rest of us that during the show we were watching him walk around and steal drinks from people who were dancing, or even collecting multiple drinks and pouring the bottoms into one glass. 

One of the girls we were with had the brilliant idea to put some salt in it. She put a dash to start and he didn't notice. She put more, still he didn't notice. Then finally she dumped the majority of the bottle into his drink. He took a swig and his face reacted like it was horrible, but he continued to drink it. So for the rest of the weekend this guy was either drinking salt or nothing at all. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_17vn19,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17vn19/beer_thief/,

This happened about four years ago. Being busy *and* broke is not a good combo, and I needed some clothes that didn't look like they spent more time tumbling around a washing machine than on a person. I had fallen in love with a pair of pants at Diesel while showing my aunt around town. She gave me my birthday money early explicitly to get them when I got the chance. Remember the being busy part? Yeah, I had no time for a leisurely walk around town to shop, so I decided to go straight to the store after one my of classes (photography, this is kinda relevant), get the pants, and get back to campus in time for the next class. So I ended up downtown in clothes that are obviously worn, but still pretty neat, considering they've gotten sprayed with developer and fixer on a number of occasions (left cuff of my shirt had the only obvious stain, about the size of a quarter). My sneakers were speckled with bleached and red spots, but they weren't noticeable. I also smelled of fixer.

Anyway, walk into the store, right to the women's jeans section, and look through the sizes. Didn't even need to try them on, I knew exactly which one I needed. As I lifted another folded pair carefully to look at the sizes on the tags, a hand slams down on the pile, ripping the corner of the one I was lifting out from between my fingers. I looked over my shoulder and saw the biggest, snottiest sneer I've ever seen on someone's face. When this sales-- well, I don't think ""lady"" really applies, to this person, bitch will have to do -- this salesbitch saw that she had my (rather stupefied) attention, she said in the most condescending voice possible, ""These are $300 apiece, *honey*.""

Of course, I already knew how much they cost. I gently pushed her hand of the pant-pile, pulled out the pair I wanted, then met her eyes again, and said, ""Of course I know they're $300, *sweetie*. If I didn't have that money, I'd be doing the selling, not the buying."" I lost count of the number of colors and shades that flashed all over her face.

As a bonus, I *accidentally* hit the pile o' trousers with my oversized bag of ~~bricks~~ textbooks, sending them all over the floor, and said, ""Oh, no. I'm *so sorry*. I'd help you pick it up, but I have to run back campus. Sorry again!""

Revenge achieved. I also did talk to the manager about her behavior, but not in the ""you've wronged a customer and now you'll be sorry!"" way. Told her what had happened, and informed her that I didn't want to cause any trouble for anyone (beyond pants-picking and folding, but that was an *accident*), but there has to be some level of decorum, especially since I had not interacted with anyone in the store. The manager was pretty understanding, and even commented that she had received complaints about similar behavior with other costumers. I was kind of glad to know it wasn't just me. 

On the other side of the coin, I also go out of my way to praise any one who helps me well to management. When they're in earshot the looks on their faces are amazing. 

And I still have those pants.

Edit: Accidentally a typo.

Edit Again: A lot of people are going on about how I can be ""broke"" and spend $300 on a single article of clothing. The 300 bucks were from my aunt with instructions to get those pants as a birthday gift. If I could do what I wanted with that money I'd either squirrel it away or buy cheap but neat clothing.

Besides, 4 years later, and I still have them, and they're in better state than other, newer pants. Plus the way they fit is awesome and they make my butt look great.

I've never typed pants so many times before. Wow.

Pants.

We all went to the office in the morning, and then split up into carpools to go to the conference and back, about a 30 minute drive or so.  Since I was late in the morning and someone was leaving from the conference early, I rode up by myself and then took the people from the other guy's car back to the office with me afterward.

All day, this one guy was whining about how stupid these conferences are, and what a waste of time they are.  Keep in mind, it's all basically 18-22 people there, so if you're really not that into it, just hang back and check out the hot girls from all over the place and maybe strike up a conversation here and there.  But no, this guy had to just shit on everything and bring the rest of us in his vicinity down.

Sure enough, he winds up being one of my carpool people along with two sweet, friendly, soft-spoken girls.  He starts by inserting himself into the front passenger seat without offering to either of the girls. No big deal I guess.  Then he starts ragging on me for not wanting to run the AC.  I just got the car, my first car, and was getting acclimatized to the expenses and didn't want to shell out for an AC repair when I'm just trying to use the car to get to work to pay for school.

I use this as a segue onto it being my first car, thinking this might spark up some conversation in the car that is upbeat.  Nope, this asshole has to rag on me for not getting a standard transmission and needs to point out that we wouldn't have shitty autos if it weren't for women wanting to drive.  I look in the rear view mirror and the girls are flabbergasted at this idiot.

So I decide I'll speak to them about what they are going to school for.  The one girl says something about nutritionist or dietitcian or something like that.  I take up an interest and tell her about a girl i knew from my school in that and about career fields, etc.  We are finally having pleasant conversation, but no, this asshole now has to point out that dieticians and nutritionists, or whatever, are just quacks.

After the drive, we're back at the office, the girls thank me for the ride, dickhead just jumps out of the car like, ""finally we're back"".  The girls want to just get away from this asshole and say goodbye and jump in their cars to leave.  I go into the office to get some supplies and dipshit goes in as well.  Now he's thinking about home.  

him:  ""Ah man, now I gotta walk home.""

me:  ""oh yeah, you live around here eh?""

him:  ""yeah kind of.  it's like a 2 minute drive on XYZ St., but because of the highway there, I have to walk all the way around and it's a longer way and takes forever.""

me:  ""oh that sucks man""

him:  ""yeah....[pause, trying to incite an invitation for a ride from me]""

me:  ""well, you probably want to get going then, i'll stop holding you back.  take it easy man, see you on monday""

i acting completely oblivious and watched him get more pathetic by the second.  for some reason, he didn't want to seem needy or something to actually ask for the ride, and i'm so glad he didn't.  i loved getting back into my car and watching him hit the pavement as i pulled out of the lot.

TL;DR on the bottom.

So, my boyfriend and I were at Universal Studios waiting in line to ride the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit Roller coaster. We were behind a group of little tubby boys all wearing neon green t-shirts. I remember this because I thought they were just a tad annoying as soon as we joined the line. Behind us was this short skinny girl and a really tall guy in a red shirt. 

There were a couple of people sitting on the railing when the line turned a corner and I thought they were in front of us so I didn't move and waited for them to jump down. Then I remembered the kids in green and realized that the people on the railing were from the other side. By the time I had move, the couple had already cut us in line. I simply thought to myself, ""Gosh darn it. That was my bad."" I figured in the next corner turn I'd inch my way back to my spot. 

When I tried however, this bitch extended her arm and grabbed the railing as soon as I walked up beside her to block me from moving up. I thought coincidence and I would have better luck on the next turn. The whole time she kept her head down while biting her nails. I tried again and the same exact thing happened. ""Are you serious?"" I said out loud, but she just kept her head down. Her buddy looked a little nervous but stayed quiet. I was getting pissed, but my boyfriend kept reminding me that it wasn't a big deal and I should get over it. 

I tried to and I was pretty close until I saw that she was not only in front of me, but she had also surpassed the chubby kids in green. When I tried to catch up to them, the kids were like, ""Uh . . . excuse me. You're kinda cutting us."" I just looked at my BF in disbelief. I don't like to get into fights or confrontation so I didn't say anything. 

We waiting in that line for almost half an hour, by then the couple was about 20 people ahead of us. Now I'm pretty shy and don't like any type of confrontation, but I am very competitive and in my mind, I was losing to this chick. Miserably. I really hate losing. So contrary to my usual personality, I started talking really loud. ""Whoa! Those guys got pretty far! They got in front of those people and those people. Hey, look they are trying to get in front of them too! Can they do it? Amazing! They did it again!"" Like a sports commentator. Unfortunately, everyone either didn't care or were too afraid to say anything. The girl looked up and kind of gave me a dirty look. 

Finally, they were trying to get ahead of these three kids, but they had overheard me and were prepared. They had formed a wall and blocked the way. I leaned over to where they were and started talking to them, ""Good job!"" I said and they smiled at me and we just had a small conversation about how rude they were. My boyfriend nudged me and smiled as he said, ""That girl was talking about you kinda mad saying that you told on her."" I smiled back.

I guess that was enough to satisfy me enough to enjoy the ride. By then we were right by the stairs and would get on in about another 5 - 10 minutes. Suddenly, the girl I had been talking to called to me. ""Hey!"" She said, ""We called security on them."" I smiled and thought to myself, ""Yes! Justice!"" Then she said, ""They want to talk to you."" Damn it! I had been trying to avoid a fight with this girl. 

I walked up to them, ""Who was cutting?"" He asked. With no hesitation I pointed to the girl and her buddy (who I kinda feel bad for since it seemed like he was opposed to the idea) ""Alright, you two get out."" The girl walk away in a huff followed by her disappointed man friend. I couldn't stop smiling. I think I was a little too happy, but like I said I'm competitive and in my mind I won. 

**TL;DR** A tiny girl and her man friend cut us and almost 25 other people in the line to a roller coaster at Universal. Being too shy to call them out directly, I started commentating on their actions loudly. After waiting in line for half an hour, a girl who heard me called security on them. I guess I was a key witness and was called over to confirmed that they were the skippers. They got kicked out of the ride five minutes before getting on.

I don't care about the weekends, but I take morning classes during the week and need to get to bed around 10. Things were fine for the first couple months, but my roommate and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot, so now she'll come home from work dragging some coworkers and they'll all get drunk and be loud until the wee hours of the morning.

On top of that, she's accumulated two dogs. Little yippy things, which she leaves caged while she's at work. The dogs are young (1 year and 6 months), and anytime they hear someone in the apartment and aren't getting attention they bark and jump around and make noise. Then, when the roommate comes home from work around 11pm, they'll bark for a solid ten minutes because people walking in the door sets them off. I can't do anything about it either, since the landlady is her mother.

So I just found a new apartment with people who don't have pets and seem really cool to live with. Cue the revenge. The roommate is also insane about cleaning. A place for everything and everything in it's place. Every time she's home from work, she's cleaning or redecorating/rearranging something. Every single day. So now whenever I'm home and she's not, I move things. Just a little. A quarter turn on a trinket here, putting the can opener back in the opposite side of the drawer, poking a hanging picture to hang *just barely* off center. Things like that.

The best part is within a few hours of her coming home, they're all back exactly the way they were.

He ain't getting no new fridge!,657,106,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hj66u/boss_treats_me_like_shit_for_years_he_aint/,"Sorry guys, this is a long one... feel free to skip to the TLDR! Enjoy! And I'm so sorry for the language! I never swear in real life, but it feels great to finally get this off my chest.

About 5 years ago, I left my hometown for university in the big city. I was a wide eyed, fresh faced 18 year old from out in the sticks, wouldn't say boo to a goose and very innocent and shy. Because of this, I didn't have many friends.

I soon got a job at a local restaurant as a waitress which was very upfront with their customers, we were encouraged to be chatty at all times. This restaurant was extremely close knit and the staff accepted me straight away, we always went out after work for drinks and I eventually moved in with the ones I was closest too.

The only thing bringing me down...was my boss.

He was an utter shit head but he seemed to have something in it for me in particular. He would rota me down for the deep clean shifts every week (out of around 35 staffs) Mon, Wed, Sat. That's a 6am- 12pm shift of having your head inside the grill hoods, dishwashers, ovens, bathroom sinks, customer toilets and on top of that, a 12pm-10pm shift. Bearing in mind I still had college to study for.

He would berate me, make snide remarks,openly make fun of me in staff meetings, make me go get his coffee, ask me to make his food and always made fun of my appearance and financial situation. He knew I was desperate for money and I think he did all these things thinking I would never hand in my notice...and the fact I was an utter mouse and would never speak up.

Over time, I became more and more confident, even rising through the ranks. Became head waitress, staff trainer, shift co ordinator and eventually a supervisor. Of course, this also meant I would be working closer to my boss, who became even more unpleasant.

I graduated from college with the highest honors and received an offer from a hospital about 200 miles away (I was training to be a nurse) so the time came to hand in my notice. It was very emotional, as my boss said goodbye he said ""I wish I could say I would miss you but I won't, have fun wiping peoples butts for a living!"". He even went so far as to rota me in for my leaving party....and then proceeded to attend it himself! (It's fine as I powered through and shut up shop super early so I could go!)

So I bid everyone farewell, pack up and move away to start my career and I'm having a great time. I pop back home every other month to see everyone and we have a good catch up, although my boss would deny me the obligatory 30% company discount and eventually banned me outright from setting foot in the store ( good thing there is a coffee shop right next door to it that we would all gather in) 

My best friend had risen to the rank of 1st assistant manager and invites me back for a party that is paid for by the restaurant chain in the most glamourous nightclub in town (free drinks and entry, dance all night long and a chance to see all of my friends at one time) I tell her that I will attend though I will pay for my drinks, since I no longer work there and I shouldn't qualify for freebies! My old boss gets wind of it and tells me that if I attend, he will have me escorted out by the POLICE!??! 

I'm pretty upset as I've come all this way to see everyone to be told I'm not welcome. My friends all leave the club and meet me in the bar next door so we proceed to have a great time.

As luck would have it, a month later, I inherited quite a large sum of money from my grandmother. Not millions...but enough to live comfortably for the rest of my life. I'm not a flash woman, I don't drive a car, I already have a cute little bungalow in the suburbs that I bought and decorated myself, I have no hobbies, I don't like flying. I am dedicated to my life as a nurse and have kept my fortunes very quiet. For now, I'm investing and donating to charities. (oh, and I sent my parents on a honeymoon 35 years after they got married haha). I bought my best friend (the manager) a new car, it was the least I could do after she took me under her wing all those years ago and we slummed it together in a pokey student hole.

Although, the next time I visit my old restaurant, my boss comes up to me and gives me a great big hug. Weird. He asks me how my job is going. It's going good. Weirder. Asks me if I've had lunch, would I like lunch on the house for old times sake? Uhh, no thanks...what the hell is going on?!

I'm starting to get very uncomfortable. He puts his arm around me and asks me to join him in the office to check out the new CCTV system... well okay...I suppose.

The office has changed. On the wall are the sales figures, written in big red letters, with a downwards arrow and a drawn on sad face... a catalogue is on the desk, with a new fridge freezer highlighted.... on the computer, an email from Head Office saying that they have not been granted the budget for a new fridge freezer, only the document has been zoomed in so it's readable from 2ft away.

Boss sits me down. ""It's really nice to see you back in town, did Claire (the best friend) tell you about our fridge breaking down?"", ""No, she didn't"" I reply. It's all pieced together in my head. I know whats coming...

""Well, I've heard from the staff that you've come into a bit of money, and I was wondering, since you were such a valued member of the team to us all here, If you wouldn't mind buying us a new one? It would be a great help you know"".

I don't believe what's just been asked of me, but the voice of my weak, teenage self starting screaming within me ""THIS IS YOUR CHANCE!"".

I smile. ""I have a better idea"". I go into my bag, pull out my purse, go to pull out my credit card but instead slide my hand away and proceed to stick my middle finger up into his face.

""How about you go FUCK YOURSELF?"".

I promptly walk out, and burst into tears at the relief of FINALLY being able to tell my boss where he can stick it.

**TLDR: Restaurant Boss treats me like the shit of the earth for 3 years but I'm too shy to retaliate, became wealthy and refuse to buy that cunt a new fridge freezer.**

It was a late night, and I came out about 3 am to drive home, only to discover that someone - wonder who? - had let the air out of all my tires. Luckily for me I own an air compressor, so I hooked it up to my car's cigarette lighter and pumped the air back into my tires. It was pretty cold out, and not the greatest compressor in the world, so it was a miserable 20 minutes or so.

Once I was done, I returned the favour, letting the air out of all the tires in the four cars in his driveway as well as his boat trailer. I also superglued his mailbox closed. That made me feel better.

It was a day camp at the local university, and each day the campers got time in the gym (under supervision of course), to play racquetball, swim, etc.  The university was nice and let us use an area of the locker room that was vacant.  Most all people were respectful of us, as they realized the difficulties of my job.

Now to try to explain this next part.  The shower system in the locker room was a bit weird.  Every time somebody flushed a toilet in the locker room, there was a short burst of intensively hot water that everyone taking a shower would feel…really annoying.  Basically, you had to coordinate your shower to either be short, or to when you felt that the locker room was empty, as to avoid getting doses of extremely hot water.  People were generally cool about this fact, and it wasn't really a big deal.

One afternoon while getting my campers into the pool area, a man (let’s call him Professor Douche) felt the need to cut the line at the entrance citing his seniority at the university.  As he passed me, he gave me a terribly nasty look and said, “you should get your campers under control.  This is a university, not a zoo.”  Either  Professor Douche didn't realize these campers were special needs and needed closer attention, or he was just a real big douche.  Either way, this pissed me off.

The Revenge:
Well after the day is over, and all my campers are currently in the locker room getting ready to leave, guess who strolls in for a shower post swim…yes, Professor Douche.  As he was the only one taking a shower at the time, I couldn’t resist.  I had ALL my campers (16 of them), go flush the toilets one by one as they were walking out.  I could hear Professor Douche scream around the 9th or 10th flush…yes, it was awesome.

TL;DR – Fuck with my special needs campers…get a intensely uncomfortable shower.

I saw my share of bad driving, but very seldom was it that I got the opportunity to actually do something about it.

For reference, the road I was driving on was one of the larger roadways in the city. It was the pre-rush hour rush, so there were more cars than usual, but less than full on rush hour. 

So I'm driving down this road in the right hand lane, singing along to the tunes on the radio, because that's how I roll. Out of nowhere, this jackoff in a raised pickup truck with all the fixins (you know the type) comes flying up behind me, gets right on my tailgate, and starts laying on the horn. I look around, and the road is full. I can't go left, because there is a wall of cars there, all moving the exact same speed. But yet, this doucher has decided that I'm not doing all I can to shorten his commute.

This goes on for about 30 blocks (5 sets of lights) and this guy just will. Not. LAY. OFF. **THE HORN.** He's riding my ass like nobody's business, and constantly pulling left and right to try to get past. Into more cars. I don't know. But whatever, I've had it by now. Game on, fucker. You've freed the beast. At this point, I know I need to make this guy more unpleasant than he already is, but I don't know how. Then he makes this problem very easy to solve.

At one point in this road, a new right hand lane opens up for about 150m. This is *only* to exit. It does not stay on this main road. It leads to another, larger road. So of course, as soon as we hit this new lane, asshole decides he is going to use it to pass everybody. He swerves into the lane the second his truck is clear of the last little bit of curb. He punches the gas, and quickly starts to overtake me. With perfect timing, the car ahead of me moves over into this lane as well, blocking this truck's path. Cue the horn. The other driver proceeds to give 0 fucks about this guy on his ass riding the horn. Now, by this time, the guy who was originally behind this truck (2 spots behind me) has pulled up close behind me, and I'm holding pace with the truck, forming a pretty little rolling roadblock that is trapping the truck in the exit lane. He's got the signal going, he's trying to muscle his way back onto the main road, but I (and I like to think the other two guys as well) were having none of it. We hold this guy in his lane for the last 75 m or so until he hits the exit ramp, at which point I give him a cheery little wave as he pops a few blood vessels.

The road he got on was already gridlocked with rush hour traffic, and the next off ramp was over a kilometer away. Enjoy your trip, asshole.

EDIT: A lot of people are asking about medical emergencies. I don't know, but I think it's safe to assume this wasn't the case, as the road we made this guy get onto is the quickest route to the nearest hospital.

I work on the register at a bulk type meat market butcher thing, and this hambeast comes to the register during the lunch time rush, and tries to buy ~50 slabs of different cuts of meat. Once I ring up the total price, she decides that it costs to much, and dumps 20 trays back on my register. Now these registers are tiny, none of that conveyor belt stuff, so I ran out of room. She then demanded I take them all off the total and re-bag everything for her because all of the bags are now practically empty, meaning I had to put it all away myself during the lunch rush, or try and work around the 20 trays in my limited space.

The area that this butcher is in is known for theft and destruction of property, so trolleys aren't actually allowed to leave the store. My revenge? As she is trying to pry money out of her purse with those sausage fingers, I stretch the bottom of each plastic bag slightly and then overload them all with the remaining trays of meat. She payed, still accusing me of ripping her off, then left. Two minutes later, she comes back, all six chins quivering and she is livid about it, and started yelling at me, because her meat went all over the car park. The head butcher came out, saw the meat still sitting at the register, and just there and then said if she didn't like it she could fuck off, as it wasn't my job to make sure the meat got from the register to the car.

**TL:DR** Hambeast comes in to bulk butchers, changes her mind about half of the shopping at the register where I work, demanding me to re-pack the bags now that she has emptied them all again.

I live in Mumbai. There is nothing like driving etiquette here. Driving is a game of survival, anyone can cut you off anywhere and bikers generally squeeze between cars and try to beat the traffic.

The bus service over here is also chaotic. I don't know what the ""international standards"" are, but here bus stops are 2 and 3 minutes apart, and 20-30 different routes may all share at a single bus stop. There are no doors on buses (there are doorframes, so don't worry, we don't have to climb in from the windows). And buses rarely halt for more than 20 seconds at a bus stop. In fact, they start moving before the last person has even entered the bus. (You buy the tickets after you're seated)

****

**REVENGE**

So it's frequent here that bikers try to save time by squeezing in between the bus stop and a bus. Nobody really cares if you get out from the front or back, so usually there's people getting out from both sides. Now this is quite dangerous, as the biker could easily hit you in his hurry. So what I do, when I see a biker trying to squeeze between the bus and stop, I'll stand at the back door, and put my hand out, signalling that I'm getting off. So the biker usually stays right behind me, so as soon as I get off and move away, he can cut out before the other person exits. But I don't move. I stand right outside the door (move a little back so that the other people can get on/off) till the bus goes away (usually within 10 seconds). ONCE the bus is gone then the biker can ride around me and continue. This maybe holds them back by a few seconds, but it makes me happy that I caused them inconvenience.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1366661441.0,,,True,t3_1cvahy,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1cvahy/the_3_seconds_you_tried_to_save_turned_into_a_15/,

This is a tale of one of those people:

I fondly recall this one time where I had this guy come in and sit at my bar during a slow spell in the day. The bar top was empty so he had the whole thing to himself and my undivided attention. I remember him saying how he had shown up a bit earlier than his date for the night, and how he wanted to knock back a few to help ease the nerves. A fairly common request. I remember his drink order; he wanted a premium margarita with top shelf ingredients, blended, with extra salt on the rim. I whipped up his drink, he complimented its deliciousness, and proceeded to guzzle it fairly quickly over the course of around 20 minutes. He ordered another, standard procedure. I figured what the hell, his date's on the way, nothing wrong with a bit of liquid courage. 

So I mix up his second drink and my back is turned while I'm watching the blender. As the noise dies down, I hear a familiar *-click-click*. I turn around to pour his drink into a mug in front of him and see this dude clipping his finger nails right onto the bar top. Hmmm. Not exactly the best place to take care of that, but whatever man. Guess he wants to look good for his date. So half way through his second drink his date arrives, and this dude wants to close out his tab and get a table. My douchebag sensor starts tingling as I hand him the little tray thing with his card and receipt to sign. I make myself busy at the other end of the bar and bid him a good rest of his evening, as he and his lady grab a table. I go to pick up the tray and receipt when lo and behold, fucker stiffed me AND left a pile of his fucking fingernail clippings in the tray. Come on man- you just spent $18 on 2 drinks, and the only tip I got was a handful of your disgusting, gangly nails?? Fuck that. 

I watched the bar ticker closely as the waitress from his section put in the order I recognized: premium margarita, blended, with extra salt. I did what any petty revenger would do; I tossed that pile of his own nail clippings into the blender along with his drink, then blended it up nicely. Then I watched menacingly from a distance as he chugged down his frosty/naily beverage, knowing that was all the tip I needed. 

As an epilogue, he ended up not tipping the waitress either on a fairly hefty tab &amp; I regret nothing.

This petty revenge wasn't the result of a single action, but of a long period of frustration that culminated in a perfect opportunity.


I remember being a child going to grade school and high school. Sometimes you just really did not want to go. So yes, I've pulled the ""faking that I'm sick"" card in order to stay home, but I usually felt guilty about it and would only do it 2-3 times a year at most. My younger brother (by ~5 years) however, was less motivated in school than I was and throughout his time at school would try to pull it a few times PER MONTH. Of course, by the time early afternoon comes around, he's playing video games and watching movies while eating ice cream. Now, bless my parents, but after a while they just kind of let my brother get away with it all the time. It was frustrating to me, because I put a lot of effort into school, and they were a little harder on me than they were with him. I would have multiple talks with my parents on these mornings where he'd be belly-aching and moaning and ""UUUMMMFFGHH I feel awwwful""-ing, but they would just say ""I don't have the energy to deal with him today."" It got to the point where it was laughable; I didn't think someone could have that many fevers, that many colds, or that many migraines that often.


Anyways, by the time I was in university and still living at home, my brother's frequent ""ailments"" were just a part of life. That does not mean I grew placated by it; quite the opposite. The longer it went on, the more incensed by it I became. The main frustration for me was that my brother was completely taking advantage of my parents, and my parents were LETTING him take advantage of them. I would see their looks of exasperation often during these ""sick"" mornings, and it would irk me to no end.


By the time the petty revenge (justice?) gets into play, My brother is in grade 12 and is 17 years old, and still faking sick several times a month. My parents were going away on a huge anniversary vacation to Europe, and being that I was the oldest child still living at my parent's house, I was put in charge of getting my younger brother to school and watching over him. I was his ""legal guardian"" for the three weeks my parents were away. And as his legal guardian, I was going to make sure that he went to school every single day unless one of his limbs were cut off.


So it's early September, the start of the school year, and my parents leave for Europe. My younger brother starts his senior year of high school, everything is fine. Until...


The SECOND DAY OF SCHOOL, I go down to his room to wake him up, and up starts the moaning. ""Ohhhummpphhh OlderBrotherRevenge, I'm so sick. I have such a bad cold *fakeasshitcough* I need to stay home"". Are you kidding me? The second day of school, you are going to pull that shit with me? I was enraged, but this was also my chance to finally be able to directly address this issue as I couldn't address it before. My rage was building up for 7 years for this moment. Never did I realize that it would work out so perfectly.


I calmly let him know that he was, in fact, going to be attending school that day, whether he was sick or not. He IMMEDIATELY became indignant, arguing with me about his body's failings and the recuperative measures that needed to take place. After about 15 minutes of debates, I gave him an ultimatum: either go to school, or we're going to the hospital.


""Fine, let's go to the hospital!"" he said, trying to call my bluff in a move of desperation.


My nostrils flared with excitement. I had nothing to do that morning. ""Get your coat.""


With glee, I drove him the 20 minute drive to the hospital, and checked him into the ER, the entire time with him bitching to me about how unnecessary this was and how he just needed to rest. I said that since he was sick quite often, we needed a doctor to check him out as I was worried about his overall health. Fuming, he waited with me in the waiting room for about an hour and a half before being called into triage, where he gave a laughable account of his state of health. The nurse looked at me with a smirk, as though she knew what I was up to, and I was reveling in the moment.


After another 30 minutes of waiting, we finally get into the ER. My younger brother is still complaining up a storm. The nurse comes by and does the pre-check, asking him to cough, pressing down on pressure points on his body. By the end of the assessment, the nurse is pretty confused as he's found nothing wrong with my brother yet (""How surprising!"" I thought), so he goes to get the doctor. When the doctor comes, he's as well perplexed by the lack of noticeable signs of concern. Since there's nothing noticeable that the doctor can see, he decides that everything is necessary. He orders a blood test, a urine sample, and a CAT-scan for my brother. 


My brother hates needles. He turned white when the doctor said that. I was over the moon.


The nurse returns with the syringe for the blood test, and my brother squirms back on the hospital bed in a feeble attempt to get away. The nurse scolds him, and tells him to man-up. My brother's face was still completely white and he had to look away, so I was giving him small encouraging remarks that would get him through this. My brother is not impressed, and I can see in his eyes and his body language that he's regretting the decision he made to go to the hospital and to pretend to be sick that day.


Next, the nurse leaves and returns to give my brother a cup to pee into, and instructs him to the bathroom. With a smirk, my brother says that he doesn't need to pee, so he won't be able to do the urine test. He thinks he won that round. The nurse looks at him and says, ""Well okay, but if you don't pee into this cup, I'm going to have to insert a catheter into your urethra."" It took me every fibre in my being to not burst out laughing at my brother's expense at that little quip. I am pretty sure I was visibly shaking with internal laughter. My brother's face dropped faster than a boulder rolling down a hill, and he grumpily asked where ""the damn bathroom was.""


When he returns, he gets set up for his CAT-scan (I couldn't believe they gave him a CAT-scan, it was like icing on the cake), so I just chill out with my book and read while he takes the 45 minute journey to the underbelly of the hospital. When he returns, we wait another 30 or so minutes with his impatient (still pretending to be sick) moaning at all times, until the doctor comes up to us and basically says that my brother is fine and he's not sure why he's there. Smiling, I thank him for his time, exclaim how happy I was that my brother was not in any mortal, and lead my brother out of the hospital. We've been there for roughly 4 hours, and on the way home my brother makes a comment saying ""Ooooh, I'm going to take a nice bath and then a good nap when we get home."" This boy thought he was in the clear.


""Oh, what? Didn't you hear the doctor? You're fine. By my reckon it's your lunchtime now. You're going home, putting on your uniform, and going to school for your final two periods.""


He was LIVID. Swore up a storm, gave me as many insults as he could muster, and said my parents wouldn't approve of this to try and get me to change my mind. I replied, ""They may not approve, but they aren't home for another 3 weeks. I am."" After that, he sullenly sank into his seat and didn't talk unless it was to insult me.


We went home, he got dressed, and I drove him to school. And because I'm a nice brother, I went into the attendance office to let them know that he was in the hospital all morning and that if he got a detention because of it they would be hearing from me. Told him I love him, he discretely shot me the finger, and I went home.


One of the most satisfying mornings of my life.



*Note: We live in Canada, so we have universal healthcare and didn't pay for the hospital trip. Was it a waste of taxpayers money? Yes. Will there be people who chew me out on this? Yes, but sorry; I needed to teach my brother a lesson.*

So when I was a little girl, around 3-4 I had a cousin that was just the meanest entity to ever become human. We are the same age, however she would always try to get me in trouble and one day on a fine Christmas evening she decided to lie to all the adults and tell them that both of my older brothers called her a swear, and they got in trouble. 

So what did I do, trip her no too easy, tell on her the adults would never listen. No as soon as we had the Christmas cake, it had little toys in it so I asked my dearest grandmother if I can please have the toys on the cake, of course she wanted it but grandmother favored me over her. That's not the revenge.

I decided to play with Santa and his reindeer in the swimming pool aka the toilet, so I stuck them in the toilet and flushed the toilet multiple times until it flooded. (Sorry Santa) I promptly walk out of the bathroom and to the dining room with the adults and act like nothing happened. 

Then I hear my sweet grandmother yell from the kitchen so I run to see if she needs help. She asks me in a serious tone what happened to the bathroom as it was flooded with a Christmas miracle, I say I do not know looking her dead in the eye, and explain that my cousin stole my toys and locked herself in the bathroom and flushed my reindeer down the toilet making me cry. 

I get extra dessert while she gets yelled at and cries sweet tears of joy for me. I smiled at her and she knew, however the adults would have nothing of it and she got in even more trouble for slandering sweet little me. My brothers never knew.

Sorry grandma.

**Background**
So you know type, classic douchebag, bluetooth headset, suit wearing, businessman (known as DB) who makes slightly more money than the rest of us which adds his narcissistic ego.

**The Story**
So in the morning commute to work I get out of the train go up the stairs to exit the station, normally I have no problems with this. Today however was very different. DB decided to NOT stick to the right side of the stairs which is the side you use to go down, and went on the left. Now normally this would be no problem as someone would just let him go. But I noticed that he had already bumped into 3/4 people in his rush to get the train but not only that he said ""excuse you"" (as sarcastically as he could) to every single one, including a little kid around 5/6 years old and the cherry on top was instead of paying attention he was busy talking on his bluetooth and overall ignoring everyone.

**Revenge**
So instead of letting him go down and catch his train on time I decided to play a game of chicken, we both were walking directly at each other me on the right going up, him on his ~~wrong~~ left (my right) coming down. Of course he too stubborn to move, and I decided that instead of winning I would have some fun, I slowed down just enough so the rush behind me would catch up and then I bumped into DB slowing him and forcing him to move into the corner. At this point he was PISSED and he even pushed me out of the way to try to make it to the train but it was already too late, he was trapped by the rush of the people exiting the train. He was stuck waiting (i'm assuming) a good 10 extra minutes while the train emptied and then left without him.

Since apartment rentals are too expensive in that area, we decided to venture into renting a house for the first time. They are first-time landlords, which already raised some red-flags for me, but my SO was determined into saving money and these landlords were willing to do a 6-month contract.

Before we moved in, we were told they were going to install a dishwasher and let us use the garage shed and take care of the yard. Now we know to always get these things on writing, since that ended up not happening. Basically, everything they did was half-assed. They lived about an hour away and told us to piss off after we asked about thinks they promised to take care of.

And then the mice problem started. They ate through a collector's item backpack that I had and tore some of labels from vintage wines that we had. They got into our cabinets and it was just hell! We basically did not eat at home because we were so disgusted. I called them, and called them about the mice problem, but to no avail. They simply told us to get some poison and put it around the house. Well, according to our state laws, that's THEIR responsibility. We say that and they basically tell us to piss off again and just put poison all around.

So, revenge mode ON!

The mice problem started about a month or two before we moved out and they were trying to get it rented out as soon as we left. So, every time they asked to enter the house to show it off to potential renters, we would leave the mice traps and mice poison EVERYWHERE and in plain sight. You had to step over them to get into the living room, bedrooms, etc. 

But the real treat came as we said goodbye to that house. We took granola bars (which we determined was the mice favorite treats, since they ate through our supply) and dropped them all over the vents and basement. A few months supply for them.

So in the morning I fed the cat the new brand of tinned cat food. He sniffed at it. He stood there and stared at it in disbelief. Then he stared at me. It was a look that clearly said, ""This is shit, you cheap fucking bastard."" He flicked his tail with undisguised contempt and stalked away.

A short while later I was having coffee and reading the newspaper. The cat was busy grooming himself thoroughly, and seemed to spend an inordinate amount of attention on his feline posterior. I raised an eyebrow and gave him a slightly disapproving look (do that in private, cat!), and went back to reading the newspaper.

A few moments later I heard a quiet *thwip thwip thwip* sound. I paused, newspaper in hand, and listened. *thwip thwip twip...* I looked to the sides - nothing.

Enter one day, when there's a Caddilac XLR convertible. I've never seen one of these in person before, and it's gorgeous.

It is also, however, parked diagonally across two spots. The two spots adjacent to those are unoccupied, and if there's one thing I absolutely hate, it's dickbags who don't know how to park. Taking up multiple spots, parking too close to the lines, etc... you know the type.

Well, as soon as I see this car, I park my wagon right up next to it. I fold my mirror in and get my car about three inches from his (if that) and crawl out the passenger side.

Knowing that he could just crawl *in* from the passenger side, I went in to my mom's office, explained the guy's parking and asked for her keys. She obliged.

So I get her car too and park it on the other side of this Caddy. Again, just a few inches. I crawl out and call it good.

I didn't have anything to do that day so I decided to sit and wait. I messed around in her office for a bit, browsed the internet, whatever. Then I heard yelling. I walked over to the door, looked out, and a fat, middle-aged man is yelling because he can't get to, nevermind open, the doors on his Caddy.

He sat there yelling and steaming for a few minutes until he stormed off somewhere, probably back in to his office to make a phone call. I ran outside, got in my mom's car and moved it so the passenger door was now free, but left my car in place. He came out again, realized his car was no longer blocked, unlocked it and I got to watch a fat, middle-aged man crawl across the interior in his $100k Cadillac just so that he could get in and drive off, all because he parked like a dick.

We were in History class, and some guy is the centre of attention cracking jokes, everyone is loving him.

He left a girlfriend (Call her HP for horrible person) home in the house that he owns. A few days ago, the hairstylists husband goes over to visit and sees a man walking around in his underwear. After he knocks on the door a few times, nobody answers, and so he starts yelling through the door. He hears HP's voice through an open window next to the door and so knows she's there. After hearing her, he realizes what is going on. HP is cheating on his son. 

So, enraged, he starts trying to take down the door, leading HP to call the police. My hairstylist also hears of the situation through the neighbors, who like John. She rushes over, and arrives to see the police taking her husband into custody for trying to break in. She goes over to try to stop this, and the cops, who also like John (for the most part), tell her the deal. 

Her husband will have to spend a night at least in the county jail for his actions, as his name is nowhere on the ownership papers for the house, so technically illegal. My hairstylist also is informed that he can't evict HP either, as her name is nowhere on the ownership papers either. Only John can do that, as only his name is listed as owner, and he can only evict in person, which is not feasible until he gets leave. However, the cops give her a clever alternative method of payback. 

The next day, HP receives a call from my hairstylist stating that at 3:00 that afternoon all the locks will be changed on the house, something she can legally do. She then tells her that if she needs back in for any reason, she can ask the hairstylist for entry. This is all technically legal, as she is allowed to modify the house, but can't evict. She isn't, however, denying her entry by allowing her in by asking, so HP has no legal recourse for entry. 

Now, HP is trying to find a place to stay, as her parents are gone and her ""boyfriend"" had no idea she was cheating on someone and so left her cold, so she is pretty much stuck sleeping in her car until she finds another residence.

It's the asscrack of dawn when we open our drive through lanes. My manager and I had issues opening up, so we couldn't process transactions. We didn't open until about a half-hour after opening time, which was at 7 am. 

After getting everything sorted, this very nice young lady puts her money in the carrier and sends it to me. She is a very sweet girl, but she is a stripper, and apparently, she just ended her shift. Now, when she gives me her money, I notice that it's a little wrinkled and stinky. I put it aside in my drawer to get rid of later.

She leaves, and after a few minutes, this other woman pulls up. I greet her, and without any provocation, she starts screaming at me.

Her: ""Your sign says that you guys open at 7! I was here at exactly 7! Why weren't you open? I want to speak to a manager!""

It was going to be one of Those days with one of Those customers. My manager is about twenty feet away behind a closed door and she still heard the old woman. She comes over.

Manager: ""Hello, my name is Manager. What can I assist  you with?""

Her: ""You guys weren't open at 7! I was late for work! I waited for an hour for you to open!"" 

First off, no normal person sits in front of a darkened building for an hour, and second, no she was not here at 7:30. I kept checking for people who may have thought we were open, and no one had come by.

Manager: ""We had a few difficulties opening, ma'am. I am very sorry that you were late - ""

Her: ""Why didn't anyone call me to let me know that you were closed?""

Manager: ""Ma'am, we don't call customers if we are unable to open on time. We simply don't have the manpower to call everyone that comes into our branch. Now, what can we help you with today?""

Her: ""I need to make a withdrawal!""

I take out the carrier and put a pen and a withdrawal slip into it. Then I send it to her and ask her to sign and indicate how much she needed. She flips her lid again.

Her: ""Fuck you! I'm not signing shit for you. Other Manager at Other Location just hands me my money.""

The manager and I share a look at her blatant lie. The woman puts her debit card into the carrier and sends it to me. Then she pushes the call button.

Her: ""1234.""

Manager: ""Pardon? I don't understand.""

Her: ""That's my PIN. I want $200 out of my account. I want all small bills.""

I had to step out of sight to literally facepalm. The manage explains that she cannot use her PIN, as bank employees cannot know that kind of information. Woman starts getting combative, arguing that she isn't ""signing shit"" because she doesn't trust us with ""her money"". After a few minutes of polite cajoling from my manager, the woman finally signs the withdrawal slip and sends up her driver license. It's expired. I would have told her that we couldn't accept it, but my manager was so frazzled that she did overrode the notice and told me to get the woman out ASAP.

The petty revenge?

I gave her ALL of the ones and fives that I had gotten from the nice stripper girl. The money smelled like cheap perfume and pot, was covered with glitter, was still kind of moist in certain spots. She left without checking the money. I hope she got that glitter all over her car.


ETA1: For those who asked about the coffee pot guy:

There is an elderly gentleman (though I use that term loosely) who comes in every single day - and I think he loiters on Sundays, because I'll see him in the bank parking lot when I'm grocery shopping.

We have this really cool coffee pot that plugs into a base. When it's plugged in, it heats up the coffee inside to keep it warm. It's also expensive. Now, we have that on a table right by the door with an assortment of ""fine sugars"" and creamers, as well as cookies and candies. So, he comes in one day, and makes himself a cup of coffee. He normally goes through six or seven cups while he's in the branch, so we don't think it's odd at all.

He takes the entire coffee pot into my managers office with an entire container of creamer. He sits there for an hour, pouring cup after cup of coffee, all while other customers are baffled. We aren't allowed to say no at any point, not even if someone's being an ass. So my manager just continues to talk to him. Finally, after an hour or so, the guy gets up to leave. He walks right by the coffee table thing without stopping.

He has the coffee pot and creamer tucked up snugly into his coat, and as he's trying to leave, my manager goes after him.

Manager: ""Uhm, sir, can we please have our pot back?""

Man: ""What pot?""

Manager: *points at coffee pot*

Man: ""Oh."" 

Manager: ""You can come by and have as much coffee as you'd like...we do want to keep coffee on hand for our customers...""

Man: ""Oh.""

My manager puts the coffee back on the table, but we didn't notice that the creamer was gone until a customer had asked for it. :-\",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1367417954.0,,,True,t3_1dgk1z,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1dgk1z/cuss_me_out_and_act_like_an_idiot_in_public_thats/,

This is another golf post, so I'll try to include translations for those of you who are not familiar with golf lingo (heathens!)

I was out golfing today, because fuck yeah, summer. I was on the green putting with my group. I was lining up to putt for birdie (a good score ona hole, one under par), when I hear a golf ball land close. Very close. Like, 3 feet away close. That would have hurt, and the guy who hit it didn't even yell ""FORE"" (to warn other golfers that a small white projectile might be heading their way). The golf ball rolled down a small embankment and into a sand trap next to the green. 

Whatever. Shit happens. Then the guy shows up, decked head to toe in LaCoste gear, chewing a massive wad of gum and wearing jersey shore type sunglasses. My buddy is about to putt, and this guy strolls up to the edge of the green, and just yells out ""EY. I HIT A BALL THIS WAY. WHERE IS IT?"" right in the middle of my friends backswing (a big no-no in golf etiquette.) No apology, refusing to wait until the player playing has hit his shot, and demanding to know where his ball was. Like we're gonna help you.

""Yeah, it went into those trees over there."" I say, pointing at a thick copse of trees about 40 yards to the right of where we're standing. Long grass, not a lot of room to move, and plenty of thistle bushes.

Assholio turns on his heel and stalks off towards the trees and starts rooting around in them for his ball. I hear the occasional ""fuck!"" and ""ow!"" coming from his general direction, prresumably when he jabs himself on some thistle.

While he's rooting around in there, I casually stroll over to the bunker (sand trap) and pick up his ball. It's a Titleist ProV1 (the priciest golf ball you can find, that skilled golfers use to play good, and that shitty golfers use to look good.) I pocket the ball and proceed on my merry way to the joyous cacophony of cursing from the trees and thistle.

I used that ball for the rest of the round, and am debating keeping it for posterity's sake.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1db5b2,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1db5b2/you_almost_hit_me_and_then_expect_me_to_help_you/,

While the rest of my family was going to head home to NYC after the flight, I had to take everything with me for my flight home to the west coast and had a 25-30lb bag of records (will be important later)
      On the flight down, the guy in the seat infront of my father had a broken chair.  Guys chair went back slightly too far, there was something wrong with the lock on it, and it went way past normal flight recline.  You could easily see compared to the rest of the seats on the plane.  Every time dude moved his seat it collapsed into my fathers knees.  After the fourth or fifth time he crushed my pops legs, my father politely asked him to control himself and his seat.  Dude said ""fuck you"" and continued to abuse my dad's knees till the end of the flight.  My brother and I hatched a revenge plan.

I generally work the Sunday shift at my poorly managed bookstore, and being a Sunday; the bank is closed.
This means I'm stuck with whatever change was left in the til from Saturdays shift. Which shouldn't be a problem as there is $250 in various notes and coins except for the $50 customers.
Now the $50 customers don't actually spend $50, they spend less than $10 and pay with a $50 note, which quickly eats up all the change and leaves me with several $50's and no way to give customers change until the lunch shift where I would have to find another business who will exchange my 50's for change.
After the same customers coming in with the exact same habits several weekends in a row I decided to start asking them if they had any smaller change. They never did, which was quite frustrating.
So I got my co-worker to prepare one weekend, before the end of his shift on Saturday he got $150 of the til changed into $1 coins. Come Sunday morning the same customers came in at various times, picked up their $3-$7 items and handed me the fifty. Keeping my 'friendly customer service smile' I would count out the correct amount of change in $1 coins and happily hand them their mound of change with their receipt and do my best to hold eye contact with their state of surprise upon receiving the pile of coins.
The next weekend they all had smaller change and have ever since. The regulars do anyway, I still get the occasional random $50 customer.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1aga6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1aga6l/the_change_game/,

I work in a an accounts department. Contrary to popular belief we aren't completely socially inept, in fact the whole team is quite the opposite. We aren't Loud or unprofessional, but we do love a bit of banter and a giggle. 

All accept one person, who I'll call 'the shrew' (because he looks like one)
He has always been a hard working, motivated and efficient employee like everyone else, except he is the most selfish, self absorbed prick I've ever met.
Day in day out he criticises people because of their lack of expensive/sought after belongings, and if you do have something new, rest assured he'll go and buy himself a better version of what you have and boast about it. He's one if those guys.

Anyway, the story...

My wheely chair sadly passed away, it had been with me since my 1st day almost 4 years ago, so I needed a new one. I was presented with this space-aged one, with more padding, moulded to perfection, just a generally funky chair. Shrew didn't like this. So Shrew took it upon himself to find me 'a better one'. I came back from lunch to find him leaning back in my new chair, whilst he put his old one at my desk

""I've given you the privilege of sitting in a chair I once sat in, no thank yous are necessary"" and he spun round and tapped away merrily. 
Prick. Pricky pricking PRICK!!

So once he left his desk, I proceeded to take one of the little legs off of the keyboard so it would wobble. Knowing he would slide himself backwards to the desk behind him to complain to IT his keyboard was unstable, I also locked two of his wheels on the chair, and took the sliders off, so they couldn't be unlocked.

And then I played the waiting game. It only took 2 minutes for him to sit back down and throw a hissy fit, and shout behind him at IT that they MUST give him a new keyboard. When he didn't get a reply, he pushed backwards from his desk, only for the wheels to lock and send him flying off the back of the chair. During the tumble he managed to  pull off some of the arm padding, leaving a bear metal armrest in its place. He got up, red faced, and told me to give him his old chair back. 

I have him the biggest shit eating grin and said 'my old one is just over there, I wouldn't usually give anyone the privilege of sitting in it, but because it's you...' And gave him a wink.
And as a bonus, because he can't unlock the brakes, he has to put 10x the amount of effort in the wheeling to his destination.
This has absolutely made my week :)

It has a garage that opens onto a fairly narrow alley and is directly across from the service entrance of a bar/restaurant.  The bar has two private parking spots abutting the entrance, and people frequently park alongside my fence, also in the alley.  All is well.  Except for the people blocking my garage.  

A few times a month, I would return home to find someone parked (illegally) directly across the alley from my garage, which does not leave enough room for me to actually get in the garage.  I started leaving polite notes, and when I caught people, I asked them to park alongside my fence.  Frequently, the offender was related to the bar: beer truck, grease truck, recycling van, dropping someone off for a shift, picking up a paycheck, and on and on. It quickly became tiresome, and I got sick of arriving home from work to a blocked garage and an entitled asshole saying, ""It was only for a minute!"" when they own two parking spots and can also park twenty feet down the alley and block no one.

I talked to the two managers and the owner, several times.  Their excuses included:

*The bar has been here longer than I have owned my house

*Their two parking spots are reserved for the owner and cannot be used by anyone else

*Sometimes people just need to run in real quick 

*It's probably not even anyone related to the bar

*They will announce at their next staff meeting that people should not block my garage, princess &lt;sneer&gt; &lt;eye roll&gt; 

This goes on for three and a half years, with only short periods of improvement after each discussion with a manager/owner.  I start to twitch every time I round the corner into the alley.  

One day, my bosses' boss asked if I could be on call (on my day off) for an important project.  I was angling for a promotion, so you bet your ass I'm available, sir!  Mid-day, I opened my garage door to take out the trash.  Son. Of. A. Bitch.  I ran to the bar entrance and pounded on the door.  Kitchen dude said the truck did not belong to anyone at the bar.  I paced.  I sweated.  I silently begged my phone not to ring.  I stared at the empty space alongside my fence.  For the very first time, I called a tow truck.

Then I ran inside my house, grabbed a tin of olive oil, and poured about a half cup on the truck's windshield, driver side window and door handle. I felt slightly better.  Five to ten minutes later, the tow truck shows up.  Almost simultaneously, the driver shows up.  It's the fucking bar manager.  He sees the oil and loses his mind.  You bitch, I was only here for a minute, we've been here for decades, why didn't you tell me this was such a problem, on and on.  I calmly dismiss the tow truck driver, give him my widest and craziest smile, and close my garage door.  He's out there for an hour scrubbing olive oil off his bayyyyybeee.

It's been six months now, and guess where exactly zero people have parked?

They left me some cash to buy groceries and the basics, but they expected me to get a job as well. I didn't mind hard work and they gave me a car (my mom was in a minor accident and was too afraid to drive so I ""inherited"" the car happily at the cost of being her personal chauffeur) so it made it much easier to find a job.

I decided that I wanted to be a delivery driver because I loved my car and driving. I found a job in our local paper and called them immediately. They asked if I could start in the morning. Sure thing I thought and went up there at 7am ready to work. 

The company sold home soda dispensers and the CO2 and syrup cartridges that it used. My job was simple, deliver whatever the customers ordered and collect their payments. The job was for minimum wage but had the bonus of $3 per delivery to motivate drivers to be quicker and more efficient as well as pay for gas.

I had a few minute conversation with the owner and he handed me a stack of 30 orders and had someone help me load my car. I was at the first place by 8am and basically zig-zaged all over town till about 6pm that night. Pretty easy job.

After my day or work I went back to the shop to give the owner the cash I collected - about $700. He hands me $30 for gas and says come back in the morning. That $30 was a little less than a full tank (back then at least). 

The next morning I arrived and get another 30 orders, loaded my car, then asked when I was going to get paid. The owner said he already paid me for the prior day. I thought he was joking, but asked again just to make sure. He said I made 10 deliveries at $3 each and he paid me $30. I explained what he told me the previous morning and he denied having ever said that. Fuck that I thought. Then he was called out to their warehouse while I waited in his office. 

While I was waiting I realized something very very important. Through every talk we've had I only told him my first name. He never got any information from me whatsoever. In other words there was no record of me at their company.

I walked out to my car, on the way out the owner said he needed me to take another CO2 cartridge to a guy I delivered to yesterday. No problem, I said to him. Smiled and left.

I made the first few deliveries and collected payment. It was enough to cover my previous and current days of work and a little extra. I then continued making the deliveries but told every customer I visited that the company was going out of business and that the company was giving them their last order for free as an apology. Everyone was so nice and felt bad that I was losing my job that they tipped me quite well from the money they were expecting to spend on their order. 

I never went back to the shop. They never called me for their money because they didn't know who I was. A few months later they did shut down and I had a much better summer job.

**TL;DR - Company I worked for wouldn't pay me what I was owed. They didn't have my information so I made the money I was owed and then some on their dime.**

I'm battling a cold and I ran out of medicine. I stopped off at the drugstore down the street to pick up some supplies (tissues, nasal decongestant, toothbrush). I'm walking down the aisle towards the cold medicine when this harpy and her husband are taking up the whole aisle with their basket full of clearance Christmas wrapping paper. I kindly say to them, ""Excuse me"" so I can squeeze by. Instead, I get twin sneers and sidelong up and down glances and no movement. I say to them again, ""Excuse me, mind if I get by?"" and no response. I know they're ignoring me. Now, my ears are stuffed up so I'm pretty sure I said this somewhat loudly. Instead, they mosey down the aisle towards the cold medicine, blocking my way.

I'm annoyed. All I wanted to do is to run in and out of the store. I overhear the harpy saying she was going to get some cold medicine XYZ. Well fiddle-dee-dee...that was *exactly* what I came to buy. Harpy and her husband split off at the intersection but I still wasn't able to shimmy through the small gap between her ass and the aisle. She blocks off a large portion of the aisle reading medicine packages with her ass and her basket. Seriously, 75% of the aisle is blocked. I quickly turn down the parallel aisle and get to the cold medicine from the opposite direction. Harpy is slowly reading the medicine boxes but the type we both want was right in front of me. There were two boxes left.

I made eye contact with her, smiled, then picked up the last two boxes and left. I could see her realize I had JUST picked up what she was looking for. *YOINK* I see her scrabbling through the racks but haha - those were the last boxes of XYZ bitch!

This is a few years back, supervising a shift at a busy and well known restaurant, we're known for a relaxed family atmosphere but mostly entertained young couples and parties...

This particular day was manic. There was a music festival in town, hot day, a lot of punters out enjoying the atmosphere. Shift running nice and smooth, we got plenty of staff and we're having a good bit of banter with the customers. All good...

Enter a gypsy family, very well known in the community for being trouble makers and extremely well known in our restaurant for trying to get away with petty things (such as not paying for side dishes, desserts, drinks, complaining to get vouchers and generally being rude to our staff and a nuisance to our customers).

The father is 6ft tall, built like a brick shit house, tattooed to the eyeballs and quite literally decked in gold.... he usually leaves all the talking to the mother, a short and snappy cow with cartoon eyebrows and the nastiest false nails and hair extensions I've ever seen. 

On this particular occasion, they bring a selection of their brood. 3 of their bratlings, The youngest is around 4 years old, middle is 7 years old and eldest is early teen and all of them dirty, disrespectful and snot nosed.

We're busy. upstairs, downstairs and outside seating is packed. There's a 15 minute waiting time for tables. These guys walk in, ignoring our host and find a table for themselves. Host goes over and tells them there's a queue and is told to fuck off as their hungry NOW and don't want to wait...

Well, alrighty then. I apologise to those who are waiting and saw it happen but they can see there would be no reasoning with these guys and the moment passes.

Mother comes up and barks her order at me. Throws a £50 note on the counter and walks off. Not a please or thank you in sight. I call over ""Excuse me miss, you forgot your change and your drink glasses"". ""Bring them"" she says without looking back to me. So I do.

About 15 minutes later and the youngest brat is getting bored. He entertains himself by spitting on the table and writing his name with his gob, SCREAMING that he's starving, fighting with his brothers, swearing and the ultimate peeve of any waiter or waitress that has ever lived... *RUNNING AROUND UNSUPERVISED.*

He's going to go one better. He's going up to other customers tables and is **TAKING** food from their plates. Chips, garlic breads, tomatoes, anything he can get his hands on. These guys look around for the terribly embarrassed mother who is sure to be straight behind him to apologise profusely and yank him back to their table.... yet nasty chav momma hasn't even looked up.

Brat then runs behind the counter to the cooking area, we got a 250°c grill, a 150°c griddle, a chip fryer and a bain marie back there and all at a lovely head height for a 4 year old. He pushes staff members out the way to go into the kitchen where we have the ovens and raw meat being prepared, he starts pressing buttons on the oven, dishwasher, glasswash... putting his dirty hands on our lovely clean work tops.

He then runs back into the cooking area where staff have now actually noticed him and are trying to block him away from dangerous areas. He;s trying to push past them, starts kicking them and want's to have his own way. Brat turns away and is now pawing at the cooked food being prepared on the counter top. Topples a chicken salad dish onto himself and then begins eating it off himself, in *tears* because he's so hungry.

I've had enough, I take his wrist and take him back to his mother. She glares at me, then at her son, snatches him up and turns back to her trough. 'Whatever', I think to myself. I know there's nothing I can say to the mother about her son's behaviour. She clearly doesn't care or has the power to stop him. Maybe he'll stay there now since the food has arrived. Shift goes back to normal.

A few minutes later, I'm behind the till and feel something kicking my legs. Yup, it's the brat. I look over to his parents table, they're still engorging themselves. I couldn't believe it. 

Kid starts running around again, this time instead of heading to the kitchen at the left, he heads off to the disabled toilet on the right. I know it has a clunky door that has the tendency to lock itself... so I follow him to make sure he's okay.

When I catch up to him, he's unrolled all the toilet paper and turned the sink on full blast to splash water around the floor.

A scolding is on the tip of my tongue, but when I look into his shit brown eyes and his ""I dare you to tell me off' smug little face... I realise I'm leaning on the door that has a tendency to lock itself and with a triumphant look, I accidentally shut it and accidentally turn the light off. I can already hear the turd screaming but the toilet is right by the music speaker and it's hardly noticeable...

Parents are about to leave 10 minutes later, nasty momma looks around for her youngest spawn. She doesn't seem panicked, she glances back to the restaurant floor and over to the staff. ""Have you seen my son?"" she snaps. They truthfully reply that they haven't, for I have not told them. 

A few of them go to check upstairs, in the kitchen, in the fridge and freezer when one of them walks past the disabled toilet and hears a wailing. Quickly, they get a butterknife to turn the lock from the outside. I'm only watching from afar but I hear the staff member gasp and the hicupping of a child that has spent itself on screeching. He has also pissed himself with terror of being locked in the dark for 10 minutes.

The mother walks over to him, smacks his bottom and turns to leave without another word. And so triumphant was my glee, I began to cry with held back laughter.

**TL;DR** Brat child causing terror at a busy restaurant, taking customers food and running through the kitchens, I accidentally lock him in the disabled toilet, switch off the light and he pisses himself in panic.

I should also mention that next time he came in, he was good as gold. Lesson learnt, you little bastard.

So my brother thought it would be a good idea to go under my bed in the middle of the night, and make weird noises to freak me the fuck out, then pop up and scare the living jeebus out of me.



I waited about 3 weeks, but it was worth it. He recently watched a creepypasta called ""Abandoned by Disney"", and whenever he finds a good scare like this story, he tells me to listen to it.


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLLuVlghPo
(TL:DW: man goes to investigate abandoned Disney park, sees living zombie Disney mascots and mickey rips his head off)


Bad idea.


The video has a creepy piano song in the intro of the video, which i use to scare him.

I sneaked into his room at around 2:30 AM and put a large mickey mouse head on his chair and an LED flashlight shining underneath it while he is still sleeping. I also put my phone behind the chair and set the creepy song to play 20 seconds after i leave his room.


The song plays. I hear him slowly wake up and realize he is being watched by a large mickey mouse head in the dark with a flashlight shining below it with the extremely creepy music playing behind it


He IMMEDIATELY darts for the door (which i left open) for him to run into the kitched (also dark) for him to see a dark figure stand about 15 feet in front of him (me) wearing a scythe (plastic one i had from 5 halloweens ago).

I really enjoyed working there, especially since the store I worked at was located in a college town, with many drunk women taking pictures of things they would (or would not) regret the next day. One day, a sorority chick came in while talking on her phone and slammed a roll of film onto the counter. She continued with her conversation and would not stop to tell me what she wanted. That got her irritated and began to gave me looks that seemed to say ""well, aren't you going to do your job?"" I just continued to stand there until she was done with her phone call. She finally hung up and at that point, I asked her how I could help her. She was already irritated with me for not being able to read her mind and know what she wanted, so because of that, she felt the need to be rude with me. She would talk down to me as if I did not know how to do my job. Although she had pissed me off enough to make me want to say something, I kept my composure and continued to remain professional. I began to process her roll of film and printed them all out. Now, at that time, Walgreen's had not switched over from the Kodak machine to the newer digital Fuji machines, so we would have to review the pictures to make sure that all the prints were fine. I began to look through the pictures and the first half of the roll was nothing but sorority party pictures. Nothing out of the ordinary. Until I got to the second half of the roll. In that half of the roll, I see this sorority chick doing some things that would go on the NSFW_gif subreddit. So, I decide to put those pictures in the very front, so when she would open the envelope, they would be the first prints she sees. My plan was nice and simple, but got even better when Ms. Sorority chick arrived with a friend to pick up the pictures. I hand her the envelope, and she then hands them over to her friend, while she paid for the pictures. As soon as the pictures were paid, the friend opened up the envelope, pulled out the pictures and let out a gasp, which made Ms. Sorority chick turn to look at her friend. The friend then showed Ms. Sorority chick the pictures of her extra-curricular activities and the face that Ms. Sorority chick made was priceless. She grabbed the pictures, stuck them back into the envelope and practically ran out of the store with the friend right behind her.

In order to get a gumball, you had to place a penny in the slot and turn the knob. After a couple of weeks of spending every penny we found on gumballs, something miraculous happened: pennies were no longer required! With a simple turn of the knob, one marble-sized gumball came out of the machine. Though we had free access to gumballs, we only ate a couple each day.

One day, my cousin came over to play. We fired up the sega genesis and were having a great time. ""Do you want a gumball?"" ""Yeah,"" he replied. I walked over to the gumball machine in my parents room and turned the knob twice. I went back to the bedroom and told him about our gumball machine. For the rest of the day, my cousin would sneak into my parents room. Twist, twist, twist. He'd then pop three gumballs into his mouth. Ten minutes later: twist, twist. My brother and I were growing increasingly annoyed. Twist, twist. I couldn't bear it any longer; all of our gumballs were being eaten. I don't even think he was chewing.

An idea popped into my mind. ""Hey cousin, do you want a gumball?"" ""Yes,"" he exclaimed as he reached out for it. I tried to hold back my smile as he took the red gumball and popped it into his mouth. He bit down. ""OUCH!"" he cried.

In case you don't know, dish dog is the low man on the totem pole, but nobody really messes with them, because nobody wants to do that if they quit.  I actually liked it.  Turn on the music, load up the wrack, dirty dishes in, clean out, wax on, wax off... you get the picture.  I would actually use the time to go over my college homework, write paper outlines in my head, and even design D&amp;D worlds, all while my hands were busy.

Eventually, I got promoted to prep cook, then line cook, etc... and moved to a bigger, better paying kitchen.  I still loved cooking and enjoyed being in the ""zone"" when tickets were flying in and out, food was perfect, and you got to drink a case of beer after work with your line buddies.  I was good enough to get promoted to sous chef, and took the job, even though it meant an actual hourly pay cut with more responsibilities.

I was good at this, too.  Cut overtime hours in a huge kitchen, streamlined food cost and made sure people took pride in the food and service.  I even nutted up and fired the racist, lazy bitch who threw temper tantrums in my kitchen.  6 nights a week, 60+ hours, and I loved it.  Things were great, I got a few awards, it was awesome.  Then I asked for a raise.  ""Sure, its in the works"" was the reply for about 8 months.  Then they switched bosses, I started off at square one with the raise.  ""Oh, yeah, we're working on it.  I have to talk to the guy, and he's only here every 3rd Tuesday"", or some other bullshit.  6 more months of this, then I say ""Look, if you can't get me a raise, take me off salary, and I can at least get overtime.""  Done.

So I kept doing the job, even though I made the same pay as the line cooks, but was responsible for the whole kitchen.  At least I was making more money.  They hire another sous chef, at a salary much higher than my old rate, and I ask if I can get that salary as a sous chef.  ""Well, you have to apply for the job,"" which I had been doing for 5 years.  ""Fine, I'm no longer a sous chef.  Find somebody else to close the kitchen 6 nights a week.  I'm paid the same as a line cook, so that's what I'm going to do now.""

Time passes.  I am back on the line, still happy, but much wiser.  Another new boss, and he starts trying to bully the staff.  Me, as a former manager, knows what is and isn't allowed by company policy.  People start coming to me when they question his instructions, I tell them what the actual policy is, and what they can do to counter him.  Chef, understandably, doesn't like somebody challenging his authority, but most of the people we work with don't speak english too well, and he is abusing these people in ways that are clearly not allowed in the employee handbook.  Stuff like forcing people to use vacation time when they don't want to.  Offering overtime early in the week, then cutting it later on.  Ignoring time off requests, etc... not stuff you get sued for, but stuff our company frowns upon.  My outspoken defiance gets me transfered off the line and into the ""steward"" position.  I don't care, company can't cut my pay, and I've got so many years there, I get tons of benefits, plus I no longer work nights.  Awesome.  Angry that I haven't quit, Chef tries one last thing to get me to quit.  Dish room.  I couldn't believe it.  I was the highest-paid dishwasher in town, never worked a night or Saturday, and nobody ever fucked with me.  Chef would come into the dishroom, expecting to see me elbow deep in some shitty, burnt pots.  Nope.  Everything clean, I'm miles ahead of the workload, and I have a smile on my face.  I know it doesn't seem like a dish best served cold, but it felt pretty good to ruin that bully's attempted revenge.

It was a decent guitar, nothing special... not high end but not horrible. Of course, I got a few low ball offers which I promptly ignored, except for one. This guy sent me, a complete stranger, an email about how my guitar was a piece of crap, and how that I must be a ""noob"" to guitars if I thought I would get close to my asking price ($400) for it. He offered me $100 or something to ""take it off my hands"". 

This guy was acting like such a condescending, know-it-all, asshole, I decided to play along. I told him something like ""you're right. How about $125"". I told him that I worked at UPS as a late night loader and that my shift ended at 2AM, and that I could meet him at this public parking lot by 3AM at the latest. He wasn't too happy about that (has to be at work at 8AM or whatever, blah blah), but he agreed, probably because he knew that he was getting a $400+ guitar for $125. We exchange cell phone numbers and what type of car we'd be in and agree to meet.

2AM comes. I text him ""leaving work now, will be there by 3 for sure"".
3AM comes. He texts me saying that he's there, and asking where I was. I don't respond. He texts me a few more times.
3:15AM - I text him ""sorry, had a last minute truck arrive, will be there in a few minutes"". He replies that he's been waiting there for half an hour, and to hurry up.
3:16AM - I call the authorities and tell them that there's a really suspicious car (gave car description) in ____ parking lot. They say they'll check it out.
3:45AM - He texts me saying that the police just searched his car, and ""where the fuck"" was I?!
3:46AM - I text him back saying ""sorry. decided it wasn't worth it to meet up this late in the freezing cold for $125.""

I then block his cell phone number (I gave him my Google Voice number) and send all his emails to immediately delete. I never sold the guitar, I ended up giving it to my brother as a gift instead. 

tl;dr - posted a guitar on craigslist. lowballer/asshole tells me that the guitar sucks and that I'm dumb.

I work in the travel section at an international organization with many staff members who travel quite frequently. We are quite busy, but well organized, and so are able to deal pretty well with last-minute rush requests for various travel documents.

Enter staff member (Rude Bastard, or RB) with a history in our office of being difficult (not following instructions, submitting the wrong forms, rude to anyone below his level, never having *anything* prepared on time, etc).


Me: What can I do for you today sir?

RB: I need my (old Travel Document) renewed urgently because I'm traveling soon.

Me: Sir, we no longer renew (old Travel Documents) here at Derp Organization; since September of last year we have been issuing only (new and much-more-secure Travel Documents) that meet the stricter requirements of many countries around the world.

RB: What? Why wasn't I notified of this?!

Me: A memo was sent out to all the heads of the departments of Derp Organization in July of last year sir, and again once the change took effect in September.

RB: Fine! Just tell me what I need to do to get a (new Travel Document)!


I tell him the process of applying for a (new Travel Document), all while his grumbling continues, calling our office a circus and unprofessional. My coworkers and I can hear everything, and are getting a bit annoyed to say the least.

Time comes when the (new Travel Documents) are almost all finished...except for the new photo everyone has to take, as per the new stricter requirements.


Me: Ok, now that this is all done, head over there to have that gentleman take your photo.

RB: What? Why? I have this photo from my (old Travel Document) and it's still good! Why can't you just use this one?

Me: We cannot sir; the (new Travel Documents) requirements state that the photo must be under 6 months old. We provide this service free of charge over there by that gentleman.

RB: Well I can't have my photo taken like this! I don't have a tie on! I would look unprofessional! If I had known I needed a new photo I would never have come to work without a tie!

Me: (declining to mention to RB that the requirements for the new Travel Documents are CLEARLY posted on our intra-net, and ignoring the bait of responding to what was OBVIOUSLY my fault for not informing him of the changes last year) That's ok sir, other staff take photos without ties on all the time.

RB: No! I'll come back tomorrow!

Me: ....thinking to myself (what happened to this being urgent?)


So RB comes back the next day, wearing his most magnificent thousands-of-dollars-suit (yeah, right) and tie, hair slicked back, the whole nine yards, and takes the photo.

Unbeknownst to RB, I am not just someone who works the front office collecting applications and helping staff members.....I am actually in charge of creating the (new Travel Documents).

Time comes to upload the photo to our software program, and guess what happens?

Oops, looks like our ""software"" ""automatically"" cropped the photo, cutting off your glorious suit and tie, thereby leaving you looking like only a floating head on the (new Travel Documents). Which are valid for 5 years. Asswipe.

I no longer work for an airline, but back when I did, I spent a great deal of time in big airline hubs.

A lot of these airport terminals cover a vast expanse, and utilize long conveyor belts to help speed the journey through these big buildings. They're a good idea, at least in theory.

Unfortunately, as any frequent traveler can attest, people *lose their minds* when they get to an airport. All social conventions and situational awareness are completely out the window. One of the worst examples of this is the traveler who sees the conveyor belt not as a tool to speed his journey, but rather a chance to stop walking and let a machine do the work for him.

These human slugs wouldn't be such a problem if they would simply heed the simple instructions that are posted *everywhere* along these conveyor belts: **Walk Left, Stand Right**. Such a simple concept, or at least it would be if these people didn't leave their brains in the parking garage.


So as I'm in Newark, rushing to my gate to catch my flight home, I end up behind one of these human speed bumps. She's standing on one side of the conveyor belt, and her bag is directly next to her, making it impossible to pass. I can't step over it as I'm pulling my wheeled suitcase with another bag strapped onto it.


I say ""excuse me"" as I approach her.  She doesn't acknowledge me at all.

I say, ""ma'am, could I get by?"" She just gives me a confused look.  We're about ten seconds from the end of the belt, so I give up and wait while other passengers stack up behind us.

We get to the end of the belt, and she steps off, but doesn't pick up her bag. It falls over, completely blocking the lane, while she stands there looking around.

""Ma'am?  Ma'am, your bag!""

I back up a few feet, but it only buys me a couple of seconds, as all the non-insane travelers are right behind me and I have no where to go.

She looks back as I'm shouting, looks down at her bag, and picks it up. She then sets it down on the metal platform immediately after the belt ends, but still between the handrails!  She resumes looking at signs to figure out where to go.

Out of options, I do the only thing I can: **I kick her bag, as hard as I can, ten feet across the terminal floor.** I'm positive I heard something break inside when it landed, and that just made it even more satisfying.

She actually had the nerve to say to me, ""What is your problem?""

I was too stunned by her stupidity to do anything except shake my head and walk away. But I smiled as I envisioned Snow Globe juice and broken glass all over her clothes.

By the 4th day of this every one at the airport was stressed tons of people were stranded and doing the same thing as my family due to canceled flights.



We all wake up at the crack of dawn and start standing in line for the doors to open like we do every day.

At first people think there's and emergency and let him by but, the closer he gets to the front (where my family and I are) it dawns on every one he's just cutting. You can visibly see people getting angry that he's cutting  who is this guy that's so important that he can cut every one else because he time is so much more precious then ours no one says or does anything about it they all just let him pass and look disgruntled at him...



He reaches the very front doors next to me. As they open up and it's like the scene out of the lion king with a huge herd pouring through the valley. So I look at this grinch of a man dead in the eye and kick his luggage toppling it off his cart right as every one starts spilling though the doors. I can see his mind working playing out all the scenarios. He can try to catch me but with so many people who would never reach me in time, if he does go after me his luggage will most likely get stolen, if he picks up his luggage and ditches the cart he'll be stuck lugging around those heavy bags all day because carts are extremely hard to come by, if he restacks his bags and gets back in line he's already lost so much time he'll be waiting for hours right behind every one he just tried to cut...

Hopes of school being cancelled were shortly dashed. Somehow, I managed to find a way to fight through 3 periods of school. Then, I dragged myself to English. 

The lesson was bog-standard, with one deviation; it was our first English lesson back after receiving our Mock results. I had been pleasantly surprised to see that I had managed to attain a beautiful pair of A's. However, Mrs 'Conor' (Not her real name, instead I used the name of my mortal enemy) decided to tell us that we should all have received C's. the majority of the class got a mixture of A's and B's, so as you can imagine, there was a large amount of disgruntled pupils. I personally found it quite rude, but the sight of heavy snow falling brightened my mood to 'miffed off a bit'. The real problem, was when she asked for our work back (A controlled assessment we had finished that we were analysing that lesson). She wanted us to hole punch the papers for storage purposes, which is perfectly understandable. Then a frown fell upon Mrs. Conor's face, a d she abruptly declared ""Actually, no, send them to the front. This work might have to go to the examine board, it needs to be neat."" This caused a huge imbalance on my moodometer. It went straight down to 'who the fuck do you think you are...'. It was preposterous, surely a set 2 year 11 English class was capable of punching holes? Apparently not. It was then, that I hatched my plan.

Mere minutes earlier, she had prepared said hole punch for us to use. She had carefully set it to the setting for A4 paper. Then she made her mistake. She moved away from her desk to help a student. Thanks to my 'prestigious' position at the front next to her desk, I quickly grabbed her hole punch, and adjusted the setting. Slightly. It was only a centimetre or two out. She then returned to her desk and ordered the papers to the front. The moment of truth came. She used the misaligned hole punch! But victory was not here yet. Was it noticeable? She grabbed her binder, and inserted the papers. All of a sudden, she froze. Only for a second, but it was long enough for me to see. She suddenly started patting the top of the papers, trying to make it fit. It was at that moment, that it happened. Her mouth, wibbled. Like a child stuck on a hard level in a computer game, she was about to cry. Then she pulled herself together and closed the binder. It mattered not that she didn't cry. Her mouth had wibbled. Her binder wasn't a perfect fit. VICTORY WAS MINE!

And best of all, we had a massive snowball fight at lunch. It was a good day. It was so good, that I haven't been back at school since. God bless you snow.

We have never caught her in the act but someone's pizza will magically go missing, and lo and behold she has the exact same type of pizza for lunch, or someone's coke went missing and oh hey! A cup full of coke on your desk!

This happens all the time and we know she does it. Anyways on the the incident....


I'm responsible for like 14 staff members and as a morale booster I decided to bake a batch of my mom's double fudge chocolate brownies. I love baking for my staff so I was excited to hand them out come Wednesday afternoon (as a side note, I had this whole plan where I was going to call them into my office to discuss something all very serious like and then we were going to have coffee and brownies). I put them in the fridge to stay nice and fresh. I left for lunch to go on a date with my girlfriend. 

The afternoon rolls around and I go to get the brownies and there's 1/4th of the pan missing. I was fuming. I walk over to food stealer's desk and YUP I see one sitting next to her keyboard.... I wasn't comfortable handing out the rest of the brownies because god knows what food-thief did to them.

I was angry, and a plan started to form in my head...

**THE REVENGE**: I knew I had a pie in the fridge at my house that had to be like a year old. Seriously this thing was gross. I took it out and tried my best to scrape off as much of the grossness as possible.

I took it into the office the next day and left it out on the counter in the packaging. I watched all day to see if food-beast would get up to devour it. At around 3:00pm, she left her dungeon to go to the kitchen. I followed close behind.

It's a public site, as in anyone can access the campsite, as long as they pay the owner to access the hot water, toilets and showers, and obey the rules. (This also applies to us.)

One of the rules is:

- No noise between 10pm and sunrise.

Many campers play music from their car stereos, and for the most part, there is no problem with that.

Enter four annoying douches. They show up a few days after we do, and from minute one, they are playing electronic music from their cars as loud as possible. We don't mind too much, as there is no-one else at the site, and we've dealt with worse stuff than that.

10pm arrives.

The music doesn't stop. After a half hour, I walk up to the owners along with my father. The owner lives on site, and when we told him about the music, he responded with ""I know. I was about to ask them to turn it off."" That's no problem, he's done it many times, with many campers simply not realising what time it was. Thinking that this would be the case, we returned to our tents.

We see the owner ask them, and we also see the douches laughing.

The owner passes by us on the way back to his house. He answers our questions before we can ask them.

""Just be up at dawn""

We wake up at dawn, but are tired as fuck, since the music didn't stop until about 1am. We make some coffee and wait.

Finally we see the owner walking towards the douches' camp site. He was holding a large black bag. When he finally got near the site, he stops, sets down the bag, unzips it and pulls out his chainsaw. He pulls the cord and the chainsaw screams into life.

I've never seen four people wake up so quickly. As they emerge from their tents, I see the owner turn the chainsaw off put it back in the bag and walk away.

So in my early college days, I hung out with a group of wild, hard-drinking guys I'd known since grade school and, being the most rational member of the group, often had to step in as the voice of reason for their wilder plans (something they were very grateful for because it kept them from serious injury or jail... usually.) In that capacity, I'd grown very accustomed to them asking whether [insert horrible idea] was a good idea or not.

**Offense:**  
So one day I showed up to the apartment of two of them and found them sitting at the table clearly agitated. When I asked them what had happened, they explained that some guy had been over the previous night and taken a crap in their shower. I laughed, saying he must have been seriously drunk, and they said ""no, he was sober. He just thought it'd be hilarious."" They'd called him out on it the following morning and he'd just laughed, said it was a ""joke"" and refused to come clean it up or even apologize. They were clearly in revenge mode, but I talked them out of doing anything rash because, while the guy was clearly a prick, they were going to overshoot it on the revenge and do something like light his car on fire. Bad juju. Anyway, we moved on and it wasn't mentioned again until a couple weeks later, we're hanging out again and someone is clicking around on facebook and suddenly stands up in shock. We come over to see what he's looking at, only to find he's just received a ""bring your friends"" party invite from the shower pooper to christen his new apartment. They all stood there silently for a second, then turned to me, eyes begging.  
""Get in the car.""

**Revenge:**  
We get to the party and mill around for a little while and I'm starting to think better of them doing anything foul to this guy's place until he suddenly says ""Hey guys, remember when I took a shit in your shower? That shit was hilarious!"" Nope, screw him, he's earning this. The three guys with me at the time finally make their move and line up to use the main bathroom in the place. The first guy goes in and upperdecks the toilet; always a classic. The second went in and plugged the sink, pissed in it, then knocked the guy's toothbrush into it. The third guy went in and was in there for a while, then comes out grinning from ear to ear and says ""ok, we gotta go... now.""  
We get out to the car and start driving away and he starts laughing hysterically. Turns out when he went in there, he was looking for something to do and noticed that the floor air vent wasn't screwed down. He had taken the cover off and crapped right into the vent. It had even managed to make the turn enough that it wasn't visible anymore, meaning that it'd go unnoticed even after they'd cleaned up the other things and would keep the poop smell lingering for quite some time. After a long laugh from all of us, I just said ""you know of course there's really no coming back from this one, right?""  
""Yeah, I think we're legit enemies forever, now.""

Come his teenage years, the family across the street from his house got into loud partying on the weekends. They would pound loud music in their garage, which of course echoed and kept everyone up. Compounding the problem, the parents of the kids are a manager of a successful liquor store and the owner of a party hosting firm. Since they were feeble parents who let their kids do just about anything, the partying was all but guaranteed. When my boyfriend's family and the family of his best friend (who also lived along that street) complained about it, they would find their houses vandalized. They did the whole 'dodge-the-cops' routine by turning the music down and were none-too-subtle about their disdain for the rest of the neighbourhood.
  
Enter my boyfriend's best-friend's father - we'll call him Angus. Angus was the leader of the local Scottish cultural club and has been playing the bagpipes since a young age. While Angus' and my boyfriend's families were talking about these loud parties, someone mentioned how much nicer it was to hear bagpipes than the loud dance beats. This gave Angus an idea. He asked the whole neighbourhood for permission (and got it), and set about his plan. I should note that Angus lives next door to the shitty loud neighbours.
  
Friday night came along and the loud teenagers were obnoxiously partying it up. They were unthinkably drunk the whole night, throwing bottles and doing what inebriated teenagers do. The neighbourhood didn't say a word and the party dies down at like 5 a.m. on Saturday. Angus, who typically has the Scottish piping band over for practice and hanging out, decided to hold practice as soon as local noise ordinance let him do so. That happened to be 7 a.m. At 7:01, some 20-piece bagpipe outfit starts playing, loud as can be, facing the fence which separated Angus and the neighbours. 
  
They played. And they played. And they played. Hours and hours of bass drums and bagpipes filled the neighbourhood. The teens, hungover and pissed, called around to ask people about filing a noise complaint - when they discovered that everyone was actually in on and supported the piping practice, they called the police anyway, only to get themselves a good strong talking-to for being horrible neighbours in the first place.

I've golfed all my life, so it was a pretty easy gig and I did a damn good job.  Club pro requested me for a pro-tournament he was qualifying for.  I kept my mouth shut when needed, but I could help your game by a few strokes (if asked).
    
Every year, there was a two-day event for the members.  There was heavy gambling on the event and a steep entrance price.  No one played and spent less than $5k.  As a caddie, you'd have the same person each day and the pay was significantly higher than a normal.  It was expected to make $200-$500.  Caddies look forward to this day to balance out all the days where they made $0 throughout the summer (often were more caddies than golfers).
    
One year, it was 100+ degrees, sunny and humid.  Each round was 6 hours (golf should take no longer than 4).  This didn't count the hour-lunch break or the couple hours of waiting before.  So, these were 10 hour days.
    
I was assigned a guy I'll call John.  Not very pleasant to be around.  Never a ""thank you"".  No small-talk with other golfers or me.  He didn't play very well.  Despite the nice weather, he had an umbrella, couple dozen golf balls, extra shirts, extra towels, and rain-gear in the bag for me to carry.  I still made no mistakes over the two days and went far above the call of duty.
    
My base rate was $60 for both days combined.  For tipping, the club's system was to match that and then pay more on top (it was stupid and has since changed).  So, the minimum anyone should have made was $120, but most made above $200.  John decided to pay me $100 and write a vague bad evaluation.
    
The caddie master tried to make things right, but he's limited in his powers.
    
Attached to every evaluation is a lunch ticket.  Members fill them out with their number, get charged $5; caddie gets burger, chips &amp; drink.
    
I memorized his number and acquired a stash of blank lunch tickets.  From then on, John bought me lunch whenever I had a bad day.  I gave many away too.  This went on until I stopped caddying.

He would be a dick to girls, make up all kinds of ridiculous stories, talk shit behind your back, and whip off his shirt whenever possible. The kind of guy that would turn off a Xbox when everyone is playing, just because he's losing. Our friend group was  slowly but steadily becoming disillusioned with this guy. And after a particularly extensive display of asshatery, we decided to get back at him.

The moment of inspiration came when my brother was watching an episode of True Life. It was dedicated to people that frequent online chat sites. We thought why not pose as a particularly slutty girl (who shared an extremely similar first name) on a bunch of these online chat lobbies and put up his number soliciting phone sex and sexting. 
We posted it in a number of lobbies that popped up on our Google search. The first hint that is was working was when some guy responded on lobby ""DONT CALL THAT #, SHE SOUNDS LIKE A DUDE!!"" 

Lo and behold the next day he shows up to class looking flustered and annoyed. He immediately starts getting into it about how he's got and still getting ""100's of creepy calls and dick pics from all over the f-ing world."" That golden inner satisfaction kept building and building as he kept ranting. ""I got pics of f-ing big dicks, small dicks, black dicks, asian dicks!! This shit is complete bull!!"" I didn't want to give myself away, but the joy too was fantastic and tangible. Wracking cackles of delicious revenge were had. 

But the capstone moment was after class he gets a call from some of those poor saps. Captain douche puts it on speaker and you hear in a lowww weird sexual voice ""Heyyy is this Douche-a? I'm couldn't stop thinking about calling you after reading your posts... I'm touching myself right now.."" I proceed to fall on the ground laughing in ecstasy as Asshat told him off.

Imagining him getting all those calls and dick pics years ago still makes me crack a smile. I would never do something like that nowadays, but god it felt glorious to get some revenge after years of being subjected to his reign of unholy douche-ary.

1360536144.0,493,self.pettyrevenge,189r6y,Get off my account,579,86,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/189r6y/get_off_my_account/,"My ex girlfriend broke up with me the day before my birthday (about 3 months ago), we were together for over 3.5 years, shared a Verizon account (unlimited text and talk with 6gig data plan) and had just activated our new iPhone 5s (it's relevant), but the account is in my name. 

I thought because she broke up with me, if anything, I would be the bitter one, so I figured we could keep the phone plan as long as we each paid our share. The initial break up was not bad, so it was feasible, however because she is an alcoholic, and started abusing drugs after we broke up, she began acting like I was ruining her life (that’s a story for another time). 

When she started acting like a bitch, I began looking into splitting the account, getting her off mine and having her start her own in her own name. I called Verizon, and they said that all she needed to do was assume liability for her line, no fee for splitting the account. Awesome. I get a hold of my ex, and let her know this information. I call Verizon back after texting my ex, and they say that they can call her and start the process immediately. Perfect, do it.

I call Verizon the next day, they said that they contacted my ex, and the paperwork had been started, all she had to do was call back and it would be over with. She would be off my account and have her own. I was very happy about this because I really wanted to lower the data on my plan, for one month I use a little bit less than 1gig and she eats up about 4.5-5gig. So the sooner she assumes liability for her line, the better. 

I wait a few days before calling Verizon back, they say she hasn't contacted them, and her line is still active on my account. So I text my ex, and ask her what the hold up is, she says that she DID call back, they were supposed to contact her, and they never did, but that she got a text saying that it was taken care of. Ok, fine. 

I call Verizon back later that day and they said yes, they were supposed to call her back, but they didn't. They said that the customer service representative that was dealing with her had put in an application for her to lower the deposit amount for her to start her own line. I guess because her credit is so bad she was initially going to have to pay $400. After the application went through, it was lowered to $125.

From that day on, I call Verizon at least once a week to see if her line is still active on my account. Every time, they say yes. I follow up my calls to Verizon with a text to my ex, politely asking her to call Verizon so we can get this done and over with. She tells me each time that she plans on doing it later that day.

This goes on for about 3 weeks, and I am getting fed up with the bullshit. I call Verizon again, and ask if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. They tell me that all she has to do is pay the $125 and she will be off my account. They suggest suspending the line, because that usually makes the process go faster; scare her into paying and ending this whole ordeal. I decline; I want to give her a chance to pay the deposit without having to do something like that.

I text my ex, ONCE AGAIN, and ask her to PLEASE call Verizon and finish the assumption of liability for her line so she can be taken off my account. To summarize the conversation, she basically told me that if I want her off my account then I can pay the deposit for her; she has no intention on paying the $125. 

I fume for a day or two and try to think of a plan. 

I call Verizon, for the second to last time, and I ask to suspend her line. I guess it is uncommon knowledge that you can suspend a line on your account without billing. The monthly access charge is $40 for each phone on the account. The 6gig data plan is $80. 

What happens is this: I suspend her phone without billing, leaving her line on my account that is attached to her brand new iPhone5. I am no longer being charged for her monthly access, $40 off my bill right there. I lowered my data to 2gig (just in case) and that’s another $30 (or $20) off my bill. Also, once the assumption of liability process starts, you only have 30 days to complete it. After that 30 days, the process starts over, and not only does the deposit go back up to $400, it's harder to lower it the second time around. 

I hang up with Verizon, extremely happy. Not only did I suspend her line, I don't have to pay for her monthly access, AND since the phone number is attached to her brand new iPhone, its not like she can use it anywhere else.

She texts me furiously (using the wifi at the bar she spends all her time at because she doesn't have internet at her house)

[Text One](http://i.imgur.com/HbgF57Q.jpg)

[Text Two](http://i.imgur.com/wvUaDVT.jpg)

[Text Three](http://i.imgur.com/bDB74FL.jpg)

[Text Four](http://i.imgur.com/lGVmbpF.jpg)

So today, for the **last time** I call Verizon, and I verify that I **do not** have to pay for her monthly access. 

So now, instead of just paying the $125 and being able to use her brand new iPhone, she is going to buy a new phone and start a new account because she thinks she is screwing me over. Little does she know that she is actually screwing herself over.

It feels good to win this fucking war.

**tl;dr:** ex tries screwing with my phone bill, suspend her line and let her fuck herself over.

It was a long summer.

I still hate texas to this day, and the story following is just one reason.

I was in Houston on an assignment for a large IT vendor.  I took temporary residence and tried to blend in, because being different in texas only invites constant confrontation.

But as a temporary resident, I did not get texas license plates for my car, which meant that my vehicle and I were constant targets.

At the same time every morning, I drove about 30 mins on the I-610 outerbelt to the project site.  At the time I-610 was in terrible shape because the houston heat had buckled it in numerous places.  The repairs to the road left serious potholes that ran the entire width of the lane, but were too narrow to see clearly as you approached.  Basically, you had to memorize their location if you didn't want to wreck your car.

One day a particularly charming degenerate native observed my out-of-state plates and took it as his duty to tailgate me in his nasty pickup truck, get alongside and swerve at my car to run me out of my lane, and perform other agressive maneuvers to show his lone star superiority.

The first day it happened I figured it was a random asshole, but then he showed up the next day at about the same spot and tried it again.

I revved it and let him follow close behind.  When buckle #1 came up, I swerved at the last minute and enjoyed the crunching thud that ensued as his rustbucket truck ran into it.  I knew where the buckles were, and this local idiot didn't.

He was raging after that and tailgated closer, trying to overtake my car.  I sped up and swerved, and savored the crunching noise that buckle #2 made.

I thought I'd lost him after that but soon looked into the mirror to see him speeding up right behind.  He had a gunrack in the back and I figured he was unbalanced enough to try to squeeze off a shot.  I sped up again, making sure he was doing over 90MPH when i swerved to avoid Buckle #3, which had to be the eastern arm of the Grand Canyon.

His truck hit that and immediately slowed down.  

I never saw this asshole again.

It's not exorbitant, and definitely the cheapest of services a bride pays for, and yet this bridezilla decides to argue and haggle with me over my prices (im not selling veggies at the farmers market here) and accuse me of stealing from her (bitch you want to do it yourself?? Go ahead) because she booked me last minute.

Alone, her shit attitude is bearable. She IS a bride after all. Except she crticizes every single product I use ($1000+ kit here, I ain't using cheap shit) and every thing I put on her face requires a 7 minute mirror inspection complete with bitchy criticism. Except when I offer to do it differently she just huffs and says ""I don't have time to fix every little mistake, just hurry up!""

Bitch you're fucked.

Photoshoot makeup is a fine art, I can fuck up her pictures easily without her realizing how hideous she will look. But that won't be enough because her photographer will probably edit her to look nicer so I need to fuck her up so she will notice.

My trump card? It's an outdoor wedding, and its a super sunny, humid day. Normally I'd waterproof her makeup and apply it carefully so it won't melt. Today? I slapped it on and made sureto use stuff that I know runs very easily (I have non waterproof for those who are allergic or just prefer it).

Her photos will need more editing(stuff I used on her will make her face glow white cause of all the sunscreen in it) and it will barely hold for two hours in that weather.

As far as I'm concerned I don't care if she reviews me badly. I do this for fun and as a favor to friends, it's not my bread and butter. I hope she looked half as melted as I planned her to look. 

Tl;dr: Don't piss off your makeup artist on your wedding day.

(she was having the photos taken before the wedding because of how hot it was outside, she wanted everyone to look their best before the weather wilted their hair and clothes)

Edit: people are taking runny concealer way too seriously. Her photos, if edited more than usual will still turn out fine (if she hired an actual legit service) they will just cost slightly more. Her makeup would hold enough for the 'I do, k thx let's eat' but it inconveniences her by forcing her to check on it every so often. At WORST I created a minor frustration, hence why I'm posting in PETTY revenge. A wedding doesn't explode because your eyeliner moved a bit.

It was quite a trip for me as we live in Atlanta, and I've always been a huge roller coaster fan. We did, however, unfortunately choose to travel during a very busy season. Between my dad's work and school, it was impossible to go when no one would be there, so we prepared ourselves for lines.

Our first day at the park, we worked our way through, never really knowing the details of the roller coaster we were about to get on, but always enjoying them. Some had very long lines, others were quite short. We didn't really know where we were going, but I knew that we wanted to ride Millennium Force on our first day. The ride had opened maybe a year ago, it was on all the roller coaster shows on TV, and I just had to do it. Unfortunately, we got there a little late in the day. The line was quite long, but my dad was very patient, and we waited in line for close to two hours to ride.

As we wind through the queue, my anticipation builds. This monster that I've been looking forward to is getting closer and closer. When we get to within a half hour left in the line, a small group squeezes by my dad and they stop directly in front of us. I guess they didn't want the park employee to see them, so they planned to stop before the end.

I'm seething with anger, and my dad notices. He tells me to be calm. ""Yelling at people is never the answer,"" he tells me. I wanted to yell. I wanted to push them back to where they belonged in the line. My dad simply smiled. We creep to the final queuing building where the line breaks out into separate rows for each row of seats in the roller coaster, my rage building because these people are still in front of us. I'm wondering how my dad could let these people stay in front of us. It's not fair. Then, we see the first park employees that we've seen throughout the line.

My dad gets their attention and calmly explains, ""This group in front of us cut in line."" The employee asks the people around us and they all confirm what happened. The look of joy on the kids faces drops as they are removed from the line, security is called, and they are ejected from the park.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1gafrr,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1gafrr/roller_coaster_revenge/,

This was the opening-night showing and so the theater was **packed**. We got there about an hour or two before the show started. So I decided to take a nap. About half an hour before the movie started, I woke up to see a group of loud, obnoxious college-aged kids come up the stairs by our seats. Their friend had been holding their seats for them. They were pretty loud, but I imagined that they would quieten down before the movie started. Right before the movie started, the theater management came over because they had a few announcements and a small competition. They basically just asked some trivia questions about the Avengers and gave out T-Shirts and the like. The group behind us were loud and obnoxious, shouting out stupid and obviously-wrong answers, and making stupid jokes. Again, I figured that they would shut up once the movie started.

The movie started and they were good for a bit, but then they started making all kinds of stupid comments while the movie was going on. I was starting to get really pissed. I mean, people would clap or whoop when something cool happened on screen, or laugh when something funny was said. That's fine. But these guys were making stupid comments and just ruining the atmosphere. I could see people in the rows below me looking up towards them with irritated expressions on their faces and I could also hear people sighing in exasperation. However, no one did anything. I thought I could ignore them and so I just dealt with it.

Finally the movie got to the scene where Coulson gets killed by Loki. Coulson is sitting there bleeding out while Nick Fury is talking to him. The entire audience is quiet because this is supposed to be a sad scene. Except for the fucks sitting behind me. They start imitating what the characters are saying in mocking tones and making stupid jokes and comments about ""how sad they are"". I finally couldn't take it anymore. I turned around and said/shouted in an extremely loud voice:

**SHUT... UP!**

I heard whoops, clapping, and cheers of support from the surrounding chairs. The obnoxious guys tried to make some half-hearted comebacks. A theater employee walked up the stairs and flashed their lights at the group and I heard some whispering; I think they were telling them to be quiet or they'd be kicked out.

For the rest of the movie, I heard nary a peep from them.

**TL; DR;** Obnoxious moviegoers try to ruin movie by making stupid comments. I yell at them to shut up. Theater management possibly warns them that they might get kicked out.

My little brother is a genius.  He got an Associate's degree from a local CC before finishing up 8th grade.  Basically, he's one smart cookie and everyone knew it.

He's taking his Biology final exam and notices the kid next to him is blatantly looking at his paper, doesn't even try to hide it.  He's not one for letting kids cheat off of him, so he goes and hurries through the rest of the test, purposefully marking the wrong answers for his entire test and watched as the kid gleefully fills up his scantron and dances up to the front and turns in his test.  As class is about to end, my brother takes out his eraser and slowly and obviously takes out an eraser and erases his answers for the entire test, basking in the look of horror of the kids face, and blasts through the rest of the test in the last 15 minutes.

Kid next him: 12%
My brother: 100%

My grandma lived with my parents and my aunt came over every morning to help out and provide her some company. Auntie G would come over around 9:30am every weekday. On most days, she'd encounter dog shit in front of our house and walkway. WTF? The dog owners on my block were conscientious owners and would pick up after their dogs. My parents and aunt were tired of picking up after phantom poops. We figured she let her dog go outside our home because we were one of maybe 4 houses with hedges and plants outside.

My aunt and my mom started watching for the suspect and we realized it was a middle-aged Asian soccer mom/bitch with a huge fluffy gorgeous dog. They'd stalk and watch for the bitch then ran out to confront her. She pretended not to understand my aunt who yelled at her in Chinese. She repeatedly ignored my mom who yelled at her in other dialects of Chinese and in English. She walk off with her nose in the air with her big fluffy dog. She learned to cross the street if she saw that someone was watching from our house and let her dog do its business outside a neighbor's home. We were angry. Our neighbors were angry. 

We eventually just had random neighbors stand outside around 9:30am to make sure she wouldn't let her dog poop. This couldn't go on forever.

My elderly but extremely spry Auntie G got mad enough one day to follow the lady to her home from a safe distance. She stalked the lady to a house 1.5 blocks up the street from our own. (Imagine a tiny 80 year old woman peeking around a hedge to spy on a woman. Because that's what she did, lol.) My mom went out there to confirm fluffy dog bitch lived there. (Imagine a middle aged woman in her car with sunglasses and a newspaper spying on this woman.)

My auntie's revenge: Now that the house was marked, my aunt started collecting fluffy dog's poop in plastic bags for a week. She then went over to fluffy dog bitch's house one afternoon and smeared the festering dog poop all over their sidewalk, their gate, and even their door handle and stuffed in front of their door locks. What? We're just returning the gifts your dog left us.

**TL;DR** Fluffy dog keeps pooping outside our home. Elderly aunt stalks owner and returns pooptastic gifts.

Side note: I would love to say this stopped the lady but no. The dog took a huge shit outside another neighbor's house the very next day. My poor neighbor stepped in the dookie and my mom ran out to tell her who was doing it. The neighbor's very large and buff Hulk-esque son pretty much scraped up the feces, ran up the block, caught the lady and the dog and screamed at her for not curbing her dog then flung the poop at the woman.

No problem with that, the only issue was that every time he would let the dog out, it would find its way into my front yard and proceeded to take a massive shit.

I cleaned it up without saying anything several times, but after the 10th time, I finally decided to let him know.

He promised that he'd be better about it, and each time his promises turned out to be nothing more than lip-service, and the dog kept shitting on my lawn.

After what seemed like the 6th or 7th time I mentioned it to him, I decided I had to make a statement or the problem was never going to go away.

So I grabbed a big trash bag and headed to the dog park.  With elbow-length rubber gloves on, I collected every piece of shit that I could find.

Some wet, some dry, some white from age.  It was absolutely disgusting and I gagged from the aroma.

The next time I saw him drive away, I dragged the bag of shit over and with a rake, proceeded to absolutely cover his front yard in rotting dog shit.  I took great care to make sure I spread it out evenly, even hiding piles under his juniper bushes.

His dog never shit in my yard ever again.

I have no illusions to the contrary.  This story takes you on a few turns and you might feel some sympathy for me as the reader.  Do not be fooled along the way.

It all starts in my urban apartment complex in some random U.S. town.  Our doors are situated in a way that makes us share an outer perimeter door with 5 other apartments.  The six of us share a common area complete with mall boxes and such.   One day a new group of men move into one of the vacant spaces in my section and it was soon afterward we started having issues.  I won’t go into full detail to explain all the bullshit these over privileged scumbags made me endure.  That would be me just trying to justify what comes later in the story.  

Coming home from work one day I notice a full set of keys hanging from the deadbolt to our common area.   This door acts as the first line of defense between the local beggars and hooligans.  To know any of the lowlifes that walk the street had access to my shared common area was enough to make me upset. What sort of mad man would just leave keys in the door like this?  I remove the keys and inspect them.  Car keys, Alarm fob, door keys, mail box key.  The mail box key had the apartment number stamped on them so my first guess as to whom it belonged to was right.  I take the keys to them and get the door rudely slammed in my face as they laugh to each other about the situation.  They didn't even say a word to me.

Flash forward a week or so, and it happens again.  This time I take pictures of the keys and send them a ransom note demanding $200 into a PayPal account or they will never get their keys back.  I left the note on their car that I was able to find with the alarm fob.   A few days go by and I don’t hear anything from the contact email I put with the letter, so I cut off a chuck of one of the keys and mail it to them to remind them of my demands.  In the end they paid the money and I donated it to Child's Play.

The reason I am posting this is because I was essentially the instrument of his revenge. 


Nearby from my house was a place called CyberJocks that was, essentially, a large gaming zone that did regular LAN and all night tournaments (great place, shame it shut down). You can all imagine that along with attracting lots of awesome people that it also attracted a lot of younger, more profane little snots. Kev frequented this place more than I did and regularly put up with these little shits screaming racist and sexist remarks over the headphones during CS. So, he hatched a plan of what he deemed approrpriate justice and this is where I came in. 


Being a shut in most of the time, I spent my hours after school playing games while letting my mind wander. One of my favorites to play for hours and hours was Super Smash Bros Melee. Kev told me they would be hosting an all night LAN with a Smash tournament and prodded me to attend. Even with my dislike of venturing into society, I figured I'd be ok so I agreed and we played every day for about a month. 


The night arrives and I find out I am the only female in attendance, something that is both humorous and disconcerting. We play some CounterStrike first, Kev bitching because I continuously peg him with the noob cannon (his term for the shotgun) and then the Smash tournament begins. 


Needless to say...I have never heard so many men/boys whining in profanity laden tirades. I bulldozed through them intermittedly using Fox and Peach with Kev doing a jovial little Mephistopheles jig behind me. It comes down to me, the current champ and the guy who claims to be better with him. Champ goes down in silence and the guy who was better, using Samus, actually threw the controller and got kicked out. 


When it was all over, Kev was practically coated in a perverse satisfaction at seeing all those little twats that had been, mere moments ago, laughing at me and telling me to get back in the kitchen, sulking silently. To add insult to injury, I managed to stamp most of them out in CounterStrike. He told me later about it all and we laughed it off, especially finding out the ""guy who was better"" had actually been the NY champ at one point.

...and now we arrive at James, the over-privileged, jock with the biggest ego (next to mine) in the class. James was likely a B or C student, very capable and rather smart, but very lazy which is why he wasn't near the top of our class. Anyway, James sat directly to my right and was getting B's on all of our quizzes until one day when he realized I was getting A's on all of them...this didn't sit well with him.

It only took one test for me to catch on that he was copying my answers because he bragged about how he scored the same as I did and I noticed that every answer was the same...I was a stupid, egotistical kid and would race through tests to get done first and I recalled last week that James had finished slightly behind me and how I chuckled to myself thinking he probably just guessed on everything because. Everything clicked when I saw our answers were all identical all multiple choice and the last question was always a bonus question of ""what was your favorite thing you learned this week"" and even that was the same...so I started devising my plan:

On Friday, just before our tests came I told James that even if he can also get 100%, he couldn't possibly beat me on speed. He took the bait and when our test came I purposefully answered each question wrong by putting the letter before the correct answer (A instead of B, C instead of D...etc) and then put down my answer for the bonus and got up...James sprints ahead of me and practically dives to turn in his paper. My heart leapt with joy and I just sit back to my desk to change all my answers back.

James scoffed at me and pointed out that I was stupid for forgetting my name or something on his way back to his desk. On Monday we get our scores back and he's shocked...0% but he got the bonus question correct. His jaw dropped even more when he saw that I got 100%. I then rubbed salt in the wound with a ""Huh, guess I wasn't the stupid one after all...probably shouldn't copy off me next time"".

At this point James should've called it quits and just went back to his B's but he was almost as stubborn as I was...he was smart enough to figure out how I altered my answers but not smart enough to realize that he was outmatched...and so came Friday

This time I started off for the first 4 questions with the same pattern and then answered them all correctly for the last 16. I wait for James to get it and start furiously erasing all my answers and adjusting the first 4, and putting the same ones down for the last 16...James notices this (as was his plan) and he runs back and adjusts all of his answers as well...Monday comes and I was tell that he's seething with excitement, ready to rub in my face that I was outsmarted. He got a 25% and I got my 100% again.

...this went on for 3 more weeks until he finally caved. The 5th week I was especially devilish and wrote all my characters as they would appear on a calculator (boxy)...then I let James see them outright, and on my way up, I added and erased lines to turn a few D's into C's and D's into B's...etc

His parents ended up getting a call as the teacher was concerned that something might be wrong at home...he was forced to explain this to his parents, who then called my parents and while I ended up getting scolded by my mom, I was taken out for ice-cream with my dad as a celebration of my wit.

TL;DR
Tricked a kid into writing down the wrong answers to a test after I figured out he was cheating off me. Then played off his ego/stubbornness resulting in 4 failed tests. Received icecream/praise from my dad when he found out.


EDIT: a few people have asked me why my mom scolded me...the short answer is that she felt the proper action would have been to just covered up my answers instead of being a devilish fiend. The long answer involves her taking christian values into skewed directions...she's lightened up an extreme amount since then.

I was second in line behind this completely redneck looking guy wearing a white (and dirty) muscle shirt and he looked like he just got off some dirty job just prior to getting there.

There were 3 guys behind me in line as well. Then all of a sudden a family walks in. There is two parents, a teenage girl, and a younger girl. All of the females are wearing hijabs (head scarfs).

Instead of getting into the roped off line, they walk directly to the front beside the redneck looking guy ahead of me and proceeded to wait there. Finally the next window opens and they go directly to it. The redneck guy says ""excuse me, there is a line"" and they ignore him. 

He walks up beside them to the counter and says, ""excuse me, you just skipped ahead of all of these people in line"". 

Immediately the father denies skipping in line. The registries employee asks if that is true to the rest of us standing in line. We all agree with the redneck looking guys version of events. The woman tells the family to go to the back of the line. 

At that moment the woman starts yelling that this was racist. She started to say they were getting picked on because they were Muslim and middle-eastern. The husband demanded to speak to a manager, and one was already there watching the whole thing and stepped up.

The guy demanded that they be taken care of before he calls the police for hate crimes on the redneck looking guy and the employee. 

The manager says she will take care of them personally and asks them to have a seat so she can go grab the forms they'll need. They sit down and the line continues moving. The family looks at everyone in line like they just won. The people in line don't give a shit. 

As soon as everyone who was there prior to that family was served she re-appeared and said she was too busy to help them but they could get back in the line which was now empty.

I got to see his face before I walked out and this guy clearly looked defeated. He knew what just happened and now there was nothing he could do about it.

Context for the story: one of my friends is vietnamese, so from hanging around her family I know a little bit of vietnamese. 

As soon as I sat down, I handed Tammy the nail polish I wanted, asked her to cut down my nails and file them in a round shape. She starts going to work on my hands. I look down and see that my nails are a square shape... so I politely remind her I asked for my nails to be round. She nods her head and continues working. She has done nothing to change the nail shape. I pull back my hands and say ""can you please round out my nails?"" She looks at me as if I had just accused her of performing back alley abortions. She takes my hands back, and she begins muttering under her breath, this is basically what I understood: ""then you should have asked for that before I started."" Tammy then laughs and begins obviously talking shit on me to the other ladies working in the salon.

She's a largely unpleasant person, always complaining and double-standards etc etc, generally someone who belongs in badroommates. My solution? When she's been particularly annoying, and -especially- if I know someone's round. I'll make a point of going to the bathroom -frequently-, just to make her have to pause and stop fucking so I don't hear.


My other housemate took the cake though. She -really- pissed him off, so that night he went down, knocked -loudly- on  her door and said ""Hey [painintheass] I'm going to the toilet, you're not in the middle of anything I might interrupt right?"" and went to the loo.

Naming the entire house as a facebook business as her 'shagpad'


Putting up with her trying to hit on the gay and female among us when drunk because she -is- that desperate.


Having sex in public places. The kitchen, shower, sofas, stairs etc. (It's the location, not the act, that's the problem)


Having her go off on rants about the state of the kitchen when over half the dirty crockery is hers and hasn't been washed in days.


Constantly bitch about each of us to everyone else behind our backs


Fill the fridge and freezer with her stuff (we're talking a -months- worth of food into space that has to be shared between seven)


Leave passive-aggressive messages about how we all really need to clean up more


Generally refuse to contribute towards communal stuff. She blocked the toilet and works at B&amp;Q, we asked her to buy a plunger when she was already on shift, and we'd split the cost. She let us know they are available for about £5, came home,and went away for the weekend leaving us to deal with her fatty shits (she's on Atkins or something)


etcetera, etcetera. Two other room-mates have loud, frequent sex. We don't care, stop trying to make me out to be some puritan.

Since it was an ice cream cake and I don't have big fridge to keep the full size cake, I told them to keep it in their shop and I will pick it just before the cake cutting. 

When everyone gathered and we were ready for cake cutting, I have asked my friend to pick-up the cake as I was with my kid and guests. Apparently, the cake maker messed up the size and decorated a half sheet cake instead of a full sheet cake. I was shocked to see such a small size cake and called them and they argued that it was a full sheet cake. 

I wasn't ready to argue as the kids and guests were waiting for cake cutting, so I had my kid cut the ice cream cake and distributed the ice cream cake to kids and bought another full sheet regular cake from a near-by shop to serve the adults.

Next day, I went to the shop with the cake box (empty) to prove that they gave half-sheet instead of full-sheet. They realized the mistake and asked me to talk to the owner (these are franchisee). Owner was a rude Asian lady and didn't bother to apologize or anything. She said that she will give a small cake to compensate the difference between the half-sheet and the full-sheet. Since we ate the cake, I didn't want 100% refund, I was reasonable and asked only 50% of what I have paid (55$ of 110$ I have paid in advance). 

She said that I am stinky and trying to make use of their mistake. I have clearly repeated that I am just asking 50% refund. That lady didn't even bother to listen to me. I told her to keep everything and I walked away. Later I told this to my friend and he suggested to dispute the transaction in my Credit card. I did the same and Amex refunded 110$ back to me on the next day. 

PS: I have donated 55$ to charity promptly.

Xpost from /talesfromthepizzaguy,630,156,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1f376i/so_you_dont_tip_but_your_a_regular_are_you_xpost/,"The folks over at talesfromthepizzaguy thought you /pettyrevengers might like this story. So here goes.

Waaay back in the day i delivered for this place that stayed open till 4am. Working till 4am can be tiring but drunk tips are some of the best tips, especially in a college town so its worth it.

The place i worked at had a deal on Mondays for a large 1 topping pizza with a large drink. It came to $7.16 out the door. We would make bank on Mondays, the high volume made up for the low dollar amount of orders. On Mondays its best to try and bunch things together to maximize your time to $$ ratio. I'd do whatever i could to make sure i was getting paid. I'd check the addresses of the upcoming orders and try and time things to get orders i knew were to good tippers, drive faster or slower to avoid something that would take me out of the way or have me going to a known bad tipper.

Well one Monday i couldn't avoid this order. This was from a regular that lived on the very farthest edge of our delivery area in a seedy part of town and never ever tipped. Ever. Not even the change. He'd ask for all his money back down to the penny every time. And the dude had money, he'd always answer the door in some expensive track suit too. Well i got his order along with a couple on the way to take the sting out of things. This was in the middle of rush, so by the time i would get back to the shop, the orders would have come and gone,so not only am i going to not be tipped, I'm going to lose out on a lot more money just making this order. This greatly upset me. All the drivers were sick of this clown and his penny pinching ways! So i decided to get some revenge.
Did i mention its late fall, early winter? Did i also mention this takes place in Michigan? No? Well both of these are true.

So i drop off my other 2 orders and Mr.Regular is last of course. I take his pie and wedge it up under the passenger side windshield wiper and start my trip to his house in the ass end of nowhere. I pull it about a mile from his house and its ice cold. Now there's no way he's going to accept this super icy ice cold box. Being the quick thinker that i am i put the pie on passenger side floor and blast the floor heat. It should be noted that the heater in a 87 Honda Civic should have a setting called blast furnace. I get to his house, and the box is piping hot and the pizza is ice cold. Head up to the door, everything is normal, he demands his exact change. I look him in the eye and say, ""Thanks man. Much appreciated."". On the surface I'm thanking him for the business but we both understood i was thanking him for nothing.

Well by the time i get back to the shop, he's called in and actually got to speak to the owner. He was livid that it was so cold! I could actually hear him a few feet away from the phone receiver. So the owner asks me, ""Snowreaper, whats up with this guy? Says his pizza is cold."" I told the owner, ""You know what? Fuck that guy. He lives on the edge of our delivery area and he never tips. Not ever. And he didn't tip when i went out there, so he should be happy he's getting a $7 pizza."" Another driver piped up and backed me up saying he hated delivering to that guy and never got tipped ever. The owner, bless that man, chewed out Mr. Cold Pizza! ""YOU NEVER TIP MY DRIVERS AND YOU COMPLAIN?!?! YOUR LUCKY WE STILL DELIVER TO YOU! IF YOU ORDER AGAIN AND I HEAR YOU DIDN'T TIP YOUR BLACKLISTED!!!"" and with that he hung up on him. Took the guy a few weeks to work up the courage to order again, but by god, he tipped a buck and the change from then on.

*edit* put some spaces in so its not so horrible, but not as many as SEGirl did since she's already done it.

*edit#2* I see a lot of comments about tipping delivery drivers. Allow me to provide a singular reason to tip your delivery driver. You see, the word tip isn't just a word, its also an acronym. T.I.P = To Insure Promptness.
Feel free not to tip, your delivery will not be prompt, and in this case it will be ice cold. :)",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1369901678.0,,,True,t3_1f376i,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1f376i/so_you_dont_tip_but_your_a_regular_are_you_xpost/,

The best part, which I only realized after we got the date from the city marriage office, was that the date we were given was my ex's birthday. All our mutual friends came to our wedding, so her birthday party was probably deserted.

We had about a 45 minute wait so I informed them as I took their name. The woman whose name I took, Catherine, was pissy she had to wait so long but waited anyway.

A little while has passed and I continued to call names and seat people as tables were available. After calling a couple who had been waiting outside, Catherine came up and started flipping the fuck out. I'm horrible with names but I remembered this pissy bitch.

Before I continue: my wait list was a full page. I had the first quarter crossed out and the rest untouched. You could look at the list and clearly see that I was calling people in the correct order. 

So I asked her what the problem was, she told me (still yelling) that they had come in after her and that she was waiting over an hour when I said it'd be thirty minutes. I asked her what her name was, and she angrily said ""Catherine."" I then asked how many people (irrelevant) and she angrily replied , ""two."" I took as long as I could to find her name (even looked at the second page of names I had, though I knew she was on the first). 

I sweetly said, ""oh! Here you are!"" and showed her my list. What Catherine didn't realize is that I wrote down the time she walked in the door and the amount of time I quoted her. So I said, again sweetly, ""hmmm...no I said it'd be about 45 minutes and I said that at 5:15, it's 5:32 now so you still have about 25-30 minutes left. Sorry for the confusion!"" 

She huffed, walked away, and didn't bother me again after that :)

While my job responsibilities are primarily infrastructure and server maintenance, I will assist with lower level tickets when the help desk is overloaded.  Not because I have to, but because I want the department to look good and to help out my coworkers.  

So one day, I picked up an older ticket that was stagnating in the queue.  I thought the delay in resolution was due to a difficult issue, but instead it was due to a difficult user.  The whole time I'm fixing her problem, she's complaining about how our department is so slow and that we are all incompetent.  She is inches from my ear saying this, but I do my best to ignore her and just focus on her screen.  She doesn't take kindly to being ignored, so she ups the volume and specks of spittle start to fly past my face.  People in nearby cubes are looking at me, although most seemed to be sympathetic as they were accustomed to this lady's behavior.  I later find out this is why the help desk is reluctant to assist her, though the tickets have target dates and we look bad when they are not met.

I fix her computer and leave slightly damper than when I arrived.  Back at my desk, I think of what I can do to avenge myself and my compatriots.  I want to mess with her somehow, but not in a way that would cause a lot more work for the IT department.  In the end, I settled on a three-pronged revenge:

1) Looked up her favorites and added all non-work related sites to the blocked list on our filter.  When she asked for me to unblock some, I said that sadly they were blocked for the entire company and there is nothing I could do.  Then I went ahead and gave override privileges to people I liked.
2) I'm one of the last to leave the office, so every now and then I will power off her computer by holding the button down.  I do it locally to ensure no logs are left of the shutdown.  This makes it so that she has to power her machine up the next morning, having to wait 5+ minutes before she can clock in for the day.  I take great pleasure in knowing I am denying her several cents each time (once every ~3 weeks.)  I would do it more often, but then we'd have to replace the computer and I wouldn't be able to blame it on ""power spikes.""
3) The final piece involves changing her password once every month or two to something completely random.  I then tell her I reset it to something like Password8, whereas I really make it Password*.  She'll type it a bunch of times unsuccessfully, after which I ask her to step aside.  I then proceed to type it slowly so she can see my fingers, but she never sees me hold shift down for the last character.  The end goal of this is to convince her that she's either really bad at typing, or that she's slowly going insane.

I worked for a few years as a sales associate at a clothing/skateboarding store. One day three young girls (maybe 12 years old) came running and yelling into the warehouse sized store, split up and hid behind different racks of clothing, in amongst the hanging clothes.

Less than a minute later another girl came in the store and asked if we had seen some girls come in. At first we thought they were just playing hide and seek or something but it became clear that these three girls were bullying their ""friend"" and were hiding from her for that reason. This poor girl was not dressed as nicely as the others nor was she as skinny.

She was also the only one who wasn't white.
My south-asian co-worker got really upset after seeing this all go down and turned to me and said ""watch this"".

While the girl was looking around for her friends it took everything I had not to just tell her where they were, but I wanted to see what my co-worker would do.
He disappeared into the back room and came out with our manager following him. He then pointed at where one of the girls was hiding, then walked back to me.
SIDE NOTE: This girl had decided to hide directly infront of an air conditioner vent that constantly became stuck in place, and needed a good punch (which neither he or I could deliver) in order to open the large slats up.
My co-worker told my manager (and 5""11, 225lb weightlifter) that he had tried to get it open earlier in the day and couldn't.

I watched as my manager ignored the clothes in front of the vent and threw his fist into the wall as hard as he could. He wasn't expecting the clothes to start screaming. Nor did he expect a little girl with a very bloody nose to step out from behind the wall of shirts.

My co-worker watched smugly as my manager offered apology upon apology to the girl, who simply ran out of the store crying, followed by the group of girls. We never heard from them again.

When my manager turned furiously to me and my co-worker we both played as innocently as we could and somehow managed to convince him that we had no idea there was anybody behind the shirts.

Meekly, two people look out the window. I see them and shout out something along the lines of 'WTF are you doing throwing shit out the window?' They start calling me names, and berrating and laughing at me, etc, and close the window. What they assume, is that I don't live in that building.

Every weekend, when the bar closed everyone who had been drinking would stumble their way down the street to the pizza shop for some late night drunken-munchies. It can get quite loud between the 'woo-girls' and the drunk jock's but I usually slept through it fine. The stairwell to get up to my apartment (the only one up there) was next to the pizza shop entrance and had a big 'privet property' sign on it. Usually I kept that door locked, but I'd had friends over earlier in the evening and when they left they must have forgotten to lock it. 

A few hours after I'd gone to sleep, I wake up hearing yelling and laughing in my stairwell. It takes me a moment to come to, but then I realize that drunk people are sitting in my stairwell eating pizza and being loud. It didn't really bother me they were in there...but then I smelled cigarette smoke. I don't smoke, and it pissed me off my apartment would smell. Also...they woke me up. Not cool. 

I got up without turning on any lights, and peeked through the crack of the curtain on the door. I could see two of them sitting against my door on the doorsil, and three more sitting on stairs right below them. The apartment was pretty old and crappy (=cheap!! I didn't care) so the door itself had about an inch and a half of clearance from the doorsil at the bottom...

THE REVENGE
I quickly and quietly grabbed my mop bucket, and a dustpan. I wedged the dustpan under the door, so I could pour water on it, and it would direct it out and under the door without getting all over my floor. Then I used the mop bucket (filled in the tub) to unleash a torrent of water from under the door. As I heard screams and curses, I flipped on the lights and swung open the door and started yelling ""get the fuck out of my apartment!!"". The two that were sitting on my doorsil were SOAKED all down the backs of their jeans...the ones sitting below them didn't get it quite as bad, but was still pretty good. Once I got a look at them, they were no more than 16-17. Scared the everloving-snot out of them, but they shouldn't have bothered me. 

Oh yeah...did I mention it was January, and this is eastern Canada? They were in for a chilly walk home. 

tl;dr Stupid kids wake me up by being loud and smoking in the stairwell of my apartment. I pour water under my door without warning and totally soak them, scaring the crap out of them by yelling. It's the middle of winter and totally cold, I hope they froze.

This is a townhome complex with shared parking spaces.  My home is at the end with the 'overflow' parking, which leaves me many spaces to choose from.  With the lot in this area being so empty, it is an optimal place to play street hockey and set up a net.  Perfectly acceptable, I loved doing these things when I was a kid, but be respectful of other people's homes and cars.

My girlfriend was tired of walking out every morning to hockey sticks and the net behind her car each morning leaving for work.  Also, their gear (skates, gloves, pucks) would be in our yard.  After asking the kids to pick up after themselves to no avail, I spoke with the parents.  ""The parking lot is my kid's backyard, as far as I'm concerned,"" was the Father's response to my bringing it to his attention.  

Instead of reporting to the HOA, I decided PettyRevenge was more my liking.  Late one night, after they left their equipment out again behind her car, I picked up their skateboard ramps, gloves, balls, pucks and net and placed them in my shed.  I then took them to the landfill the next morning.  The hockey sticks and skates needed to send another message.  I took note of the car the Father drove and noticed he always backed in.  Given the time he left in the morning was still dark outside, I placed the hockey sticks and skates in front of his tires, out of sight.  The next morning after I did this part, I noticed the sticks were not there (He did run over them, as splinters and plastic were on the pavement) nor the skates.  

Whether it was a lesson to the Father or the kids (or both) is not my concern.  They were out money and materials.

They were at the end of the day, and we made sure to go early and stand as close to the stage as possible to get a good view of the band. 

As it gets closer to the starting time, more and more people begin to crowd in and it gets packed. Suddenly this girl, which I will call Entitled Bitch (EB) from now on, cuts in front of me with her friend and blocks half my view. I was annoyed, but it was no big deal. I could still see the stage relatively well. 

After a few minutes, a group of very tall people end up in front us, and I couldn’t see anything from where I was standing. Since there was some space beside EB, I tapped her shoulder and asked if she could move just a little so that I could still see (I made sure to note that her view of the stage would still be obstructed even if she did move). The interaction went something like this:



&gt;Me: Excuse me, could you move just a little bit, I-
&gt;
&gt;EB: No! I don’t fucking care!
&gt;
&gt;Me: If you move just a little, you could still see the stage and I would be able to see as well. Plus, you cut in front of us and we didn’t say anything.
&gt;
&gt;EB: Fuck no, deal with it. I got here first!



By this time, I was very much ticked off. If she politely declined, I would have just backed off and dealt with watching the screen instead of the stage. But her being A-entitled, B-rude and C-inconsiderate, I wouldn’t have it. 

Eventually, I was able to get into a spot right next to her, which I assume pissed her off, because she started leaning into me and putting all of her weight onto me to try to get me to fall. I stumbled, and responded with an elbow to her stomach (Sorry guys, I’ve always had trouble with responding to bad behavior with good ones).Of course, this turned into her playing victim to the crowd around her, but I just ignored her and turned around to watch the show (and she didn't dare try the same thing again). 

But it gets better!

Eventually, some people in front of us moved and EB was quick to move in and take the spot, giving me a quick smug look before turning back to watch the show. I moved up behind her, making sure that she couldn’t get out of that spot.

Why? Because there was a tall girl standing right in front of her, which is probably why the people moved in the first place.

Ok so this is something I do frequently, but I will tell you how it started.

My grandmother lives in a farily big apartment complex, with parking spaces right in front of the building. I go there to have lunch with her once a week. Three of this spaces used to be reserved for visitors but about a 6 months ago they changed into spaces for an eye shop, so I didn't park there anymore. But about a month later I noticed that the spaces were always empty. So I thought I can still park there no one would mind.

I did this for maybe 4 weeks, as I was pulling up to the parking spaces the next week there was a car parked right across all three of the spaces. I thought what an idiot, parked my car elsewhere and went inside. I told my grandmother about the car and she said that it belonged to one of the eye shop employees and that she did this on purpose so I wouldn't park there anymore.

Now I would understand if she came to talk to me or something like that, if I blocked the spaces and costumers of the eye shop had to park elsewhere. But that was not the case they were always empty, and even if it was, when she parks her car across all the spaces the costumers couldn't park there too.

**My Revenge:** I made a flyer for courses on how to park your car for driving rookies and free theory lessons on what a parking space is and how to use it. I thought it was hilarious. I put it under her windscreenwiper and she never parked there again. I was so proud with myself that I printed out a whole bunch of it and put them on badly parked cars I see everywhere.

And it makes me laugh everytime.

Big turn outs at my local theater. So much so that for each showing of Iron Man 3 there was a line outside of the theater designated for the order of entrance, because they couldn't have the lines inside the theater probably because of how many people there were and the confusion it would cause. Me and my girlfriend decided it was worth the 45 minute wait outside to be basically first in a line to get the best seats. 

Well the 45 minutes pass and a couple about the same age as us cuts in front of some people in front of us as they let the line go inside the theater to grab some seats. No way. Fuck you. We still sit exactly where we want, upper theater in the very middle, but these two assholes sit right in front of us. Well I let 10 minutes pass and I go find the theater manager and say, ""Hello. Sorry to interrupt but I've been looking for you for ten minutes now. These people cut in line and as a result have taken away good seats from people who waited."" Being the cool guy he was, he comes with me and I point them out. They are then ordered to either leave the theater or wait until everyone else is seated before they can sit again. Well they must have decided to just stay because they sat in the very first row all the way to the right. 

Haha. Fuck you two. 

Edit: To add some important context I missed. Yes cutting the line annoyed me, but I could have sucked it up. As we sat there, I listened to them laugh at people how they couldn't find seats.

Best friend to the rescue!,529,60,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/12qi26/hit_by_a_car_best_friend_to_the_rescue/,"I used to work at a grocery store during my teenage years as a cashier, stock boy, cart pusher... pretty much whatever they asked me to.  This grocery store was surrounded on three sides (all but the street, obviously) by an old folks home.  Most of the time, the people from the home walked to the grocery store, not because they really needed anything, but because they wanted exercise, something to do, and generally just socialize.  This was generally pretty convenient, because I usually LOVE talking to older folks.  With the exception of loose 20 something females, they're my favorite people.  I even thought like this during my angst-filled teenage years.

Now, I've read several posts on here of the horrors people encounter as a cashier.  While I can relate, I generally have a pretty high tolerance for other people's bullshit (for better or worse).  So, an older woman that I recognized came to my line with a bunch of empty bottles that she wanted to return for the 5 cent deposit.  Now, we have a bottle room with machines for that.  It wasn't my job to redeem bottles at the register, but I knew how to, and I felt like being nice.  So I scanned each bottle/can (5 cents each, with a grand total of $1.25 or so... that's a lot of bottles), but two of them did not scan (because we do not sell that brand out our store).  When I explained this to her, she went FUCKING CRAZY.  She threw a glass bottle across the store and stormed out.  This was over 10 cents.  Jesus.

Anyway, my manager had me close my line, and explain to him in the office what happened... no problem.  Once I was done, they had me go outside and push carts for a bit with my best friend, Kevin.  Now, Kevin is not a normal kid.  He's built like a brick shit-house, he's allergic to everything, and has a high-functioning case of asbergers syndrome.  He has a heart of gold, though, and is one of the best people I've ever met.  He also lives RIGHT next to the old folk's home, and walks through there every night to get home.

So, we were gathering a line of carts (about 15 or so), and a car backs up out of their spot (obviously not looking) and pins me between the line of carts and their buick.  Not HARD.  I didn't suffer any injuries, but it still really pissed me off.  I knocked on the trunk so they knew ""hey, maybe i should release this poor 16 year old kid.""  That's exactly what happened, until they backed up AGAIN, doing the same exact thing.

My best friend, Kevin, went to the drivers side window of the car and said ""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, YOU FUCKING CUNT?!""  There was no answer.  I guess this person isn't used to being called a ""fucking cunt"" on a daily basis.  I got out of the way, and went inside to tell my manager what had happened.  By the time we got back, the car had driven off, apparently like a bat out of hell.

I thought this was the end.  Nope.  Kevin got off of work an hour before me, and asked me to come over.  I knew the shortcut through the old folk's home, and walked over there.  After playing goldeneye (yeah, those were the days) for about an hour he said ""I want to show you something.""  He brought me to the old folk's home, and showed me the same car that hit me.  Turns out it was the SAME woman that flipped a shit at me earlier that day over 10 cents.  What was special?  Kevin seriously took a MASSIVE dump on the hood of the car, picked it up, and smeared into the windshield ""DIE CUNT.""

1364607831.0,465,self.pettyrevenge,1ba2ub,I just withdrew from a class to avoid failing an assignment tomorrow morning that four other people are counting on me finishing. [X-post from /r/confession],615,150,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ba2ub/i_just_withdrew_from_a_class_to_avoid_failing_an/,"I had a lab assignment due at the end of class tomorrow, and I'm supposed to be working on this assignment with a group of four other people. It was assigned two weeks ago, and being a biweekly class, we've had five days, including tomorrow, to work on it. The assignment consisted of shooting a video and measuring things in the video, blah blah. I'm trying to be vague in case any of them are on reddit.
Anyway, I shot the video, I analyzed the video with the software, I printed the graphs we needed, I typed the introduction and the theory/discussion (five pages total), I found the references, I did everything except draw the sketch of the experimental procedure, answer two discussion questions, caption the graphs, and fucking make a title page. I did the most crucial parts of this mother fucker. And I spent more time than I wanted to spend working on this piece of shit over spring break just because my grade in the class is suffering and I needed to make a decent grade on this to make a decent grade in the class.
Problem is, no one else in my group did anything the entire time. One dude helped me set up the tripod to take the video, but they've basically just written down everything that I've written down. And there are still plenty of things to do for the report - the things I did would only equal to about 60% of the project, so I still needed them to help too, you know, being a group project and all. We all sat down, and they all talked about going to the fucking beach for spring break, which, fine, whatever, but at least use the class period to work on the project. But no, every time I walk behind her computer she's on Facebook. The other two are talking about how they want to get into Vanderbilt (no, seriously). I don't say anything, I'm being polite, and I just give them the benefit of the doubt and leave for break and maybe they'll have something, even if it is only a vague inclination of what the hell we're supposed to be doing. I mean, it's their grade, too. They need this class, too. So hopefully they'll help me out with our project.
So I come to class on Tuesday after break with all my shit, and no one else has anything fucking done. I should add that everyone in my group is around 18 and I am going to be 24 this year (I fucked around a lot in my late teens, so college was a couple of years late) and no one else is concerned at all about having approximately zero of our required 11 pages completed one day before the shit is due. So I sat at the computer in lab for an hour and 45 minutes trying to plot and calculate the acceleration of an object in a fuzzy video clip and make a graph of the motherfucker, and my lab group sat behind me and talked about old Nickelodeon cartoons for the entire class. Seriously. Other groups were telling my group to shut their shit because they were trying to work.
I tried emailing my professor about it since yesterday morning, but he hasn't replied yet. I talked about it with another person who used to be in a lab group with some members of my lab group (we are reassigned lab groups before every new project), and he said he has brought up their lack of work and input on their last project before to our professor, and he basically told him that as long as it was getting done, it didn't matter who did what.
I was scrambling tonight trying to fucking finish everything that no one else had touched, but after about two hours, I decided I just don't give a fuck anymore. None of them have answered my emails from the past two days. I guess they assume that I'm going to finish the report because I've already done most of it. But they're in for a nice fucking surprise.
I logged into my student account online and dropped the fuck out of that class. This was the final week to withdraw, and I did, and tomorrow morning when they come in, I'm going to be a fucking sleep, and they're going to have approximately none of the assignment finished. Even if they start from scratch tomorrow and really pound it, they still won't have time to finish. None of them have shit done because they expected me to do it, and I just decided that I don't care anymore. That may have been a shit thing to do, but keep in mind that I was prepared to turn in everything that I had done if they had only replied to my emails and drawn a goddamn picture of our experimental set-up. So, fuck it. Fuck them. Fuck that class. I don't want to be a doormat anymore.
Anyway, thanks for listening.

1) There are a lot of pets at my house. 4 chickens, 3 cats, 2 dogs and a snake. One of the cats is my husband's and the chickens are my mum's but the other pets are mine.

2) My husband and I live with my mum and maternal grandmother. My grandmother has dementia so she needs a full time carer, which is what I do while my husband and mum work full time.

3) My sister in law had her first kid in October 2012

4) My husband and I are childfree, which means we never want kids, biological or adopted. My husband likes kids and is great with them, just doesn't want them while I don't like them at all, plus I'm terrified of pregnancy to the point of it being a phobia.

Anyway, I got my pet snake in July last year, which my SiL thinks is crazy. When I told her about him, she was asking things like ""What if it bites you? The venom will kill you!"" To which I replied ""He's a python. They aren't venomous."" Then she said ""It'll strangle you and eat you!"" So I told her ""No he won't. He'll grow to 1.4 metres max, and for his species that's rare."" But she just kept harping on stuff like that so I changed the subject.

Few months later, in October, she had her first kid. My husband and I went to visit her and the bub when they were out of hospital and I also told her that we were in the process of adopting a 2nd dog when we moved back to my mum's place. I was excited to share my news since I love dogs and hadn't been able to live with one for 6 years while we lived in an apartment building. My dog from before I moved out of home had been living with my mum all that time. My SiL just looks at me with a disapproving expression and says ""Two new pets in 12 months? Why would you want another pet but no kids? What's wrong with you?"" 

Needless to say, I was angry, but I kept my cool. I just excused myself and went outside for a cigarette. Her husband came outside with me and apologised for her explaining she was stressed about their kid, but it still stung. I find it hard to muster up enthusiasm for people when they tell me they're pregnant cos I don't understand the appeal, but I act like I am and turn the brain to mouth filter up to 11 so I don't offend.

So anyway, 8 months go by, I've had my awesome dog since November, her baby is a dream kid that hardly cries, she's doing a great job as a mum and everything is good. We go to visit her, her husband and the kid a few weeks ago. After we give her a hug goodbye she says ""Guess what? You were just hugging two!"" She's pregnant again. I just couldn't help myself and said ""Pregnant twice in 12 months? Why would you want another kid? What's wrong with you?""

Brain to mouth filter malfunction? Yep. Super bitchy? Yep. Unimpressed SiL? Oh yeah. Smirk on our husbands' faces? Totally worth it.

Guy: You assholes didn't put cheese on this! It comes with cheese and the dumbass who made it didn't put it on!
He said this with that air of self-righteous indignation of someone who has long suffered an injustice and is watching it finally put to rights. It was intense.

Boss: No cheese? Sorry sir, let me fix that for you.
My boss took the top of the sandwich off and there it was, the cheese. The guy hadn't even bothered to look at it before coming in. The guy's reaction was priceless. His whole face fell and he went from righteous indignation to ""Holy crap, I'm a moron"". He started to mumble something and reached for his sandwich, but my boss stopped him.

Boss: It's okay sir, the cheese is kind of small. We'll make you another one and put some extra cheese on it. I'll go back and make it myself.And he did. You could see the prep area from the register area, and my boss made a big show of putting on 2 or 3 extra slices of cheese.

He wrapped it up and brought it over and gave it to the guy. The guy took it and muttered his thanks, not looking up once. He practically fled the store and my boss turned back to me with a huge grin.

I guess we'll see. 

One weekday morning, I hopped on the turnpike to head into work. I wasn't in the best of moods but this changed pretty quickly. This particular day, the traffic was more or less bumper to bumper(which is very rare, thankfully), when I noticed a lady in my rear view who was crisscrossing between lanes like an aggro idiot. For some reason, this really annoyed me.  

I was in the middle lane while she was in the left lane and it came a point where cars in front of her started to resume driving while she was stopped looking at her phone or what-have-you. With 5 or 6 car lengths between her and the car in front of her, I decide to switch into the left lane. She took offense to that for some reason so she did what every asshole tries to do; Speed up really fast to make it look like they're about to ram the back of the car in front of them. 

I see this in my rear view mirror and before she could hit her brakes to end the charade, I do a quick-stomp of MY breaks with like 4 cars worth of space between me and the car in front of me(Just like tapping the breaks, but extremely hard using a stomping motion so that the car's chassis appears to be screeching to a halt yet maintaining approx the same speed). 

She's clearly not ready for this, nor is the coffee she was holding at the time. I know this because, in my rearview, all I see is a light brown sheet of water pouring down from within her car's windshield.  

She jumps out of the car and I roll my window down because I'm honestly about to choke and die from laughing at this middle aged lady in a  gray pantsuit and a newly browned blouse storming out of her car screaming at me. Through my laughter and coughing, all I could get out was, ""That'll learn ya, dummy. Get back in your stupid car."" Before resuming driving and choke-cough/laughing my way to work. While still in traffic, I did notice to lady in the middle lane next to me laughing her ass off as well.   

After that, the day was actually pretty good.   

*Before you say I put other cars in danger, I really didn't. When the traffic resumed, no other car was flooring it to move forward. We were going at MOST 10MPH with no potential of that ending anytime soon.

He keeps talking some more before he finally grabs his cigarettes and hangs up. Finally, he turns to me and says, ""How much were those?""

Our town had just opened a rec center complete with Olympic sized pool, weight room, track, sauna, video games, snack bar...for a kid that can't do anything it was a relief to finally have somewhere to go. My friend and I are waiting outside for my mom to pick me up when a couple in their forties walked by us. I saw them walk by and I sneezed at the same time.

""What did you say asshole?"" says the man. I honestly sneezed and didn't do it as a joke, I just happened to be looking at him at the same time. I told him it was an accident. When his wife chimes in; ""Let's just ignore the little bastards, honey. Kids are motherfuckers.""

I should add that this is an upper class suburb, not a trailer park. Adults usually don't go around talking like this. *Kids* don't go around talking that way. 

The man then got in my face, looking up at me. ""You got a problem, you little punk?""

I was really confused how I got in that position where moments ago everything seemed so peaceful. I told him again I sneezed, I didn't mean anything by it. His wife finally pulled him back inside.

Later that week I was working my glorious job as a supermarket bagger when guess who came through the checkout?

I quickly skipped over to that register and asked the bagger there if I could take over. I was still fuming about that asshole and knew I'd get caught but fuck it.

I started bagging his groceries, shoving them in the bag. Luckily he bought a lot of bread and eggs that day. I grabbed his bread and twisted it like I'm drying out gym towels and slammed the eggs on the bottom of the bag, opened the carton, broke a couple personally and stuffed everything possible in one bag so it would rip open soon after he got out to the parking lot.

All the while I have one eye on him, certain he'd see what was happening. He didn't. I slipped away before he caught me.

Surely he must notice as soon as he picks the bag up, right? 

Nope.

Then of course he'll see me watching him and say something rude right? It took less than that for him to threaten me last time.

Sees me, doesn't even recognize me. 

I hope he enjoyed his smashed eggs and crushed bread.

This is a tale of a rude woman, an awkward parking lot, a fire-spitting &amp; cuss-filled stranger who came to my aid, and (hopefully) a long roadside hike for the offender.  I hope you guys &amp; gals like it.

* * * * *

I live in a very small town in leftern Mass where the ""downtown"" consists of about 4 buildings.  Amongst other necessities such as the liquor store, we have an independently owned full-service gas station.  It's a small but well run operation and I get gas there at every opportunity.  It's located right near a highway that leads up into Vermont, and because of that it gets a decent amount of business from out-of-towners driving up north for vacation.  The parking lot/pump area is a bit narrow; there's four pumps (room for two cars on either side), with a small entrance/exit on either end for people to come &amp; go.  It's difficult to explain the layout but there's a few car-lengths of space on either side of the pump area (between the pumps &amp; the entrances/exits) for waiting cars to line up.

Last summer I pulled into the station to gas up my car.  I'm friendly with all the kids that work there - we always shoot the breeze when they're filling my tank and I always tip them a few dollars for their effort (they have a sign saying not to tip but fuck that).  On this particular day this kid Alex happened to be working - he's a nice guy who I know fairly well and we've always had a good rapport.

A few minutes earlier, on my way to the station, I'd stopped to help a guy stuck on the side of the road - just a simple jump to his car, then we shook hands &amp; left.  Purely coincidentally when I got to the station the same guy happened to pull into the spot across the pump from me.  We'll call him Tim because I'm pretty sure that's what he said his name is.

Anyway, the story unfolds like this:

I was sitting in my car while the pump was running, bullshitting with Alex about who knows what.  Tim pulled in, recognized me, then got out to thank me again/ chit chat while Alex filled his car.  The three of us were standing there, pumps running for both cars, just shooting the shit and making small talk.  Two other cars then pulled in, filling all of the pumps and causing a situation where I'd probably have to back out of my spot in order to leave.  On an ordinary day that's no big deal and I didn't think anything of it at the time.

Then a shiny new Subaru with New Jersey plates pulled up behind me... *right* behind me.  I didn't even notice it until the woman behind the wheel honked her horn.  She yelled out the window ""Hey! *Stop talking!* You're in the way and *I'm* in a hurry!"" and honked again.  We all gave her dirty looks, Alex pointed to the pump sticking out of my car, waved her off, and we went back to our conversation.

Thirty or so seconds later the pump did that ""THUNK"" noise indicating my tank was full.  I got in my car, and Alex put the nozzle away and then stood there waiting for the machine to print out my receipt.  The Subaru woman honked again, and then said once more through her open window ""Excuse me, I'm in a HURRY?!"" in that annoying, upward-inflection &amp; bitchy tone of voice.

At this point I was fairly irritated but not enough for a confrontation.  I had my gas and this woman wasn't worth getting mad over.  So I went to back out of my spot (the car in front of mine was still there, actively being filled so it obviously wasn't going anywhere for a few minutes), and I realized that this Subaru had totally boxed me in.  I couldn't go anywhere, and that was that.  So I put my reverse lights on &amp; sat there waiting for her to get the message and back up - I figured that she would immediately let me out if she was in such a hurry to get gas and be on her not-so-merry way.  5 or so seconds passed.... and the woman honked again, then fucking *pulled forward* another foot until her bumper was 6 inches from mine.  At this point it was obvious to everyone else who was present that moving my car was out of the question - there were the gas pumps to my left and the brick-fucking-wall of the gas station building immediately to my right.  I was about to get out of my car and ask her to move when she honked one final time.

All of a sudden it was like a switch turned on, and this guy Tim absolutely lost his shit.  He was still out of his car, leaning up against the pump &amp; trying to maintain a conversation with Alex..... and after the final honk he turned and started ripping this woman a new asshole.  Full-force top-of-his-voice yelling, waving of the arms, flipping her off, etc.  It hadn't noticed this until he started yelling, but he was a pretty muscular guy &amp; cut quite an intimidating figure as he walked towards her car yelling his fucking face off:

""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME LADY?  YOU JUST FUCKING BOXED HIM IN, ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED?  ARE YOU A STUPID PERSON?!  HE WANTS TO MOVE BUT YOUR FUCKING CAR IS IN THE WAY!  HE CAN'T FUCKING GO ANYWHERE, OPEN YOUR FUCKING DAMN EYES!  HONKING ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE A GODDAMN THING IF HE CAN'T MOVE HIS FUCKING CAR YOU **BITCH**!""

Throughout his tirade I was standing there, awkwardly half in &amp; half out of my car, mouth completely open and shocked at the beauty of what I was hearing.  I am *not* a confrontational person so this exchange was wholly unexpected but was *massively* appreciated - he said everything I'd wanted to (but would never) say. The woman immediately put her car in reverse and sped out of the lot, flipping us all off as she went.  The three of us stood there and watched her drive the few hundred yards to the north-bound highway on ramp, and then onto the highway..... And then Alex started to crack up laughing and said ""the next exit with a gas station isn't for another 17 miles so if she runs out of gas she's *fucked*""",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1358288502.0,,,True,t3_16n7g7,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16n7g7/btch_boxes_me_in_at_gas_station_and_gets_verbally/,

Backstory:
He used to work as a mechanic, doing maintenance on helicopters. For a while he had an apprentice (or an intern or something) following him around shadowing him to learn how to take care of the copters. This guy ""Jimmy"" was terrible for leaving the windows open in the copters at the end of the day and bugs would come in all night. After several weeks, my uncle had had enough of listening to bitch and complain about them, as the bugs grossed him out and told Jimmy that he would be cleaning the bugs out from now on.

Revenge:
It was dusk. Jimmy had left for the night and Uncle was finishing clean up for the night when he notices that Jimmy has left a window open in one of the copters. Again. So he decides to give him something to complain about. Close the window so the bugs stay out? In time. But first, take the doors off all together! He also hung a light inside and went about his business cleaning up. About half an hour later he finishes up and puts the doors back on the copter, takes the light out and leaves. 

Results:
Jimmy comes in the next morning and finds the copter he's in charge of cleaning ALIVE with bugs. Every insect within a mile came to that light and now they were completely coating the inside of the copter. You couldn't even see inside, you just saw masses of bugs crawling around looking for an exit. Jimmy freaked out. He refused to clean it, bitched to my uncle when he came in and was simply reminded that he told him not to leave the windows open. While Jimmy went to complain directly to the manager of the facility, my uncle simply popped out the doors again, shook them off and when Jimmy returned not five minutes later, all the bugs were completely gone, so he couldn't even complain, which made him flip his shit even more. He stormed off in a rage. 
The manager gave my uncle his best ""Yeah, so this happened"" look and says: ""So you had some fun with Jimmy today, huh?"" My uncle shrugged and simply repeated: ""I told him not to leave the windows open."" 
I'm not 100% sure if Jimmy quit after that or if he just never left the windows open ever again, but either way he never had a problem with Jimmy ever again.

I had just gotten a new-to-me (aka used) bicycle and was riding it around Venice Beach. They have a large area dedicated to foot traffic, bicycles, skateboards… non-motorized traffic. On this day I was feeling a little silly so I put a big shaggy wig on my bike helmet. So it looked like I just had a big brown mane of locks. The cool thing was it muffled the roaring sound of wind. I could hear everything around me pretty clearly. I think the wig was working like those shaggy covers on movie microphones. Even though the sound dampening was cool, the wig itself was hot as hell.

So like I said, I was riding along the concourse of Venice Beach when this rent a cop waves me down. Actually, he nearly tackled me. I come to a stop a few yards away. This guy, an overweight sweaty fellow, wearing an orange safety vest, proceeds to dash up to me. He stops in front of me, out of breath, and points right at my face. With his finger inches from my face he berates me for not wearing a bicycle helmet. He tells me it's illegal to ride a bicycle without one in California. Every time I try to tell him that I am wearing a helmet under the wig, he cuts me off with a flicking gesture of his hand. So I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay fine. If you want to play this out, then we'll play this out."" He gets on his radio and calls for the actual police. Meanwhile, I'm also pointing out all the other bicyclists that are riding around without helmets. He couldn't care less. Finally, two police officers, one female and one male, ride up to us on bicycles. The rent a cop proceeds to tell the male officer that I'm in violation of some code and I should be ticketed. All the while the female cop is looking right at the strap for my helmet. She asks me if I'm wearing a helmet. I tell her that I am in fact wearing one. I then take off the wig and leave the helmet on my head. The three of them stare at my helmet for a few seconds and then in unison the two police officers start laughing their asses off. The rent a cop looks like a damn fool.

Here's where my petty revenge comes in. After the cops caught their breath, I ask them if there is a law about wearing a helmet in California, making sure the rent a cop could clearly hear. The female police officer answers, ""No, but it's a good idea to wear one."" The male police officer then says, ""But, there are laws about false accusations."" Apparently, the police knew this rent a cop because they said something to him to the effect of, ""You need to stop doing this kind of thing."" Eventually rent a cop left and I was rewarded with a high five from the police officers for giving them the best laugh they had all day.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1hvk48,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1hvk48/rentacop_wigs_out_over_nonhelmeted_bicyclist/,

My mom is notorious for being a major hypocrite in our family. She will yell at us for eating too much junk food but will come home every day and eat half a (family sized) bag of chips while watching Ellen. She will get angry when anyone leaves the bathroom smelly but leaves the worst stench of them all when she is done. Most of all, she can be extremely inconsiderate. She will eat half of something, put it back in the pantry/fridge, and never finish it, but if we eat it, she yells at us because it was hers. This last thing she does is the topic of my revenge. Her car has a beeper that lets it be unlocked form a distance and if you press the button twice, the entire car gets unlocked. As I have seen with every other person with a car I know, it is common courtesy to unlock the whole car so eeryone can get in, but this does not occur to my mom despite us telling her of the fantastic feature her clicker has. Instead, she will only unlock her door, get in, buckle her seat-belt, put the key in the ignition, and finally look up at me waiting outside as though she had no idea I had been carrying a conversation with her on the walk over to the car and was planning on accompanying her to the pre-decided distention via automotive transport and only then unlock my door.

**Revenge:**

When  I was finally old enough to get my drivers permit (15 &amp; 1/2 where I live), I realized the power was in my hands to enact my sweet sweet revenge. One day, we were heading off to my martial arts class and she told me I was going to drive, so, as i had been taught over the years by my current traveling companion, I clicked the unlock button once, unlocked **my** door, got in, put my seat-belt on, she knocks on the window impatiently, I look over at her as though I forgot she was even there, put the key in the ignition, and then unlocked the door for her.

I’ve ended up volunteering at the county fair this summer since I need a certain number of volunteering hours to get full credit on my GPA. Yesterday, I managed to get revenge on two people, but the first was accidental.

My job was at the 4-H booth, registering people’s submissions. A girl who had hated me, and I her, in elementary school, walked straight up to my table. She was carrying three pies she’d baked herself and wanted to have judged. I simply tried not to look at her, but under the pretense of adjusting the pie lid, which was on the table in front of me, she whispered in my ear, “Hello again, fuckface.” 

That was what she had called me when I was in fifth grade and she was in sixth. At that moment, all my rage at her came flooding back. I would have been willing to let it go, but she had to bring up taunts from five years ago. That was fine. I couldn’t do anything or say anything, or else I’d lose a valuable volunteer position I would need for years to come. 

My work partner volunteered me to carry this girl’s pies over to the display risers. I vowed to do my job perfectly, to set those pies down and to own it. However, the universe was angry at her on this day. 
My shoelace had somehow come untied, and I stepped on it as I made my way across the freshly-washed, smooth cement floor. Halfway to the risers, I fell, pies flying out of my hands. My chin slammed into the floor and I bit down hard on my tongue. Even the blood filling my mouth could not keep me from looking up joyfully as the three pies she’d worked so hard to make flew through the air. The lids were not secure and flew off. 

Two of them landed on the floor. One splattered on the risers. All three were ruined. 

I hadn’t even meant to do it, and yet, I had done the absolute best thing possible. She would get no credit for her 4-H project, she would not have a chance for a ribbon, and she would not get her hard work displayed with everyone else’s. I turned around and saw her standing there, openmouthed, as her mother rushed forward to try salvaging the confections. The work partner helped me to my feet and ran off to get paper towels. 

I stood there, trying not to swallow blood, and looked at her. She was standing frozen and white as a sheet. I raised one hand to shoulder height, waved with my fingers and smiled winningly. Her mother left without a word and she followed.

------------------------------------

**Bean revenge**

The second revenge was intentional. 

While I was sitting at the aforementioned desk, far earlier that day, there was a dry spell of people coming in to register. My work partner had not yet arrived so I was all alone, flipping through the fair book and wondering what the hell a muskmelon is (it’s like a cantaloupe, only a vegetable). 

A family of three walked by on my left. A teenage boy, a mother, and a father. They only had livestock books and didn’t have anything to register with me, so they had no business with me. I was sitting there, staring into space, chin on my hands, waiting for someone to arrive with a box of vegetables or flowers for me to catalogue. As the father passed by, he grabbed the table and yanked it out from under me, shouted “WAKE UP” and continued walking, chuckling to himself.

I know it sounds like something that belongs in /r/thathappened, but I swear I am telling the truth. Neither of his family members said anything to this man who just ripped the table out from under a teenage girl who was doing nothing but daydreaming. No one else was around. I pulled the table back and resolved to get revenge on this man.

After a while I was getting moved between 4-H (kids ages 8-19 who are in 4-H) and Open Show (anyone) registration desks. In one of the rare moments I was at the Open Show desk, the same man came over with a large plate of green beans. 

There are so, so many categories of green beans and I had learned quite a bit about them in my years at the fair. However, many of the judges cannot tell one type of bean from the other (perils of being run by volunteers) and simply trust the person who writes the tag as having them down as the right kind. Ny job was to make tags.

Immediately, my brain began whirring. How could I destroy this asshole? Then it came to me. I had been looking at beans and other vegetables all day. He told me they were a bush type. I had only had three entries of bush type green beans and I knew that these would easily win first prize, and 30 dollars, if they were entered. However, there were at least fifteen different types of pole green beans entered already. If you’ve ever seen a fair book that tells the classes of vegetables, you know how small the print is and how easy it is to make a mistake.

I wrote that he had pole type beans on the tag and put it on the risers, waiting. Everything would be judged the next day, and since this happened yesterday, my time was now.

This morning I came in and nonchalantly went over to the Open Show produce. The beans didn’t even win fourth. They had been surpassed by everything else. No cash prize for you, bitch.

My school (a connected middle school/high school) has a breakfast every morning. Not mandatory, but you can go if you want some breakfast in the morning and you don't eat at home like me. Also, the kid I'm about to discuss a little sixth grader I'll call ""Mason"" to protect his real name. This kid is an asshole. He slammed my brothers finger in a locker just to be an asshole, and my brother bled for 7 straight hours, no exaggeration, before we eventually had to take him to the emergency room.

Now, on with the story:

I went to breakfast and got my food and the line was crazy, but I waited in line like everybody else. I finally get to the front of the line and this kid decides he needs to be right in front of me so he just waltzes his ass right in front of me. I tell him I was standing there and he says to me ""Cool.""It's too early for this shit, so I began to think revenge. That's when I saw him slip an apple in the inside pocket of his vest. I knew my revenge would be simple but embarrassing. He checks out and I check out two people after him, because he jumped in front of someone else. As I'm checking out I'm sure to mention Mason's apple he slipped in his pocket. 

Not one minute later people are yelling at him to go back and see the cashier. He was sitting at his table with his head down the rest of breakfast. As I walked by to go to my first class, I made sure to give him a nice ""Ha!"" right in his face.

They must have bumped into me no less than two dozen times.  Not your nomal bump either.  The line would move ahead and then stop.  I would stop.  They slam into me.  I tried saying ""excuse me"" loud and to their face a few times but these ladies apparently didnt speak English.   Then they started talking smack about me in Spanish.  Pretty fucking stupid to think a Floridian doesnt also speak Spanish.  

 I had enough of it.  I patiently ignored there bickering about me and bumping into me until we got to the loading area.  When the park employee was dividing us into loading areas to get on the coaster, I asked to speak with him quickly.  I said ""The lady behind me has been talking about her pregnancy and she is due in June.  I didnt think pregnant women could ride coasters?""  He pulled them aside and it was amazing how fast she learned English.   We got on the coaster and took off on an amazing ride, she was still arguing with the employee.

He was a steroid induced asshole working because his cousin owned the company (mortgage company). He was abrasive, rude, and just an asshole. He also love hunting more than life itself. He had no idea what he was doing (no education, no training, didn't understand the mortgage process). 



One day he pushed all of us over the edge... the mortgage company had an 800 number for people who called from the newspaper ads, etc... we (loan reps) took turns answering it, we had assigned times we owned. This certain the asshole had 9am to 3pm on a Wednesday. 


After a morning of no calls, he decides to leave at 11AM and go to the gym/lunch/Hunting store until 2pm. Hunting store was a major sporting goods chain I won't mention name of that had a huge hunting/fishing department. So he is 3 hours of out of the office, on his one day where he owns the 800 number. His cousin, the boss, didnt care, he was busy in his office didn't notice he was gone... so lo and behold between 12-1 two calls came in, people applied for re-fis (lunch hour is busy, since people make their phone calls). 

I answered one call, a coworker (a quiet very nice young lady) took the other call. Policy is, it's our deals, since he was not as his desk (exception is made if guy got up for 10 minutes to use mens room, we would cover)... but we are not going to cover and give him deals because he took a 3 hour lunch. 


So he comes back, opens up our software (CRM) and see two calls came in.. he gets all excited ""thanks guys for the deals, please email me the applications""... our sales manager said NO. asshole gets all angry and it escaltes into an agrument. A loud one. 


His cousin (big boss) comes out, and to see what all the noise was about... it became a long heated agrument, with me, asshole, sales manager, and cousin boss, it was decided he would in fact keep those deals. But if this happens again, whoever answers the phone gets it (unless of course, it's a quick 10 minute bathroom break)... 


Later he tried to act all cool and thank me for covering, but this habit of having others do his work was common... the nice young lady who took the other app stayed out of it, she let the angry men figure it out. He was the type of guy who would start physically threatening others, any other workplace, this guy is fired... but his cousin and him were very close friends. 


We really hated this guy..... so here is the revenge....... a few weeks later, so it was well removed from the big agrument we all had. 


He loved this certain hunting store. One day he left his hunting store shop members card on his desk (he was putting in an online order), I took a quick picture of the ID # with my phone....nobody noticed I did it. 



When he was out of the office, I then opened up Photoshop (I am good with Photoshop) and made him a ""members appreciation discount day"" coupon. I copied a similiar coupon layout I found online and made it state ""get 80% off hunting and fishing merchandise Between the hours of 10AM to 3PM on Tuesday, June 3"" (i forgot exact date). I even wrote a marketing letter with his name and info, and hunting store member # and mailed to his home. I even ran the envelope through the printer and mailed it from  the same town of the store's location (I was in that area anyway). I used some of our marketing stock paper, so it looked fancy. 


So he gets the hunting store fake coupon in the mail.... he brings it into work the morning of the fake sale, I see it on his desk.. which also happen to be his next scheduled day to cover the 800 number. He makes up some lame excuse to leave the office around 10AM..... from 10AM to 1pm he's gone, we assume he went to the Hunting Store fake sale... and he did... in that time, 3 calls came in, which we took the applications for. He comes back around 1pm, looking pissed off like hell. He sees we took 3 applications, and doesn't say a word (because of the last time he can't pick this fight again).... later his cousin walks by and asks him what's wrong (ever see a 6'2 250 pound man sit in office chair and just pout like a spoiled child?)... so asshole starts whining about how he went to hunting store and this coupon didn't work, and how he got into an agrument with the manager, and the kicked him out of the store. 


Cousin says, ""isn't today your phone day""... asshole ""says yes""... cousin says ""well, did we get any calls""... asshole says ""yes, 3, they are all set and we are working on it"".... end of story.. those 3 mortgage apps went to the people who answered them (myself included)... asshole never skipped work like that again. I never told anybody I made the fake coupon.

Later we are sorting through some free gifts the company provides us with (because we work too hard for too little and it's just a perk of the job really) and she sees a perfume she wants. I don't like this perfume too much, personally, so I'm ok giving it up to someone. Just not her.

She asks me if she can have it, I play along and ask her what she has to trade for it. I pretend to sort through her stuff very carefully and list a bunch of things of equal value to the perfume and then ask her what else she has at home. She lists a bunch of shit and then I say.

After school, Junior year, I went to my buddy Ben's house to hang out for a few hours before going home. I did this a couple days a week.

This day we were messing around in his garage, where he has a small halfpipe. I would skate and he would BMX. He was rather well-known in the Midwest for his riding abilities and would often go on tours with his team on the weekends. This is relevant.

Anyways, we're in the garage and started throwing screws at each other, then snowballs and it escalated to bigger objects. He ended up chasing me out to my car with an old brown banana; like hell I'm gunna let that splatter on me. I unlock the car and get in just in time to hear a loud *whump*. I see Ben's big goofy grin and then him running back in the house. I get out and see banana splattered all over the driver side of my old car.

Aw hell no son.

So I drive home and since this is February near Chicago it's like negative 10 degrees Fahrenheit. For some reason it didn't even click that banana would freeze to my car. Sure enough it did. I go to get my ice scraper and actually took paint chips off in the process of getting this frozen mess of banana goop off. I was just getting more angry that Ben got the last shot. 

But I didn't forget.

We kept hanging out normally through the end of the school year and into the summer. June rolls around, temp's getting into the 90's. I'm working at a pizza place.

I'm sitting at home masturbating, like always, when I get an idea. I get in my car and speed to my workplace, run in, say hey to everyone, and grab some anchovies. Perfect.

I call up Ben right away as I'm pulling out of the parking lot.

""Hey whatsup? Let's hang out!""

""Yeah man, come on by, I'm home,"" he says.

I get to his house and we're in his garage. He says he has to poop. He goes inside. I go to my car and grab the cup of anchovies.

Immediately I go to his expensive, beloved BMX bike and take out the seat with an allen wrench. The seat is connected to a rod that slides into another open tube on the frame. Inside this open tube is where I dump the anchovies. I quickly get the seat back on before he comes back in.

Everything went better than I planned in my head.

One month of 90+ degrees passes and he went on one of the tours with his team. When he comes back we're all hangin' out and he's telling me about this terrible fish smell that was in the van when they were all travelling.

*Hell yeah, shit's workin'.*

Another month goes by and he's telling me whenever he rides at the parks there's this terrible smell that follows him everywhere. But it's only when he's on his bike. Weird! I get little comments like this every now and then for the next month after that.

Three months total goes by. He orders a new bike seat. It comes in the mail and he wants to change it. Two of his friends are over in the garage when he changes it. Loosens the screws on his seat, pulls it out of the tube and this white-ish green, goopy anchovy paste is pulled out with it. The most rancid smell in the world fills the garage in seconds.

Ben starts puking.

His one friend starts puking because of the smell and because of Ben puking.

The other also decides now would be a good idea to puke.

Puke everywhere in the garage, mixed with three month old rotting anchovy stank.

I get the entire story from Ben on what happened the next day. Laughing my ass off so hard while he's telling it. His friends retell the story also when I see them the following week. Laugh just as hard.

The look on his face at the simple explanation I gave him was worth the 7 month wait for my petty revenge.

So, I put my hip out just enough to dig my wallet chain into the side of his car, making a huge scratch in his paint. He gets out, yells at me, and then goes inside and complains to management. When they asked me what happened, I told them about all the previous times as well. They watched the security videos and when they saw what he had been doing, fired him on the spot.

Here's a favourite.

In high school I was friends with this mentally disabled girl (and don't worry this isn't going in the direction you think it is). In the first week of school, I was picked on at the bus-stop. When she saw I was upset, she jumped in and yelled like a mad-woman until I was left alone. I appreciated the gesture, so throughout high-school it developed into a mutual watching of each other's backs.

This went on for some years, until she started to get used to getting her own way around other people. That she could manipulate people with lies and sob stories. When she found these tactics didn't get any sympathy from me, she started to take it out on me. There was nothing much I could do when she would yell at me, pinch, hit or throw things at me. I would ignore her, and she would get angrier at me.

""Why are you making me upset?"" She would ask. I would calmly tell her ""I think you're upset because you're treating your friends badly."" Cue more fists and screams, and one day a teacher coming up to me and blaming me for picking a fight with this girl.

""Fray Joker! I expected much better behavior from you than to pick fights with a special needs student. Go stand over there until your bus comes, you should be ashamed of yourself.""

This teacher was legendary for thinking less of students, for being a real power-tripping authoritative muscle drone. It was not possible to for her to be wrong when it was her word against another student.

I looked this simple beast in the eye and said ""I am not in the wrong here, and you will apologise for what you've said to me."" I swear at the time she laughed it off, rolled her eyes. And I knew. I knew that she would apologise.

So started my campaign. Every single time I saw her, walked past her in the corridor, saw her standing on duty. Any time I had to interact with little miss superiority complex, I looked her in the eye and said simply ""You still owe me an apology.""

It took three months for this academic dictator to take umbrage at my continued disrespect towards her. Before she finally snapped and yelled at me to ""meet her in her office"". Head held high I walked in to find her sitting at her desk, hands folded, doing her best to kill me with her pure unbridled fury, detention pad at the ready. I looked her in the eye and said ""You owe me an apology."" 

She asked me why, and I explained the incident to her. How this girl decided to pick a grudge against me, and how I was trying my best to teach her sympathy towards others. She accused me of going over this girl's head. I pointed out that we had been friends for years, and she always used to be compassionate to others. I told her that her assumption I was in the wrong deeply insulted me, that I would never bully or hurt another student in the school. She admitted that she had never heard a complaint against me from any student or teacher.

Without another argument left in her, she said sorry, I said thankyou, and walked out of her office.

Thanks for the Karma and (some) interesting discussion. What honestly stuns me is quite how many of you are scummy and douchey enough to think it's appropriate to steal from someone. I a) hope you have others steal from you for the rest of your life and b) hope when you're finally old enough to drink and attend university, you live with some *enormous*, angry people who have no qualms about beating you senseless after you try and steal their stuff.**


I post in BadRoomates quite often...since I have six of em, and four are awful. One in particular is -terrible- he lives on the bottom floor, seperate form the rest of us, and spends his days getting wasted, high, smoking cigars and repeating the process (recently baked a load of Space cake, the entire lower floor stinks of weed now...)


Anyway, we had a party, got drunk, and my alcohol got left downstairs on the side in the kitchen..a few months in I finally go down to fetch it, and discover a shot glass in front of my Rum, and the bottle over half gone. It was an -expensive- bottle, and he was the only one who was down there to pinch it, he'd been enjoying a shot or two whenever he felt like it. I rescued my bottles, and a few weeks later finished off what was left...but kept the bottle.

I bought another (cheap) bottle of rum, poured about a quarter back into the empty expensive bottle....

and filled it the rest of the way up...

with *laxatives*, this thick, dark syrupy type stuff that looked designed to taste pleasant (and was cheap). Then I put it in the downstairs kitchen.


Now, my petty revenge is fairly obvious...however, petty revenge -kind- of turned into epic, justiceporn worthyness (or perhaps simply cruel?). Less than a week later, he held a party with a bunch of friends, loud music, getting absolutely wasted. At some point during the night he got high enough...or ran out of alcohol, to simply grab the -new- bottle of his 'friends' rum from the kitchen, and shared it out amongst his friends...


God, I can't tell you how wonderful it was to be woken up at 6am by a dozen stoned or drunk people downstairs -all- desperate to use the one bathroom in the house, and unable to leave and go home for fear of shitting themselves if they stood for longer than a few seconds.



**EDIT - lets see if I can't respond to a few of you en masse.**

**Apparently important!:- Someone mentioned this is important. The Rum is left in the pile of bottles we all leave in the kitchen, Bottles of Wine, spirits and cans of beer and whatnot, this is the unofficial housemate booze pile, its where we leave stuff to drink so that we don't have to keep it in our rooms (someone below said that makes it the equivalent of a storage cabinet), that doesn't make it for public consumption. He didn't touch the wine or cans, or others spirits it seems, just the nice looking rum.**

**1. It was left in my house, not someone elses, my home, the place I pay rent to live in. It was left in a communal area, which is part of what I pay rent for. At no point or no length of time does it become 'okay' for someone to steal from you. There is a Nintendo Wii in the communal living room, it's been there for five months now, it doesn't mean it's 'okay' to steal it and sell it elsewhere. It's not your property, don't steal it.**

**2. Two months wasn't a casual ""Lol it'll be fine"", I'm not a heavy drinker, I drank it at the party, it got left down there, I assumed in a communal space it would be fine, two months later I need it to drink, fetch it and realise it's almost all gone. And it could be there for nine months, it's a communal space, not someone's private room I dumped it in, and it's mine, at no point can someone else steal it, there isn't a 'five minute rule' or something.**

**3. Some people seem to have got the wrong impression about the house layout. He's not my roommate, he's my housemate, there are seven of us each with our own separate rooms inside a large house. The large house includes two kitchens, one bathroom, and one living room that are communal spaces. It's three floored, three bedrooms on the top floor, three bedrooms and a kitchen on the middle floor, and one bedroom, one kitchen, the bathroom and living room on the bottom floor. Rum-thief lives in the bottom floor bedroom, and the rum was left in the bottom floor kitchen, on the side, out of the way.**

**4. When I refer to weed and the floor stinking, again, it's not his personal floor, it's the communal floor, the living room, hallways, kitchen, bathroom (and presumably his bedroom) that stinks. There are three asthmatics in the house, one of which is severe enough to warrant regular checkups. He knows this, we all do, the other smokers stand by an open window or go outside to smoke, he smokes baccy and weed in the communal spaces, indoors, which isn't appropriate, considerate, and in fact is banned on the tenancy lease we all signed.**

**5. The other, unfortunate victims of my revenge are just unfortunate victims, but hardly my fault, I never offered him the rum, he simply took it when he was high and drunk and shared it amongst his friends, it's entirely his fault they suffered as well, not mine, in exactly the same way leaving a car unlocked so that it can be stolen doesn't make you liable for the people the thief runs over. I expected him to take a few shots of it, and suffer the consequences, not down the entire thing along with a dozen other friends.**

**6. the first port of call if you decide to assume something is communal, especially something expensive, is to ask if it belongs to anyone. Any of the other five people living in the house could have told him without any hesitation the bottle belonged to me and wasn't for sharing. And, for the record [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ADMIRAL-RODNEY-St-Lucian-Bottle/dp/B004EY5FQC/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359667779&amp;sr=1-1) is the expensive rum he stole. It's quite clearly not cheap stuff random guests bring to a party and never come back for.**

**7. The guests he brought over didn't take it themselves. He brought the bottle in, claimed it was his own, and shared it out with them. Additionally the only time I realised the party was happening was when the music started up. HAd I known in advance, I'd have removed the bottle until a time when only he would have been affected, to avoid strangers having to suffer. Also to note, we made sure to keep an eye on all the suffering guests and told them to drink plenty of water when they worked out they were 'ill'. All of them are entirely fine and healthy now, no one needed the doctor, a hospital, or anything more than plenty of water and access to the toilet.**",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1359673887.0,,,True,t3_17mlfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17mlfe/you_like_my_booze_heretry_this/,

Well at one point I'd had this girl in my class for 3 semesters but I hadn't really spoken to her until the last 2. Well this girl is majoring in English and French and writes poems all the time and she just happens to think she's curing cancer with it. For the most part I don't care about your major if it makes you happy but this girl was fucking arrogant about it. At one point she told me the name of her 3 cats and looked at me like waiting for me to get something. I just said ""oh ok.. .that's cool..."" and she looked at me in utter shock and disbelief and said ""HELLOOO! IT'S THE NAME OF THE 3 MUSKETEERS! HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?!!!"" And I just about punched her in the face. She would do this constantly, referencing literature and shit. She was also the kind of person who would ask you a question just to tell you you're wrong. Bitch. 

Petty Revenge: Well roll around to the third semester I had with her and the teacher announces the French Department's Annual French Poetry Contest. The teacher gives us the opportunity to submit a poem (in French of course) for extra credit without the expectation to win. This girl is SO excited to write a poem and just can't wait to submit her own work of art and show it off. Now, I kind of hate poetry. A lot. It makes me angry. It's just not for me. But I personally set out to write the shit out of a poem. I wrote about my aunt's lost battle with cancer. I put all my emotion into it and even cried remembering everything we went through in that time and I made it as deep and personal as I could make it. I even got a couple of my poetry-writing friends to review it and fix some things here and there to make it better. All in all, I spent about 20 minutes on it. I submit it. 

This was mid semester and for some reason they didn't tell us the results of the contest until the last day of class right before the final exam. They announce the winners. Guess who won? ME! That's right ME!!! Out of all the 400-500 level classes, I won the fucking contest! And in the most bitchass move I have ever made I say, ""Omg! I won?! I can't believe it! I DON'T EVEN LIKE POETRY!!"" The annoying girl just stared at me with her mouth wide open and completely in shock. She just couldn't believe that this poetry-hating-science-major just made her look like shit at what she does best!

I did everything from make/deliver the pizza to washing the dishes. Now every Friday the same couple order a big meal with deserts and soda($30+) and every time I deliver they never tip me. I don't mind a great deal since I know they live in lower income housing and the woman is always very nice to me. They order 2 different sodas, Pepsi for him and Ginger ale for her. One Friday night the man answers the door, and asked if I get tipped frequently. Excited at the idea I might get a tip I say sometimes and I always appreciate it. He pulls out a 5$ bill and says, ""I would tip you but your nothing more than a bad waiter that just brings my food to me and leaves"" and jokingly pockets it while closing the door. So next Friday I am going back to their house and instead of messing with his food I decide petty revenge is better. I secure the food and the ginger ale. As for the Pepsi I 
throw in in the back so it gets shaken as much as possible. After delivering their food I linger at their apartment door for just a moment, long enough to hear him scream when he opened his soda. 

If I can go on a quick tangent here: I DRIVE your food to your front door, if it's raining or snowing. I risk getting in an accident, robbed (3rd most likely job to be shot in America), have to pay for my gas and use my car higher insurance; I have get to your house quickly along with my other 6 orders, and we have no driving distance maximum so I have had 7 miles deliveries (they always tip) Not to mention I took your order along with making it.

Context:

One of the side streets connecting my parents street to the other is about 100 metres long and has this one jackass' garage backing onto it. He *used* to constantly park his car funny and block that little 100 metre stretch to people wanting to go through to get to the other street. Now that that's over with...

Anywho, so this guy would always block the way from one street to the other and was veeeeery rude about it when you would ask him (heaven forbid) to move out of the way. His english was almost non-existent so he would just scream and wave his hands at you to back your car up like you had inconvenienced him from being an asshat. 

Now, my mom is a no bullshit kinda gal. If you want something resolved, she is a fierce mama bear. So she's driving home on her day off from an outing of grocery shopping or something of the like and wants to use this side street to get through to her street. Low and behold, she's pulling up and fuckface has blocked everyone's way again. This particularly time, the guy's son was outside with him and luckily, his english was perfect. My mom rolls down her window and tells him to move out of the way and that he can't park like that to which the snot nose kid replies,

""What are you gonna do lady, call the cops?""

My mom just smiled, calmly rolls up her window, and backs up to go home via a different route. Not the typical actions of our frightening Eastern European mutter. But you see, ol' fraulien here was actually a member of our local police department. Yes, that same department our lovely snot nosed kid told my mom to call.

So my mom waits a couple of days until her next shift and makes a special trip down to her neck of the woods only to find that, she was in luck! Good ol' fuckface (or asshat if you preferred) had parked his shitmobile in his usual spot, blocking the road yet again! And not only that, his faithful brat was standing right beside him!

My relative being the kind person that he is pulled along side the gentleman offering him a ride to the nearest petrol garage to fill this tank up. He waited around to drive this guy back to his car to save him from the walk.

Now on the drive back a traffic cop cut my relative up on a duel carriageway and sped off. Being the driver that he is he started bitching to passenger he is dropping off about this. The ""officers"" in the traffic car infront of him must have seen this and decided to pull him over to have a little chat.

They requested his license and asked what the problem was and when he explained they decided he deserved a ticket. He protested about this but there was no stopping the cop from giving him this ticket, until the passenger also protested advising the cop he cannot give a ticket for his bad driving.

The cop clearly enraged by this thinks he will get his little bit of revenge by giving the passenger a ticket also. He requested his details (and this is when the revenge is).

The passengers response: Chief Constable ***** I expect to see YOU and YOUR colleague in my office first thing tomorrow morning.

My relative never did get his ticket

One day between classes, I overheard him talking about how wrong interracial relationships are and how ""disgusting"" black women are in particular, using very crude and degrading language, using the n-word, calling biracial people ""chocolate swirl"" and so on.  If it had only been me overhearing it, I would have let it slide, but as there were some young black ladies who were within earshot, I knew I had to engineer some karma.

My favorite uncle had always hooked me up with adult magazines since I was still too young to buy them, and I had several issues of Black Tail.  I didn't do it the very next day, because I didn't want it to look obvious, but a few weeks later I brought them to school inside a big book and put it in my locker.  During the middle of a class, I asked to go to the restroom and set it up, quickly planting the porno mags in his locker and positioning his textbooks as a ramp to where the Black Tails would slide out of the locker.

After the bell rang, I went to my locker and got my book for the next class, but wanted to watch it go down from a distance.  The anticipation was intense.  He opened his locker and, sure enough, the magazines slid out and onto the floor.  The best part about it was it happened in front of some girls he obviously had crushes on.  He was saying he didn't know how they got there, that they weren't his, etc.

A day or two later, I overheard him bragging about how he had put a padlock on his locker and nobody could do that to him again.  I identified the vents in the locker door as a point of vulnerability and spent a few weeks letting people somewhat forget about the Black Tail incident and also to give me time to figure something out.  In the meantime, he kept bragging on his padlock.  

I asked my uncle if he had any smaller magazines with interracial or kinky content, and he hooked me up with some really off the wall non-mainstream material, showing fisting and other kinky things even I hadn't seen at that age.  During basketball practice after school, I went and slid a couple of them through the vents of his locker door.  The way they fell must've had them leaning against the inside of the door, because when he opened his locker then next day, they fell out.

Teachers saw it and were telling him, ""Stephen, you've got to STOP bringing that filth into our school!""  The other kids were saying things like, ""OMG, I can't believe Stephen looks at black women fisting white guys!"" with other kids saying, ""Maybe she was an amputee and her hand really wasn't in there!""

I was a warm late winter morning. Warm enough that everything has become slush. Grey, dirty, salty slush. I'm 16 years old and had just gotten into a big fight with my boyfriend-at-the-time which ended when he drove off to be an asshole somewhere and left me with no ride to school. So I start trudging through the slush. I'm halfway to school and doing a decent job of keeping my shoes and pants dry. When this car comes peeling around the corner infront of me. I recognize the three guys in the car and make eye contact with the driver. He swerves into a huge puddle as he drives by me and soaks me head to toe. A tidal wave of slush and dirty water. I am wet, cold and pissed. They are laughing at me, heads out the window. I vow revenge. But I never really see them again, if I did they were in cars.

My chance didn't come until seven years later, January 2012. I was seeing this new guy who was picking me up one warm January night. We're driving when I see them, all of them, smoking right near a giant slush puddle. I COMMAND that the boy drive through puddle. Demand it, beg him. He agrees after I tell him why. As we approach I roll down my window and screamed ""ICE TO SEE YOU, MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!!"" then de drive through the puddle while I flip them off. Their faces were priceless. Before they could even fully react, the boy turns the car around, guns it though the puddle again and says ""FREEZE IN HELL, ASSHOLES!""

My job, besides the supervisory stuff, is to create data ingestion and reporting software. My little department isn't the only research analytics department within the company, we have another one that specifically deals with billing. They take all of the data that's generated by workers using my software and use it to bill clients. The reason for there being two of these departments is that VPs wanted/needed to fudge numbers sometimes and I simply won't allow inaccurate data to come from my department so the VPs found some people who were perfectly willing to do that. My department has 10 people in it, the lying department had 2.

The guy in charge of the lying department screws up. A lot. Sometimes even too much for the VPs that want to fudge numbers. He over bills so often that we run the risk of losing (huge, think banks that got bailout money) contracts every couple of months. A hired liar who screws up? Weird, right? Rather than accept the blame himself, he'll often blame our department for producing bad data. Nope, sorry, our shit is solid and we can prove it. When he gets called out for fucking up he'll email a ton of people, often even including clients in the emails, trying to blame his shitty numbers on us. Then I have to spend an hour showing how he's fantastically wrong (omitting the clients from the communications to at least save a little face for the company by not bickering in front of them).

The absolutely most infuriating thing that he does is goes into our code, fucks it up, and then pulls his calling-out bullshit. Through extensive user activity logging that I built into all of the software in response to this, I can tell when he's messing with my code. The most recent change to this activity logging stuff that I've made is, whenever he messes with code, unbeknownst to him an email is sent from his computer to all of the usual important people (except I've included the owner of the company in these emails, a multimillionaire who doesn't like to deal with ""the little stuff"") saying something along the lines of ""I'm messing with code, if the numbers are wrong that's why,"" although the actual body of the email is a lot longer and more detailed.

After messing with the code the last couple of times, he tried calling us out again. The owner of the company asked him what the fuck he was talking about seeing as how said owner received an email from the Head Liar that he was messing with code.

The Head Liar and his underling were soon fired after that, they never responded to the owners inquiries. Not only that, the lying VPs came under heavy scrutiny for fudging numbers and they're watched very closely, now.

I admitted what I'd done.

Our clients are consistently happier with the numbers, now. Everyone in my department got a raise. We're in charge of billing, now.

So I currently work in a large department of a large company, providing tech support for clients. One of my fat colleagues, is a total buttwipe. He's rude, stinks, never shaves his neckbeard, constantly eats chocolate bars and drinks only Red Bull. He's quite literally round like a giant watermelon, so we'll call him Hamplanet. Here are some examples of why I dislike him:

He steals lunches out of the fridge.
He makes racist jokes that everyone can hear.
He stares at women as they walk past him.
Once, I was happily walking past his desk with a coffee in my hand, and he got up and shoved me so the coffee went everywhere, then shouts ""JEEEEZUS WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING"" and I got told off for spilling a lot of coffee on the carpet.

But what really sent me over the edge into ultimate retribution extreme mode was that one day I get pulled into my boss's office and had the following conversation:

Boss: ""Hello fat_head, please sit down. I've called you here to talk about an unfortunate situation that has arisen. I've just received a complaint from a member of staff saying that you sexually harassed a client on Monday.""

My boss hands me a document which shows a written explanation of how I made rude remarks to a female customer on Monday, and then the customer's manager called back the next day and spoke to Hamplanet with a complaint against me. Hamplanet's name was written at the bottom of the document.

Oh dear, I thought. Our calls aren't recorded and I certainly never harassed anybody, so how can I prove that this was a lie? It turned out to be quite easy.

Me: ""Uh, ok, but I don't work Mondays.""

Boss: ""Oh. That's right. Uhhhhh...... sorry. I'll speak to Hamplanet.""

Great! I'm off the hook. Normally, I'd just return to work glad that nothing bad came of 1 on 1 meeting with my boss. But this time was different. This time, the score needed to be settled. I'd had enough, and it was time to strike back. So I began to scheme and plot my vengeance.

It came to me the next morning while in the shower. A genius plan for revenge against Hamplanet.

I drove to Krispy Kreme on my way to work and picked up a four pack. For those who are unacquainted with Krispy Kreme, they're a well-known and much coveted iced donut. I personally think they're a little overrated, but everyone I know goes nuts over them and so they fit my plan perfectly.

I got into the office and discretely handed out the four donuts to my friends in the department. They loved me for it. That was just a bonus though - the real prize was the all-important, empty Krispy Kreme donut box. Phase one complete.

I waited until Hamplanet got up to make a coffee. I crept over to his desk, planted the empty donut box right in front of his keyboard, and snuck back to my desk. The trap had been set, and now it was time to just sit back and enjoy the show. *ooooooh I am sooooo diabolical!*

Hamplanet started walking back to his desk. When he was about 10 feet away, his eyes locked onto the donut box, and he started running. His coffee splashed everywhere as his pounding feet propelled him closer to the . He shouted, ""Hell yeah!"" and sat down, ready to devour the sweet donut deception in front of him.

The next 10 seconds was the greatest moment of my life. I watched on with indescribable anticipation, like a child waiting for his first sparkler bomb to go off. I can't emphasize enough how much joy and excitement setting this trap gave me. the suspense was KILLING me.

Hamplanet opened the box, and actually reached inside of it, trying to grab the donuts that he didn't realize didn't exist. When his efforts proved fruitless and his tiny brain kicked into gear, the most perplexed, what-in-the-actual-titty-sprinkles-just-happened look washed across his face, and he just stared at the box for 5 seconds in disbelief. Then he looked up, directly at me, with the most fantastic how-could-you-do-this-to-me look on his face. It was like I'd just kicked a puppy down a staircase, and it was *supremely* satisfying. It was *delicious*. I'm getting goosebumps just writing this. I exploded into uncontrollable laughter as Hamplanet looked again at the box in disbelief.

One day, I'm working Sunday evening, all other shops in the area are now shut, meaning we're extremely busy, on top of this we have one of the lazier till avoiding managers working this night so it's just me and a relatively new girl working the tills. 

A lot of the customers are very understanding of the circumstances and are as pleasant as I am, (arrogance on the matter aside, I get people writing to head office about how nice I am in work). Except one male customer not even so far back in the queue over dramatically yawning, shouting and seemingly trying to start a mob of customer service hatred, the fact people ignored him only added to his growing anger. 

He eventually got to me, with three baskets of pretty expensive alcohol, Grey Goose vodka, whisky, gin a fair medley to say the least. I ignored his theatrics and begin serving him, it's at this point he begins to basically scream at me.

He tried to come back in and demand a refund, but the security guard coming off his break intervened and refused him entry.

So I am currently employed at Chuck E. Cheese working as a cashier that bounces back and forth between registers and the merch counter (you know, where kids get to pick their prizes and such).  It is rather ironic because, truth be told, I really do not like children... at all.  Oh well, it is just what you make of it; that, and it is a job for the mean time.

One day we are just beyond busy, with only two registers and only one person alone at merch.  I decide to jump in and help my fellow co-worker because it was just obvious she needed someone to help her.  This one dad wanted to get a prize that his daughter wanted but was just a wee bit short but I mentioned that he could pay the rest of it with cash.  I had told him I could help him at my register.  As I he was following me, I noticed that this older lady had got out of line to follow him to my register.  When his transaction was completed, I had every intention of going back to the merch counter to help my co-worker since the line was still long.  As I was about to step away, the older lady that was behind the guy slammed her purse down on the counter and just scowled at me as if she knew I was going to walk away.  'Okay,' I thought, 'this is no big deal.  I'll just help her and be done with it.'

When I was hired I was told that I had to suggestive sell because it helps bring in more money, so that is what I did (even though I honestly do not like to do it).  There is this promotional deal going on that prints out this long receipt and I have to explain what it is to every “guest” that completes a transaction, no matter how big or small the purchase (no big deal even though it is a mouth full).  I guess she felt like I was trying to dismiss her or something and when I read her back what she ordered she said in the most snottiest tone “And I want a coffee... FRESH.  And while you bring me my FRESH coffee, I will be speaking with you manager *takes a look at my nametag lanyard* TokkiGoesRawr.”  Now mind you, since coffee is not exactly a highly ordered item, the coffee is just in one of those hot water dispensers so it stays warm/hot all day and it is made as soon as we open, so at 9 AM.  This all happened around 5 PM.

Honestly I did not think I did anything wrong, so I was not upset or even remotely phased.  I bring her out her “fresh” coffee and, as she had said, she was talking to my manager.  I hand her the coffee and she scowls at me once more and says “see, I am talking to your manager like I said I would.”  With a stoic face I reply “I'm sorry” (obviously not sincere).  She retorts with “that's not sincere enough!”  Once again, with stoic face unwavering, I reply with “I'm sorry”.  Her scowl just intensifies and she goes back to talking to my manager and says to him “she's only apologizing because you're here!  I come here all the time and I have NEVER had anyone treat me with such disrespect and carry such a bad attitude!”  My manager turns to me and just tells me to take 5 in the break room.  No big deal.  I am STILL not even remotely phased or upset.  Later he pulls me aside and tells me “she has complained about EVERYONE here, so to be honest with you, I just wanted you off the floor so it looks like I am doing something about it.  I'm not even mad or upset with you.”  I just smile at him and tell him I'm going back to merch.  

***SIDE NOTE***
Now, I am usually generous enough to round up on a receipt that has like 1 ticket on it to 10 because the lowest prize you can get is in the 10 ticket bin.  Besides, I think it is so disheartening to tell a kid that they can not get a prize because they only have like 3 tickets.  Also the managers do not really mind when we do that.

Two hours pass by and as I am stocking the merch counter, I see that the old crotchety lady is back with her grandson to pick out a prize.  However they were looking at the other case and did not even acknowledge that they needed help.  I was done filling one bin, I turn around and this once kid who was barely tall enough to see over the counter hands me his receipt and he has 2 tickets which he then tells me that he wants stickers, and he even threw in a “please”.  Honestly, it is such a rarity for kids now-a-days to have and know manners, that it just always makes me smile whenever a kid can use it.  Just as I was about to hand him his stickers and send him on his merry little way the old lady was like “I know you saw me standing here!  That little boy was behind me!”

I gave her this flabbergasted look because honestly, I did not know what to say or do because it was just a super quick transaction.  I gave the kid my most apologetic look and told him that I would be with him in just one second.  As I was walking toward her and he grandson, she yells “Do you want me to talk to your manager AGAIN?!”  I just sigh and ask the little boy what he wanted and he insisted that he  gets a lollipop which can be bought using tickets.  She just throws his receipts at me and I look at them and instead of rounding up, I just add them just the way they are.  OH WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!	  He is JUST 3 tickets shy of getting his coveted lollipop.  

“Sorry kid, you do not have enough for you lollipop.”

“Can't you just give it to him?!” she screams at me.

“Sorry, I can't do that.  It's against company policy.  Maybe next time he will win enough to get it.”  I reply with my biggest smile.

She is fuming as her kid flops on his back on the floor and throws a huge temper tantrum.  She snatches the receipts out of my hand and literally drags he grandson out of the store, but before she leaves I yell “Have a MAGICAL day!”

I go back to the sad little forgotten kid and I give him his stickers and throw in a couple pieces of candy on the house.  He smiles an adorable smile and repeats “thank you thank you thank you!” as he runs to find his parents.

At the time there were approximately 1000 members and maybe 100 who contributed and commented on a near-daily basis. 

The community was overall a non-pretentious bunch with the glaring exception of two members who thought their shit didn't stink and took it upon themselves to shit on everybody else's work at every turn. Typical internet know-it-alls with a nasty penchant for putting people down and making them feel bad for sharing their poetry with others. Over time, we noticed members were not returning, particularly after being on the receiving end of one of these asshole's criticisms.

We got tired of the community being torn-apart by these guys and hatched a plan: we created 5 new user accounts. One contributed nothing but lesser-known poems by Sylvia Plath. Another nothing but obscure William Carlos Williams. You get the idea. The others were e.e. Cummings, Ralph Waldo Emerson and T.S. Eliot.

Over the course of three months or so, these users regularly contributed their ""poetry"" to the site. As usual, most of the community was positive in their feedback and a few were genuinely impressed. We even had to PM a few users who were hinting at being suspicious and let them in on the joke. 

However, the two aforementioned almighty warrior neckbeard ""poets,"" just as we knew they would, shit all over the work at every turn, even offering their own ""improvements"" every now and then. It was hilarious to see these guys offering their 'critiques' of poets like T.S. Eliot and Sylvia Plath as if the authors of these poems were just anonymous, unenlightened and angsty teenagers on the internet.

After three months of this we finally unveiled the truth in a lengthy post that referenced every single poem and it's true author. There was a day or so of futile and desperate justifications by the two overlords of all-things-poetic. They tried to make the distinction that there was a reason these particular poems were not-well-known by the general public, but, the laughter shared by the rest of the community became too much for them and they eventually gave up and never returned. The site went on for another couple of years until it was inexplicably shut down by it's creators. Every once and a while an asshole or two would show-up and try to belittle people, and, if it got too bad we would pull the same stunt. 

EDIT: I should clarify: these two guys weren't assholes so much as they were *pretentious* assholes. This was a site for **amateur** poets and these two guys treated every submission as if it was meant to be ready to join the ranks of the immortals.

It's possible that at least one of them was a literature professor at a community college. Nevertheless, they were both extremely confident in their breadth of knowledge and expertise and, in a few rare cases, they did manage to offer something constructive, but, that was not the norm. 

They were arrogant fucks who got-off on taking advantage of the fact that maybe they did have more knowledge and expertise on the subject of poetry than the rest of us who never made such claims.

So, the beauty of this revenge is that we turned the tables on these guys and they couldn't see the (in their world) obvious fact that this ""amateur"" poetry was really written by professionals.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1368743088.0,,,True,t3_1egmib,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1egmib/my_poetry_lacks_depth_and_clarity_you_say/,

Our story begins in September, where SRP was taking the same class as me. He showed up to maybe two classes, then proceeded to believe he is is too good for school and never showed up again (note: There were no online lecture notes). Because SRP was in our friends group and I wanted to be nice, I let him know a couple of times via text that we had a quiz the next day. After the 2nd or 3rd time a mutual friend told me he was resonding to every text by telling people I was ""obsessive"" and ""wouldn't stop texting him"". So I stopped, and proceeded to ignore him. He asked for my help an hour before the final, but I ignored his texts.

Cue second semester, I have a lovely boyfriend who I am very close to. SRP proceeds to tell my boyfriend that he ""hates me"", and on another occasion ""Don't worry, targaryenpie's boyfriend, I wouldn't punch anyone in the face, no matter how much I hate them."" He is also generally dickish to me, and at this point I decide I can't ignore it any longer.

Fun fact about SRP: He is a neat freak who loves to keep his room in pristine condition, and bought a ton of furniture to make his dorm room even nicer.

I work from home. The 9 year old across the street is home schooled. We see each other ALOT, as we are always home. Bought the house 5 years ago, so have watched her through the cute 5 year old phase.

She was always polite and sweet, so I spoiled her. I'd save the Sunday comics for her, gave her my old Hello Kitty bike bell and I always bought an extra bag of Halloween candy each year, just so I could give her a piece of candy whenever she came over.

She has gotten to the point she just says, ""Candy? (pause) candy? (pause) candy?"" and helps herself, no more please or thank you and climbs on my counters!

Petty part...my side

She is playing in the yard. I drive up and see her, so I close the garage door as quickly as possible to avoid the, ""Candy Candy Candy"" routine. She waits about 2 mins and comes to the front door. Rings the doorbell for 20 seconds straight, I ignore it. Then 30 seconds, then 1 min, this goes on for about 10 mins. She finally leaves.

Later, I go to check the mail and she comes running up to me. ""Candy? I came by when you got home, why didn't you answer?"" Me, ""Oh, I must have been in the shower."" 

Give her the candy and comics to make her go away.

Kids petty revenge...

Two days later, I walk across the street (right after they get home) to give her mom back a book I had borrowed. No answer. I knock again, I know they are home. (I just saw the car pull into the garage.) So, I give up and start to walk back across the street. 

Suddenly, the kid runs up to me in a bathrobe and towel wrapped around her head. ""Oh, I was in the bath, sorry. Do you need something?"" (She still has clothes on under the bathrobe.) I hand her the book for her mom and know I have been defeated in petty revenge and stalk off home.

My dad owns a small business, very small, consisting of him and 5 other employees.  My sister just started working at a pharmacy and on her first day one of my dad’s employees, let’s call her Jane, comes in.  The transaction was normal and life went on as usual, until the next day when Jane came into work.

**Jane**:  “I made $20 off your daughter yesterday!”

**Dad**:  “You what?”

**Jane**: “I went to the pharmacy and your daughter was the cashier.  She gave me $20 too much change!”

**Dad**: “You stole $20 from my daughter?  If her register is short at the end of the night it comes out of her paycheck! You need to give that back!”

**Jane**: “No way! It was her mistake, not mine! It’s my $20!”

At this point, my dad was pretty pissed at Jane but kept his cool until he went home from work to ask my sister about it.  My sister told my dad that Jane did in fact come in, but her boss had counted the money in her register at the end of the night, right in front of her, and the totals matched up exactly.  She was 100% positive of this because her boss had made comments about her good job, how everything was fine etc, etc.

So now my dad was pretty happy, but he didn’t go and brag to Jane about it.  He just let her think she had gotten away with an extra $20.  What he did instead was from that point forward every time he gave pay raises, Jane got less.  Christmas bonuses? Jane got significantly less.  All in all, my dad says the $20 she thought she stole ended up costing her at least $5,000 over the course of her employment.

*Hi ShaneL79,*

*This is [neighbors name]. I just witnessed a grey honda civic with license plate ____ hit your car as it was parking. They moved to the other side after hitting your car, probably to make it look like it wasn't them. If you have any questions, my number is _____.* 

This neighbor was a nice older woman I had met a few times in the parkade of our building. On this day I was parking in the visitor parking because it was a better spot and empty during the day. 

After doing some investigating and evidence gathering I was able to determine that the honda civic next to me had a fresh scratch that started and stopped at the exact same height as the one on my car. I knew it was fresh because there was a loose black chip of paint (the color of my car) hanging from it. My car had grey paint in the scratch. The scratch itself was about 4"" tall by about 16"" long. There was also a unique deeper impression about a 1/3 of the way up the scratch that lined up perfectly with a protruding piece of the civics bumper. Took photo's with measuring tape on each part.

As I was doing my ""investigation"" the owner came out. A girl in her 20's along with her boyfriend. I confronted them but as expected they denied it despite the mounting evidence to the contrary.

I explained my situation to the building manager and then went to the police. The police were impressed with my evidence and said they would send someone out. When I got back to my apartment the building manager explained that she had the car towed for parking in the visitor parking spot. They normally don't care, but because of the situation she wasn't giving letting this girl off.

The cop showed up shortly after and looked through my evidence and spoke to my witness. She said she was going to press charges for hit and run but it would be a few days since she was on days off as soon as she left my place.

A couple days later I get a call from another cop telling me they are no longer pressing charges because there wasn't enough evidence. I was shocked and asked what type of evidence he needed is a witness and scaled photo's didn't work. He told me he never seen the photo's and my witness told me she didn't talk to anyone else.

That night I got a call from the cars owner demanding I repay her the $375 it cost her for towing and impound charges. Claiming it was all my fault and the police told her she was innocent.

Another couple days later and I called the original cop I dealt with who was now back on duty. She explained her partner screwed up and confused the files for two similar cases she had. She explained they were still pressing charges but were having trouble getting a hold of the girl.

Knowing that the girl wanted money I came up with a plan to meet her at a specific time so the cop could charge her. When I showed up the girl did as well with two guys who I assume were there to intimidate me. Once I confirmed it was the girl, the cop came out from around the corner. She became very difficult towards the cop so the cop actually arrested her and then had her car towed and impounded - AGAIN!

A few weeks later I realized that this girl was parking in the visitor parking overnight on a weekend. It was a holiday weekend so the building manager office was closed so there was no fear of parking in those spots.

My story goes as follows:

I live in a city with a sizable gay neighborhood. One day, a college friend found a sweet drink deal ($5 all you can drink drafts for the 3 hours our alma mater had a football game scheduled) in the heart of said neighborhood. Being the reasonable alcoholics we are, we bought ten drink tickets and began inviting fellow alumni to join us. Giving away free beer on short notice proved marginally more difficult than we thought, so a few friends-of-friends found their way into the fold. 

Things started off well. They had Rogue Dead Guy on tap, the bartender aired the game on three TVs, and the place was pretty much all ours. As the game progressed on, we drank heartily as our team took a commanding lead. By the fourth quarter we were well on our way to being ripshit drunk, the drink deal was near expiration, and the usual clientele (gay dudes) began filing in. 

One of the friends of a friend was particularly hammered, and apparently quite homophobic. He began dropping the F-bomb with an astounding proclivity- and I don't mean fuck. This condescending asshole kept audibly calling gay dudes in a gay bar in a gay neighborhood faggots. 

Needless to say, my sensibilities were quite offended. Being the spiteful jerk that I am, I calmly told him my phone had died, and asked to borrow his phone (to text myself his number). I then grabbed a handful of cocktail napkins, scrawled his digits on them, signed them with his name and ordered half a dozen whiskey shots. I requested the bartender distribute them along with the napkins to the most single males in the room. I gave him a reassuring wink and a nice tip, and took a seat next to the homophobic shitbag who couldn't keep his mouth shut. 

In a mere matter of minutes, men started walking up to our table and asking who Marty was. I pointed him out, and announced I was stepping outside to have a smoke as they thanked him for the drinks. A few minutes later, he comes flying out of the bar, ranting about how all the fags are hitting on him and it's gross and they're disgusting and he shouldn't be there. I agree, and hail him a cab. 	

For your average individual, the prank might have stopped there. However, I am extraordinarily petty, and proceeded to set up Google Voice accounts for the purpose of masquerading as the recipients of the drinks bought under his name. Every time I'd catch wind of him doing something homophobic or otherwise intolerant, I'd send him a text telling him how much fun we had, how we should get together again, etc. I kept at it for a solid 6 months until he moved 1000 miles away and started threatening to report phone harassment to the cops.

**TL;DR- Homophobe shows up at gay bar to watch football game, gets wasted, uses homophobic slurs to insult gay people. I buy drinks for patrons of the bar under his name, they hit on him, and he spazes. I then proceed to text him from Google Voice accounts masquerading as the dudes who hit on him for months when he shows signs of intolerance.

We all worked nights, so we usually got up around noon. We had a subscription to the local paper, which was delivered early in the morning. After a while, our paper delivery stopped in spite of being paid up, so we called the paper and complained. They assured us that it was still being delivered, and we realized that one of the neighbors was stealing it before we woke up. So a couple of nights later, we came home from work and stayed up until the paper arrived at 5am. We went out to the courtyard and found several piles of nasty dog shit, which we rolled up neatly in the center of the paper. We then put it back on our porch and went to bed. We never had a problem with our paper being stolen again. We had a suspicion as to which neighbor was taking it, and I got great joy out of imagining the look on his face when he unrolled the paper over breakfast and got dog shit all over his nice dress clothes.

I'm well accustomed to the drunk soccer mom and dipshit kids coming in just to fuck around because it's apparently okay at our store. Whatever, though.

What I hate, absolutely hate, is the inattentive / asshole parent and the holier-than-thou customer. More often than not, our store is used as a daycare for some kids while the parents go off to do whatever in the mall. The HTT customers are just the ones who think retail workers are sub-human and treat us like shit. 

I was lucky enough to have the two awful things in one last weekend. It was slow, so my coworkers and I were working on individual projects around the store when this lady and her daughter come in. The kid immediately goes apeshit and runs around the store, touching everything and throwing shit all over the place. My coworker starts following her around for damage control, leaving me with the mother. 

She fills her arms up with clothes to try on, comes over to me and instructs me in the heaviest Southern drawl I've ever heard to pick up some novelty items she'd like to buy. I offer to get a dressing room started for her, prompting a scoff and reminder that she pays my wages, and that idiots like me ought to be lucky we're accepted in society. She starts to ramble about my blue hair and how ""my kind"" is a plague upon humanity. ~~Cunt.~~ Anyways, I oblige and grab a few things for her, setting them on top of the clothing pile. Her phone begins to ring and she scream for her daughter to come get it. No response. She rolls her eyes and informs me that she's ready for a dressing room.

I go unlock the dressing room and she THROWS her purse and phone, along with the novelty items, at me and tells me that I need to watch them to prevent ""common thiefs [sic]"" from stealing from her - she's a very important lady. She screams for her daughter to join her - the first parenting act I've seen since they entered - much to my coworker's relief. 

So I'm alone in a corner of the store with no cameras. Nobody's paying attention to me because they're too busy laughing that the hothead of the store had to deal with this woman. I notice her iPhone doesn't have a passcode to it, and I have a moment's hesitation before she yells at me that I must have done something to sabotage the clothing because they don't fit right.

Right. Okay.

So I take her phone and change the language preference to Norweigan. I set her stuff down on the clothing stand next to the dressing room and walk away. The lady leaves all the clothes in the dressing room, grabs her stuff, pays, and leaves. I have no idea what happened next.

My dad pulls every string he can and makes sure every part comes from a different place around the country, and is used.

My dad looks him in the eye and calmly says, ""Well Mr..."" pauses to look at the invoice, "" Grebowski, it's a fringe benefit of my job that I can decide to use whatever parts I like.""

The guy stares at him for a while, then his eyes widen.  ""You're that crybaby I gave a ticket to.""  My dad just smiles and hands him the invoice, knowing that the guy has no choice but to pay it at this point.

I was pretty pissed off as I'd paid for the deal the day before, so this was clearly bullshit, and when I asked to just get my money back, I was told to fuck off basically.

I work as a cashier at a lovely hardware/houseware/everything but grocery store, and I was pulling an 8 hour during that wonderful season we call Christmas.

It was a normal night for December 15th, busy and cranky customers - which is to be expected, especially 10 days before Christmas. Almost all the tills are open and we're still lined into the shelves. It was about 2 hours until closing when I notice this woman at the end of my belt loading her items, even though the gentleman in front of her hasn't completed. I think no big deal of it and carry on. All is going well so far, and my shift is almost over.

So the gentleman whom of which was in front of the woman runs out of rooms for his items, so I stop the belt and manually reach for the old man who was in front of him's items. Whatever, right? Nope.
That damn woman at the back calls out to me in her mightier than thou voice, ""Excuse miss, I **need** you to move the belt. My stuff isn't on yet, and I need it on the belt so you'll complete my transaction quicker.""

I have to give her some credit, she did want to put everything on the belt at least.

So eventually both her and the man have their stuff up on my belt. Then I hear sighs. You know those bitchy, impatient sighs? Yep. A lot of those.

*Whatever*, I think, *its the holidays. She's probably got somewhere to go.*

Then I hear her shrill voice ring through my ears. She's telling the customers behind her about how long I am taking to finish the gentleman's order and then started making remarks about my goddamn appearance. I'm a short female with short blonde hair, mind you, but I can't stand when people get unnecessarily rude towards me.

I finish that transaction and its the lady I now refer to Cunty McCunterson's turn. Cunty is trying to be all nice and smiley. *Maybe she didn't know I heard her, or maybe she does know that I heard her..* So whatever, I start scanning her stuff, and begin to place it in bags. As soon as I place the first item I hear her pipe up, in an awkward trying to be nice tone of voice.

""**Excuse me** but I hate plastic bags. They're harmful to everyone. I'm kind of a plastic bag Nazi.""

I've had enough of her, so I look up at her with a dead look in my eyes and (mis)inform her that my grandma had escaped from the Holocaust and I'm Jewish.

The look on her face made the night so much better. The rest of the transaction was awkward and quiet, and I never saw Cunty again.

**TL;DR Christmas season, cunt in line, is an asswipe, calls herself ""bag nazi"", ends up looking like more of a cunt than before.**

I stared daggers at her while she walked into the CardSmart next door to GameStop, talking to myself about how much of an asshole she was, wishing there was something I could do to get her back.

I opened it up and there was about twenty of them hanging out in there, so I grabbed six of them, opened all of them at once, and splattered her door and her door handle with the spicy sauce. 

The next three minutes were pretty tense, I have to admit, because I didn't know who was going to come out first. But the gods of passive aggressive must have been smiling down on me that day because my fiance came out of the store. I told him what happened and what I did in retaliation.

My step-mom on several occasions found me (only child) and her sons/daughters doing something we weren't supposed to be doing, and she would only punish me for it, letting her kin go unscathed. She would make me feel guilty for things when, looking back on it now, I realize I was doing nothing wrong at all. I was a shy, quiet, easily-intimidated kid and she took advantage of that and bullied me. She would yell. I remember her even forcing me to drink milk at the dinner table after I told her I was lactose intolerant. She was all about asserting her control over me, which was easy because I never fought back. She never physically abused me, but all this was enough to set the seeds for issues that I still deal with as a 25-year-old man. She busted into my room once when I was naked after just getting out of the shower (I was probably 10) and I quickly covered up with the towel and, expecting her to apologize and leave quickly, I instead was told ""Oh please, there's nothing there I haven't seen before."" That in particular really made me feel violated. She made me feel guilty for wanting my own privacy. I remember being a little child and having to say ""I love you"" to her and feeling sick about it because it was such a blatant lie. In reality I was terrified of her. 

When I was 18 she wrote me a letter asking for forgiveness for how horrible she had been during my childhood. The thing about forgiveness is that you can't really force it, even if it does seem like it would ""taking the high road"". And I didn't feel an ounce of it. This letter was long. It was clearly heartfelt. And it got no response. A few months later she sent me an email wondering if I had gotten the letter. I replied with a single world: ""yep.""

I hope she feels guilty for being such a piece of shit to me during my most vulnerable and formative of years. She has reached out to me more times telling me how much she loves me and misses me.

Back in the late 80s/early 90s, my wife (lets call her Sara for this story) was 6 or 7 years old, and had an older sister (we will call her Laura) who was 9 or 10 at the time.  Nowadays, Laura has a good 3 or 4 inches on Sara, and it wasnt much different back then.

At some point, for reasons unknown to Sara, Laura got into the habit of randomly punching 6 yr old Sara in the stomach, multiple times a day.  Sara is a tough cookie, and for the most part didnt cry too much, but most 6 year olds would probably break down a little after too much of this.  Oh, Sara would try to fight back, but her being 6 yrs old and Laura being 9 and much taller than her, Sara's punches didnt have as much of an impact, and in no way deterred the actions of Laura.  This went on for days.

After 4 or 5 days of this happening, Sara was watching Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon, and saw a brilliant idea she could translate into the real world.  One of the characters used a metal serving tray as a chest protector.  

So Sara finds the thinnest, hardest cover book she can find (like a children's book, or where's waldo) and stuck it underneath her shirt.  Then she began taunting Laura, ""I bet you cant punch me as hard as you can!""  What bullying older sibling is going to turn that down?  So Laura cocks her hand back, and swings with all her might.  My wife said she heard 2 noises.  The thud of Laura hitting the book, and the crunch of laura's hand buckling from the pressure.  Instantly, Laura dropped to the floor crying hysterics.  Their dad rushes over and askes them what the heck happened.  Sara explained the whole situation with the biggest grin on her face, to which her dad responded, ""Way to go Sara!  That will teach Laura to punch you like that!""

And it did, because Laura stopped that little habit right away.

This included rotisserie chicken, buffalo or regular fried chicken, mac&amp;cheese, other sides, etc. 

A small, frail looking granny inches up to the deli counter. 

Me: Hello, how may I help today ma'am?

Her(delicate old lady voice): Yes, can I get a third of a pound of fried chicken.

Me: Yes, ma'am. 

*As my serving tongs approach the chicken she shrieks in horror as her face turns half-demonic!*

**NOOO! NOT THAT KIND! I CAN'T EAT SPICY FOODS!!!!**

In shock that she just yelled/screamed, but thinking she couldn't see that I was NOT reaching for the spicy buffalo chicken, I stammer over my words to explain. 

O-oh, n-no ma'am, these (*I point*) are not spic-

*I am cut-off*

Her: I can't believe this! Every God Damned time I have to ask for plain fried chicken! This is what happens when you let the Mexicans and Spicks (sp) in. They are ruining everything, even my God Damned chicken!

I interrupt:  MA'AM! This is not the spicy chicken, I can assure you. 

Her: You're so God Damned stupid! It has spices in it! It's spicy and I CANT EAT IT! It burns my throat! I want my chicken battered in flour! Only flour! Do you got it?

Now, it was truly not a problem to batter her chicken in flour (an option for people with allergies and maybe high-blood pressure as there is not salt added unless specified), but a simple, ""I'll have the flour-battered chicken"" will suffice. 

Flabbergasted, disgusted and slightly demoralized I zombied over to the chicken, floured it, and place it in the frier. As my finger descends to a button marked **#2** (7 minutes for boneless chicken), my brain flashes back to my trainee days. 

*A smile grows wide on my face as I remember my manager* ""Don't forget, **#2** for boneless, **#3** for bone-in. If you mix that up, you'll be serving either raw or really over-cooked chicken."" 


My finger presses button **#3** (15 minutes for bone-in chicken) and a wave of joy rushes over me. Half giddy, I tell her it will be about 10 minutes. 
She leaves. 15 minutes later I hear the frier and turn the buzzer off. I let it sit for a few more minutes. I see her creeping over and bag-up her thoroughly cooked ""**NON-SPICY**"" chicken with a smile. 

""Enjoy your chicken and have a wonderful day ma'am!""

I've heard it's almost impossible to chew or even cut our boneless chicken when left in the frier for that long. Hehehe.

My daughter has had two encounters with bullies.
One kept pulling her hair and pushing her. I talked to the teachers several times, the mother once, and the principal once. It just wasn't stopping. Finally, I told her to do what she had to. She's had MMA classes. She just didn't want to get in trouble.

I had been expecting the call for two days when the school called me to come pick her up because she had been in a fight.

He had pushed her down, tried to kick her, then spit in her face. She got up, grabbed him by his head and slammed her knee into his face, then kicked him in the testicles when he hit the ground and rolled.

I told the principal, the teacher and the father if they had done something, then my daughter wouldn't have had to finally resort to this. I took her for ice cream after I picked her up.

The second time, there was a child that kept irreparably cutting her clothes everytime the class got scissors. I took pictures of the clothes he cut, and took them to the school. I have three children. I'm a single parent. I cannot afford to buy one child five shirts and two pairs of jeans in two weeks because your son has chosen to disregard the rules for personal space. 

They told me that they were aware of it. Then why hadn't it stopped? I warned them, and the parents, that if it didn't stop, I was going to give her permission to defend herself accordingly.

That was unfortunately the second time that I had to give my daughter permission to defend herself. After he tried again, she grabbed his hand and twisted the scissors around with his fingers caught in them. That was the end of that.

Violence is not the first answer. I made everyone involved aware of the situations, and gave them ample time to fix them. My daughter is aware of the fact that we don't immediately resort to violence. But, when all the necessary steps as a parent fail to stop it, then it's time to consider alternatives. You can only be the bigger person for so long.

As a poor student in a new city, I had not choice but to go potluck on a rooming situation at a student housing complex near the school. I did not know the name of my new roommate until a week before I was due to move in, and sent her a friend request on facebook to introduce myself (She never accepted the request). Although my school is 12 hours away from home, my mom drove down with me to help me set up my apartment. Walking in, she saw my new room mate setting up the living area and greeted her with a pleasant ""Howdy!"". This bleach blond, talon manicured, raccoon makeup-ed, princess brat glanced up from her Iphone, looked my mother up and down with a disdainful look, and turned her back to walk to her room without saying a word. I was shocked at her appalling rudeness, but figured we could talk it through later when it was just the two of us in the apartment.

  I opened the fridge we were meant to share, and found that she had packed it to the point where I could hardly fit a couple of water bottles in, with cheap light beers and diet food. I stacked some of the stuff that was not too fragile so that I could make some room for my own groceries. Later when I went to go buy some apartment supplies I found she took out some of my stuff she deemed as able to ""survive outside the fridge"" on the counter (my water bottles, apples, etc).  Upon viewing our bathroom, I found that she had moved my stuff around so she got all the prime space in the cabinets and the best towel rack (don't act like you don't know there is a better towel rack in your shared bathroom lol). I was upset about all this (mainly the issue with my mother, so I text her asking if we could have a little chat).
We met later that night and she listened to what I had to say but failed to apologize. Never one to raise my voice or express the depths of my frustration, I took her ""sorry did not hear your mom"" and ""yeah, I did not realize that would bother you, you can have some fridge space"" and decided not to pursue things over for the sake of peace in our apartment.

   What I did not know is that there was a different reason other than ""she is just a brat"" that she was treating me like this. I heard her speaking on the phone to someone that ""she did not understand why she had to live with someone ""like her(me)"" and that she ""did not want to live here anymore"". I did not get the big deal, until later that week when her friends came over and I heard one of them inquire about my Dos Equis beer in the fridge... ""Oh. It's like from the motherland for her lol"", she replied. She did not know I was home so I heard her continue with some jokes about my being ""Mexican"" and a ""loner"" (not that it makes a difference, but I'm a third generation American. I'm proud of my roots but also where I am now). She got really drunk with her girls that night and went out on the town. She began the weekly tradition of bringing home a guy from the bars, sleeping with him, and leaving him face down and buck naked on our shared living room couch (never understood why he did not just sleep in her room). I was hurt. I'm a proud Latina and never really thought hard that an educated individual would be so ignorant as to judge me solely by my race. I stewed about it and being timid and not the arguing kind, chose to fall into the most awkward living situation ever with us living side by side, completely ignoring the other's presence.

   I got sick and tired real quickly of her sexual escapades and drunken messes (Did I mention she faked orgasms so loudly that even turning up my Ipod all the way could not cover the squealing sound?). I got sick of hearing her tell her mother about the ""Mexican"" and how unfair it all was. I spent a lot of time away from the apartment largely to avoid her, which helped out in the long run because I made a solid and fun group of friends pretty quickly.

   Towards the end of our time together I thought... you know what? I have put up with this long enough; Time for some payback. I thought of all the things that might annoy her and remembered the Dos Equis incident at the very beginning. If she was going to ignorantly judge me on stereotypes, then stereotypes were what I was going to force feed her. I decided that if she was going to complain about a ""Mexican"" roommate, she was going to get the full ""Mexican"" experience.

  I called up a bunch of my Latino friends, and asked if they would like to spend  the night at my apartment and get uproariously drunk. While she hid from us in her room (she always disappeared whenever I had company). They set up their sleeping bags all over the apartment, and we proceeded to get wasted on Tequila I provided, while listening to ranchero music as loud as possible. We talked about her in Spanish loud enough for her to hear, making sure we threw in her name ever so often so that she could know she was the topic we were laughing about. She came out of her room around 4am when everybody was snug in our little Tijuana of sleeping bags, and I could nearly feel the intensity of the disgust rolling off of her. It was quiet enough for me to listen as I heard her sobbing in her room, on the phone telling someone that ""They"" were here, and were so loud earlier she could hardly hear herself think. Gee, I wonder how that feels?

The rest of the semester I hardly saw her, I think she stayed at a friend's house.

Tl;dr Roommate chose to judge me based on unjust racial stereotypes, stereotypes were what I gave her.

One night, we decided to eat out in one of our fav restaurant. One of the cook there is BF best friend. He's making the best rib in the entire world, also the restaurant is known for it's amazing smoked meat sandwich. We decided to get seated in a more remote place of the restaurant because I'm an ex fatty and have problem eating in public. The waiter come to take our order, raw steak for me and a pint (or maybe more) of Creemore. Bf decide to have the rib sandwich (because rib sandwich, nuff said). Waiter is about 50 something y/o, pretty cool, apologizing because it's saturday night, it's pretty full. Two middle aged lady are seated next to us, after a certain time I start feeling like somebody is looking at me (If you suffer of social anxiety you know that you always feel that way in a crowded place) so I don't really pay attention to it. Having a good time, holding hands, talking about the beer since we are home brewers. I still feel looked at, start to feel anguish, looking around, seeing nothing ... Feel even worst because I think that I'm starting to paranoid and I hate when it happen. Then I hear the lady next to us tell her friend: Good lord, I really hate it when the employee can't talk in french! Why do they have to hire so many immigrant, they are taking jobs opportunity from our people(The bus/hostess girl is a extremely beautiful south-american girl, with the most sexy accent in the world and she's really really shy, so she barely talk to the customers when she seat them but she have a perfect french despite the accent.) Finally our meal arrive and I stop paying attention to the bitch. The food is delicious, as usual. It's like angels having an orgy in my mouth. Exchange food with the BF, ribs are as delicious as usual, waiter is kind, everything is AMAZING! 

While we are eating I hear the lady calling the waiter to her table: this smoked meat sandwich is full of fat (Well it's pastrami you know...) like big layer of hard chewing fat. The waiter being his amazing self tell her, oh I'm sorry we'll get it back to the kitchen and bring you another one free of charge. You must be pretty unlucky, we served them all evening and people keep telling us that they were fantastic, I'm sorry you felt on a bad piece, I'll be right back. This dialog ensue:
Bitch: No it's ok I will eat it anyway, don't bother going back in the kitchen I waited so long for it the first time I don't want to wait again.
Waiter: No, no don't worry, the rush is almost over and I will ask the cook myself to proceed your order in priority because you've already waited for your meal and he didn't verify the quality of the meat before making your sandwich.
B: No, no it's ok I don't mind I will eat it anyway *sigh* I'm not really hungry anymore anyway, all the fat in that sandwich made me sick *sigh*.
W: Ok then, I will cover your meal. Do you want me to bring you a coffee, a cup of tea? We also have delicious home made apple pie!
B; No no I'll pay for my dish, I don't want to eat nothing else from here.

Waiter come see us, asking if we want another beer and if everything is ok, BF telling him a little louder than usual that THE FOOD WAS SO GOOD HERE AND THAT WE WERE NEVER DISAPPOINTED OF OUR MEAL WHEN HE WERE VISITING HIS ESTABLISHMENT. 

Continue eating, barely listening to the annoying lady conversation, because steak is too delicious. Start to feel observed again, gets uncomfortable, stop eating and hold BF hand. He whisper to me, don't look but the lady next to us is looking in our direction since she arrived. That's why you feel tensed. Giving quick glances at the aforementioned old bitch. Yes she's indeed looking at us and not being real subtile about it. She starts telling her friend about girls willing to go out with ugly guys for cash or drug, basically saying they are worst than prostitutes (which I agree with) and glancing directly at me. My BF got really, really pissed, turned around and look at her directly in the eyes and tells her: No she's not with me because I'm rich, just because I have the biggest dick known to mankind. We silently glanced at her until she leave, which was done in a record time I must say.

FFW to end of the meal, the waiter come back, asking if we still have room for cake or home made pie and apologize again because we had to wait almost 45 min for our lunch. He told us that since 2 waitress called-in sick that day he did the waiting but hadn't done in in years since he's now the owner of the pub/restaurant. He also apologize for the way the lady acted earlier by complaining on her meal, almost throwing a fit for pretty much nothing (turns out the sandwich was totally fine). So we told him about what happened and learned that she use to come at least once a week, usually drunk off her ass and complain and pass comment on everyone. Since it was the first time a customer answer back to her and made her leave he paid for our drinks and decide to tell the staff she wasn't allow in anymore.

I had parked in a parking structure and moved to the passenger seat so that no one driving by would think I was about to back out and leave.

Parking was VERY tight.  I had JUST gotten in with enough clearance on both sides to barely be able to crawl out once my friend was ready to meet.  The parking spaces were just that narrow.  I had barely made it in between the lines.

Enter guy to whom I will refer to as Entitled Jerk (EJ).  EJ and his parents were, as I learned, parked to my immediate right.  EJ's mom notices that the space is very constricted.  She says something to the effect of ""Wow, there's no way I'll be able to get in on that side,"" but not in an angry or accusatory tone.  Further, there was an open space next to their car, meaning they could easily get in and just deal with crawling over a passenger seat.

EJ took it upon himself to perceive this situation as an affront to his very existence.  He noticed me in the car and started yelling.  ""Hey asshole, move your car!"" ""Come out here and settle this like a man!"" and on and on.  Being legally and correctly parked between the lines, I knew I was not in the wrong.  As a result, I did not move my car or even acknowledge him.  I simply looked at him and his parents and went back to texting on my phone.

EJ could *not* handle someone not listening to him.  He cursed more and more and started getting into it with his parents.  EJ's dad tried to calm him down, and even went so far as to say ""he's in between the lines,"" noting that there was no wrong committed here.  Defeated, he (along with his parents) gets into their car on the right side.  As they leave, his parents wouldn't look at me out of embarrassment, but I gave EJ a nice wave.

I was working in a supermarket, specifically in the candy and crisps aisle. A huge obese woman enters the aisle with her 7ish year old son. I've seen them before, they are regulars. The kid is obese too. It's not hard to imagine why as they usually fill up the shopping cart with so much food that it's literally filled to the brim. 

Now this kid is always annoying, running around screaming and being a general waste of space. But this time he was accompanied by two of his friends, which made it even worse. To demonstrate how cool he was, he kicked over a stack of boxes I'd put in my aisle when his mom was in the next aisle. There were glass pots with Dorito's dip in there, and I saw that one broke because  dip started pouring out of the cardboard box. He obviously ran away with his friends before I could say anything to him. I was too busy to give a shit. The really annoying thing is that the mother returned to my aisle. I was expecting an apology because she obviously heard boxes fall and products break as her kids ran away laughing and screaming. But no apology, she just came back for more candy. She leaves her shopping cart in my aisle and walks away, probably to grab even more food.

I'm still stocking shelves by this point when I have a brilliant idea. I put at least €50 of candy in her shopping cart. It was so full, I figured she wouldn't notice. I chucked some expensive chocolates and whatnot in there. 

She comes back and takes her cart, she does not notice the extra stuff and leaves. She arrives at the registers and screams for her son to join her. I heard this and went into the manager's office for a good view. She starts putting her items on the belt when she notices the expensive chocolate. She proceeded to scream at her son (do you know how much these are?! etc.) and the kid obviously claims he didn't put the items in the cart. His mom doesn't believe him and makes him put the stuff back, which amuses his two friends.

Sunny weather and my skin are a terrible mix (I have atopic eczema) and as such, I consistently rub my face, causing it to swell up around my eyes and a red raw rash to blossom on my neck.

During my teenage years, lots of kids who were just getting their drivers license found huge fun by playing mailbox baseball.  This is where you drive down a rural road at night with your friend hanging out the window of your car with a baseball bat.  Your friend then proceeds to smash mailboxes as you drive past like a bat out of hell.  This game was played religiously on our road every year on Mischief Night (October 30.)  And every following morning my dad and I would collect the broken mailbox parts, head to the hardware store, and spend a day re-building our mailbox.  

After a few years of this, I get the bright idea to build a decoy mailbox in front of our real mailbox.  My dad and I did this by taking a mailbox and 8ft. of PVC pipe, sinking the thing 4ft. into the ground, and filling both the pipe and the mailbox with concrete.  When completed, it was a giant immovable post of solid rock.  Fast forward to the following October 30, and my dad and I are sitting on the back porch, waiting.  Finally, we hear the screeching tires coming down the road, the juvenile shrieking of happy 17 year olds, followed by the unmistakable ""TOOONNNNNNNNGGGGGG"" of an aluminum bat hitting solid rock.

We're talking about those huge-ass industrial ones that process thousands of pages a day. There are a few smaller home-office type of printers around each cluster of cubicles for convenience.

I had to finish a pretty important report by 4:00pm today, and I needed it signed off... which meant printing it. It's a 9 page report, but there are *440 fucking pages* in the appendices. Client's request that we include every last presentation and associated document. Obviously I'm going to be printing to one of the huge printers, but the one on my side of the floor isn't installed through Windows, and it's 3:30. I don't have time for IT to come install it, so I simply print to the other huge printer across the hall.

About 75% of the way through the print job, the office secretary (who supports everyone on that side of the floor, and who I've never met) comes over and gripes about how I need to use the printer on my side of the floor. I apologize and explain my situation, and even promise to re-stock all the trays when I'm done. She leaves without saying anything. 2 minutes later she's back and lets loose a rant about how I ""need to stop tying up her resources"" with my ""inconsideration."" I had checked the printer status and my document was the only one in the queue. I just shrugged and reiterated how I would resupply everything. Then, as I'm getting my finished document together, she comes by *a third time*, with a guy who needed to print something. ""This gentlemen needs to print something! And you're still using my printer!"" I was about to point out that I was already done, and was actually about to open the tray to resupply it, but she stormed off like I personally offended her.

I said ""sorry about that"" to the guy (who clearly was as confused as I was) and headed back to my side of the floor. Time to make her day.

After I took care of my report, I headed to the guest computer and sent ""her printer"" 2000 copies of a blank page to all 5 trays. Enjoy restocking them one by one, bitch. The printer has a feature where you can make it a secure job, so you need to enter a pin number to cancel or pause the job. I took this opportunity to make my print job untouchable.

So I was at *Insert large national drug store chain here* picking up some smokes, now, being broke, I rode my bike, and locked it securely on the empty bike lockup rack outside, on one end. I go in and purchase my sweet, sweet, death, and upon going outside to scurry away to my bachelor hole, i notice someone has locked their spray-painted cheap BMX to, as well as the bike rack, my front tire. Now, I'm the nicest guy in the world, really, but that kind of dickishness/douchebaggery/idiocy sets my inner redditor off.

Now, this is the revenge:
I took off my sunglasses, and, without damaging the tube, used the arm to vent the air from his tires through the valve, and retreated to the nearby dvd vending machine to await first, my ability to leave and get out of the heat (phoenix, az) and second, my first taste of sweet, sweet, revenge.

15 minutes later, MC DBag (I named him when I saw him) saunters out of the store, takes his bike off, and, upon seeing the result of my hard work, promptly loses his shit, stringing together so much profanity that I doubt I could transcribe it without wearing out the hyphen key, before carrying his bike on the return leg of his journey.

Since we were all more or less headed in the same direction, career-wise (that is, into the Oil Patch), and since all were geology majors, we were required to take rather a lot of chemistry. Inorganic was fun, organic was even a larger bales of cheers, but detonic chemistry was were all the really inspired stuff transpired. 

Now, there has to be a certain fly in this scholastic ointment, and there was one student was thought oil companies to be evil incarnate and wanted absolutely nothing to do with those “sell outs” that would gladly trade their souls for an overriding royalty interest and opportunity to get filthy rich. 

Also he (whom we shall dub ‘Mark’) was an avid environmentalist. 

No, screw that. He was a rabid environmentalist. 

He hated, with the burning passion of a thousand blazing supernovae, any of the extractive industries (coal and metals mining, oil and gas, hell, even dimension stone quarries and gravel pits were objects of his not-infrequent vociferous denunciations) and let us all know, full well, he was studying not only geology, but the ‘softer, kinder’ “geology” that is hydrogeology. 

Bleedin’ waterheads. 

However, in order to obtain his degree, he still had to take most all the same courses as we regular land-raping, cigar-chomping, booze-swilling, small-furry-animal-abusing petroleum types. 

Two key points: he didn’t take the same amount of chemistry as we (foregoing detonic chemistry for aqueous chemistry) and he loathed just being in the same classroom with us evil, more practical, types. The upshot being is that he never learned what are and what makes (hell, for that matter, how to make) certain contact explosives, and he eschewed going to class. Rather, he’d learned that if you give a dorm room’s door a good short, sharp shock (i.e., bashing the door just above the lock with the palm of your hand), the door would flex and pop open (hell, the doors were so flimsy, you could just about knock one down with a blunt remark). He’d then secret himself inside, swipe our class notes (we took the best notes), run down the hall to the copier and Xerox the living hell out of them. 

He’d hit everyone, but give the devil his due, he was one sneaky bastard. Never the same room twice for the same course’s notes and he never left any form of incriminating evidence behind (reminding everyone the time frame of this particular sneakery, before CSI and DNA analysis). But, more than once, he was discovered with Xerox’ed notes obviously not in his handwriting. We never confronted him (I mean, where’s the fun in that?) but did concoct a plan, so devious, to extract our little slice of payback. 

Remember detonic chemistry (the science of what makes things go *BOOM*)? Well, we all had fully two semesters of this under our collective belts and had practically memorized the chapters on ‘contact explosives’. 

Contact explosives are truly wonderful compounds. Simplicity itself to whip up a batch (cheap as well, as they all used common off-the-shelf chemicals), and lie in wait to plan our next move. I won’t list the identities of  all the compounds we were creating, for fear of some less chemically-minded person trying to create a batch and end up blowing their eyebrows off, but there is one that I simply must mention: Nitrogen triiodide, good ol’ NI3. 

Very stable stuff when wet (which allows for easy transfer, as soon will be seen) and fiendishly easy to detonate, with a satisfying flash, boom and puff of purple, with the lightest touch when dry. 

So, while ‘Mark’ was in his water class, and none of us were, we ‘entered’ (ahem) his dorm room and began to paint everything he owned with NI3. It doesn’t take much and when dry, it really doesn’t show up well at all, especially against darker surfaces. Safety note: we only used the smallest amounts (though everywhere) more to pixilate, rather than annihilate. 

First was the door lock, a little NI3 on a Q-tip, and deposit it right in the very bowels of the lock, then onwards to escalation…on the handle of his toaster, on each and every knob of his little black and white TV, more on the stereo controls, on all his loose change (which he kept in a shallow bowl), much of his silverware, under his coffee mugs, we went nuts, but restraint stayed our hands as we did not paint the interior of his Koss headphones (as much as we wanted to…). 

We all retreated to the commons for a cold brew and fine cigars (thought I was kidding earlier?) and await Mark’s return. I recall that a spontaneous poker game broke out as well, so much the better for our cover story. 

About halfway through a fine maduro hand-rolled, Mark shows up, gives us all a collective grimace (think Kent in “*Real Genius*”, but without the charm) and harrumphs himself off to his sanctum sanctorum. Down the end of the hall we all sat in the commons and had a pretty good view of his room and awaited the inevitable. 

*POW* There was the first one, the old key in the lock full of NI3. Beyond a look of surprise and a muffled “bastards!”, he shrugged it off like the harmless little prank that it was. 

Keys tossed into the change bowl *BLAM*. 

Stereo switched on *KERPOW*.

Fridge opened *FAGROON*.

Mark realized he was well and truly boned. He began to get a bit manic and ran around his room slapping everything and recoiling every time some heretofore inanimate object started lusting for his giblets.  

*BLAM*, *POW*, *KERFOON*, *KERBLOOIE* and other associated noises of really, really rapid chemical decomposition. So much so in fact, that his room was actually leaking purple smog which started drifting down the hall in small cloudlets. 

After 15 minutes or so of this, Mark thinks he’s finally found all the spots we sabotaged, walks out of his dorm room door and gives us a joint sneer that if fatal, would have sent us all home in buckets. 

After all this brouhaha and communal buffoonery, it goes quiet and things, as are their wont, lapsed back into a state of scholastic serenity. 

“I wonder if he found the spot where I painted the NI3 under the toilet seat?”

A sudden flash, a muted *boom* and Mark, screeching at us with his pants around his ankles told us that, yep, he just did.

**TL; DR: Don't swipe course notes from people who have easy access to a chemistry lab.**

**BACKSTORY:** I was about 10 (Grade 4) and was in a class where our teacher made us read a book (of our choosing) every 2 weeks and at the end, we had to make a project on/about/something related to the book (Diarama, Poster, Slideshow, T-Shirt, etc). I was never a popular kid/well liked kid, but nobody rubbed it in my face except Katie Hopkins (not her real name). She was a right little smarmy bully. Had a real thing against me. Making fun of my loneliness, my hobbies and just being a cow in general.

**EVENT:** About 1/4 through the year, I read ""Danny: Champion Of The World"" for one of my projects. In my 10 year old ""creativity"" I decided to whittle a pheasant out of a potato. I spent hours on that thing. I convinced my parents to take me to multiple fresh produce stores so I could try and find the biggest potato there was. Then the right tools, getting tips on whittling, then actually doing it. 

When I finished, I was as proud as punch of that little thing. I was so proud. I was certain for sure my teacher would love it. And even if I didn't, I still was pretty happy anyway.

The date where everybody had to hand their project in came and I had my potato pheasant in a Tupperware container. I presented it, my teacher didnt care. Bit disgruntled but okay. 

Then Katie Fucking Hopkins appears and steals my Tupperware with the potato inside it. She starts teasing me and runs away with it. I try to get the teacher to get her to give it back (mainly because I couldn't run for shit) and she says she put it in my bag (which she didn't) and I was just lying to get her in trouble.

Anyway, time goes on, I forget about the potato/Tupperware, Katie's a little turd, and we're at the point where it's 3/4 through the year.

**THE REVENGE:** I'm sitting in class doing whatever 10yo's do in class when somebody starts making a fuss about something smelling bad. More and more kids join in and everybody's saying how the classroom is reeking with some musty, yucky, unpleasant aroma. 

People get up and start trying to find the source of the smell and I too get up to try and find it. 

Katie Hopkins knows where the smell is. Katie Hopkins is a little bitch. 

Suddenly, it gets REALLY. BAD. I'm talking absolutely horrid. People started walking collectively to our locker tub bay, sniffing them to see where it was coming from. Soon we get to Katie's locker and she turns bright red as the teacher gets her to pull her tub out. 

She does, and she sets it on the desk. She takes her books and stuff out and inside is my Tupperware. Leaking. Turns out, that's where she'd hid it. And that's where my potato pheasant had been festering away for a good half a year. Not a good smell.

When Katie had found it due to the first smell, she went over to see if that was it, upon opening it to see, it was, and she hid it again.

Taking the lid off, everybody saw my potato. Golly was it horrid. She took it out of her locker this time (lid still off) and her hands were so shakey, she dropped it. All over her books. 

That was a sweet, sweet day. She got in trouble for stealing. I got my Tupperware back (she had to clean it of course) not to mention she had to get new books and class stuff (having to rewrite some things out too) and my little 10yo tears from the start of the year had been avenged.

In high school, I had a classmate (let's call her C) who hated and bullied me. She and her friends were very outspoken in their dislike of me and made up countless rumors. I dealt with it quietly for a couple years because I really didn't want to deal with the drama of getting into a catfight. I hoped ignoring it would make it go away.

One day, a friend mentions that there was something very crude and sexual written about me in a bathroom stall. I recognized the handwriting immediately and knew it was C (we used to be friends and her writing was very distinctive). It was enough to push me over the edge, and I decided that something needed to be done. Sadly enough, I didn't know what to do.

Then one glorious Friday, I saw my chance for a bit of fun and revenge.

My school's broadcasting club did a short televised news show on Friday mornings, and I was one of the anchors who read annoucements and such. When I was handed the list of stuff to read, I saw the line with Homecoming court nominees. Sadly, C happened to be nominated. The candidates had already been announced Thursday at the end of the day, but no one really listens so most didn't know who the nominees were.

C wasn't one of the most popular girls, but had quite a few acquaintances who were willing to nominate her (at her request). Even though most of you probably think that getting crowned as Homecoming Queen is irrelevant and stupid (which it is), I knew that this was something she really wanted... she was not particularly smart or motivated to make much of her life, so she really didn't have much else going for her. It was my golden opportunity.

I arranged it with my co-anchor to make sure I got to read the female candidates. I ""accidentally"" didn't read her name. Final voting was at lunch, and not many knew she was nominated. So most of her acquaintances didn't vote at all and never saw her name on the ballot.

Shit hit the fan. She was beyond furious, and I had numerous people throughout the day asking me about it. I played dumb, saying that her name was on the next line and I somehow missed it. I told everyone that I was ""so sorry"" and ""felt horrible"". C knew I was full of shit, but everyone else bought it so I got away unscathed.

She lost miserably. If I had read her name and people knew she was nominated, she probably would have won. Our school tended to vote for the ""underdog"" or most tolerable of the nominees, and the others nominated were the stereotypical popular girls but only really liked inside their own circle. I saw C during the Homecoming game and in my most insincerely sweet voice, I told her ""hey, too bad you didn't win. I totally voted for you!"" She looked like she wanted to puke.

I wasn't messed with after that.

**TL;DR** Stupid girl made high school shitty for me, so I dashed her stupid dream of being Homecoming Queen.

Why is this a difficult concept?,493,104,195,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/14xz7g/dont_screw_with_people_who_handle_your_food_why/,"I'm a server at Texas Roadhouse. It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but I love it. (Also, if you're a server too or just want to read about more crazy people like in this story, check out /r/talesfromyourserver. It's awesome)  
  
As any server will tell you, you have your awesome tables... and you have tables that are total dicks.  
This is a tale of both.  
I was serving a couple of months ago and got sat with a couple. They were the sweetest people I have ever waited on. Imagine your typical very classy, very polite, old school southern black couple. They were great.  As they were getting toward the end of their meal, I got sat with a party of 6. Unfortunately, these 3 men and 3 women were the biggest jerks I've ever seen. They were nice to me (at first) but clearly unhappy with sitting across the aisle from this older couple. At first, I didn't catch on.  I asked them if everything was okay. They insisted it was fine, and I went on caring for my tables as usual. However, every time I'd walk away, they'd complain (loudly) about having to sit across from ""the niggers"" (Honestly, I hated even typing that.) Luckily, my couple cashed out and left before that word was used. Even though the couple was gone, they still complained to each other. Again, I asked if everything was okay and they started including me in their little bitch-fest. Saying things like, ""Can you believe they honestly thought it was okay to make us sit across from those porch monkeys?"" and ""This is ridiculous. I come out to enjoy good food, not to see an ape sitting near me. I thought I came to a restaurant, not the zoo.""  When I didn't join in on their racist slurs, but asked them if there was anything else I could do, they turned on me. They started complaining hard core. I told them that there was nothing I could do, and left to find a manager. Two different times, a manager checked on them and both times they told her they were fine.  This table then worked me like a dog.  They would run me as much as they could, wait until I got half way away from the table before throwing out a ""Hey, one more thing."" Whistling to call me to them like a dog. Laughing at what a ""pathetic"" job I had (while I was at the table) and just generally being dicks. 
Now these guys, as I said, were typical rednecks. They all had Tbone steaks all well done.  Of course they demanded A1. Well, because we were busy, there was no A1 in the back. I would have to get a bottle from a table who wasn't using theirs and pass it over.     
As luck would have it, the now clean table across the aisle had an A1 bottle on it.    I, very conspicuously,  picked that bottle up and sat it on their table saying, ""Enjoy your meal!!"" with the best Barbie smile and tone I could muster.  
They ate (didn't touch the A1) and then demanded a manager comp their entire meal because of the inconvenience.  
I told the manager this, and she laughed and said ""Hell no!"" within earshot of the table. I dropped off their bill and told them she just wasn't able to do it. She could only comp a meal for food related issues, and since they ate their entire meal without complaint (she checked twice!) they would have to pay.  
  
Their bill was 97.70, they left me 98.00. (So with tipshare they actually COST me money by eating.  Don't care.)

 I lost money but didn't care knowing they either had to use the A1 from that couple's table.. or eat super well done steaks that would taste terrible (not my fault they ordered extra well done intending to drown it in sauce.)
  
***TL;DR: Asshole table complains and treats me like shit because they had to sit near a black couple.  They wanted A1 for all their well done steaks.  I gave them the A1 from the black couple's table.***

I had started marinating them days before. And they were looking *good*. 

Enter roomate. I told him DONT EAT THE STEAK. I coudnt have been clearer. You shoudl not eat this steak. This steak is not for you. I put a note in the steak, specificly designed to let him know not to eat the steak.

I enter the kitchen and what do I find? A huge mess, greese everywhere. and no steaks.

Because of this, sunny Saturday mornings cause a gigantic line for the ferry to Vashon.

My brother, my two best friends, and my dog were all packed in our car, expecting to wait for roughly 2-3 ferries worth of time before we could catch a ferry ourselves. The line intersects driveways and park openings, so there are a lot of gaps in the line made from places where you aren't supposed to park.

We'd been sitting in line for about 20 mins and were thinking, ""Hey, maybe there's a chance we'll get on the next ferry!"" when a car pulled up into the gap in front of us. We weren't sure if they realized they'd skipped in line, but we made a lot of ruckus so they stuck their head out their window and asked what was up.

My brother yelled, ""You cut in line!"". The chick rolled her eyes, pulled her head back in the car, rolled up the window, and blasted music for the rest of the wait.

Meanwhile, we threw up our hands and mimed yelling (we were ready for vacation, so it was moreso just acting and making big gestures than actually getting heated) whenever we saw her eyes in their rearview mirror.

Another half hour of following this girl in line and both our cars had finally made it to the ferry dock. There was a police officer directing traffic and, since he was right next to our car and the windows were open, we said, ""Is there anything we can do about people who cut in line?""

He asked who cut, so we pointed out the car (as she was just pulling up to the ticketing counter to buy her ferry pass). He walked over, chatted very briefly with our nemesis, and we got to watch her car pull out from the normal queue and go all the way back to the end of the line. She avoided eye contact as she passed by going the other direction.

In addition, it was nice knowing that we'd headed out early on this day. I bet by the time she finally got to the end of the line she'd have had to do another hour (at least!) of late-to-the-ferry traffic on top of the 30 mins she wasted from cutting.

During this time she changed completely and was a complete bitch to me. The first year the marriage was ok and she was smitten. I had to hear lots of loud copulation which frequently made me want to barf, but whatever. The last two years of their relationship turned to not so good. Most of the time I spent in my room and away from both of them. My stepfather enjoyed making snarky comments about me when I would walk through the living room. He started blaming me when things of his went missing. I was scared of him and so I never had done anything to his stuff.

Some of the highlights of his behavior:
Couldn't find his shoes and told my mother I probably stole them and proceeded to call me all kinds of vulgar names, completely unprovoked.

Tried convincing my mother to send me away to a boarding school in England (he was British) so he wouldn't have to deal with me.

One time I was in the shower and he came home from work and started banging on the door and screaming vulgar insults at me. For what I am not sure. WHen I came out he was sitting at the dining room table not moving, not doing anything. He just stared at me with this bizarre look on his face.

He started getting into guns a lot and would spend his time in the basement messing with them. On his way up the stairs from the basement he would pound his fist on the wall and make my pictures fall in my bedroom. I slept with a door up against my door handle so no one could get in because I was terrified he'd kill me in my sleep.

He threatened to beat my mother. In his defense, I can understand this. This woman is trying in the best of times.

His 20 something son stole from my room. (I was 11-12 at the time).

So now for the revenge.
This man had barely any hair but he was very vain and would spend HOURS primping in the bathroom. In the morning before work and in the evening also. We had one bathroom and so for years I was forced to wash my hair, brush my teeth and do any ""washing"" in the kitchen sink because he would hog the fucking loo. Finally my mother came to her senses and we were to move out. The day before we did I filled his shampoo and conditioner bottles halfway with Nair hair remover. Even if it didn't make his remaining locks fall out he had super sensitive skin and it was extra strength so I knew it would irritate the fuck out of him.

Next I collected all the dead bug corpses in the basement and garage I could find. We lived in the woods so I got quite the nasty collection. I dumped this under and in his pillow case.

He was a ski instructor and skied all the time. Anyone who skis knows that you have to push your foot hard to get it into a boot. I placed tiny light bulbs in each pair of his ski boots. Don't know if it worked but whatever.
I probably should have taped tacks inside his shoes too.

**Edit I slept with a chair up against my door...lol

***Edit: he also threatened to kill my pet bird (cockatiel) once in a fit of rage and so that day forward I dragged my bird's cage into my bedroom and that is when I started putting the chair up against the door since it didn't have a lock.

I was a shy kid. I usually sat with my older brother on the bus, and I tended to mostly have friends who were older than me because they were actually my brother's friends. Well when I entered fifth grade and moved up to the middle school I got a new bus driver who was mean, incredibly obese, and absolutely set on segregating the bus by age. He yelled at me a few times for sitting with my brother. At some point I just gave up and sat in the front, sitting alone and reading books. I was pretty introverted (still am) so I didn't like talking to kids my own age. 

At some point during the year, I guess my bus driver noticed that I was reading books pretty often. He started to make sarcastic remarks about how I must be really intelligent to be reading all the time. He even came up with a super creative nickname for me: book boy. Every time I would get on the bus he'd say ""Heya book boy, whatcha reading today?"" or ""Why don't you have any friends? You need to put down Harry Potter."" Hah, not a chance. The final straw came on the bus ride home one day when he actually said over the intercom ""Will someone come sit with book boy? He needs to make some friends."" I was 10 years old.

I went home in tears that day and told my mom about how awful my bus driver was. She told me not to feel bad, that I'm a smart kid and he's just a dumb bus driver. She said that when I grow up I'll surely be more successful than him, and don't take anything he says to heart because he's just unhappy with how his own life turned out. Maybe he wishes he read books when he was my age.

I was feeling pretty good about myself after that, and I read books with continued vigor. A few days later when he was dropping me off, my bus driver finally asked me, ""So book boy, why are you always reading so much?"" And without missing a beat, I replied, ""So I don't grow up to be a bus driver."" I hopped off the bus without even turning to see the wreckage.

On top of that, a kid who lived down the street from me getting off at the same stop heard what I said and thought it was absolutely hilarious. We've been friends ever since.

This place was horribly managed and because of that it was empty most of the time, especially weekend afternoons.

We had a manager who was a server for only a couple of months before that and didn't know shit about the business. When I say manager, I am referring to the no power type of manager that can't hire or fire anyone. He was basically there to correct problems and help out wherever he was needed. 

For a couple of weeks prior to this incident this manager was being verbally abusive to staff. Whenever he got stressed out it was like he would explode and say the worst possible thing imaginable. Finally he did this to one of our well liked and pregnant waitresses calling her a whore and her husband a piece of shit. Being highly emotional she cried and everyone was pissed.

A couple of days after he insulted the pregnant waitress just so happened to be April Fools Day. There were three of us scheduled to work that afternoon. He just so happened to be kind of rude to us while we did the typical restaurant setup. 

I convinced the other two servers to play along. I called my girlfriend at the time and had her call in a reservation for 30 people. I then had the hostess do the same. I had a couple more people do the same. The kitchen staff were in on it (we didn't want them prepping for massive amounts of people and wasting good food). 

So we have multiple large party reservations all scheduled for the same time which was right away. He comes running over to us and told us to setup the tables for these large parties. We told him it was too many for just us and that he would have to help out (which was his job). He refused and went and sat at the bar and watched TV while we were supposed to be setting up.

We went to him and said ""fuck this, we quit."". We walked outside and into a little storage area we had out back. The other server had a smoke while we let the manager stew in this dilemma. We were outside for about 15 minutes and had the kitchen staff watching in case a real customer arrived.

Finally the kitchen manager came out and said the owners were there. I knew the owners pretty well so they came directly to me and asked what happened. I told them about the fake reservations, but not the fake quitting. They didn't seem upset or bothered by our prank, which was a relief. 

At that moment I looked at the manager and his face was red and he was sweating badly. He did not look well. Then it happened, a full blown breakdown. He began screaming at us, the owners, the chairs, everything his eyes could focus on long enough to yell at. His yelling wasn't making sense. He began knocking over chairs and tables. Then just like it began, it ended. He walked out. 

I was promoted to this manager position. He was not allowed back in the building. 

I later found out that when he left the restaurant he checked himself into a hospital. Apparently he had serious mental issues and our little prank triggered them worse than he had seen before. I really did feel horrible about that, but it was never our intention to break his brain. Piss him off a little? Sure. But nothing more.

I apologize for the text wall.

When I was 20 I got out of a bad relationship where I had lived with my ex. Shortly after, my ex started stalking me at work and harassing me through email, IM, text, leaving notes on my car, following me to and from my home, and it even escalated to him calling the police on me a few times. Fed up, I got the police involved myself and charged him with harassment. We had a court date and I showed up completely unprepared as I was alone and he had an attorney who grilled me until I was in tears. The judge ordered 120 days no contact.

In retaliation he then charged me with withholding the security deposit, my engagement ring, and damages (holes in walls and doors from him punching them) to the apartment that his father had fixed. I went prepared this time. I ~~hacked~~ gained access into his bank account that we had once shared and printed out records from the whole time we had been together to show that I was the main source of income and payments for the ring came out of that account. I had a copy of the receipt from the jeweler. I went to my bank and got a copy of the canceled check proving that I had paid for the security deposit alone. I had a certified letter from our landlord stating that he had given the security deposit in full to my ex. And I also had an attorney. I'm assuming he thought that I would show up as unprepared as last time because he did not have an attorney. With my evidence I was able to disprove EVERY statement that he made leaving him speechless for the first time since I had known him. At the end I sat there and watched the judge berate him and his father calling their behavior disgusting and pathetic. He told my ex that based on his behavior he doubted it would be the last time he saw him in court and told hid dad that that he was the lowest scum for ganging up on a poor innocent girl and not acting as a father figure.

She keeps reading through the previews... slightly annoying, but I can deal. When it gets to be 20 minutes into the movie, however, she hasn't made a move to put it away. It's also on full brightness, and it's BRIGHT.

After 10 minutes of me tapping on her chair like I was tap dancing, she has the nerve to turn around and say, ""Do you mind?"" Only to be met with a ""You first. Fuck off."" I then start hitting it harder (The theater is relatively comfortable, and I know that I wasn't distracting my two companions, and the people next to her were her companions, so I didn't really care if I was distracting them because they didn't care enough to tell her she was being rude.) She has apparently made up her mind to ignore me, and decides to take a drink out of her soda. That's when I gave the seat a good, **hard** kick (I was just tapping it before.) It jolts her and makes her spill her soda on her chest, dripping some of it onto her tablet.

Even better? The people around her were so annoyed that one of them DID go get the manager and they asked her to either turn off her tablet or leave the theater as she was bothering other patrons. She opted not to leave, turned off her tablet, and proceeded to huff, puff, and sigh.

**TL;DR I pretty much tap danced on some rude bitch's chair until management came and told her to put her tablet away.**",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1esepl,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1esepl/star_trek_revenge/,

The two of us finished a short shift at the restaurant where we worked as parking attendants on a day that was not particularly busy.  As we were getting into our car, these two teenagers (just slightly older than myself) peeled out and raced down the street, just barely missing several cats (had about 30 strays that lived under the docks there) whizzed past some customers and a kid on his bike further down the street.  The cars stopped in front of a house near the top of the road.

My dad drives us up along side the lovely (I'm exaggerating, she was a 5, tops) young lady and, very politely asks,

""Hey, we'd really appreciate it if you guys watched your speed on the road here.  There are customers walking all the time and kids.""

Well this bitch starts popping off about ""blah blah blah, you can't tell me what to do, bitch bitch bitch, self-entitlement to be a jackass because of it being a free country""  He responds properly.

""Please, I'm trying to be nice about this.  There are people all over down here and you're drag racing on a residential street.""

She replies, ""Well what are you gonna do about it, tell my mom?  Go ahead, she's right up there!""  and points to her house (I think this girl's about 16, btw).

My dad gets a grin on his face...  ""Well, yes, I think I will!""  parks the car and approaches the girl's mom.

She and the guy in the other car both get an ""Oh shit"" look on their face as my dad flashes what appears to be his badge at her.

Oh, did I mention he was a cop?  I think I forgot that...  Retired by this point, but he had a badge from a current job as well.

After a brief conversation he walks back to the car, still smiling.  The girls mom screams her daughter's name and makes a really angry face at her.  The girl has a disgusted look on her face as my dad gets back into the car, makes eye contact with her and proclaims just loud enough for both her and the guy to hear,

""Have a nice day!""  He then waves like a little prancing gay hobbit and drives away nice and slow, observing the 25mph speed limit.  Didn't see her driving around the restaurant for quite a while after that.

TL;DR - girl drag races in residential street endangering random civilians and lots of cats.  Dad tries to be nice, but she's a bitch, so he literally tells on her to her mom before driving away like OJ in his Bronco (nice and slow).

Part 1:  The Backstory: I grew up in a religiously divided environment (Utah).  Being a non-mormon kid generally meant you always had to be ready for rejection when you made new mormon friends.  It wasn't uncommon for the mormon kid's parents not to let them hang out with you or being shunned by your new friend's pals.  In the third grade, I made a new friend the same age on my street and we hit it off like gangbusters right away.  One day I went to pick her up from her house to go and play.  As I walked up to the back door,  an heard her step-mom chastising her saying ""I thought we already talked about this.  You are not to play with her anymore, do you understand me?""  My friend sheepishly came out and told me she couldn't play and we were both just super bummed out.  I would see her at school and we would say hi to each other, but she pretty much went back to hanging out with this boring churchy girl in our grade, lets call her 'Robin'.

Part 2:  The Act:  Robin was horribly rude to me and made a habit of rubbing it in my face that she was in good with the mutually coveted friend.  You know, typical third grade girl bullshit.  She always had this smirk on her face when passed me at recess when she and awesome friend were playing hopscotch or jacks or whatever, and of course I wasn't allowed to join.  One day, we were all playing out on the grass doing our version of gymnastics which amounted to cartwheels and round-offs.  Robin was wearing these white pants that had rainbow stitching up one leg and then went around her waist and down the back of the other leg.  Quite cool for the mid-70s, the bitch had some style, I'll give her that.  Ever the show off, Robin did a cartwheel and I noticed a crimson spot on her pants right between her legs.  Doing some quick memory work, I recalled our Life Science Library book and knew that Robin was having her monthly visit from Aunt Flow.  I knew then what I had to do.  I said ""Hey Robin!  That was the best cartwheel I've seen!  How many do you think you could do in a row though?  I bet a lot!""  Robin proudly wound up and completed 12 cartwheels right in front a watching crowd of kids.  She was really excited that her activity had drawn such a group of spectators and was gleaming when she completed her amazing acrobatic show.  Awesome friend was looking on in horror as well, and whispered something in Robin's ear.  Robins gleaming smile slowly turned to an anguished grimace, and she ran off the playground crying.  And it was fucking awesome. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1fhivd,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1fhivd/mean_girl_grade_school_classmate_revenge_mormon/,

It was a fairly large presentation that would take up the last 3 weeks of class for presenters. It was an Aboriginal History class and we were assigned a subject to do a multi-media presentation on. 

I had partnered with a friend, and 2 girls, lets call them Blonde Barbie and Brunette Barbie (or B1 and B2 for short) asked to join our group. I knew why they wanted to join our group, we both did really well in this class but we accepted anyway. 

We had a month to complete the project, but we also had final projects in every other class and final exams due the week after we were scheduled to present so we agreed that we should focus on this project first and get it out of the way. 

These girls clearly were not as concerned with their marks as my friend and I were, so we took on the bulk of the project, leaving them only 1 section each to complete. The subject was Aboriginal People in the Media and their sections consisted of 4 questions each. It should have only taken them about an hour to complete. 


My friend and I worked hard, putting lots of images of examples of media campaigns, cartoons, mascots etc and glued them to a big poster board to hang on the wall behind us while we gave our presentation. We found videos (the ""why is the red man red"" song from Peter Pan, news reports etc), we even prepared a reading where we changed some of the language in a news report and talked about how a simple change in language painted a totally different picture of the story.

About a week before it was all due I emailed the girls about sending me their part so I could add it into the cards. Of course they hadn't completed it yet. BB1 promised to have it to me by the next morning. 

I emailed again the next afternoon, this time the response I got from BB1 was ""if you stop nagging me I'll be able to get it done"". Naturally I was pissed. I told them to get off their ass and get it done or they were out of the group. BB2 called me a bitch and a tight ass. 

Naturally I went to my prof and explained the situation to her, complete with emails and they were removed from my group and given big fat zeros. 

Apparently they decided to go to the program coordinator and claim that they sent me their work and I claimed it as my own. The decision was made, without hearing from me, my friend or the teacher, that BB1 and BB2 would present in another seminar the next week and I would hand over a copy of the project. 

I handed it over, but I changed the language in the presentation so that it had a very different point. But BB1 and BB2 didn't know the material and were fairly stupid so they had no idea that when they got up to give the presentation that they would say things like ""and here is a great example of how there was an Aboriginal Presence in children's movies even back in 1953"" and their whole presentation was about  the positive depiction of Aboriginal People in the media using obviously racist examples. They received the material with more than enough time to review it and notice the changes I made if they had been involved in the creation of the presentation and if they understood the material. 

Apparently, their presentation was cut short because it was so offensive to the teacher and the class that he wouldn't allow them to continue with it. My seminar professor thought my changes were hilarious and neither teacher felt that I deserved any kind of punishment for changing the material because it was their responsibility to review and edit it.

We used to have students live next door and a little downhill from us, and they'd continually park their cars inside our property near a dodgy fence between our properties. Their place was full of junk and only had one accessible driveway where one of the longer-term students would always park. Dad was a lawn-proud man, and while he was incredibly patient with these guys, and would ask them repeatedly to move their cars, he hit breaking point one weekend there was a big race in town. Half a dozen visiting student guest shitbox cars ended up in our lawn, and he went around to protest, saying it'd gone beyond ridiculous, especially in wet weather when it'd be likely to damage his lawn all the more. They promised like they always did that they'd get the cars out and not park there ever again but hey - the race was on, they all wanted to watch it and have a decent sunday and they'd leave them there until the race was over.

As I mentioned, our back yard was uphill from theirs, and part way through the race it really started bucketing down. Dad didn't show any outward anger, but he went into town, came back with a few bottles of dishwashing liquid, and coated the whole lawn in the stuff. Come evening some of the guys needed to move their cars and when they got to the downhill slope to go out our driveway found they couldn't steer or brake.

Two made it out without much damage, but the third slid sideways, got onto the steeper part of the lawn and went straight through the fence and into one of the other students' cars and pushed it sideways into the house. Total damage? four student cars with dents, one with busted front suspension, one wall of the student rental totalled, a bunch of arrogant students kicked out, and a few skidmarks on dad's lawn. Total cost to my dad? four bucks in dishwashing liquid, a few weeks lawn regrowth and a brand new fence shared with the new neighbours, who were pretty decent people.

Dad's response to the police asking about the frothy shit on the lawn? ""White oil. kills bugs""

I was with, lets call them The Red Bank. I have savings accounts, credit cards, chequing accounts. The works. Well, turns out that the bank was suppose to be charging me ""service fees"" on the Savings account I have.  I was not aware of this nor did I get told this when I made the account 2 years ago.

So, when I saw them deduct 200$ from my savings I got a little upset. This was for service fees for the past 2 years. (in their words) I went to the branch and they said they cannot put the fees back in as it was ""something I had to pay, but wasn't"" I agreed to start paying their fee for the account if they would credit the money back in stating a banking error. They said they can't.

So I said, give me all my money out and cancel all my accounts. I'm going to another bank. The teller said ""I need to get my supervisor."" Ok, No Problem. 20 min later the ""Branch Manager"" comes up and asks me if I can get my issue resolved. I explained to him what I wanted and he said. ""No, I cant authorize that"" So I then reiterated, Give me all my money and I'm going to another bank. His response was ""HA, that will take hours even weeks to switch everything over and its not worth it""

So I left the bank. Went to the other bank I wanted to sign up with. Lets call them ""The Blue Bank"" turns out they were closed for lunch. So, I went and had lunch myself, Chicken Soup actually, and came back when they were back open. Spend 15 min, opened all my accounts and applied for my VISA card. DONE.

It took actually 30 min once all the money was deposited and I talked to the manager there for a bit. Hours eh? Nice customer retention.

Went out last night for a friend of a friend's birthday. The birthday boy's girlfriend seemed to be singling me out for the most condescending treatment ever. Every comment I made within earshot of her would be responded to with a snide remark. 

I wish I could give the best examples, but lots of the people that were there are redditors, and I could be found out. So I'll give the more generic (less awful) one: we're stopped at a red light behind a vehicle. The biatch is telling the driver, ""Just go around!"". I'm not really understanding why we would do that, since the light is clearly red, so I say, ""They don't even have their signal light on."", because I assume what the asshole chick's point is that she doesn't want to have to wait for them to go because we are turning right, and could do so when the light is red. She looks at me with disgust and says, with all sorts of rude tone-age, ""You can't go straight here."" WELL SOOOOORRRY! I don't know every street in this city as well as you. How embarrassing for me! 

Anyway, I know that doesn't seem too, too bad but, take my word for it, tone is important here and hers was evil. Not to mention it wasn't the first unnecessarily harsh ""point"" she had made that night.

Some years ago i had heard from an 'extreme' mate what the experience was like using deep heat as lube. (You know the type of guy, the type where snorting wasabi sounds like fun) So i decided to buy some new 'warming' lube to put where i would normally stash my lube except with a minor addition. I added a few squirts of deep heat and mixed it in well. 

I changed my hiding place for my real lube and forgot about it for a few days. A few days later this housemate starts a weird sexual conversation with me leading towards me having some strange sexual fetishes. Such as he had 'seen' the new lube in my room and 'heard' that it was really extreme heat.  I was trying to stifle my laughter but asked about how he'd heard it. He admitted that he'd tried some before (but not mine of course) and that it was like firing lava and that the burning was so intense for hours he couldn't get out of bed.

Got an ex (then my fiancé) a job at my company.  We split but still have to work together and we're physically in the same room together for eight hours a day, five days a week. My ex, in a successful attempt to be obnoxious, would chat on hookup-apps on his phone and leave the ringer at its highest setting so as to let me know when and how much he was sexting.  I chatted on these apps as well but I never felt the need to broadcast my business and kept my ringer off.


The Petty Revenge:

Cell coverage in the office is spotty/non-existent.  In order to chat on the apps he needed to use the office wifi.  I don't have control of the wifi or the cell towers but was still able to put a wrench in the works.  

I picked up a cheap Belkin access point and configured it to broadcast with the same ssid, wireless frequency/channel, security protocol and pass phrase as the company wifi.  I then left the router disconnected from the LAN. It would let devices connect and hand out IP addresses just fine but wouldn't provide a connection to the Internet.  He tried switching over to his cell data connection but it was too spotty/slow to use for his apps.  In order to get a cell or wifi connection he would have to walk 20-30 yards down the hall. Managers would give him odd looks because they would see him on his phone all the time.  Warm fuzzy feelings for me.


Unexpected Benefits:

I sit fairly close to some offices for mid/high level managers. My rogue access point kicked all their iPads off the wifi network.  

Now, I had been complaining to IT about the network for a while.  We had plenty of access points but they were all broadcasting on the same channel killing the network speed.  My complaining never got IT to address the issue but when so-and-so with his iPad couldn't FaceTime you bet that IT kicked into high gear. More access points were deployed and they're actually configured correctly now.

TLDR -  Ex was being obnoxious with hookup apps on his phone at work.  Setup a rogue access point to kill his Internet connection.  Side-win: IT finished setting up the company wifi correctly.

A day later, my sister came in and asked me if I knew why her brushes were stiff. I said no, and she left. I later found out that the brushes were still somewhat stiff after washing them, and if she ever used them, they would make her break out really badly.
It was immature and petty revenge, but it made me feel a lot better. The best part is that I never got caught.

I work as an intern for a large company doing data management. Now as an intern this means i basically copy-paste large amounts of information from a spreadsheet into the database; very tedious and boring work. I get two monitors to do this, so typically i will have the database on one, and my 2nd monitor split between whatever spreadsheet i am using and reddit/pandora/YouTube to keep me entertained. My boss is completely aware of this and has no problem with it. She does it all the time.    
    
So i have this very overweight coworker in the row of cubicals behind me. Not even in my department, but she is constantly over in our row to use our departments printer, because it's closer then hers. Even though each department is responsible for budgeting it's own paper and ink etc. Needless to say she's not popular round these parts.   
   
She likes to walk behind me and made snide comments under her breath about how ""we are paying our interns to watch YouTube"" and give me sarcastic ""Good Mornings"" to see if i minimize my window when i know someone is watching. (I don't). She's made reports to my manager and my managers manager about me plenty of times. Both ignore her for the most part because they are satisfied with the quality and speed of my work, so they don't care how it's getting done. But she is a massive annoyance to me.
  
**The Revenge**   
One day i just got fed up and decided to do something about this person. Luckily, the night before i had a delicious dinner with asparagus and broccoli, topped off with a protein shake. Anyone who's had protein shakes before knows, it can cause some...gastrointestinal distress. And asparagus/broccoli farts are noxious.   
   
So that day i made sure to walk past her cube on my way to the water fountain everytime i needed to let one rip and silently crop dusted the shit out of her all day. I later walked past two people in her department and overheard ""Is it just me or does Emily (the nosey co-worker [not her name]) smell like shit today"" ""No she totally does! It's VILE, dog shit smells better!""    
Victory is sweet.

My family doesn't live in stable economic conditions, so a present like this is a HUGE deal. Shortly after receiving it, Emma carelessly broke the ipod screen.

This Christmas my mother wanted to surprise her with a replaced ipod, much more affordable than the new ipod model she wanted that came out this season. I knew she didn't have earphones so I buy Emma's favorite type of earphones as a surprise (although she gave obvious hints that she wanted new earphones). 

That night, my family sits in a circle and exchanges gifts of socks, shirts, and plush toys. Emma throws my first gift aside (a blouse and an ethnography) and sighs in frustration. This upset me but I decide not to make a big deal of it. We were tired from work and just wanted to enjoy our first Christmas in years. Mother hands her a gift bag and smiles with anticipation. Emma reveals a new package of fuzzy socks. After realizing that she was not going to receive the ipod she wanted, she threw the gift bag aside and rants. I noticed the joy leave my mother's eyes as she picked up the bag and told Emma to look for more presents inside. 

""There's nothing in there! I already checked! Ugh, there's probably more socks or something."" 

Seeing mother beg Emma to take the gift bag made me really upset. After a few words of encouragement from everyone else, Emma finally takes the gift bag and finds it. She doesn't smile. She doesn't say thank you. She gets up and leaves with her ipod. As Emma walks away I remembered the earphones I was going to give her. *Heh*, well have fun listening to music without earphones.

WARNING, WALL OF TEXT.

My family wasn't able to afford a plane for a long time, mostly due to the fact that my dad wasn't able to get a job yet. But then, this summer my dad got a job. What does that mean? PLANES!

We got first class tickets for the three of us, Mom, Dad and me. So when we got to the airport we were ready for our 10 hour flight. On our way to our seats we met a nice lady sitting 2 seats ahead of us, turns out she was 9 months pregnant with triplets. When the line in the middle of the aisle started moving again, we said goodbye and went to our seats.

If only it was that easy.

When we get there we meet the most rude person I've ever meant. This lady wasn't taking up just one of our seats, oh no. She took all 3 of them. ALL, 3 OF THEM. Never mind the fact that she was only 5'6, Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing wrong with pregnant woman. The only thing I hate is this woman's reason to do this. Attached is
the conversation that took place.

Mom: Um, excuse me, those are our seats.

Random Woman: Yeah, so?

Dad: So we payed a lot of money for those.

RW: Well, I payed a lot of time being pregnant.

M: That isn't a valid-

RW: (Cutting Mom Off) Look lady, I don't care how much you paid for these seats, I'm sure that they have 3 seats open back in economy class.

D: Actually they don't, this plane was completely booked-

RW: (Cutting My Dad Off Now, Practically Screaming) LOOK, I'M 7 MONTHS PREGNANT, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE FORCED OUT OF MY SEAT WHENEVER YOU WANT TO GET INTO IT.

Me: (Loud enough for people to hear it) Hey, random woman, the lady in front of us is having triplets, if she can still be a nice person while she has 3 times as much children than you have, then you don't have an excuse to take up 3 seats in first class.

Right after that, a stewardess came over and escorted her back to her seat, while everyone was staring.

This went well, and all of us got along fine. We weren't terribly strict about using other people's stuff, it was okay as long as you weren't using it all, replaced it quickly and asked the owner beforehand. Very civil, and things continued nicely for a couple of months. 
   
Then began the washing powder drama.   
   
As I discovered, washing powder is quite expensive so we all agreed in the house to buy our own. One of my friends had noticed her fancy brand name tablets were running out very quickly, so she decided just to keep them in her bedroom. I disagreed with this, because it's I didn't think I should have to lock my stuff away so some dickhead wouldn't use it. Especially after we had stated clearly not to use each other's laundry detergent, and everyone had agreed.   
   
So, as female friend's stuff was now unavailable my own started to be used up rapidly. I could normally make a box last a couple of weeks, however this person was clearly washing their clothes every other day. I left a note on the box, explaining how much it cost and that it was expensive as hell having to get a new box every four or five days. I came back a few days later to find the note **ripped up** and stuffed into the opening, as well as the box being significantly lighter than it had been since I used it last. Cue my petty rage.    
I managed to narrow it down to one possible roommate - let's call him D. Generally a good guy, but with the capacity to be an enormous dick.  I waited until I was the only one home, carefully removed all the detergent from the box into a sandwich bag, and replaced it with a mixture of salt and zero calorie sweetener. This was months ago, and I am still topping up the box with salt, and occasionally other condiments just for spite.   Bonus: he buys the salt. 
   
Every time he complains his clothes 'smell strange' or 'feel itchy' I'm filled with the pettiest of glee. Don't use other people's stuff unless you want them to fuck with it.

Jay dated this girl, Hannah, for about a year. And from what I hear, it didn't end well. Soon after, she started banging one of Jay's best friends, Adam, and they started flaunting their new relationship all over Facebook.

Obviously, Jay found out about it. They came to him with the, ""We meant to tell you first, we didn't want you to find out this way"" blah blah blah.

There is a block of time reserved for P90X, Insanity, 5 Minute Abs, etc and there is a core group of us that will do a cardio dvd together a couple times a week.
There is one girl that just seems to be a pain in the ass, I could sense it from the first time I met her, and could tell that the other people didn't really interact with her as much, even though they all work in the same office.  We all agreed to listen to music during the workouts, and not the cheesy music the dvds come with, for variety and so on.

The first time Julia showed up to the ""new and improved"" music workout, she walked over and turned the tv up almost all the way, presumably so she could hear Tony Horton and Shawn T telling you to ""give it all you got"" or whatever.  It's not like she couldn't look at the video, or the other 10 people doing the workout if she didn't know which jump-squat-punch-plyo-hip-shoulder-burner thingie we were supposed to be doing!

So now we have music playing with the tv speakers blaring over it.  I made a comment about how i'd turn the volume down on the music and then we could lower the tv volume because the wall of noise was a bit much.  Oh ho ho ho, you silly bastard, why did you think reason would work?
She walks over and turns up the tv again.  Nobody said anything so I could tell that this was normal behavior, and I just let it go.

I hadn't seen her in a while due to the holidays, but last Friday she was back.  You know what happened.  However, on Friday I was sick, as I have been fighting a cold, but I knew an intense cardio workout would help clear this thing out.  Well, Julia kept going to get water from the fountain in the middle of the exercises and had to walk right in front of me every time.  We were already jumping around and breathing heavy, so it was easy for me to camoflague my ""extra"" heavy exhalations every time she walked in front of me. I willed my cold germs to fly out of my chest and up her nose: fly, my lovelies, fly!  Sometimes I would even see some spittle head outbound as well, beautiful!  (I did not intentionally spit on her, that would have been nonproportional to her offense)

I thought about posting it to this subreddit but said ""nah, that's dumb, too petty.""  Until today when I saw the greatest email of all time in my inbox:  ""Sorry guys, I can't work out today, I'm fighting a cold.""

It wasn't severe enough that I needed my tonsils removed but I was told by the doc that had I waited any longer to see him then I'd have likely had to go to the hospital - so it was pretty bad. 

**Scenario:** My friend's birthday was this past Tuesday and he was having a small little get together at his place before we went to the clubs later. Everything was going well and we eventually got to a club that night.

I ordered myself a drink at the venue and was enjoying it when our group decided to go for a small bit of dancing. Being the naive person I am I put my drink down on a railing right next to where I'd be dancing and hoped it would be safe. I was wrong. As soon as I stepped away from the drink I saw out of the corner of my eye a girl scurry by and pick up my drink on her way. Naturally I wasn't going to let her get away with it so easily so I caught up to her and explained that she had my drink but she was having none of it. I placed my hand on the drink and tried to explain some more that she may have taken mine by accident because it was definitely my drink. She then jerked the drink away from me and spilled half of it on the floor and over me. At this point I didn't care for the drink any more and just said ""Fuck it, take my drink"" and walked away. 

**Revenge:** Remember that tonsillitis? Tonsillitis is rather contagious, or at least the case I had of it was according to the doc. It could get passed onto somebody else by kissing them, coughing on them, or quite delightfully drinking from the same container as an infected person. Yes, I had warned my friends of this earlier as a just in case measure, but I didn't warn this girl who stole my drink. I did think of it but by this point most of the drink was either on the floor or on me so I simply didn't feel like it. I had slobbered all over my glass before she stole it and now she was slobbering all over it too. Enjoy your tonsillitis girl, maybe next time you'll think twice before stealing somebody's drink because you've no idea what they may be infected with. It should also be noted that visits to a doctor here normally go for about €50 and the anitibiotics for tonsillitis I got were about another €20. How's that for an expensive drink?

I'm not really Tim the Toolman, but more like Wilson with a lot of Tim's tools. I do the things that are too small to call in a contractor for, or fix something a spouse has ""fixed"" and to make it look like I was never there. 

Now I deal with all sorts of problems from plumbing to electrical to setting up and maintaining a network system for the HOA. I even whack the moles occasionally when the landscape guys can't get to em. 

This means I'm all over the place almost every day just doing my thing. I don't ask for a lot, and most of the folks are genuinely happy someone can help them. Especially the spouses of those who watch way too much HGTV. Oy. 

Anyhoo... 

Ernie is a condo commando. He hates everyone, and since his wife is dead there's no reining that asshole in. He goes around with a yardstick to measure peoples grass and where they park. If your bumper is an inch over the sidewalk, he slips a ""I'll have you towed!"" notice under your wiper blade.

A real winner. 

I've gotten tired of the petty bullshit from listening to him rail at me for being blue collar and proud of it and the snark when participating in the monthly HOA meetings. So it was time to fuck ol' Ernie over. 

One fine day I went out to HD and picked up a couple 15 pound bags of chicken manure, a couple packets of toilet gel powder and a new bucket with a spout lid. Now if you've worked with bagged chicken shit, it's a half liquid half solid all nasty mixture. 

This stuff went into the bucket for storage out in the hot sun to ferment while I waited for night to fall. Around 3am, I wake up and put on my coveralls and grab my pipe wrench and bucket of shit and walk over to Ernie's place. I make sure to avoid the streetlights, just for safeties sake. 

Once there, I open the white drain cleanout plug for his sewage system and set the funnel up on the bucket. The reek from the fermented manure was horrible, and if anything, it had gelled up worse than before. The bucket contents went right into the cleanout and just sat there clogging the pipe like some horrible Jello nightmare. 

On went the cleanout pipe cap and off I went back home. I cleaned the bucket out and stowed it so there'd be no evidence. Then went back to sleep, content in knowing that no amount of flushing and plungering would dislodge that giant hunk of shit now lodged squarely in his pipe. 

Cue the midday: Ernie has Roto-rooter out there and they can't get rid of the clog because it merely gets sliced apart and then slumps back together. They've got to water-ram and slice it and vacuum it all out. This takes a few hours to do. All this time Ernie's fuming and getting pissed off like noones business because of a giant plug of shit.

The back of my parents property that connects to the neighbor is a 6 foot high retaining wall(the back street is slightly higher for some reason) that is their backyard. The garage butts up against this retaining wall and the shed is a few feet away from the wall. Zoning laws in my states say you don't need a permit to build something small like a shed if it is 10 feet away from the property line and the shed is 5 feet from the wall. So they want my dad to tear down the shed and move it five feet. My parents pay to have a surveyor come and tell them where the precise line is for the property line.

Now, in Korea, places like this would have often dirt-cheap clothing (quality akin to that of Forever 21) so it was fun to peruse the wares and occasionally buy a cute skirt or scarf that would fall apart in a month. But more often than not, I would go with a friend or two – mostly my American friends who were studying the Korean language/working as English teachers because at the time I was incredibly homesick despite being 100% Korean and fluent in the language. 

One particular afternoon, a friend suggested that we go to a department store/mall because she was going home for the holidays and wanted to bring back some nice gifts. In Korea, it’s very common for department store/nicer boutique employees to follow around the customer and ask questions because most department store employees worked on commission. Both of us had shopped in relatively “fancy” places  (considering the fact that anywhere that wasn’t an outdoor market is considered rather upscale), so we knew that the sales ladies tended to hover so we weren’t bothered by it. 

So as we were enjoying ourselves, drinking coffee, window shopping and speaking in Korean – me fluently and my friend practicing hers - we entered this adorably cute store. We both were looking at different things when from behind me, I heard a rude saleslady tell a customer that she was too chubby to fit into their clothes and would the foreigner please get out? I turned around – and there was my friend, getting picked on by this… this… *bitch* of a sales lady, trying to explain that the item she wanted to buy wasn’t even for her and she was buying it for someone else, all the while nervously stuttering in what was obviously not her first language. And the whole time, the salesbitch had the **nerve** to look smug about having the upper hand because the other person couldn’t even comeback to what she was saying, nevertheless apologize!  Meanwhile, I was shocked and didn't even realize that when the entire ordeal was over, we sort of stumbled out of the store, me overwhelmed, frustrated and totally blind sighted and my friend in tears.

Later that week, even after my friend had calmed down and probably brushed off the incident as a one-time bad experience, (she was incredibly sweet but meek like that), I was still upset. Furious, even. I decided that I would get my petty revenge. So I stalked the saleslady; I would go back to the store every once in a while in hopes of seeing her there. It wasn’t until about a month later that I managed to catch her and by then my anger had cooled – but my desire for revenge hadn’t. I wanted to get even. 

I walked into the store pretending to talk to an imaginary person my cell phone – but in English. Now, in Korea, all students are expected to learn English until they graduate high school – from as early as kindergarten. Koreans also pride themselves on being able to speak it well (mostly conversational stuff only) and most department stores around the more popularized areas like Hongdae or Apgujung where there are lots of tourists, management tends to hire people who can speak English (relatively speaking). So, I’m browsing around in the store, the salesbitch hovering at my shoulder until I pretend to turn around and catch her eye. Having overheard my “conversation”, she comes over with a toothy grin and asks me – in English – if she can help me with anything. She was clearly proud of her ability to speak “fluently”. Well, I wasn’t about to take that from her. I proceeded to grill her about every article of clothing in the store and then some, purposely using longer words than necessary and asking if items could be shipped to different places and if they had different colors and if the sky was blue and the grass was green and whether the cow jumped over the moon – all in English. By the end she was visibly sweating and struggling to please my uppitiness in hopes of getting a sale. 

Finally another co-worker (boss, maybe?) came out from the back/helping another customer and saw my impatience and the salesbitch struggling to close a sale and unknowingly asked me in Korean if there was anything that she could do to help.  I just looked at the terrible saleslady in the eye and in fluent Korean responded with a, “Nope. I don’t think that there *is* anything you could help me with. Thank you though, and have a nice day” and then walked out after having wasted her time.

**tl;dr:** While in Korea, I pretend to not speak the language (despite being Korean) to get gloriously petty revenge on a bitchy sales lady who was rude to my friend.

Bully get hoisted with his own petard!,457,74,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jdzzq/bully_steals_my_lunch_bully_get_hoisted_with_his/,"This is a bit long, but I am confident it will be one of the most satisfying petard-hoistings you will read this week.  But only you can be the judge of that...

---------------

Norman was my locker partner in grade 7.  I guess our school was too old/poor for each kid to have their own.

Norman was in grade 8 and was much, much bigger than me.  Norman always wore a jean jacket and smelled like cigarettes.  Norman had a very bad attitude and he was also known for beating the holy hell out of anybody at any time for any reason.  I, like everyone else, was extremely afraid of him.

Now then...

Every day I would bring my lunch in a brown bag.  And Norman would steal them at least once a week.  He wouldn't rip it out of my hand or anything, no, I would just go to my locker at 12:00 and it would be missing.  Guess who?

I let it go once, twice, ten times until I just could not take it any more.  But I had a problem.

I could not simply ask Norman to stop taking my lunches, because that would be me *accusing him*.  I could not go to the teachers or my parents, because that would be me *accusing him*.  In the ~~logic~~ thought process of a couple of 12 and 13 year old kids, you could never tell somebody to stop stealing your lunch without hard evidence that they were actually the one stealing them!  Why that would be the most outrageous accusation anybody could make and would most certainly be deserving of several thrashings and a lifetime of being on the bully's shit-list!

Does this make sense to an adult?  No.  But when you're 12 years old the rule is this: the school menace does what he wants when he wants and your job is to take it and like it.

Anyways...

I knew I had to do something to stop this.  I also knew that I had to do it in such a way that if he ever confronted me about ""getting him back"", that it would mean he'd have to basically admit that he was stealing the lunches.

I hatched the perfect plan.  I make the most sumptuous lunch any kid could want.  Two luscious PB &amp; J sandwiches with the jelly bursting at the seams and not one, but **two cans of Pepsi**.  The stack of Oreo cookies would surely make this a lunch no hungry child could resist stealing. But of course, I put my special twist on the lunch.

At lunch time I walked as casually as possible to my locker, but my mind was racing and I wanted to sprint.  But no, I had to play it cool.  I unhitched the lock and opened the locker door.  Would the lunch be there?  Would it be gone?  Please please please let it be missing....

The lunch was gone.

I won.

Flawless victory.

What Norman didn't know, but discovered upon first bite, was that I had taken the peanut butter and mixed it with fine sifted sand from the playground.  What looked like a perfectly delectable sandwich was actually 6 hours of sand in his mouth with sticky, oily peanut butter keeping it in place.

Not a word was ever spoken and he always treated me with a lot more respect after that day.

There was a certain twinkle in his eye the next morning when he said ""Hi Plorf"".  The look was undeniably there.  It said ""You got me dude.  Checkmate.  Check Fucking Mate.""

Anyway, I always bring my own bags.  So, after putting my stuff on the counter, I handed my bags to him.  He tossed them right back into my cart, ""I don't use cloths bags!""  and he went on some anti-global warming rant.  I don't even know what all he said because I was too pissed.

So, I let him ring everything up and bag it and then I said, ""If you're not going to use my bags, I'm not going to pay.""  and I walked out without my stuff.

I had gotten the job right before the recession hit, so once I had gotten sick of it and started looking for a new job.. there were no jobs to be had. So, I was stuck working there for about 4 years.

This guy was co-owner of the store, and although he liked me at first and gave me a raise, he started to really hate me. I think it had something to do with the fact that I'm a strong, independent woman and the family who owned the store was a conservative Arabic family. He would expect me, as a female, to shut up and take my medicine when he was having a bad day, and I wouldn't give lip service to any of his bullshit. He even tried to fire me once and the other two co-owners stopped him, because I was their best salesperson and they would have lost a lot of money.

One day I came in to work on a Saturday, and I was dead sick. My face felt like someone had punched it in, red eyes, fever, snot, sore throat, the works. I was absolutely wrecked and I came in anyway, because it was supposed to be a busy weekend and I didn't want my co-workers to suffer or lose sales from being understaffed.

This asshole comes in and sees that I'm sick. He says, ""Oh, faking sick because you want to go home early huh? What a coincidence that you seem to get sick on a Saturday, huh?"", trying to imply that I was lying because I wanted to go out and have a good time because it's the weekend. I want to mention here that I basically never ""party"".. I hate loud music, I don't like drinking. My idea of a good time is to be at home with a book.

He then proceeds to give me shit all day long, making me do the hardest work lifting the heaviest boxes when there are 2 other dudes working there stronger than me, insulting me, accusing me of lying.

Then, around 4 pm, he goes to the coffee shop to get his usual afternoon coffee. When he comes back, he sets his coffee right down in front of me on the counter, and goes upstairs to the bathroom to take his usual afternoon shit.

I stared at the coffee, realizing that he had happened to set it just right in the spot where the security cameras couldn't see (he would often watch us on the cameras so he could criticize us for the things he did when he wasn't there. I would often sneak into his office and check the camera angles so that I could hang out in the spots the camera couldn't see without getting yelled at).

I made a split second decision. I opened the lid of the cup, and just.. exhaaaaaaaaled, ever so gently, into his to-go cup, making sure to blow my diseased air especially on to the condensation forming on the bottom of the lid. I then quickly placed the lid back on, no one saw me, not even my other co-workers.

He came out of the bathroom, got his coffee, and went upstairs to his office, none the wiser.

He had another business that he worked at during the week, so the next time he came in was the following Saturday. His cheeks were swollen, eyes red, and you could tell he was in pain from the feeling of being punched in the face by my germ attack.

""Aww, are you sick?"" I asked sweetly. He just nodded and went to his office. I had told my coworkers what I had done (they hated him too) and we all had a good laugh.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16l56a/delayed_revenge_on_a_hs_teacher/) story reminded me of a three generational petty revenge story.

Now I have a similar story, except with my sister and SO. Now, this teacher was actually reasonably nice, but horribly sexist towards the male members of the class. In fact, not only had she been my teacher, she had also been my SO's (who is 4 years older than me) and my little sisters (who is 4 years younger than me).

Now, to the first generation that had her, my SO. He did well in class, and is quite a tech head (now a mechanical engineer). He, however, was not exactly her favorite student. He wasn't loud or disruptive, just right when she wasn't, specially surrounding technology. 

One day, she was trying to set up the classrooms for presentations, with a projector (one that is attached to the ceiling). Nothing was working for her, so my SO, who was already at the class computer setting things up, got up to turn the **POWER** on that connected to the projector, instead of by the remote she was using. Apparently this was so rage inducing that she yelled at him to sit down so she could fix it herself, and kept on pressing the same button on the remote, expecting it to work.

By this time, everyone is ether bored or messing around, the teacher in question is ignoring the students that say to flick the power switch, and my SO just wants to get his presentation over and done with. So he gets up again, and turns on the power, despite her continuously yelling for him to sit down. He then looked over at her. His exact words to her were:

**""Fuck you, I'm going to lunch""**

And off he went to lunch. 

Now, the repercussions for this were little, due to her calming down and not asking that he be suspended or anything, and other teachers knowing that he was a well behaved kid at school. It was an amusing story we all told for a while.

Then it came to be MY turn to be in her class. 

So, I'm going through the process of trying to graduate, going to classes and being a good little kid. I remembered the story of my SO (who wasn't my SO at this point, but a good friend), told to me by various friends. It was notorious in the school now, and with my SO being my best friend at the time, I knew the circumstances surrounding it (along with the sexism going on)

I was sitting in the same class, same teacher, even the same room. We had a few more computers in the room this time around, and people were doing some assignments. However, one of the computers was not working.

Myself, I am a reasonable tech head. I can work my way around building a computer and know how to not fuck things up, along with some pretty awesome Google-fu. I'm notorious for finding answers (which helps now in uni).

So, I go over to the computer to find out what is wrong. Being in Australia, in summer, the room is very hot, and the computer has gone and over heated. So I just say to leave it alone, and instead use another computer (there were two spare), while letting this one cool down. 

But no. The teacher comes up behind us, orders me to sit down and to let her fix it instead. Thank goodness the student had already saved his work.

All she did was try and keep turning it on again and again, despite it turning itself off at about the time it reached the BIOS screen. Nothing would placate her... she would make it work.

So, I stand up, walk calmly next to her and say ""It's clearly over heated. If you wait about 15min, it will probably turn on just fine"". All I hear back is a barrage of nonsense about how it was 'working this morning' and that all the computers SHOULD work in this heat. She then told me to sit down and let the real computer people deal with it, while continuously trying to turn it on. My exact words were:

**""Fuck you, I'm going to lunch""**

And off I went to lunch.

Now I didn't get off as lightly, being a trouble maker at school (mainly borne out of the fact I was fairly socially isolated from being in a defense family). I had a week worth of detentions, but attended only one of them. That is a story for another time though...

**NOW,** at this point, she hadn't really put two and two together to realize that my inspiration came from my to-be SO. So, I've graduated from school, told my little sister all the fun tales I had from that school, and watched her go off into the same class, while I went to uni.

Now my sister is in the same position as my SO and I all those years ago. Except this time, everything has been upgraded. New projector, new computers, and each student was loaned out an iPad from the school (don't ask me why. She said she never really used it, and would have preferred a laptop to borrow). 

My little sister is not as much as a techie as myself or my SO, but can work her way around trouble shooting and basic network connection issues. Better than most really. So, while she was sitting there, looking on her iPad, she comes across an exercise given to her by the teacher that linked to a website that wouldn't work on the iPad (heavy flash content). 

So, she shoots her hand up, and explains that the OS on the iPads would not work with the site she had given, and asked for an alternative site that would give her the same information. All she hears back is a tirade of assurances that the site SHOULD work, and she had probably done something wrong with her iPad to cause it not to work. 

My sister interjects, and mentions that flash does NOT work on the iPad, and shows her, by visiting a few other safe for school sites with flash on them. This still does not convince my teacher, who, instead of listening to her concerns about actually wanting to learn (she was on a scholarship, requiring good grades), took her iPad away, and said she would return it later that week when she has the IT guys look at the 'obvious' problem that was wrong with it. Her exact words were:

**""Fuck you, I'm going to lunch""**

And off she went to lunch.

Now, this was the final straw for said teacher, because she had finally pieced together that all three of us were in on the original story (I was dating my SO by this point), and became furious, trying to stop her from leaving, by standing in front of the door, rambling on about how she was going to be suspended for this. Unfortunately for her, my sister literally just climbed out the window next to the door, with her books and all, and walked away. 

My sister did not get in any trouble, as the school found that the teacher was at fault, and had in fact been making several classes of frustrated students access flash heavy sites for ages. In fact, for the rest of time my sister was at that school, she received no more grief from said teacher, and the teacher started taking advice from students.

I had three roommates: Apple, Orange and Melon. 

* Apple- Apple was clever. She refused to stop smoking weed, but knew the university had a heavy fine for being caught smoking legal or illegal, so she mainly squatted at her dealer's apartment and I had no problem with that.
* Orange- She was from a VERY small town, was easily intimidated and simply wanted to be left alone. We get alone just fine.
* Melon- Melon was the problem.

When you applied to the dorms, you checked off what you liked and disliked in terms of noise level/study habits and guests. Apple, Orange, and I all wanted quiet, no guests and we all took school very seriously. Melon wrote the same thing on her application, but that was a lie. She wanted to party and she wanted to party hard.

It started with her leaving her room for days at a time, and not turning off her laptop, which played an Adhan (Muslim call to prayer) 5 times a day and had to be shut off manually. At first, it wasn't bothersome, everyone makes mistakes and a quick call to the RA and she came down, keys in hand and turned it off. But, it began happening 5 days a week and finally, I complained that this was driving me insane. Melon was given orders to fix the problem, she turned the function off.

Cleanliness: There were 2 bathrooms to a dorm room and Apple and I shared, so I basically had my own bathroom, and Orange and Melon shared. Orange tried once to ask Melon to clean the bathroom and Melon snapped and began screaming at her, threatening her and this began the bullying (I didn't learn about this for months).

Revenge the first: I walked into the dorm room and smelled pot. I checked Apple's room, since she openly admitted to smoking and she was squatting still. Orange wasn't in and that left one person. I put my ear to the door and heard a large group of people and turns out, Melon decided to have a 'pot party', fully knowing that the 4 of us agreed to have no smoking at all. The fine was huge, and I hate the smell of any smoke. I casually walked down to the RA's room and told her I smelled smoke from Melon's room and I had some papers RA needed to sign anyway, so why not come to my room and sign the papers. RA comes, smells smoke, opens door and finds the smoking and Melon is busted with a 600$ fine.

Revenge the second: Melon liked friends, and she liked having her friends over. But never at reasonable times, she would invite her friends over at 3-4AM, during midterms, finals and they'd be loud. I got sick of this immediately and I tried asking Melon to have people over when her roommates weren't sleeping. She told me to ""go fuck myself"" and if I wasn't having people over at 3-4AM, I must have no friends. Not sure about that logic. So, after she invited a bunch of guys over who began yelling to each other about what food to order, I got my revenge. She left her keycard on the table and these cards had to be swiped to get into the building and your personal room. The first time, I simply de-magnetised the card and the second time, I threw the card away. A replacement card cost 40$ This wasn't working, so I came up with a better plan: I de-magnetized the new card so when she tried to come into the dorm room at 3AM with a bunch of drunk assholes, the card didn't work and she began banging on the door and rattling the knob. This time I called the RA and security and said I thought someone was breaking in. Caught with a bunch of drunks that early and with that level of noise cost her 150$ in fines

Revenge the third: No animals were allowed in the dorm. I was hearing scratching noises and I was worried about mice or rats (Melon was filthy in terms of food disposal and storage) and I knew she wasn't home but she'd propped her door open. I poked my head in and lo and behold, there is a rodent of some sort (gerbil or hamster) in a massive cage. I got pissed off because there carpet had urine and faeces on it and I'm fairly sure that urine and faecal matter probably could carry some sort of disease. I closed the door and called RA and said there was a scratching in our room and I was worried about rodents. RA came and opened Apple's door, finding nothing. My room had nothing and Orange's room had nothing. But Melon had a rodent! That was a 500$ fine for the animal and something else for carpet cleaning.

I think Melon began to get suspicious of me, I always made sure that it was other people busting her and I always planned things well. If she did, she never tried anything. But I was unaware that Melon was taking her anger out on Orange. I liked Orange a lot, she was sweet, shy and could not be mean if she tried. I was writing an essay once and I heard noise that was louder than my headphones and I slid them off and heard Melon SCREAMING and threatening Orange. I opened my door and saw Orange in the corner, crying and trying to ball up and Melon was standing over her just shrieking, I called the RA (for non nefarious purposes!) and grabbed Orange and let the RA restrain Melon. This time a big meeting was called and Orange spilled everything: Melon was stealing toiletries from her, eating Orange's food etc etc. 

The rules were set: 

* No guests in the room from 9pm to 9am (Melon was furious)
* Melon had to pay Orange for the toiletries and food
* Melon was told that one more toe out of line would incur a massive fine
* We were all told to basically stay away from each other
* When final exam time came, no guests period. For anyone.

I felt really guilty that I never knew what Orange was going through, I apologized a lot and I kept watch.

My last revenge: At this point, we were getting close to the end of the school year and Melon's parents were calling a lot and were furious at the amount of money she had accrued in fines. And I really thought she was going to stop being such a dick, but I was wrong. Melon decided to blow off some of her final exams (genius!) and have a bunch of friends come over. They came over at 4AM and tried to have a 'quiet' party. I woke up because I heard glass breaking on the floor and vodka began seeping under my door. I had an exam in the afternoon. I did NOT need this shit. Melon knocked on my door and I feigned sleep and when I heard her say ""don't worry, she's not home"" I called the RA and let the hammer fall. Her parents were called and they apologized to Orange and I and I'm not sure what the final fine was. She had planned to spend her third year of university in the dorms again, but the RA was so frustrated with her asshole behaviour, she wrote a letter to the head of the board and said that letting her back into the dorms would be a huge mistake.

The last time I saw her, her parents were loading her shit into a van and she waved at me and it hit me. I don't think she really knew it was me. The whole year, every time she got busted, every fine was because of me. There is something very pleasurable about anonymous revenge, I'm not sure how to explain it.

TL;DR: Over the span of one year, I made sure that my roommate was fined for every asshole thing she did. She does not know it was me.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_12pmv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/12pmv9/one_year_of_revenge/,

One of my biggest pet-peeves is rude people in the drive-thru. The worst ones always come through there. One particular thing I hate is when the car will drive off before I have finished speaking. So, on this fine day, after about 4 hours of my shift have passed, this entitled asshole pulls into my lane.

First of all, this guy has a loud, obnoxiously jacked-up truck. Loud enough that I am about to ask him to turn off the truck. But, nooooo, asshole doesn't wait for me to greet him; he starts yelling his order out. I try and interject, asking for him to please turn the truck off. Nope; can't hear me cause' his truck is too loud. 

Think I get the order correct, and punch it all in. Bigmac meal upsized with a large chocolate milkshake. Proceed to start reading off the total -- asshat drives off (rather abruptly and fast. I also hate when people speed through the drive thru.) I don't usually try and get revenge, but today had been a particularly rough day and I was cranky. 

You see, our milkshake machine is a piece of crap. If you're not careful, it will over-flow (even though it's *supposed* to be automatic.) It also happens to dispense vanilla as a default, if the syrup is out for the flavor you pushed. Now, on to the revenge.

I fill up this guys cup with vanilla, until it is jusssst about full. Then I top it up with chocolate, making sure to let it spill over a bit. Enjoy your vanilla shake, and getting your hands sticky, sucker! And the best part is, if he came back to complain, it would be blamed on our faulty milkshake machine!

Since most of the people at my school are technologically inept, I'm often the one fixing these problems as they aren't that difficult, and also I have the patience to figure them out. I refer to the printer as, ""Girl,"" and after I fix it I always make a joke to the person I'm fixing it for that, ""you just gotta talk to her.""

Anyways, one day I'm minding my own business, using the photocopier on the printer, when a job comes in on the job list. Because it won't move on to the next job until after this one is completed, I'm stuck waiting until this one finishes. The girls who printed it come in to get it, and I overhear that they're printing several copies of like a thirty-page report. Which is fine, I can't monopolize the printer, but it just takes time for all of these to print. And what's more, it isn't working. They ask me if I see anything wrong, and I don't. They call IT, IT says that it's too big a file to print. (I don't know if this is true, it's just what they said.) IT leaves, and the girls won't stop complaining about how, ""this printer sucks,"" and, ""we need a new printer.""

In my head, I'm furious. How could they say that about my baby? Anyways, the girl goes back to the computer and tries to print MORE copies, I assume in an attempt to try to force it to work. She comes back and obviously it doesn't work, so she goes, ""fuck this stupid thing,"" and slams her fist on the top of it.

So when they walked away, I canceled their jobs, right in the middle of it - so they'd have to keep printing all over again and hopefully never have it work. I realized afterwards that this was stupid, because it's putting more pressure on the ol' girl, but I wasn't in my right mind, and I'm sure it caused these bitches more stress than the printer.

Enjoy your long car ride!,438,65,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jpb0a/treat_me_like_a_servant_enjoy_your_long_car_ride/,"**Background:**  I work in the Audiovisual section of a library, so I handle all music and movie questions.

One time I noticed a lot of the same historical movies were being checked out over and over.  I later found out one of the History classes at the high school was doing a project where students had to select a film from a list of several options, watch it, and write a report about it.  People would come in and ask about the movies, I'd look them up in the computer, and tell them if any copies were available.  More often than not, all copies would be checked out because someone else got there first.  If the patron wanted, I would put a reserve on their library card so they would be in line in case a movie was returned.  Generally, people were pretty understanding.

Not so with one woman.  One Sunday night, I noticed a LOT more parents were asking for the movies.  I realized it was the Sunday before the assignment was due and these were all the parents of the kids who put it off until the last minute.  A woman with her son walked up to me and presented me with the the list of movies.  I looked each movie up in the computer.  Every one of them was checked out and had been for days.

At first, I had to explain to this woman what ""checked out"" meant.  There was no language barrier.  She spoke perfect English, she just apparently didn't understand how a library works.  She demanded to know why I wasn't getting a copy for her until it finally sunk in that SOMEONE ELSE had the movies she wanted.  (A side note:  the son was texting on his phone the entire time, not helping out or contributing in any way even though this assignment was his responsibility)

Unfortunately, none of the movies were going to be returned in time for her son to complete the assignment.  I relayed this information to her and I was actually genuinely sorry because I knew she was dealing with something that wasn't her fault.

**The Offense:**  I told the woman none of the movies were available, but I also suggested she try her resources at home (the library is in an upper middle-class suburb where everyone has something like Netflix or OnDemand) and these movies are popular or recent enough where they might be available electronically.

The woman stared at me for about thirty seconds without saying anything.  And then she said, in the snippiest tone I've ever heard, ""So what are you going to do about it now?""

Boom.  Any sympathy I had for her evaporated instantly.  I wanted to tell her it's not my fault her son can't prioritize.  It's not my fault her child put this off until the night before the assignment is due.  It's not my fault other parents and students were on top of this before her.

**The Revenge:**  I came up with an idea.  Through some very fast-paced searching through a secondary database, I looked to see if any other libraries had available copies of the movies.  Several did.

New tab.  Google Maps.  I put in the addresses of the libraries and did some calculating.  I made a phone call and gave the woman the address of a library that  would hold one of the movies for her.

I picked the library that was the furthest away, even though there were closer options.  From our library, the drive was over an hour long.  That's at least two hours she spent driving back and forth to get the movie!

Luke was a lazy, mooching, ungrateful human being. He came in on his first day and I started talkin' to him to get to know him a bit. He seemed alright. I asked him where he lived.

""Oh on this cross street"" 

""Hey I live near there. If you need a ride sometime let me know"". I made a huge mistake

Well he started making me his only way to work. That's fine, we worked the same schedule. I just told him to pitch me a couple bucks here and there for gas and we'll call it good. He'd do it... for a week and then stop. This pissed me off. I'm taking a little extra time out of my day to come get you and all I need is a couple bucks (Yes $2) every weekend so I can cut it even on gas. He'd say he didn't have money but would ask to stop on the way home for cigarettes.

Then on days his mother was home (guy was 20 with no license). She'd drive him but wouldn't tell me. So I'd go to his house and his sister would answer saying, ""Oh our Mom took him"". It'd be nice if he'd tell him so I wouldn't waste my time coming over. I told him, you gotta tell me or I'm not getting you. He did it another 2 or 3 times.
Being the pushover I am, I still give him rides. Then I tell him, ""Hey I gotta go to some place right by work before work. I'm gonna get you about 5 minutes early.""

""Um, no?"" replies Luke.

This is one of those little things that irk me. 

Finally he'd start EXPECTING me to pick him up before work like I owed him something. I was 2-3 minutes late getting him and he started going off on how we are going to be late for work. 

After being a pushover for these couple of months, I decided to get back at him and make work a better environment for everyone (Nobody like him at work for various reasons). 

Luke called me, ""Hey you gonna come pick me up?""

Me: ""Yeah sure"".

Luke: ""Ok, I'm gonna nap for a bit. If you could call me to wake me when you are about to head over, that'd be awesome so I could get ready"".

Me: ""Sure thing buddy!""

click.

I never called him, I never picked him up, about 7pm (he called me about 3:30) he called work, after blowing up my phone with texts, saying he's sorry he didn't come in, it's IVIagicbanana's fault he said he'd get me, blah blah blah. My manager was dying to fire him just didn't have a reason. So he told him, ""Our work policy states that a ""no-show"" for a shift is considered a voluntary resignation. I hope you realize a job is a privilege to have and you should be happy to have one"". 

Luke: ""But its not my fault!""  

Manager:""You should have had another way to work""

Click.

Manager pulled me back asking if I did what Luke said I did. I rolled my eyes and obviously sarcastically said, ""Oh no sir, of course not!"" He laughs, fist bumps me saying he's happy he's gone, and scamper off to go work in front of the hot ovens for another day.

One fine day, the IT department decided to ""inspect and update"" every laptop in the school. Of course, they were also going to generate a list of all installed programs and meticulously go through every hard drive for anything remotely ""inappropriate"", but that wasn't mentioned to the students. People managed to find out about the impending virtual strip search, word got around, and being the only student who remotely knows how to secure a computer, I was flooded with e-mails asking - no, *begging* - for help. Now, I am usually happy to help my fellow students encrypt their files and dual-boot their laptops, but one of the messages in my inbox was from *that guy*. You know who I'm talking about. The stereotypical, overweight ""athlete"" who is a giant asshat to anyone who isn't one of his kind. This guy had been shoving me around and calling me a ""little shit"" since 5th grade. It was time for revenge.

**The Story:** So, the aforementioned asshat sends me an email asking me to help him ""hide some files on his laptop."" My instinct was to tell him to fuck off, but then I had an epiphany. The punishment for having incriminating files on your laptop was a revocation of laptop privileges for the rest of the semester. At this point, I stepped back from my computer and had what can be best described as a fight between my two internal monologues. Eventually, my devious side won and I replied to his email, telling him that I would be glad to help him out with his endeavors. The next day after school, I meet him in the locker room and ask to see his laptop. I made a 256GB partition on my external hard drive and backed his entire hard drive up. I then proceeded to install a fresh copy of Mac OS X on his computer. After the install had finished, I restored his files from his backup. I put everything incriminating on the desktop, in a hidden folder labeled ""HORSE_PORN"". Next, I re-installed the school's remote management software, which allowed the IT guys to access a live list of *all* files and folders on the laptop - including hidden ones.

So, the day of the inspection came along, and as luck would have it his inspection was scheduled during my study period. I excused myself from class and walked by the IT room (*which was on the way to the bathroom, mind you.*) to hear the most wonderful six words to hit my eardrums: ""I.. I thought I deleted all that!""

There wasn't an organized server mod system back then, so making anything unique required downloading one of the few open source custom servers and editing the code to work the way you wanted it to.

Anyway, it was the beginning of the summer and my server was getting too popular - getting on required reloading the page for about 5 minutes until someone left and hoping no one took their spot before you did. So I decided to give out the software to a few trusted people.

I ended up giving to one person that I had never met before, but she was friends with some of the staff members so I thought it would be OK. This turned out to be a horrible idea since the software quickly ended up in the hands of ""Jim."" He was well known for being an asshole (MC was like a small town back then, if you did something stupid the whole community found out) and my previous encounter with him involved him using a script to repeatedly advertise his server in the chat until he got banned. Since he was very likely to ruin my server's relatively positive reputation for good management and friendly people, I knew I had to do something.

It didn't take me long to realize that I had the perfect tool for the job - an old nemesis from the server's past, affectionately known to us as the ""[penis client](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/11073-the-ungoliant-client/)."" Made by a guy who was really eager to prove that he was a better programmer than me, it was a hacked version of Minecraft that allowed you to fly, go through walls, automatically kill everyone on the other team and [instantly build orange penises](http://i.minus.com/jrX17bHDfZIfj.png). I had since figured out how to block most of these features, but I also knew how to get around my own security: I edited the client so the penises were pink instead of orange! Then I set up a website with a URL like http://www.minecrafthacks.co.cc and distrubuted my special version of the game on it.

After that it was a simple matter of going to his unauthorized server and advertising my new 1337 h4xx0rz.

I put a lot of effort into making sure that each one of my items gets a unique pic so the customer knows that he/she is getting *exactly* what is in the picture, but this other jackass is lazy and just takes my images and pawns them off as his items, which hurts me because my pics are no longer unique, and it looks sketchy to customers when two people appear to be selling the exact same item. I complain to ebay using the proper channels, but get ignored.

So today, after a hot email exchange with the guy, who doesn't seem to think he is doing anything wrong, I decided fuck it. I made a throwaway account (with fake info so it can't be connected to me, and using a different IP) and purchased all 60 or so of his items he had for sale using the buy it now option, and bid way more than his items are worth on the ones w/o the buy it now option.

Basically the guy is going to lose at least an entire day of sales because he is a douchebag, and I'm going to rinse and repeat until he stops stealing images.

And of course I will be leaving him negative feedback on every single auction (ebay will eventually fix that for him when they realize I am not paying, but since they are slow as fuck, he will be stuck with negative feedback for at least a month I bet).

I'd look like a meth addict if I weighed the required 186, the most I got down to even when I was training for a marathon was 196 and my healthy weight is about 220, I've even had doctors tell me that for my build, 230 would be okay. 

So anyway, I'm in the army and I get injured in a 'training' (I was doing Insanity) accident and can't run, can barely walk, have to use a cane, etc. and as can be understood, I gain a little weight. This is apparently just right out in our unit so I suffer months of harassment while my knee is 'recovering'. In actuality, I've done something so terrible to my knee I can never run again, and I am in constant pain, even now, so they start a medical discharge. The day after the medical discharge paperwork is started, the First Sergeant decides it's time to 'trim the fat' in the unit and calls every borderline person in, tapes them, and flags them all, meaning I cannot finish my degree, I cannot get my Good Conduct Medal and I can't do many other things that I could before as well as recieving a discharge for being fat. It is also worth noting that according to regulations, anyone undergoing a medical board can't be discharged for administrative reasons like being overweight and what the 1SG did was, in fact, not allowed. Sadly, military Ombudsmen and IG are all part of a Good Ol Boys club, so they rarely interfere in something as petty as a soldier trying to get a flag removed.

Luckily, I had a great Squad leader who ran a lot of interference for me, in fact, as the date was coming up that they were going to send all the 'illegal' paperwork to the next level, they mysteriously lost all my paperwork, and seeing as it would take more time than I had on my Medical Board to get it all back, the topic of my being overweight was mysteriously dropped. 

The day of my discharge comes and this Staff Sergeant walks me to the Control point ot recieve my discharge, and in hand he has a Good Conduct Medal he had the Commander award me without the 1SGs knowledge as well as ALL the paperwork the unit had done on my overweight problem. Tells me to have a happy life, and walks away.

A few years back I had a friend who needed a place to stay. My husband was just getting ready to be sent out of town for work, leaving me alone and away from family/friends for quite a few months so we decided it would be a good idea to let my friend live with us (and pay rent, of course)

Now, at the time we lived in the countryside and our property was heavily wooded so the shade from the trees kept our house pretty cool. It was awesome in the summer since we didn't have to run the AC hardly at all but in the winter it SUCKED. To cut down on the cost of running the furnace, we kept the heat low and used space heaters only in the rooms we used the most.

At the time my friend moved in it was just getting to the coldest part of winter so I happily let her use the awesome space heater from my computer room for her bedroom. I warned her not to crank it up to the highest setting, though, because if we had any other space heaters running on the same circuit it would cause the breaker to flip, cutting out the electricity for that part of the house. However, The low and mid settings on that heater were still great for heating the room to a comfortable temperature. 

She liked to crank the heater up to full blast, making the room 80+ degrees at all times, even while sleeping. I talked to her many times about this because it meant that I couldn't have my heaters on for fear of popping the breaker. Of course, she always denied it, saying she only had it on low. What she didn't know is that when the heater is on high, every time it kicked on the lights in the rest of the house would noticeably dim so I knew how often she had it cranked up. 

We both played WoW back then. I was a very casual player but my friend, however, was a hardcore raider - if she wasn't at work she was raiding. (She was known for blowing off plans due to last minute raids popping up. Raids were more important that anything.) I believe she was a key member of the raid (main healer or tank, I don't remember anymore) so it was super important that she was in every raid. 

One day I had a frustrating day at work and just wanted to unwind by getting on the computer and not freeze so I turned my heater on low, hoping it wouldn't cause a problem. Well surprise, surprise. Her heater was on full blast and caused the breaker to pop - while she was in the middle of a raid. She came out of her room, screaming about how her raid was going to wipe now, stormed downstairs, flipped the breaker and stormed back to her room, all the while yelling and venting. I reminded her about keeping the heater down and she yelled at me to shove it.

Oh hell no. you don't yell at me in my own house. It was on.

From that time forward, if she was raiding I would turn my heater on and the breaker would pop, she would lose power and her raid would wipe. She would yell at me about turning my heater on while she was raiding. I refused to stop and she never would turn hers down. It got so bad that her guild was talking about kicking her out if she didn't stop loosing power. Eventually she started turning her heater down, but only while I was home. That wasn't good enough for me (she was still running up the electricity bill) so I started leaving my heater on low and locking the door when I left for work so she couldn't turn it off.

She still bitched about it up until we kicked her out (for something unrelated) but I just smiled and kept using my heater.

He says he wants a new lip ring, but it needs to be black. I showed him the black lip rings but warned him that they weren't hypo-allergenic, so if he has any problems with nickel he should opt for one of the titanium ones instead. He looks in the case with titanium lip rings and rolls his eyes.

The smell of justice still hangs in the air.

I'm driving down this quiet one-lane residential street. Playground zone, but it's 10:30pm, so I'm doing 5 over the speed limit of 40 (kms). All of a sudden, some putz comes flying down the road behind me, stopping mere inches from my bumper. I mean, I couldn't even see his headlights anymore, and I drive a smallish car. I just wanted to get home, not into an accident, so I moved over into the ""parking lane."" There's not two lanes there, but at this time of night, there was nobody else on the road, and I was driving in the gravel at the side of the road. This guy had more than ample room to pass me if he wanted.

    &gt;nope.jpg

This paragon of driving etiquette follows me over, still so close that I can't see his headlights. Well shit. What now?

I keep rolling along, and see my salvation in the distance: [the saddest, most useless piece of curbing I've ever laid eyes on.](http://imgur.com/965Amko)

I keep driving along towards this thing, drawing ever nearer. My palms are getting sweaty. My eyes are darting back and forth from the I-want-to-be-a-real-curb and my rearview mirror. I have a very small window. 

All my training, my years of experience, have led me to this moment. I either go home a hero, or not at all.

I wait till the last possible second, and swerve back into the lane proper. Doucher McGee back there just didn't have the time to react. 

What followed was possibly the most satisfying series of sounds I'll ever hear. I watched in my mirror as his front end hit the curb at 45. His bumper was immediately ripped off (don't lower your rides, kids!). His car jumped up onto the curb, and devoured the unsuspecting sign as a dolphin would swallow a fish. 

A final glance back as I turned the corner a few hundred meters ahead rewarded me with the glorious sight of smoke pouring out from under his hood.

I was crossing the street and the traffic signal gave me the ""walk"" sign allowing me to cross.

Before I continue I would like to say, the street I was on it pretty much a side street that no one uses, the traffic light is useless and could easily replaced by a stop sign.

And continuing, so I was on the side street about to run into the road, and this lady decides to run the red light as a lot of people do thinking no one is coming from the side street. This is just as I enter the road, and she doesnt see me untill its to late. She did slow down, and I saw her coming and put my hand out to, Idk, block it I guess (human instinct) the impact knocks me over but Im pretty much ok. A bit shaken but ok.

I get up to approach the car, she looks right at me and drives off, meanwhile a car attempts to cross the side street, as she is to busy staring at me, she crashes into him.

The crash wasnt devastating, just a fender bender, but it knocked off the other guys bumper and she will be paying for that as it was her fault for trying to run a red. 

The police showed up, I gave them a testimony, my parents freaked out (Im only 16), but in the end I think she got what she deserved.

I used to play bass guitar in a punk band in the mid 90s and took lessons at a music shop by my house. My teacher, and our bands drummers teacher were also in a band and they owned the music shop, so we hung out there quite a bit. One day we heard a puppy whimpering, so we went to investigate. In the backyard of the house next to the shop was an adorable beagle puppy chained to a stake with two bowls next to him that were empty. We figured maybe the owners were out and left it at that. 

The next couple of days was the same thing... puppy whimpering, chained to a stake and empty bowls.  I should also mention there was no type of shelter either, and by the amount of poop around, it looked like this dog never left this spot. By now, my friend and I were contemplating on stealing this adorable puppy, but we were afraid of getting in trouble... We were 13 at the time. So the next day, we hear kids in the yard and we thought, good, maybe they were away or something or had to leave suddenly...,whatever, we were just glad someone was finally there. So as were watching from the concrete wall between yard and parking lot, the puppy starts barking and jumping, looking happy, when the kids start getting closer. Well the boy grabbed a stick and hit the puppy yelling for it to shut up. 

We stole the puppy that night and he became our bands unofficial mascot. We used his picture wearing a mohawk hat as our cover album. He lived with our drummer for 6 years until he got hit by a car. My whole band and about 30 people had a funeral for him. But it was such a great feeling rescuing him.

About $1000.

Found out much later she had been cheating on me. Based on information other people have told me, she had planned on dumping me earlier for the other guy, but she had no way to pay these unexpected bills. She wasn't going to ask him to help so early into their new relationship, so she held on to our relationship for a few more weeks, got the bills paid, and then dumped me.

**Setup:**  Even though she was now engaged to the guy she dumped me for, I decided to confront her. I wrote her with the evidence that she had been cheating on me, and I reminded her that she waited 6 weeks to tell me she was in a new relationship, and she wasn't shy about asking for money for her 3 kids during that time.  She wrote the following back:

She denied cheating on me; telling me that her fiance was not the reason we broke up, even though she was celebrating her anniversary on a date weeks before she dumped me.

She reminded me about an argument we had *the year before* she dumped me and was now claiming that was the sole and only reason she ended the relationship.  And she concluded with this attempted emotional manipulation.

""I miss having you as a friend more than you will ever know, but I realize, even more so now, that you still have a lot of anger towards me. It makes me sad for both of us.""

**The close:**  I stewed on that for a bit, and eventually forwarded our entire email exchange to her fiance.

- I don't know if he ever knew that his fiance and I exchanged emails recently, but he knows now.

- I don't know if he ever knew she asked me for money after she dumped me, but he knows now.

- I don't know if he thought he was the reason our relationship ended, but he knows now.

- I don't know if he ever knew when she officially ended the relationship with me, but he knows now.

So there's me, 16 year old kid who was waiting at a bus stop in Australia (Sydney) at around 6:30 I had just finished my tutoring and was just going home. It was pretty dark and there was nobody around the bus stop, just a few cars and buses passing by. Nobody except for four women aged in their early 20s I guess. Now these women were the sort of you could just sense that they were messed up, the kind who you wouldn't be surprised to see them on the streets a few years begging to suck your dick for some money, messed up hair, baggy eyes, all of that shit.

Now one of them turn towards me and ask, with the sound of high pitched giggles behind her, ""Hey, kid, do you want some ecstasy?"", holding out a mint box which was filled with panadol-like tablets. Now me being a goody two shoes freaked the fuck out, this has never happened to me in such a unexpected manner, and these women looked pretty sketchy. So I replied in the perfect response where you would get an A+ if you did this was a scenario in a test, ""no I don't want any, I don't do drugs"".

Now this had somehow set them off and they reacted very much like a bundle of bitches who had never anyone say never been refused in their life. They started calling me a ""pussy dipshit"", ""tiny asshole"", ""fuckface"", your typical list of insults for the subpar humans, as well as continuing to pester to try some ecstasy, to which I just said no again and again.

Eventually the constantly uneducated nattering finally into my head and I snapped and I just said ""Fine gimme some"", and surprisingly, they just shut up and handed me the whole mint box to me.

So now I'm just freaking out about what I'm gonna do as I'm holding a box full of stuff that I would never think of putting in my mouth, so I just walk away from them down the road, where they followed me. The following part is what I would call a miracle. 

So in my hands was a box of drugs and right in front of me on the curb is a storm drain. Now by pure coincidence, I saw my bus coming up the  road, so I thought in my moment of adrenaline ""fuck it, they probably won't kill me"" and dropped the whole container down the drain, and signalled the bus driver and I walked quickly straight to the stop and got on the bus, with a torrent of swearing flowing behind me and a bunch of confused people on a bus, looking at a 16 year old asian kid being followed by four messed up women whose looked and sounded pretty pissed off. 

The bus driver asked what happened as he closed the door(thank God for that), I just told him ""I didn't want to do drugs"", which granted me a smile from him and a free bus ride.

Finally a drunk redhead opened and looked me sloppily in the eyes. I told them to quiet down, since it was a weeknight and so forth. To which she proclaimed, that she had put a sign up on the board announcing the party. The note said something about her having her study group over for dinner and that they would be listening to music, so I didn't accept that, since their behavior really didn't fit the description. So I firmly told them to stop and she closed the door.

I, with another counselor, was in charge of the ""youngest girls"" cabin so we had ten 8-11 year old girls, all with very distinct personalities that occasionally drove us counselors crazy.

One such girl was ""Z."" She was an extremely smart, manipulative, entitled 11-year-old who was constantly causing trouble. The kind of 11-year-old who knows that when people lie, they tend to look away from your eyes... so will stare you down while lying to your face in order to make herself seem convincing. (She did not, unfortunately, realize that all the counselors were onto her.) She would wander away without a buddy and without telling a counselor (a big no-no) and then claim ""Oh, I *thought* you were watching me!"" Once she read another girl's letter home without permission, and said ""I *thought* she said I could!"" Blatantly false. She just sort of did what she wanted, and then tried to weasel her way out of it however she could. 

Fast-forward to the event: on a pre-chosen day during the week, the counselors of the two youngest cabins (girls and boys) suggest to their cabins that they should go on a kitchen raid after lights out--it's tradition! We play it up for the kids: leaving the cabin after lights out is not allowed, so we need to be super sneaky. Yeah, dress in black. Camou face paint. Be really quiet, listen to your counselors, if we say hide, HIDE! Kitchen raids are the most fun with the youngest kids, because they usually get super into it (and are less suspicious). Of course, they don't know that we set it all up beforehand with the directors and the kitchen staff, who leave out a tray of snacks specifically for us.

So the youngest girls cabin and the youngest boys cabin decide to do our kitchen raid together. We get all suited up in black, paint our faces, and have our flashlights handy. The boys' cabin counselor has taken the liberty of teaching his cabin military hand signals. We make our way sneakily, quietly (not really) down to the kitchen, and every so often I tell everyone to stop and whisper-yell ""HIT THE DECK"" so everyone has to get down on the ground and hide. It's great. 

Eventually we get to the kitchen and my co-counselor grabs the tray of snacks--random cookies and rice krispies and fruit-by-the-foot things. We tell all the kids they can take ONE, and we sit on top of the hill and eat before returning the tray and ""sneaking"" back to our cabins. 

So as we have all the girls in our cabin in the bathroom brushing their teeth after the kitchen raid, Z, the entitled little shit, pulls out an extra fruit-by-the-foot from her hoodie pocket that she swiped and tells her friend with a mischievous, shit-eating grin, ""Hey, look what I got!"" We aren't supposed to eat in the cabin area, which is why we had the kids eat near the kitchen.

I said, ""Z, you were only supposed to take *one.*""

Z, still with that manic little evil smile, actually laughs.

My co-counselor, bless her heart, says perkily ""Oh, Z, is that an extra one? Great! You can divide it up between everyone.""

Z's face FALLS in the most comic fashion and she actually starts protesting! My co cuts her off and says ""Z, we told you everyone could take *one,*"" and takes the fruit-by-the-foot from her.

I was working at a hardware store, having a smoke on my break. I was standing at the edge of the buildings parking lot, smoking. I always made sure to stand well away from pedestrians, as well as the buildings and doors. All things considered, I was being quite polite about my smoking habit.

Well, this old lady goes out of her way to drive by and calls me something to the effect of an insufferable prick, because the smoke was poisoning the air.

My friend who also worked in the store came out to join me partway through this, and also received an uncalled-for berating.

Yes, I'll wait.""

Well, this woman's jaw drops and she rushes out of her car, saying she was, ""just going to quickly pick her husband up from the mcdonalds at the corner."", To which my friend quickly retorts, ""Sorry Ma'am, your parked illegally.""

While we were there placing flowers and reflecting, a noisy family rolled up and started setting up camp chairs and blankets over the tops of the graves around their plot.  I didn't really mind this, they were clearly going to stay for a while and they were not damaging anyone's monuments.  Their lack of consideration was really the noise they were generating, but again, I didn't see it as a major issue.  A third car rolled up and parked (facing the wrong way, which is against city ordinance, not that it matters in the narrow cemetery streets), and all the other people there started hooting and calling and making a racket.  I soon found out why when the SUV's door opened and two dogs jumped out and excitedly started running around.  When the dogs got done greeting the noisy family, they came over to sniff our party.  Now, I don't have a problem with dogs; my wife and I have two, my mom has two and my brother has one.  I love dogs, and these were very sweet, loving dogs doing what dogs do.  

Well, this is where I start to have a problem.  It is clearly marked at every entrance to the cemetery that dogs and motorcycles are not allowed by city ordinance.   I would love to be able to bring our dogs up to the plot (or ride up on my motorcycle instead of going home to get the car), but I think it is disrespectful to have animals there that will urinate and defecate on the graves - hence the ordinance.  

Apparently the Noisy Family was watching us and noticed that we were not happy so they called their dogs back to them.  I took this chance to *politely* inform them that dogs are not allowed in the cemetery.  

""Well, they aren't hurting anyone.""

""Ma'am, it isn't about that, it's about respect.  No one wants your dogs defecating on their loved ones.""

""Well, they won't do that!""

""Ma'am, with all due respect, you can't know that.  Dogs will do what dogs do""

Other Family Member: ""He just hates animals!  You just hate animals!  Animal-hater!""

""No, I love dogs, I have two rescues at home.  But I leave them at home out of respect to other visitors.  How would you feel if someone defecated all over your father's grave.""

""That's not the same!  Anyway, we will clean up after them.""

""So it's okay for me to shit all over your family plot as long as someone picks it up later?  That's okay with you?""

""No!  It's not the same!  These are smaller!""

""So as long as it is just a little bit of shit, that's okay?  How much shit is okay before it is a problem?  Is the shit from a 12 lb dog alright?  How about a 50 lb dog?  Ninety lb?""

""They [the occupants of the last SUV to arrive] are from out of town, they didn't know.""

""But you, presumably are a local, you could have told them.  Plus it is clearly posted at every entrance and within the cemetery.""

(shrieking) ""They're from out of town, it shouldn't apply to them.""

""So the law doesn't apply if you aren't a resident?  That is absurd.""

At this point there is just a torrent of verbal abuse and name calling directed at me for being ""disrespectful"" and ""ruining their father's day"" and so forth, so we left.

Then I called Animal Control, who was all-too-happy to send an officer around.  Apparently I wasn't the only one who called about people having their dogs in the cemetery.

When I was at university doing my electrical engineering degree I did industrial experience over the Christmas holidays at the test centre of a large cellular provider. The guys there were a fairly close-knit bunch, and they loved their office pranks. Being the industrial experience kid I didn't have a lot experience with how this environment should work (which was the point, really) so it took me a little while to get used to it.

One guy there, T, loved to sneak up behind you and AAAAHHHHH!!!!! in your ear. The first time he did it to me I determined not to react immediately but to instead plan my revenge. He did it to me at least once a week and must have thought I was the perfect target.

In my final week there the opportunity I had been waiting for arrived. He went on a conference. At this time we were using Windows 3.11 and all the PCs had Turbo C++. I got onto his computer and wrote a little program that looked exactly like DOS 'format' running on his C: drive, even writing some random garbage to a file to make the disk light flicker. At the end, it would say gotcha from me.

I wrote it to simply exit immediately until at least 6 weeks after I was finished up, and put it in his startup autoexec.bat.

**Preface:** I have 2 roommates, one who was away on a cruise for the weekend, and the other who is 18, works at a strip club and doesn't go to college. This story is about the second roommate who is honestly one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, so her name shall be ""Dumb Bitch"".


Last night, I was up until past midnight after being awake since 6am working and doing homework before finals and such. I was exhausted. I fell asleep with dreams of kittens frolicking in my head when, what felt like 20 minutes later, I heard the loud *Bang* that signals the front door slamming shut. Taking a quick look at my alarm clock, I see the time at a glorious 5:18am. I am not amused.

Now Dumb Bitch works the night shift as a cocktail waitress at ""The Penthouse"" strip club, so she often gets in at 4 or 5 in the morning on weekends. Fine. I'm a college girl, I like to party as much as the next and I'm usually passed out by the time she gets home so she rarely bothers me. But tonight was different, it was a Sunday night and being the dumb bitch that she is, she decided to bring home one of her stripper friends and scream and laugh at the top  of their lungs while taking copious amounts of shots. Now, I'm 21, I've had my fair share of all nighters, but I had an exam the next morning and needed to sleep. Since she doesn't go to school, she has no respect for my other roommate and I's class schedules. 
I asked her nicely to please be quieter because the boyfriend and I had class in the morning and they were being louder than they thought. My reply was to be blissfully ignored until 7 in the morning when they finally passed out. That was when I decided to take my revenge the next morning.

Her stripper friend was sound asleep on Roommate 1's fold out bed in the living room, which is right next to the kitchen (remember Roommate 1 is out of town so she didn't ask to use it, rude).

Being the healthy person I am, I decided to make a nice loud breakfast for my boyfriend and I bright and early at 9am. ""Accidentally"" dropping pans and silverware, I was so clumsy this morning! That's when I saw the pile of dirty dishes in the sink. I couldn't just leave them there! So I decided to wash those as noisily as possible. At this point Stripper girl is tossing and turning, pulling the pillow over her head to try and block out all of the ""accidental"" noise I was making. The boy toy and I enjoyed a nice breakfast of egg sandwiches and bacon before I finished the grand finale of my master plan. 

Our dishwasher is loud. I mean loud enough to wake the neighbors on a calm night. Being as I had just finished doing all of the dishes in the sink, the dishwasher was full. I couldn't leave a bunch of dirty dishes in the dishwasher all day because god knows Dumb Bitch wasn't going to turn it on! 

I gave the biggest shit-eating smile to my boyfriend and turned that bad boy on, because clean dishes. 

**TL;DR** Stripper and roommate come home at 5am the night before I have an exam, I turn on the mother of all loud dishwashers to wake and keep them up.

How cute...",436,70,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1d5zg8/oh_you_have_a_300_watt_pioneer_stereo_with_big/,"In the early 90's a good friend and I lived in a crappy 2 bedroom apartment.  Our neighbors were great, except for this one teen age couple, who lived above us. 

All times of day and night, they would play their stereo very loudly and along with us, all the other tenants would complain.  The guy would just sneer and tell every one that ""300"" watt Pioneers can't be played quietly, they're too powerful."" 

Anyone who complained too much to him, would get their car keyed in the middle of the night.  This occurred twice.


The landlords were your typical slumlord types, who would not raise a finger, unless threatened with legal action. Cops were called, but there was no evidence who did it, this was long before the days of web cams and the like. 

Enough. 

Unfortunately, for these idiots, my roommate and I owned an audio installation business. Primarily we installed audio systems in small business, homes, and the occasional church. However, once in a while we would get a big job.  We were just starting out, hence living in a crappy apartment. 

It was on one of these jobs that I took possession of 4 large professional amplifiers. More specifically 4, Class H, SoundCraftsmen RA7501's that, when bridged mono, put out 700+ watts each. Each of the amps had various problems, hence their retirement and my getting them for free.   

For those of you who are not familiar with amplifiers, Class H refers to the amplifier topology.  Normally, the stuff you buy from Best Buy and the like are Class B, car audio tends to be Class D.  Class H are the big boys, the amps that have 500 watts RMS + written on the side and they REALLY mean it.  Class D amps can be very high wattage too, but they were not around much in the early 90's, actually they were non-existent in the professional audio arena. 

So I labored for about a week to bring these 4 behemoths back to life. 

So at the end of the week my roommate and I decided to have a party, and invited all the neighbors, except for you know who, and we provided the sound. 

.

.


Of course, the party was down the street at a bar. 
.

.

. 

Before leaving, we set up 10 monitors, powered by all 4 amplifiers. All of our neighbors secured their breakables (even those on the 3rd floor, we were in the basement.) The music of choice was Vanilla Ice on repeat. (NOT MY CD!!!)  It just seemed appropriate for the mentality of our foes. 

An hour later, we all walked back from the bar and found those two pale, shaking, and chain smoking out on the front step.  

The ""big, bad, 300 watt"" Pioneer was never heard from again. 

TL;DR: Let me introduce myself, I'm a man of audio and power.

Which means, whenever you go to a concert, play, ballet, opera, or freaking tractor pull someone like me put in a awful amount of time to not only make it visible but look good. 

In this particular case, I was lighting a concert for a guy who hasn't been relevant since the early 70s. And was barely relevant then. As usual, I show up several hours before the artist, go over the rider for specific technical requirements (and there are absolutely zero related to lighting) and create a stage plot for the show. Artists arrives for sound check, I bring up the stage lights and make my final adjustments. Artist seems happy with everything - at least signed off on the sound and said nothing about the lights - and goes off to dinner.

Show starts. Artist walks on stage and I bring up what's commonly referred to as the ""bow light"" (basically, a bright stage wash), quickly throw up the musician lights and take out the bow light. Its usually at this point that I actually start setting the look for the show. Everything prior to this was getting the act on stage and seen. My hands are just reaching for the faders when I hear, ""My God, someone do something about this glaring white light in my face. If this keeps up, I'll just stop and won't play any music. I'm not there yet but will be soon if somebody doesn't do something about this."" And, I shit you not, he continues on in that vein for a solid minute.

I sit there, hands hovering over the faders that I was just about to bring down to a show level, a little stunned. I mean, most acts at least let you know if they're douchebags before the show starts so you're a little prepared for it. And all but the biggest assholes find a way to communicate with the house crew from the stage in a manner that isn't belittling and berating. And to top it off, I know for a fact that this is the first venue larger than a coffee house that this asstard has played in years. But I digress...

After the initial shock wears off, I think to myself, ""Well, dickwad this is nowhere near as bright as what I had up for you at sound check. You didn't seem to have a problem with it then."" And take his lights down by about half. Also interesting to note that the specific light he seemed to have the problem with is what's called a downlight. And it's just that, it's a light that points down on top of his head. In this particular setup it wasn't a true downlight but it was still a pretty steep angle and about 22 ft over his head. Pretty much only someone who thinks he personally and constantly communicates directly to God would have his gaze high enough to find it ""glaring.""

Things already look a bit odd as he's a bit dimmer than the rest of his band but hey, that's what you get when you're a raging douchebag. Then about 10 min into the show, he stops again to bitch about the ""light in his face"" and how he's considering pulling a Robert De Niro on somebody after the show - which is really funny 'cuz this guy is 70 if he's a day and if it really came to that I'd have my ass fired and him crying inside of a minute. But again, I digress. At this point, even my stage manager is suggesting that I kill all the stage lights but I do it one better. I take all of his lights out except for a single light pointed directly at him from the farthest point out in the house that I have. I leave it up at about 20% intensity - just enough that he can still see a light pointed at him but not enough to actually light him. Meanwhile, the rest of his band is still under full stage light. I take off my headset, get out of my chair, lay down on the floor in the control booth, pull out my phone and dick around on the 'webs for the rest of the show. Dumbass geezer with an attitude played the rest of his show in the fucking dark while his band could be seen. And didn't even realize it.

1375280241.0,358,self.pettyrevenge,1jf70r,Gym goddess learns how to use a bike,430,72,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jf70r/gym_goddess_learns_how_to_use_a_bike/,"Whoops, got a bit long but bitch made me angry. There's a TL;DR for you lazy people. 

Generally, I don't like going to the gym.  I prefer to work out at home where nobody can see me sweaty and gross hating life. Recently, we have had people staying over so I haven't had any time or space to exercise at home, so it's been gym time for me. 

So I've been on the training bike for a while now, and I absolutely hate it. It's steep uphill, I'm sweating, and crappy pop songs are playing constantly through the tiny TVs all around the place. Then comes along the Barbie doll. She's got all the expensive gym gear, full makeup, blonde hair down and fringe in her face. Definitely not here to actually get her sweat on. 

So she takes the bike next to me and starts pedaling away easy as hell, with absolutely no friction and doing her no good at all. Seriously, it was down so low that at one point she took her feet out of the stirrups and the pedals kept going. Walking would have been better.

Now each to their own, if she's going to waste her time that's on her, but then she pulls out her phone and calls one of her girlfriends to have a nice and loud chat. She tells her friend how she was going to bike for an hour, and how proud she was of herself. Good on her and all, but really it wasn't going to do anything no matter how long she went. Also, her voice was loud enough that people around us were looking annoyed, but she doesn't notice and I try to ignore it.

This whole time whenever she happened to glance my way she would give me a ""I'm going so fast and it's east but you're struggling going that slow"" type look, but again I ignore her and shove my insecurities down. 

Up until this point Barbie had been annoying, but then she became straight up rude. Looking straight at me, she said to her friend ""Some people here are so gross, I wish you could see this girl. I mean just cos you're fat doesn't mean you don't need to look acceptable and make an effort"". It was like she thought I wouldn't able to hear her from 2 feet away. 

This made my blood boil. Granted, I must have looked disgusting, covered in sweat, powering my way through the highest friction I could manage, hair pulled back, and no makeup, but we're AT A GYM. LIKE WHAT. I'm not even fat. I would class myself as completely average weight but this chick was looking at me like I was a whale. Even if I was, AGAIN THE GYM THING. Did she not realize that overweight people have even more reason to be there? Ugh. 

5 more minutes of this subject of conversation, and Barbie gets off her bike, leaves her towel and walks towards the bubbler. Like she had had a proper workout and needed a break. Now here comes the revenge. Quick as my wobbly legs would let me, I got off of my bike, went to hers, adjusted the friction to a medium ascent, and got back on my bike like nothing had happened. 

Barbie comes back, every hair still perfectly in place, still on the phone, and tries to cycle. She immediately looks confused. What? Working out is meant to require effort? Since when? She tells her friend what happened, and her friend says bikes don't just change by themselves so it probably just feels different because she's tired. Ha. 

She starts to pedal, and after about 5 minutes she begins to puff and has to hang up on her friend. 10 minutes in she begins to sweat, and all her makeup is melting. I didn't even put it that high but she's looking like she's climbing Everest. I leave for the showers at this point, but when I'm walking out the door I see her again, hair up, sweaty brow, leaning over, properly going for it. Good for her. 

I probably did her a favor, but all I could think about was how happy I was that she looked like crap, and that despite the fact that she definitely weighed less than me, I was stronger than her :)

I mean, really good, huge strawberries. 

My two friends and I each got one, and we happily went on our merry way. 

While we were sitting watching the game, my friend got up to use the restroom and left her box of strawberries under her seat. My other friend was still sitting next to me. 

In the break between innings, a rather rude couple, and their family(who were sitting in the row in front of us)  were conversing with another couple in the row behind us. At one point the Mom stepped over the row into ours and noticed the box my friend had left on the ground. She proceded to pick it up, and with a perplexed look on her face attempted to continue onto the row behind us. My friend grabbed the box, and politely excused himself, mentioning that the box was his wife's, and that it was not for her to take. She scoffed at him, and made a few other rude remarks and went on her way. 

During another inning break, we all got up to use the facilities, and my friends wife came back to the couple behind us trying to get the box within reach using their feet, and confronted them about it. They passed it off as a joke. I don't think they were within the first ""so many people"" to get them. So they wanted one. We then noticed that they were searching for these boxes and taking them from un expecting patrons, and I had enough. I had eaten most of the ones that came in my box, so I packed all of my garbage, peanut shells and whatever else I could find into the box, closed the lid, and put the pretty little bow back around it. I slid the box under the row in front of me, just outside of where they had been searching. 

It didn't take long for them to find it, and you could tell they were excited. 
I sat back and watched as they undid the bow, and opened it only to find a few half eaten strawberries, melted chocolate and my trash. The look of surprise and happiness turned into disappointment is a fun thing to watch. 

TL;DR - Don't try and steal our box of strawberries, and we won't surprise you with a box full of trash.

I'm not sure how petty it is, but it involves me doing a minimum amount of work to royally get back at my dick flatmates, so I hope this is okay!

Since I was in my first year, I got to live on campus in a flat I shared with five others. Two months into the semester and there's no sign of the fifth flatmate, until I came home one day and there were three girls about to unlock the front door.

There were a bunch of boxes full of stuff around them, and my flatmates and I had been told that the last flatmate was moving in that week, so I assumed it was one of them. I unlocked the door for them, introduced myself and we had a nice chat as I showed them around. Eventually I asked who was moving in, and one of them (I'll call her Jane) sheepishly replied ""Well, it's technically me."" She noticed my puzzled expression and explained that, while she's the official tenant, the other two girls are her friends and will be staying over once or twice a week. Apparently they all come from the same area, about twenty minutes away by car, and they all go to this university, but since the other two didn't want to move out of their homes yet, Jane said they could crash with her when they needed to, since they were only in a few days a week.

I thought this was a bit weird, but I didn't say anything because they seemed nice enough and travel could be a bitch - I come from an area about half an hour away by car, but on public transport it takes two hours to get to. So I figured as long as they weren't disturbing anyone else, it'd be okay.

Wrong. From the very start they were constantly loud, always shrieking and playing their music on full blast until early hours in the morning. 'Crashing over once or twice' actually meant they were all staying there every day. They never cleaned the kitchen, and since there were three of them they always left a mess and there was never any room in the fridge. Also, they clogged the shower drains with their nasty weaves. It was gross, and all in all they were just horrible; if I ever spoke to them about these issues they'd get pissy and ignore me, and then I'd overhear them loudly complain about me. 

But what made me snap was when, one day, I was walking to class and saw them heading up to the parking lot. All three of them got into *three separate cars* and drove off - they had means of getting to university after all, they were just being lazy and cheap, deciding to split a £490 a month rent bill three ways. They'd been royal pains in the asses for two months and I was pissed.

Luckily, that week we had room inspections. On the day, I saw the three girls head out as to not get caught. They were in room 6, so theirs was the last room to be inspected. Now, if your room is in an unacceptable condition, the inspector leaves a note on your door to tell you that there will be a follow up inspection later that week...unsurprisingly, due to two extra people living in there illegally, their room was a tip and they got written up. After the inspector left, however, I took the note off their door and threw it away.

Later on that week, the inspector paid his visit when all three of them were in the room being loud assholes. They weren't expecting it, and since visitors for the night have to be checked in, he figured out pretty quickly that something was up, and eventually the truth came out. The other two got kicked out and I haven't seen them since.

We subletted our rooms for any terms that we found work outside the area. 

Last summer, both of my roommates found work terms out west (I'm in Atlantic Canada) leaving me to live with two strangers during my school term. One of the subletters was pretty cool, but I didn't get a good vibe from the other fellow, let's call him Jim. Turns out my gut feeling was bang on and Jim wasn't an ideal roommate. 

""Yeah... I was living with my gf and her mother until I got her pregnant (gf, not mother) and had to move out"" 
He was jobless, stole things and sold them on the street to make money, and all of his friends were in the same boat. The slew of them were on parole and/or in halfway houses (theft, drug dealing, and violent crimes). 

I was in a difficult situation, because as uncomfortable as I was to be living there, they really weren't doing me any harm. 

(This paragraph is not so important)
Jim always had friends sleeping over, one night a couple slept on the couch, they were up pretty late screaming and fighting with each other and in the morning the guy broke up with the girl and completely peaced. That afternoon I was at my desk and could hear screaming from the back porch. I thought it was the neighbours, but I was wrong. It was the newly single girl screaming over the phone ""I have no money! ... I don't know anybody in this city! ..."" Then she locked herself in our bathroom to cry for the afternoon. This is just the beginning of the shit Jim dragged into our place. 


(This paragraph is important)
About halfway through the summer term Jim had a friend, let's call him John, sleeping on the couch for a few nights. Another friend of theirs came over and things got pretty rowdy. ""Other friend"" was on the phone in our living room yelling death threats at some guy on the other end. They all spent the evening doing Vicodin, drinking my beer and eating about a week's worth of my groceries. 

The next day I was livid. At this point John had been sleeping on the couch for about half a week. I yelled at them both. 

Here's where my passive aggressive self comes into play. I could tell that they were eating my loaf of bread (even after I confronted them about eating my groceries) because it was obviously dwindling faster than usual. The next morning I woke up with the nastiest homebrewed hangover farts I've ever had. They were unbearable even for myself. I let a couple loose into my bread bag, twisted it closed and put it back in it's spot. 

How sweet it was to watch that bread disappear slice by slice. 
They finished the entire bag. 

Epilogue: 
Turns out John was sleeping on our couch because he didn't want to return to his halfway house. Due to broken parole violations his face was on the news and in the paper, he had a Canada-wide parole warrant and was considered armed and dangerous. The cops had to break down our door to take him away. Jim got kicked out the next day. 

I check John out online from time to time, turns out he passed away ""unexpectedly"" a couple of months ago. (I would put all of my money on OD)

I took my 3yo daughter to one of those Buy-An-Overpriced-Mug-and-Paint-It places.  We needed Mother's Day gifts for the Grandmas, and Grandmas love mugs painted by 3y olds. 

As she is still a toddler, she has the attention-span of a gnat and the patience of rabid badger. It was all we could do to get paint slopped on her hand, a handprint slapped on each mug, her name scrawled on the bottom and handed to the counter person for firing before the call of the chicken nuggets and Yo Gabba Gabba drove her into a foaming-mouthed frenzy.

The mugs were picked up the Saturday before Mom's Day and we drove the hour to present the treasure to my MIL.  My MIL lives with my SIL, who is a 49 year-old adolescent.

My MIL LOVES the mug. ""It is so precious!"" she said, ""I don't think I can bring myself to even USE it!""  Mother's Day Win. MIL takes a break after gifts and goes back to her room.  SIL decides to make coffee. She's eyballing the mug. She goes to grab the mug to fill with HER coffee.  My husband says, ""Don't do it JJ. Mom just said SHE didn't even want to use it."" 

SIL yells down the hall, ""MOM! Can I use your mug?""

I say, ""JJ, don't worry about it. We have it covered. (wink)"" Meaning, 'hey you whiny bitch, your birthday is coming, now we know what to get you. Chill out.'

MIL (of course) says, ""NO! Didn't you just hear me say that it was too special to use?!?""

SIL is visibly irked. Throws herself around in her typical 49yo pubescent-temper-tantrum way.  I again reiterate that she should probably chill since she has a birthday coming and maybe she will get a mug too. She barely speaks to anyone for the rest of the day. Which was fine. Really it was.

So we drive the hour and a half home on Sunday evening. We get The Badger bedded down for the night and the phone rings.

MIL: ""JJ is VERY jealous of the mug. She says that she thinks she should have one too.""

In my brain, I'm flaming, spitting, furiously mad.  First of all, I felt like I'd made it clear that JJ's special mug was forthcoming for her birthday that wasn't yet here. Second of all, JESUS FUCK!! HOW OLD ARE YOU?? Why must EVERYTHING be about YOU and how YOU didn't get this or that or the other thing, when this was MOTHER'S DAY Goddammit!! 

So we return to Buy-An-Overpriced-Mug-and-Paint-It.  Her Daddy's birthday is also near, so I decided to get 2 mugs again.  But THIS time, she only painted 1 mug. Her Daddy's, with love and care.

I painted JJ's Godforsaken Entitlement Tantrum Mug.

I POURED my hatred and and resentment into it.  Carefully and thoroughly crafting that Rainbow Of Disdain and its Mocking Smiley Face, careful to render it in 3yo style.

Then the child signed her name.

My Junior year in high school things were going pretty great.  Had an awesome circle of friends, was getting great grades.  The black cloud marring every school day came in the form of 6th period.  We'll call that shit-sipper of a cloud Mrs. R and she taught chemistry.

I worked my ass off in that class.  One of the first few days of class she found out I was Puerto Rican (as is she) and I swear to god the woman flicked her bean to the thought of making my life miserable.  She was pretty mean in general telling us how we're all such unhealthy slobs for not getting colonics once a week (seriously) and not doing yoga three times a day.  

I think I went through over 3-4 notebooks in the first semester alone in meticulous notes.  She'd call me up front often to solve problems because I wasn't ""paying attention.""  I'd try to show her I was writing down literally everything she was telling us but, alas, no dice.  The woman would not relent.  I worked my ass off for a B+ (she actually believed giving people As were a ""handout"" what in the fuck.)  But hey, maybe I just wasn't too bright at Chemistry.

Come parent-teacher night.  My mother usually comes, but she was busy so my dad said he could make it.  He's an OBGYN and showed up about 5 minutes late and looking thoroughly unhappy.  ""What happened to you, dad!?""  ""A woman's water broke on my face.""  Oh.  Fuck.  He thankfully showered and donned fresh scrubs, but nothing could wash off the pure disgusted, furious shitstorm brewing behind his magnificent mustache.

We finally enter Mrs. R's room.  Recognition flickers into his face.  We sit through her presentation about her plans for the next semester.  I tell him what a complete asshole this woman was.  He just said, ""I know.""  We finally get 1-on-1 time with her.  

""Hi Mrs. R.  Do you remember me?  &lt;dad's name&gt;, you were my teacher in Junior high in Puerto Rico.""  Small fucking world, holy shit.  She looked him up and down and smiled.  ""Oh?  Look at you!  You were always messing around in class. You had terrible grades too.  Look at you now, you're just a male nurse.""  What happened next was simultaneously amazing and spelled certain doom to my GPA.  ""Well, actually, I own my own practice.  And you're teaching my daughter high school chemistry.""  

She got petty revenge back on me by making me now work my ass off for barely a C.  Fuck it, I worked on the yearbook committee.  We got her name spelled wrong.

**TL;DR My dad got decades-old sweet petty revenge.  Makes my life hell at the same time.  Worth it.**

We'll call him Jose, because that's his name. At the time the dorm apartment I was in had two bedrooms. I had a bedroom to myself as my old roommate had moved out at the beginning of the summer, while Jose shared a room with Dan. For the record, Dan was a very nice guy.


Jose on the other hand...


At first it was just little things. Mild annoyances, you might say. Having guests over the night before Dan and I had big tests, not cleaning up after himself, etc. However, before long it started getting...strange.


Somewhere around the middle of the summer, Jose forgot what the shiny little handle on the toilet does. Or maybe he just couldn't be bothered. Perhaps stopping to flush took too much time away from his morning ritual of grooming himself to the soothing sounds of European techno-house music while bathing in industrial grade body spray. Who knows. One way or the other it eventually got to the point where we (Dan, Girlfriend, and I) just assumed that if you went to the bathroom after Jose, you would have to flush before doing your business.


From there things kept going downhill. Jose started bringing drunk friends over to pass out on the floor, which can be a problem when I need to leave early the next day and someone's unconscious body is blocking me from opening the front door. We started finding used condoms on the toilet seat and the side of the bathtub. Jose started stealing food, including the alcohol my dad had bought for underage me to cook with when he came to visit. (I don't drink, but I love cooking and had recently learned how to flambe and make my own flavor extracts, both of which require hard alcohol). He put my fancy cooking knives in the dishwasher after I specifically told him not to and left notes on the knife block and dishwasher. (Note: some cooking knives can go in the dishwasher, just not the ones I have)


At the end of the day, it was a pair of little things that drove us to seek revenge.


For our first Hanukkah together my girlfriend, Haley, had bought me a pair of very fancy non-stick frying pans. I love these pans. Aside from my cast iron skillet they are my two favorite pans. As you may know, you can't use metal utensils in a non-stick pan as it will scrape the coating off, rendering the pan useless. Jose didn't care. One day I went into the kitchen to cook dinner and found my favorite pan with streaks gouged into the bottom, bits of slowly molding food still stuck to it as it sat unwashed on the stove.


And then came the juice. My girlfriend, Haley, is hypoglycemic so to keep her blood sugar in check she always keeps a bottle of juice in the fridge. Jose likes juice. By midway the summer he developed a pattern. In the morning Haley would have a little juice with breakfast if she woke up feeling a little woozy. By the time she got back from work at the end of the day, the bottle would be empty. It didn't matter how full the bottle was, Jose would empty it. We left notes. We talked to him. We talked to the RA. Jose didn't care. Jose wanted juice, and it didn't matter where he got it or whose alcohol he was mixing it with.


I don't know why, but that was the last straw. I started planning a litany of revenge ideas but Haley beat me to it. 


One night Jose had a lady friend staying over who was his latest conquest. Haley got up the next day to go to the restroom and coincidentally got to the door at the same time as the lady friend. Haley glanced through the open door and saw that Jose had stayed true to form with his daily routine. Haley stopped, turned to the lady friend, and said:


""Oh, I see Jose left us another present. Why don't you first.""


I wasn't awake at the time but apparently the look on the lady friend's face as she discovered the ""present"" was glorious. She quickly got dressed and left before Jose woke up (he must have marked his territory at some point during the night).


It took Jose about a week and a half to figure out why none of the women on campus would talk to him anymore. And then, like magic, he learned to flush.

There were two of us, one working from 8-5, and me from 11-8.  Typically, she would work from 8-11, then I would take over while she went to lunch and dealt with other duties, then she would take over about 3:30 while I took lunch.

We received a full hour for lunch, but neither of us ever took the full time, usually only requiring about 30 minutes, and sometimes less.

Ok, background complete, time to get to the meat of the story.

One day, she was running behind doing some of her other duties, and wasn't able to cover for my lunch break until late.  Really late.  It was 4:50 when I was finally able to clock out.  Her response when I mentioned it: ""Yeah, I got busy.  Hurry up, its almost 5.""

So, I grabbed some quick food, brought it back to the desk, and ate there so that she could go home.

The next day I got an email from our office manager that ""[Morning Receptionist] let me know you were eating at the desk.  That is unacceptable behavior.""  I was pretty pissed that I had made efforts to let her get home on time, and she'd tattled to management.  Made worse by the fact that this girl always had cookies or chips or something to snack on while she was working.

So, about a month after that, she was planning a vacation, and was leaving after her shift one Friday.  Once again, she didn't come cover my lunch until late (it was about 4:40 this time).  So, I clocked out for lunch, started to walk out, turned around like I'd just remembered something, and said ""Oh, I need to pick up a package at the Fed-Ex place, so it'll be a little while until I'm back.""

She usually just leaves these full of food and rotting in our sink.  She always complains about ""how tired and busy she is.""  She has also left her period blood soaked underwear SITTING in our bathtub so many times that it's starting to look like we're operating a butcher shop out of our apartment.  She feels that it is not her responsibility to help keep the areas that we all share (kitchen, bathroom, ect.) clean at all.  She just waits for us to clean it up.  

In short; she's disgusting.

Danny had been making sqealing sounds for the first few minutes, then began making more whiney noises and moving around in the booth. his parents continued ignoring their obviously uncomfortable child. by the time my food arrived, Danny was hurling himself into the back of the booth (which moved, so i was being shoved toward my table, while trying to eat), jumping on the seat (which slowly scooted the booth closer to my table, intensifying the previous action), and making ""uhn uhn"" type sounds (yes children do masturbate and it's uncomfortable to hear when NOT eating). the final straw was him playing peekaboo/ hairpull with the curtain and the back of my head. i turned around the side of the booth and asked his parents if they would mind calming him down, as he is making it unbearable to sit there. they stare at me like I'm crazy and tell me ""he's just a kid."" 

Now, I'm not one of those people who rip apart kids dreams and keep them in a perpetual state of ""reality"" for ""their benefit,"" but enough is enough, and if you won't control your own kid, I most certainly will.

i turned around to Danny, asked him if he knew about santa clause, and if he thought Santa would still bring him presents if he was mean like this (all smiles, as if he really couldn't wrap his little mind around this being bad behavior), so i set the record straight. 

""Danny, Santa Clause doesn't exist. And if you don't stop jumping and making noise, your parents won't get you any presents either.""

Cue child sitting down silently and parents stop talking, finally. I can only imagine what they had to deal with at home that night. Or years later.

(As in, ""You're lucky you were on lunch, because Oh, God, It's Her came in."")


She couldn't have done more to piss us off if she had been paid to do it. I believe that thinking up new and inventive ways to annoy and harass us was her only hobby. If I didn't know any better, I might have suspected that her every trip to our store was some kind of practical joke or reality TV episode.


She was horrid.


Anyway, a few months after I was laid off from that store, I decided to check out the new discount supermarket that opened up a couple miles from my house, and guess who is a cashier there? You got it in one!


So now, in my spare time, I like to pop on in there and go down the list of every dirty trick she's ever played on me or any of my coworkers. I'm on #18 of about 57 (that I've thought of so far).

Some of it is straight out of the asshole customer playbook: Demanding a discount when you know it's impossible, getting irrationally angry when you can't return something (no receipt or whatever), insisting that you gave the cashier a $20 bill when you really gave her a $10 bill (making her and the manager count down the till in the middle of a shift - I did feel bad for her manager on that one), bitching about the prices or the layout of the store, asking for her detailed opinion and then ignoring it, making her explain some product at length and then telling her she's wrong and going on about why, deciding not to buy half your stuff after it's been rung up and leaving it at the checkout counter, disputing the price of everything you're buying as it rings up (I felt bad for the people in line behind me that time), trying to pay with a check and arguing with her when she tells you they don't accept them, interrupting a transaction with another customer to ask questions, demanding that she show you where something is even though she is cashing people out (and berating and insulting her when she can't), bringing random items up to her till to ""check that the prices are right"", etc, etc.


To tell you the truth, I don't know if I can do to her any of the really horrible things she did to me, because I actually have manners and empathy.


But the ones I listed already were fun.

It was a lot of fun and I made pretty decent money.  Every year in Myrtle Beach, there is a Bike Week that attracts people from all over the country.  The whole area from North Myrtle to Murrells Inlet would be packed with bikers.  Most of them were really friendly people just having a great time, however, there are always a few assholes in every crowd...  

My bar was not one of the busiest, so I could spend a little time chatting with the customers.  There was one group of four guys who came into my bar a couple nights in a row and formed an impromptu friendship with me and the other bartenders.  They were funny and tipped well.  One of them flirted with me, and he wasn't exactly my type, but he seemed cool.  On the third night, they invited me and the other bartenders to go riding with them after our shift. I barely knew them and wouldn't normally go off with near-strangers, but the area was super busy, crawling with cops, and my friends were going, so I felt safe.  

It was a great night!  We rode motorcycles to the beach, visited a couple bars, made friends with a biker whose parrot rode along on his shoulder...  The flirty dude asked if he could see me again the next day and I said yes, because we had so much fun.  I told him to come to the bar after my shift and we planned on going for a ride.

The next day, he walks in the bar and I can not believe what I see.  He is wearing a shirt that has a picture of HITLER on it with the words ""White Power"" underneath!  

I was like ""Are you for real with the shirt?""  
He says ""Yeah- I am proud to be white!""

WTF?  There was NO CLUE- No off-color jokes, no racist remarks, just BLAM- here he is in a Hitler t-shirt.

I have absolutely no kind of patience for that kind of crap.  I looked him dead in the eye, completely deadpan and said ""Um... I am a Jew.""

Silence across the bar- except for the sound of his jaw hitting the floor.  He starts sputtering ""Oh, I am so sorry, um, I uh...""  
""Yes?  You sure thought I was cute last night, didn't you?""  
""Uh....I.....uh""  and turns and leaves as I bust out laughing my ass off.

One day I was kind of running late for a job interview which wasn't far but I was low on gas so I needed to fill up. There is a gas station near my house that has 12 pumps: 3 pumps in each line and 2 lines (3 pumps on 1 side 3 on the other). 

When I get to the gas station roughly 4 cars are there and a truck is using the middle pump of the far right so I pull up behind him and begin filling up my tank. I still have some time left so I proceed to clean my windows which were pretty messy. As I'm cleaning this beat up red car pulls up behind mine even though more than half the pumps are open. I continue to clean my windows and pretty soon my gas is done pumping but I still need to clean my back windshield. While I'm cleaning it this guy in the red car stars revving his engine. I ignore him but he continues to rev his engine. Eventually he even honks at me and since I'm cleaning my back windshield the noise was rather loud and startled me. So I vowed revenge on this asshole.

After I finish cleaning my windshield I start cleaning the rest of my car. Taking trash out, removing the carpet and dusting them off on the ground, and wiping down my interior. The whole time this asshole is still behind me revving his car like an idiot. When I take out my tire gauge and begin to check my tire pressure he finally gets the hint.

While it was my fault (the wreck was caused by my windows being down and some papers started flying out; when I tried to grab them, I lost control), his reaction went overboard. He already didn't like me because of my personality, and this was his excuse off-campus to let loose a powertrip. I actually hit a hill and FLEW into his fence, so I was seriously out of it and a little hurt. But none of that registered to him - he came out yelling, threatening me and calling the police. He called me a ""terrorist"" who intentionally wrecked his property, even though my car was totaled and his fence just had a hole in it. This was during the Bush-era 9/11 stuff, so everyone was a terrorist, I guess. He also called me a faggot, and a criminal, accused me of having been to his property before to beat his mailbox. It was bizarre.

He ended up goading my grandmother to pay for the fence when I couldn't afford it. 

Some years passed, I had moved away for college, then came back a few years later. Someone mentioned him in conversation one day, and it all came flooding back. Why had this guy freaked so much? I had looked up to him before it happened, even though we disagreed on politics. I decided this required revenge. 

He still lived in the same place. I rode by the mailbox he accused me of hitting. I wrote the number down. 

I went home and it started. First it was innocuous: I got him on the Belk mailing list. I signed up for Office Depot specials. Target promotions. I requested catalogs for vacationing in Arizona, New Hampshire. Over a few days, I just ordered random spam mailings and got his address in as many databases as possible.

The sign story definitely is ok here, the others may or may not be ""petty"" for the sake of the results. Feedback welcome on those points, long time lurker on this subreddit. I’ll post the others afterward in the comments.

Before she moved in, it was an all male apartment. There were three guys living there: myself, housemate 1 (H1), and Housemate 2 (H2). We had it good. There were LAN parties for unreal tournament wired throughout the building (buddy had a server and the landlords were awesome), absolutely relaxed house, and the seat never needed to go down (though no one ever complained if it was).

One day, the housemate asked if she could move in while the school prepared her dorm (renovations and such were happening). We said ok for the meantime. Henceforth the housemate's ex will be referred to as ""M"". We (much) later learned that this was all a fabrication of M's to move in and get cheaper rent.

M wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, but made due with willful ignorance and persistence to the point that arguing was useless. That would have been manageable, had she not had a sense of entitlement to match.

The first day of her presence, there was a cloth cover placed on the underside cover of the  toilet, upon which was printed ""If you can't read this, we've got a problem!"" arranged so that the toilet seat would cover the letters if it were up. After a brief chat on the expectations of moving into an all guy household, it became clear that she would not see it removed without consequence. Thus began the toilet wars. 

***The toilet wars:***
I have always been careful about cleanliness, and having a mesh of fibers so close to the flushing area of a toilet was pretty gross by my standards. Since the sign was not well thought out, I simply said that I had forgotten to read the message whenever I (often) left the seat up. 

H2 was a little more direct in his approach to this little problem, and did not share my scruples on cleanliness. After several weeks of being told how to do things, he consented to leaving the seat up. After a few days we were confronted by a rampaging froth foaming abominable M, who was annoyed that her (apparently custom made HAH!) sign for males was now covered in several shades of yellow polka-dot. 

It was concluded that the ""up-splash"" from the toilet flushing was to blame, and that noone in the apartment would EVER willingly do such a terrible thing. Luckily it was also ruled (after several glares toward H1) that putting it through the wash was both disgusting and uncalled for. She demanded that we keep it there, so when she was out at classes I hid it in a shoebox and put it in her closet. After weathering one more storm, the toilet wars had ended, and our house gained some respite from the oppressive reign of senior spotsign. Grins were exchanged, beer was had, and all was merry.

After the toilet wars had subsided, it became apparent that M was not planning to move out anytime soon. Her dorm had been ready, and she had called the admins to say that she had already found a place. As such, the admins had given her room out to another student because she had a place to live. 

This caused great problems because the amount claimed on her student funds decreased to accommodate the change, and she  needed to stay on this level of rent or have nowhere to go. So it was either kick her out into the snow or let her stay until things got sorted out.

From the counter we had a good view of the front of the store area. Our counter also had the displeasure of running all the lottery tickets and handling the scratch off ticket redemption (the actual scratch off cards were dispensed from an automated vending machine that was within view but at the other end of the front of the store). 

Often customers would come to the counter with scratch off tickets, wanting us to scan a pile of them (30+) to make sure they weren't winners, and pay any out that were. This was a simple but time consuming task but many of these people are extremely rude and would come in several times a day. They would get their winnings (if any) and then proceed to the vending machine to buy more tickets, lather rinse repeat, over and over and over.

One day a particularly rude and unwashed (read:putrid) man came in. He was a regular at the lotto counter and was in rare form, complaining that he was due for a big win because he had lost so much money and on and on and so on. After cursing out my coworker who scanned his tickets because there were no winners, he proceeded down to the vending machine to buy more. Little did he know that in my boredom the night before, I was playing with the lottery machine and discovered that after the last tech had serviced the machine, he forgot to lock administration mode. This mean I had full access to control the vending machine remotely,  everything from putting the machine into night mode (which has no visible change, other than ""night mode flashing on the tiny lcd screen) to turning off the machine completely, to turning cabinet lights on and off. My coworker was afraid to get in trouble for messing with it but I was fearless (i was pretty sure I was gonna get fired already anyways) so I leaped at the chance to pay back this horrible smelling man with the horrible attitude. As he approached the machine, my finger hovered over the night mode button. As soon as it accepted his bill, i hit the button and my coworkers and I sat in amusement as he became more and more upset with the machine. I turned it back on and it spit his bill back out automatically. Then turned it back off so it wouldn't take his money at all. Then back on and back off, over and over. He even came over and demanded we help him, so we called a manager to help (who hated dealing with them and would only try to put the cash in and then say it was out of service). He insisted we sell them to him by hand (we can't, laws and all that). I went down and put the money in the machine and pushed his selection, received the card and handed it to him, to his increasing frustration. I then gave my coworker ""the look"" and he immediately disabled it again as Commander Stinkball tried it by himself again as I walked away. He finally left in a red hot rage, only to return an hour later andd demanding to know if it had been repaired (which led us to point out that there was nothing wrong with it and other customers were using it just fine).

This went on for weeks, management never found out about it (although I think one suspected but fully supported what we were doing, unofficially).

When she had to move, I told her she could stay with me for a little while (though a few minor things had already made me somewhat wary of getting too deep with her).

When I had to move to a new apartment, she came with me. I told her to put the bills in my name because I had a suspicion that she wasn't going to be around much longer. A few months later, whadayaknow, she cheats on me. Then she ends up eloping with the guy and moving across the country. Well, good riddance!

Damn - the cable was still in her name. I TRIED to have it switched over, but they wanted me to start a new account to put it in my name. Either that or have her come sign paperwork - not gonna happen. So I said SCREW IT! She owed me money anyways, after I had supported her for so long, so when I figured out that this cable company would disconnect after two months of non-payment, I paid my last bill two months before I knew I was going to move out. Sure enough, the cable got cut off the day before I moved out. *PERFECT TIMING!*

Three months later, I got a call from her out of the blue.

Her: I got a bill from a collection company today about the cable.

Me: Ok. And?

Her: Did you, like, just move out and not pay it or something?

Me: YEP! That's exactly what I did. I figured you could take that money you owed me and use it to pay the bill instead.

Her: Well, thanks for dicking me over!

Me: OH you want to talk about dicking people over?

Her: How did *I* dick you over?

Me: Besides dicking other guys while we were together and then running away to marry one?

Her: I didn't cheat on you...

Me: Well you can keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better, but usually when you sleep with other people while you tell somebody else that you're in an exclusive relationship together, that's usually considered cheating. Now if you don't have anything else for me, I'm hanging up.

Last year of middle school, and I was one of two drummers in my grade. The talent show was coming up, so I planned to do a drum solo. The other drummer did as well, and since his mom was in charge of running the talent show, he got the grand finale, and I got second to last act.

I was perfectly fine with that, and was just trying to impress the girl I had a crush on. Let me add that the other kid was kind of a douche and had a very entitled attitude. His mom hated the fact that her kid didnt have the only drum solo. During rehearsal she would often tell me to speed it up/take things out, so that her kid could do his longer. (After all, it *was* the grand finale.)
The first day I was a little pissed. I didn't say anything though, as the cogs in my devious eighth grade head were beginning to spin. After a few rehearsals, she had cut out quite a bit of my favorite parts and even suggested ""only demonstrating a few simple beats."" I said ""great idea! Maybe the kids can learn something!"" 

Every day at practice I played the same mundane beats over and over, and listened to talent show planner's kid wail his heart out to the approval of his mom. But every day after rehearsal, I went home and practiced the solo I was planning to unleash. 
Fast forward to the day of the solo- I was sitting in line waiting to have my turn, when the other drummer boy turned to me and said ""try to speed it up; this isn't your time to shine. I have the last act."" I said okay, and my turn came up. I sat behind my kit and the announcer introduced me as ""here's zachboy95 to demonstrate a few cool drum beats!"" Applause died down and with the biggest grin on my face, I let loose on the loudest drum solo I've ever played. 

Best part, I went over my time causing the 'grand finale' to have to be modified into a shorter version. His mom was quite pissed.

So as was pointed out, while our revenge on Jose was satisfying, it didn't stop him from continuing to steal food, party late into the night, and destroying my beloved cookware. 

Here's what happened next.

_

As someone who is new to the joys of a non-kosher &amp; non-hypoallergenic kitchen, I try to go out of my way to try cooking as many things as possible that I couldn't cook at my parents' house. Among the many things I tried in that old kitchen was mango &amp; habanero hot sauce. Now, having never made hot sauce before I didn't really have a good handle on exactly what the optimal pepper/mango ratio was so as a result my first attempt was more of a habanero sauce with just a hint of mango. It also happened to be horrifically hot. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy things. But this...this was practically inedible. Thankfully, I had just the thing to do with it, I just had to wait until an opportunity presented itself.

As I mentioned before Jose liked to steal my food, Haley's juice, and my cooking alcohol. One weekend I came home to find Jose and some friends doing shots in the living room with the vodka my friend had just bought me for making vanilla extract. Since the cockblocking had gone so well I decided to see if I could one-up Haley's little ploy.

_


I think now would be a good time to explain what a Prarie Fire is. Not the natural disaster...the drink. For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, the Prarie Fire is basically just a shot with some hot sauce mixed in that's lit on fire before serving. Did someone say hot sauce? What a coincidence that I happen to have some hot sauce!

_


When they finished the round they had sitting on the coffee table I asked if any of them had heard of the Prarie Fire. None of them had so I explained what it was and offered to make them a round. They sounded interested so I grabbed the bottle and went into the kitchen.

For Jose I poured a full shot of habanero sauce, and then put a few drops of vodka on top so it would smell right and so I'd be able to light it on fire before serving. 

I had no beef with his friends so I mixed some mild Texas Pete with orange juice to get the right color (the habanero sauce was bright orange) and then mixed in the vodka before pouring.  I light the drinks and bring them into the living room where thankfully they were still coherent enough to know to blow out the shots before downing them on a count of three.

Did I mention how much Jose liked to brag about how good he is at taking shots in one go? Well, this was no exception. 1.5 ounces of what I would later jokingly refer to as ""Devil Jizz"" disappeared in one beautiful instant. 
And then the burning started.

Think about the spiciest thing you've ever tasted. Now multiply that pain by at least 5. 7 if you've never had authentic ethnic food from a culture that prizes spiciness. Now imagine taking a shot of that.

Jose's eyes bulged and his face went completely red. His eyes were watering and he started coughing and retching. Bear in mind that his friends didn't know his shot was different so they were all laughing and taunting him, having assumed that Jose was a complete wimp when it came to spicy things. He ran to the bathroom and stayed there for a good five minutes, coughing and retching and cussing occasionally. While he was in there, I explained to his friends what he had done to deserve something like this, then locked my room and left. When I got back there was an envelope on my door with some cash and an apology for taking our groceries. I appreciated the cash and note but I wasn't done yet. I still had a few jars of the hot sauce which, despite its heat, was very useful in small amounts when I wanted to add heat to something. And with Jose I had so many things I could add heat to.

Students can get free tickets to these games, but have to choose what section their tickets can be in. Our student sections are behind both goals. 

When students don't know what section they want to be in, I usually ask them ""Do you want to be with the band or without the band?"" and then they usually decide. 

One day, this guy walks in with a girl and they both get tickets. His girlfriend goes to a different window and gets her ticket and leaves quickly (I guess she had class or something.) 

The guy goes up to my window. Throws his ID down in front of me then picks up his phone and starts talking to someone with his back turned to me. 

I know he wants tickets in the same section as his girlfriend. 

I could have just printed it out and given them to him, but I decided to wait. 

Eventually, the guy turns around and sees his ID still sitting in the same place he threw it. He knocks on the window and points at it.

I then print him out a ticket (in a different section from his girlfriend) and hand it to him. He leaves without looking at it. Then I went on his account and canceled the ticket just to give him a little more trouble on his way in.

When we got to Rome we had to catch a train (metro) to our hotel and were waiting in the station with our over-sized, over-packed, and very heavy bags on our shoulders. 

When the train arrived there were about 5-6 people waiting to get on, my wife and I being at the front of that line. There was also a large group of people getting off the train including a little old man who appeared to be having difficulty walking. These two 30'ish Italian women tried pushing through the crowd exiting the train nearly knocking down the little old man in the process. A large guy behind the old man caught him and yelled something at the women before physically forcing them off the train so everyone could exit.

Finally we boarded the train followed by a little old lady, those two women and a couple other random people. There was only one seat remaining so I got there first and offered it to my wife. Being the sweet person she is she offered it to the old lady. The old lady was slow moving but as she went to sit down one of those two women literally squeezed in behind her and took it. 

They were both on their cellphones, probably talking to each other, and pretended to ignore the old woman and another woman who were saying something to them which we could only guess was ""the old woman was about to sit there"". 

The lady next to her offered up her seat, but the other one of the two women literally squeezed in the second the woman was up. There were now about 6 people yelling at these two pretentious and inconsiderate bitches in Italian. A guy eventually offered the old lady his seat since he was getting off at the next stop. 

So after witnessing that scene my wife and I continued standing in the  center of the aisle when out of nowhere one of the women kicked my wife. Apparently my wife was too close to her. There was literally about a foot or more between my wife and this ladies legs which is actually a lot for a metro, but I digress. Apparently it was too close to that lady so she decided to kick my wife's leg with her pointy shoes. My wife was quiet.

It isn't like my wife to be quiet in that scenario so I knew she was hurt. I asked her and she said the woman's shoe hit her directly on the shin bone on a bruise she already had. 

I made her take off her backpack and I put it on my front. While doing this the woman kicked me, although less hard and less effectively as she did to my wife. Again, I guess I was too close. I can't speak Italian so I just gave her the ""I dare you to do that again"" stare. 

Once I got the backpack on my front side I was now carrying about an extra 160lbs on top of my 230lb frame. Entering the next stop, our stop, the train made a very jerky stop which was perfect. I stumbled and came down hard on her foot, trying to gain every ounce of pressure I could as I landed. My entire 400lbs came down under my brand new and large gripped hikers directly onto her open toed pointy shoes. I twisted my foot while all pressure was on her foot.

She let out a loud scream, no one cared. 

We exited the train.

I used to work really odd hours when I was younger. After work one night, about 2 or 3 in the morning, I decided to hit up the local 24/7 grocery store to pick up something to eat for breakfast the next day. 

The only cars in the lot when I pulled in were the employee cars, all parked as far away from the store as possible. I go in, do my shopping, and I'm on my way out when two obviously drunk early-20's douche guys stagger in. One of them grins at me and says ""Nice car"" as I leave. 

Great. Now I get to figure out what they did. 

There's one other car in the lot next to mine, a crappy little Honda something-or-other that was obviously one of the douche's cars. And my car had a tell-tale pattern of wetness running down the passenger door, with a puddle on the pavement next to it. The bastards had peed on my car. 

They had also left their own car doors unlocked. I briefly considered stealing the Playboy air freshener suspended from the rear-view mirror, but then I noticed a mostly-full 20 ounce Mountain Dew in the cup-holder. 

Not wanting to spend a lot of time on revenge, I poured the soda over both front seats, making sure they were plenty soaked. Got into my car, drove a little ways off, parked and waited for them to come out. Watched as they got in their car, chuckled as they got out again a few seconds later, gesturing angrily while wearing soaking wet pants.

1st, when I first got my car I took a friend to walmart to pick something up, came out to the lot about 20 minutes later to find someone had laid a cart next to my car (less than 10 fucking feet from the cart return) and then either that same person or more likely someone else rammed the cart into my car using their car (probably while pulling in to the space next to me) creating a HUGE dent, costing  $600 to fix (another long story, Walmart paid to fix it because I'm just that good with words)

2nd, So about a week later i'm at the very same Walmart late at night and there is only like 20 cars in the entire lot so we're all parked at the front. I'm walking out and I see two heifers loading their groceries into the back and they push their cart about 2 feet to the right of their vehicle (passenger side, and about 15 feet from a cart return) and get in. At this point i'm walking right by that side on the way to my car (still damaged) and i'm fuming. I nonchalantly grab their cart as I pass and pull it a few feet forward and around the back of the vehicle. I get to my car and I notice they haven't left yet. So as I get in my car and I watch them very carefully in my mirror. This hog throws her car into reverse and rams the cart so hard it hurtles forward a few feet and falls on it's side. Not only did she damage her car (I assume, I wasn't close enough to see, but she hit it HARD), but hog #2 had to get out of the car and pick up the cart so they could leave.

Let me prelude by saying this : my dad is a MASTER of petty revenge...  I'm have many stories to share.

I just discovered this sub, and I already love it.  For my first post here I give you a story of when I worked with my dad as a parking lot attendant for a very busy restaurant.



The restaurant in question was on the edge of a swampy area and did not have a proper parking lot.  Instead, we parked cars on a sort of extended dirt pier.  It was a lot more structured and stable than it may sound, however.  Without parking attendants, people would park anywhere, and there would be about 40 cars in the lot, maximum.  When we would direct traffic, we could squeeze over 80 before we had to form a line.


A major part of the job was keeping a couple areas clear - neighbors' driveways and the trash dumpster.  This story involves the dumpster.


On this particular mid-90's Saturday (both the year and the temp) it was about 6PM and the place was starting to get busy.  I was about 14 or 15 at the time, and no one really took me seriously when I asked them to correct their parking, but they usually just did whatever I asked anyways.  When my dad asked, on the other hand, people would listen, for the most part.  So this guy comes in with a full load of people, I think 4 or 5, in a brand new Mercedes.  I'm not sure what model, but I know it was really damn expensive.  The whole thing was mirror shiny with nice rims and leather interior.  He lets the passengers out and then picks his spot.  We had space for about three cars right next to the restaurant entrance, which were the spots directly in front of the dumpster.  Mr. Mercedes pulls in and parallel parks, taking up all three spots and putting his passenger door close enough to the doors to the dumpster area that you couldn't open them without hitting the car.  My dad decides to take this one and approaches as the driver exits.


""Excuse me sir, but would you mind moving your car, as we need to have access to the trash bins?""


His response was an immediate ""I certainly will NOT!"" as he shook his head like a flabbergasted 18th century judge.  He then turned his back and walked away as the others who came with him chucked, as those who consider themselves to be better than you will do...


My dad smiled politely and called after them ""Ok, enjoy your meal...""


He then turned to me and said ""watch the lot for a few...""


Dad then strolled over to our car.  Now, we had a nice car sitting at home as well, but dad has a thing for bargains, so at the time we were driving around the 1980-something Plymoth-something minivan that he had bought for a couple hundred bucks.  This thing was a wreck.  The interior was shit-brown/red, we were missing a side mirror, the windshield was streaked, I think a tail light was out, no hub-caps, no AC, paint was peeling, and to top it all of there was duct tape holding the engine together (literally, you open the hood and it was everywhere).


My dad parallel parks this travesty of a van within 2 inches of the driver's door of the Mercedes.  The only reason it even worked so close is because the mirror on that side was missing.  My dad then crawls over to the passenger seat to let himself out.  He locks the car (heheh, like it mattered) and goes about his job with a big shit-eating grin on his face.


About an hour and a half later Mr. Mercedes comes back out and approaches his car stating loudly ""WHAT THE HELL?!?!?""


He looks over at my dad and may have made a crack about us not doing our jobs, but my dad beat him to it.


""I know, some people can be so inconsiderate...""


He then walked to a safe distance so we could watch they guy as he was forced to crawl in through the passenger window (because he parked too close to the dumpster to open either of those doors), a process which took several minutes.  He was cursing the whole time.


I can just imagine what his face must have been as he saw my dad and myself waving at him through his rear view mirror as he drove away.  I think my dad told me later that night something like,


""I can get away with stuff like that...  You probably shouldn't try.""


It was a good summer.

If you've ever seen the reality show Hardcore Pawn, you know the exact type of children I am talking about. Always arguing with each other over petty bs, etc.

The brother was a nerdy intellectual type that bragged constantly about how much he spent, of the company's money, on his personal collection of expensive office equipment while crying about how little the company was making and how they couldn't afford to buy milk and sugar for the office coffee machine, so if we wanted it, we would have to bring it in ourselves from home. Meanwhile, he played games most of the day on his then brand new Mac IIFX with 21"" RasterOps monitor, while sitting in his $2,500 office chair.

One day the Fedex guy shows up with yet another package for the son and we all know what it is since he has been bragging about it for days. He ordered 2 pairs of $500 cowboy boots on the company credit card and overnighted them from texas. He and the father both shared the same first name so I hid the package until the son went out for lunch, then took the box into the father's office and handed it to him ""by accident"" ;)

When the son came back from lunch the father was standing in the front of the store wearing the brand new cowboy boots and berated him for what seemed like 15minutes straight, following him back to the son's office and yelling and screaming about using the company card for personal items. Later that day the son asked me to ship the box back. Owned.

His sister was just as bad, but was more of a daddy-approval-seeking tyrant that belittled and berated the employees, usually in front of customers, and made all of us sit around in a circle and take notes at a daily ""FYI Meeting"" that commenced 1 hr before the store opened every morning. Afterward she would call out random people and check to see if you really took notes and if you got caught faking it or not doing it correctly you were docked pay or fired. At the end of each week you had to photocopy and hand in your original notes. BTW, that extra hour everyday never showed up in your paycheck since it was on ""your time"" because the store wasn't open yet. yeah.

One day I was at one of the display Macs backing up work files when the sister walks by me, looks at what I'm doing, then continues on her way. I knew that it wouldn't end there so I devised my plan on the spot, waiting for her to return. On her way back she walks up behind me and stands there, tapping her fingernails on the back of my chair. 

""What are you doing?"" 

I didn't answer, making believe I didn't hear her so she would say it louder. 

""WHAT are you DOING?!"" 

This time I turned my head towards her slightly and said softly ""What?"" knowing she would lose it.

""I SAID WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? TELL ME *RIGHT* NOW!"" 

At this point all of the customers and sales people in the store stop what they are doing and are staring at her. After a few seconds, without looking away from the monitor, I said confidently with a hint of sarcasm: ""Stuffit.""

I didn't even have to turn around to know that her face was now beet-red and she was furious...

""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY TO ME?!?!""

Without skipping a beat, I pointed to the dialog box on the screen which showed the Stuffit Archive software progress bar working on compressing the files and I said it again ""Stuffit. I'm using Stuffit.""

Several people busted out laughing, including some customers. She grit her teeth, let out a snarl, whipped around and fast-walked to her office and slammed the door so hard that she knocked something off one of the shelves in her room which shattered when it hit the floor. We all heard a muffled ""FUCK!@#$"" right after that and everyone started laughing again. Owned.

Good times.

I used to just go in and clean up everything even if it wasn't mine. One day the instigator of the notes comes in the bathroom while I'm scrubbing away like the love child of little orphan Annie and ciderella and says ""oh my gawd you're actually cleaning"" with a smug fucking grin on, because she had never seen me do it, and assumed I never did. I fuckin hated her forever after that. I would throw her nicely decorated bitchy notes in the trash without reading them. Then one day while I was in the shower, and I knew she was waiting to shower next, so i thought id leave her a little message.

That being said, college girls usually like the athletes, so they think they're the kings on campus. One day, I'm at my girlfriend's friends house and we're drinking to eventually go party. Now its only my 4 friends and I, my girlfriend and her roommates, and some college basketball players who are friends with my girlfriend's roommates (already hammered). After the drunk basketball players leave we realize my girlfriend's phone had been taken. Knowing it was clearly the athletes, my girlfriend and I used the ""Wheres My Iphone"" app to track it down to an apartment complex a few blocks away. Calling a few girls to ask what basketball players lived in the apartment complex turned to be successful and incredibly easy. I asked them what number apartment they had lived in, and off we go. We walk into the apartment and the bedroom doors are closed, so we start tearing the house up looking for the phone when I realize the ""Sound"" button option on the Wheres My IPhone App that plays a sound on the iPhone. We play it, hear the noise coming through a bedroom, bust open the door to find said basketball players passed the fuck out, grab the phone and get the hell out, leaving the house trashed as fuck. Don't steal shit.

EDIT: just to add, this basketball player is NBA-bound (it was a big deal when he decided to stay on campus rather than enter the draft) and there is no way to be sure he didn't just drunkingly and accidentally pick up a phone mistaking it for his.

The staff felt so badly for me that let me take flex days in lieu of better payment, but I really loved what I was doing, interacting with some really fascinating people.

 Most of the clients were impoverished elderly, beyond the age of retirement, who had had amazing lives. How did I know that? I was so proficient on the computer that I was given the task of creating their resumes while chatting with them for this purpose. Most at the time had never used a computer before. I did resumes for war vets, engineers who'd had their own firms, ex-Vogue models and the like.

Anyway, one day, an elderly Eastern European gent with a really strong accent came in to get his resume done.  He took a look at me and his face got really twisty. I'm a brown girl. I explained what my role was with his resume, and he begrudgingly sat down and started to give me the details. Then...he started to rant. And rant. Not a big, ugly rant that could get him thrown out for being crazy, but a conversational rant...about immigrants taking jobs, too many refugees from stupid countries, etc. Didn't take a rocket scientist to see that he had found a target for his misplaced rage as he was very closely watching my reaction. I remained professional and directed the conversation as much as I could, then terminated.

I was seething when typing the thing up. Cursing my (now shitty) job, bringing up insecurity and sadness and a bit of fear. And oh, how I fantasized how to fuck up his resume...a wrong phone number perhaps....??

Instead...I did my best work. I did the best goddamn piece of work possible, combing art and science into a rosebud of resume perfection, beautiful, eye-catching formatting (there are tricks), summary to make the gods weep.

He came to pick it up and proofed it while I watched. Silence. Silence. Silence.

He mumbled without looking at me, ""Thank you. This is very...good.""

Then left.

Sorry this doesnt have the payoff as some other ones, but it felt like it to me. He might have expected me to be petty, I don't know. Maybe I worked in thawing a bit of his heart?

My family lives out in the country, so we don't really have to deal with neighbors except for one, and she's as crazy as they come. We've got a history of putting up with her bullshit simply to avoid the hassle of getting the police involved. I'll start with some craziness we've had to deal with in the past and the events leading up to my petty revenge. FYI, our house is fairly close to the property line, which is an important factor in some of her antics.

**This next paragraph isn't important, it's just some of the stories about how crazy she is. You can skip it if you want.**  

We have a bunch of chickens, and she has a couple too. She never had them locked up or anything, so they decided the grass was greener on the other side and started living with our flock of birds (we didn't really notice, because we had a couple hundred at the time and there were only 2 or 3 that came over). Apparently, she thought we stole them so she came over (trespassing) and caught them and brought them back to her house, but they kept coming back over to our yard. So she accused us of stealing them, which was preposterous, since we didn't want them (we show our birds, and hers were just some mixes that were worthless, and we definitely didn't take them for the eggs since we have to get rid of hundreds of eggs a year). 

Another time, she decided to do some target practice with a friend (who happened to be an off duty cop). so they hung up some targets and went to town. We have our own guns and like to shoot stuff every now and then, so we would have had no problem with that except for one small thing. They hung the targets up so they were shooting towards our property, and didn't have a backdrop or anything to stop the bullets. My sister was outside, and she said she heard popping by her, which turned out the be the bullets pinging off rocks, so she eventually put 2 and 2 together, and GTFO'd. She's amazingly lucky she didn't get hit, later we looked where she was sitting and there were marks on rocks ~10 ft from her, but my family must have cats as our spirit animals because everyone has had several accidents where they should have died but walked away without a scratch. My parents drove over there and gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was just an oversight and asked her to move the targets, but told her if it happened again they'd call the cops which I'm assuming would end up with some pretty hefty charges, for both her AND her cop friend. 

**On to the actual story...**

It started with her deciding that she wanted some paths back in the woods behind our houses so she could ride her 4 wheeler back there. So she hired a landscaping company to come out and take out a bunch of trees and bulldoze a path back there for her. Despite having the property line marked, her path went a decent way onto our property. We told her she couldn't do that, and thought that would be the end of it. She didn't agree. She started off small, riding her 4 wheeler right on the property line whenever she heard us outside, but we barely noticed. Then she upped the ante. We started hearing her radio blaring all the time, including all night long. This actually bothered us, since we usually leave our windows open at night. We called the cops a couple weeks after the start of this, but they said they couldn't do anything about it during the day and we would have to call back at night when the noise ordinances were in effect, but that was more hassle than my parent's wanted since they had to work early and didn't want to spend several hours on a work night dealing with that. Then one day I was back in the woods cutting up some trees that had fallen in a storm, and noticed that there were a bunch of speakers right on the property line, 6 IIRC and they were decent outdoor speakers, all pointing towards our house. I decided that if my parents weren't going to do anything, I would, and started hatching my plot for revenge. 

The catalyst for my revenge came about a week later. Our phone went out, a pretty common occurrence, so we thought nothing of it. We called the phone company, They said there weren't any outages in the area, so it must be something with our lines. They sent a tech out, he started at the house and couldn't find anything wrong there, so he checked our box out by the road. A couple minutes later, he comes back and asks if we had anyone work on it recently. Nope, nothing of the sort. Then he took me out and showed me what was wrong. Someone had taken some bolt cutters, cut the lock off of the box and cut a bunch of wires inside, then closed it back up and put the lock back on so you wouldn't notice unless you took a close look. I had one suspect on the list. 

That night, I went out and took care of business. I took a piece of wire and used it reach through the protective screen on the front of them and poke holes in the cones of all the speakers. A couple hours later, blessed silence. The holes I poked had turned into tears. I still laugh picturing her wondering how all 6 of her decent quality speakers blew out at the same time. A week or so later we heard the music going again, and my parents had remembered how nice it was to be able to sleep at night without shitty music blaring, so they called the cops up at 2 in the morning and had them make her shut her one-woman revenge party down.

I just go through school and ignore him, but by my senior year he is still doing this and now I really hate him.

We end up having the same teacher for English 4(luckily for different periods) and my English teacher ends up really liking me. 

One day near the end of the year I'm staying after class to help her with some stuff and here comes in McDouch and he starts talking to the teacher about his grade. Apparently, he is borderline failing this class and if he does fail then he won't be able to graduate on time and have to go for an extra year. He starts pleading and begging for extra credit work to boost his grade.

After he leaves my teacher turns to me and asks ""So trizion720, what do you think of McDouch?"" Me not missing a beat began to tell her about all the mean things he has said and done to me. I explicitly tell her how much I dislike him and how much trouble he causes not only for me but to other students. After this she thanks for my input and I leave for the day.

Later that week I was in the school library helping scan in the new books and I happen to overhear McDouch sobbingly say how he won't be able to graduate on time because the teacher won't give him extra credit work.

I've been taking care of my family my whole life, while they really never gave anything back in return. Especially the last 8 years.

When I turned 18/19 years old, my grandparents and my dad passed away. All the expectations were put on me to go get a job, take care of my grandparents, then their place once they passed away until we could sell it, and basically handle all the stresses and responsibilities while my mom coddled my younger brother (23 now) and they sat around watching TV all day cause they ""couldn't handle it"".

Even up until recently whenever they needed money for something, or a bill, or whatever I'd be the one to go get a job, a second job, sell some of my shit while they did nothing except say ""oh..thanks"".

Anyways, fast forward to today. I'm still living at home, taking care of my mom and brother. My mom FINALLY got a part time job (only because she pissed away all her inheritance money) and has been working for awhile. About a month ago, my brother gets a job. Yay, good for him. He tells me he's planning to move out with his girlfriend in about 6-12 months cause he wants to get out on his own. I have no problem with that, so long as we all have plan. The bills being split 3 ways is fine, but if one of us leaves, it's gonna mess everything up for the other two people, unless we have something set up.

A week later he moves out. Then he denies ever saying any of that. Gets pissed at me because even though I'm happy for him, it sucks cause he's kind of fucking things up for us. He calls me an asshole, tells me to fuck off, and cuts me out of his life since ""I don't do shit"" even though I've been taking care of both their asses the last 8 years while he sits in his room all day eating taquitos and playing maplestory.

He also takes his mom's car, because for some dumb reason she put the car in HIS name, paid it off, and is keeping him on her insurance, even though she doesn't have a car and has to walk to work now. She doesn't even get mad, or try to talk to him, she let's him do whatever cause apparently he's the good kid or whatever.

So now we're in a bit of a crisis because we've got to figure out to cover his 1/3rd of everything. At this point I should also mention our bills are way higher than they should be because during one of the times I was living on my own, my mom apparently ""forgot"" to pay some of her bills for like 8 months. Which I should also mention, during the times I lived on my own I was always paid for my costs, plus gave her money to help with her own bills, and then she would still try to mooch extra money out of me by bullshitting me about some bill or whatever and then giving that money to my brother or buying cigarettes.

Anyways, back to the present. I'm now scrambling for a second job. I stay up about 3 days straight, with barely 2-3 hours of sleep per night, applying for jobs online/in person, going to interviews, etc etc. What's my mom doing? Watching TV and smoking e-cigs. I get on her ass to do something and she gives me the same answer she's given me the last 8 years: she'll sell something, or borrow money from a neighbor. Which NEVER happens. At this point I should also mention she's kind of a hoarder and has all my grandparents and my dads shit in the garage and backyard. Apparently she can't sell the stuff yet (which she's been saying since 2005) because she needs a digital camera. Even though both my girlfriend and I have explained to her HUNDREDS of times that we have cameras on our phones, there's ebay apps. It takes two fucking seconds, but regardless, most of that stuff is shit anyways save for a few personal items and some jewelry. And she should just get off her ass and get another damn job.

So I'm driving to work last night and I'm fuming. But I'm looking at everything objectively. Realistically, we're behind on rent, which again, my mom doesn't care about. ""Oh, our landlord's nice she doesn't mind."" ""Oh there was problems with this place before we moved in, so it's okay if we're little short."" 

Our rent is due on the 1st. We got an extension to the 5th. Then the 8th. Then the 15th. My mom's planning to pay this month on the 24th! Every month I've always had my share, plus more, covered. It's always on her, or my brother's end that the money isn't there.

So I'm looking at this and I'm like: ""there's no fucking way I can do this. Even if I get this month, what about next month? And the month after that?"" I mean, yeah, I already work 7 days a week, I COULD get a 3rd, 4th, 5th job, but then I wouldn't have time to go EMT school. I'd be making just enough to cover EVERYTHING but I wouldn't have any extra money to get myself out and into something better.

And it's at this point I say ""fuck it"". I'm not paying a single penny more. I've got several offers from friends to move in with them for 1/3rd of what I'm paying now, no cost for utilities or anything else. I'm good to go. I'm taking my money and gtfo.

But I'm not a complete asshole, not just yet anyways. This is still going to benefit my mom as well because if she's not paying anything either she can save up her money. She's probably got 30-90 days to gtfo, and even then she could milk that by squatting or whatever. That's thousands of dollars to get another place, get a cheap car, whatever, get her shit together. She's never really had to figure things out on her own because me, or someone else would always ""fix"" everything.

Here's where my revenge comes in: I'm not on the lease. Years ago, when I was living on my own, my mom wanted me to co-sign on a lease with her. And she swore up and down that it wouldn't affect anything, and that she'd handle everything, but I didn't buy it. My brother, however, did.

So I'm not liable for anything. I'm leaving, and they can have fun dealing with clearing out all of mom's shit. Oh and they're also required to have a professional cleaner come in and clean before they leave as well. Which could be a bit costly considering my mom has a few cats that she lets do whatever they want and doesn't care. They piss on something or tear on the carpet and ""oh well, the fence was kind of messed up when we got here. I don't think the landlord will care. There are 'wear and tear' laws too so I don't think she expects it to be immaculate or anything.""

And I'd offer to help buy getting a u-haul truck to get all their shit out, or help pay for a professional cleaning, but I'm not on the lease. Oh and my brother just told me to ""fuck off"" and cut me out of his life a week ago while my mom just sits around not doing anything to fix the situation like she always does.

So now they can both ""fuck off"" and ""deal with it"". 

TL;DR: Lazy mom and coddled younger brother treat me like shit and only need me when they need money. Brother moves out, tells to me FO, and mom puts all the shit on me. I have enough and leave and their left to deal with everything since their name is on the lease and not me.

At the time they were living in St Louis, but were trying to sell their house to move to Kansas where they had bought land and were building a house to live in in their soon to be retirement. 

I was desperate for any job at the time, and ended up working at a mall based clothing outfitter. Happy to have any type of income, I was willing to put up with anything at this point. 

As you can imagine, I was constantly hounded by my manager to push the store sponsored credit card, as well as pester people constantly when all they wanted to do was look at clothing. The general manager was actually a decent guy, minus the credit card pushing. However. There was one assistant manager. Imagine the fakest, most bubbly personality you can. Then add in that she was condescending, but in the *nicest* way possible. Nicest being a relative term if you will.

Now, I had recently been accepted into a specific program for what I wanted to go to school for, but it was in KC, a good 3 hour drive away. A family member in the area had graciously agreed to let stay with them until my parents sold their house. I informed my manager of when I would be leaving, but for some reason he scheduled me for a shift past that date. I actually did drive all the way back for the shift, and upon working that shift, realized they had put me down for another one past that. 

The shift I drove back for happened to be a closing shift. It also happened that I was the only male closing that particular night, and the stars also aligned and the closing manager was the aforementioned Asst. manager. So we close the doors, and what happens, **every** female goes to the women's side of the store to do closing duties, leaving me completely alone to do the entire men's side. Fuck me right?

It wasn't a big store, and I could hear all of my female coworkers very clearly. Cue the Asst. Manager, somewhat verbatim, 'I wish drunksaver wasn't here so we could have *girl* talk.' 'He only has that much done so far? Why is he so slow?' and finally, she sent one of the other females to help me. 'He hasn't even finished fronting all of those jeans, WTF.' I don't know, maybe because I've been working by myself you fucking hatchet gash. I'm pretty pissed, but I keep my mouth shut, do my job, and go home.

Now, fast forward to the next week. My uncle has been working on a new deck for his backyard. So instead of driving 3 hours for a shift I told them I couldn't work, I get there bright and early to help him. About one hour after my scheduled shift, I get a call. From my favorite Asst. Manager. It was a sunday and they were slammed, was I coming in today? 

'No, I told you I couldn't work past this date, I already drove back and did you guys a favor on that last shift. But it's ok, now you can have all the *girl* talk you want tonight.' Click.

Prior to graduating from my university, I was living in some highrise student housing with an attached garage. It was a nice place, in the middle of downtown, many great restaurants just a few blocks away. However, the one downside of living there, was that it was half a block away from a theater. Not a movie theater, live theater. As a result, people would park in the garage and fill it up on nights there are shows. I normally didn't mind, as I payed for a monthly parking permit which guaranteed me a parking spot. There were the occasional nights where people would park very shittily, either intentionally or not, and prevent others from parking next to them; which usually skewed the numbers to gauge how full the lot was. But, I was usually lucky and didn't have any problem finding a space.

It's also worth mentioning, at this time I was on a hormone supplement prescribed by my doctor to help me with a condition. They hadn't quite gotten the dosage right, and at the time, my testosterone was running at 4x the amount it should have been. It was like I was on steroids.

Story time:

I was driving home from work one Friday, having had a really bad day, getting stiffed from customers and being bitched at by my boss. Add in girlfriend problems, and it all coalesced into a shitstorm of fuck everything.

I lived in the downtown area, but worked about 15 miles away, meaning every night I got off I would have to deal with rush hour traffic. The place I was living was convenient for school, but fuck was it annoying to get to. What made it even worse to deal with, was that I had to piss REALLY badly. My-bladder-is-going-to-explode bad.

As I said, it was a Friday. I suspected the normal theater traffic clogging up the garage I parked in, and prepared myself for the worst. But what I came to, sent me in to a realm of pissed off that I have never been to: Apparently a group of fuckwads decided to take up an entire row of parking with their BMW's, each one taking up two spots. Normally the garage accounts for shit parking jobs, but this congested things even more. 

I drive around for 10 minutes, checking every level, trying to find a parking spot. Even though my pass guaranteed me a spot, there was absolutely none to be found. As I circled each level, there was a (sur-fucking-prise!) BMW SUV that was going the same way as me, but on the opposite side of the level. It's like we were doing a mating dance. With each level, my testosterone-saturated body grew more and more frustrated.

So, I reach the bottom level. The Sub-Sub-Sub basement. Normally, there is MAYBE 5 cars here, usually fairly nice ones that the owners didn't want anyone to scuff or deal with, which I can respect. However, tonight, it was the same as every level above: every spot filled. I circle and circle, and see my BMW nemesis circling as well until...'Lo! Behold! someone is backing out of their spot. But...my nemesis sees this as well....

The lane that they were pulling out of was shaped like a T, and I was going to be able to make the right turn into the lane, and make it into the spot. Rules of the road, and sheer physics made it so the BMW was going to have to let him pass, and meanwhile, victory would be mine! Or so I thought. The BMW knows they are going to be second. They are going to lose. So, the driver has his wife get out, and STAND IN THE FUCKING SPOT. MY GOD WAS I SO PISSED. I flip them off, knowing I had lost the battle, but I would not lose the war.

I talked to the parking attendant, and told them that there was absolutely no spots available. That I had circled the garage for 20 minutes trying to find a spot with no luck whatsoever. He allows me to park behind the attendants shack, and to move it later in the evening when parking became less scarce. I was thankful, but my mind still plotted revenge on the BMW...

Seeing as BMW's were the cause of all this nonsense, having a BMW jack the spot that was guaranteed by my parking contract was absolute insult to injury. I was pissed off, and nothing was going to slake that until I took action.

Remember that piss I had to take really badly?

Well, I went up to my room and found a disposable water bottle. Took it to the bathroom, and proceeded to fill the entire fucking thing to the brim. It looked like a bottle filled with apple juice. I knew what I was going to do was wrong, but at the moment, that bottle looked like the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

I go back downstairs, find the accursed BMW that caused my anguish, and DOUSED THE FUCKER. I emptied the entire bottle of piss all over it. Windshield, door handles, windows, everything. I got it good and covered.

Content with my job, I walked back upstairs, threw away the evidence, and proceeded to cook myself some dinner.

Felt guilty about it afterwards, but what can I say?

Japanese lesbian revenge. ,396,59,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/14uaro/vote_up_ifjust_kidding_japanese_lesbian_revenge/,"Some years ago, I was a student in England, staying in a shared student house. Me, one English white guy, two Japanese, and a spare room.

One day, the two Japanese, who were lovely people, asked me if someone they knew, also Japanese, could have the spare room. They also said that she'd been kicked out of her previous house because she'd caused a lot of trouble. As it was only for a month, and I was in charge of who could come stay as I was the landlord's friend, I agreed.

So this tiny little Japanese woman, early 20s, moved in. From the very first day she picked fights with everyone, told everyone to clean up all the time (we weren't that bad), was a constant pain, complained about everything - music too loud, smoking inside, shoes inside, drinking too much tea (!), you name it, she called it. On and on this went, for weeks. Blazing rows, people arguing, just a total shit-storm. 

In the space of a month she disrupted a relatively peaceful household, and turned it into pure turmoil. I absolutely hated her. 

Anyway, she eventually left, having finished her studies - to go back to Japan. 

She had left instructions with the other Japanese female in the house to forward her degree certificate to Japan, as it was coming to our house.

I happened to be the only person in when it arrived. I steamed open the stiff cardboard envelope, and carefully removed her certificate from the cardboard frame. I went upstairs to a (ok my) porn stash (this was pre-internet domination of porn) and got a picture of two lesbians doing lesbian things, something akin to goatse, and inserted this picture in the frame. In fairness, I also placed the certificate behind the picture - I'm not a monster! I resealed the package and put it back with the other mail. It was sent to Japan like this. 

A few weeks later I heard reports from my Japanese friend, who thought the whole thing was hilarious, even though I'd told no-one at the time, that the bitch was truly upset - shrieking and crying as she'd opened the envelope in front of her parents. I've no idea if she found her certificate or not.

In gym class, I saw a gal crying in the locker room on my way out the door one day. I asked her what was wrong. She told me that another girl, ""Julie,"" was being really mean to her. I gave her a hug and decided I would look out for the way Julie was acting the next day. 

After overhearing the things Julie said to this gal the next day, which included a lot of derogatory nonsense about what underwear she was ""allowed"" to wear so that Julie wouldn't ""throw up all over her,"" I invited the girl to share my locker. She changed next to me for the rest of the semester, and Julie decided to pick on another friend of mine instead. 

She stuck gum in my friend's hair, threw a handful of coins at her car, and left awful notes in her locker. 

A few weeks later, we were dissecting fetal pigs in biology class. I asked my teacher if I could take the tongue with me, and she handed me a plastic bag and said ""have at it."" I carried it in my purse all day until PE, when I waited for Julie to leave the locker room. The friend of mine she had been tormenting kept watch as I slipped the pig's tongue into the back pocket of the jeans hanging in Julie's locker. I knew she kept her locker unlocked because the week before, I shoved her lock into a cow's eyeball so that she'd have to touch it to open her locker. She had kept it unlocked ever since. 

Unfortunately, Julie walked around the other side of the lockers just as I was closing up. She yelled some really trashy stuff and then accused me of stealing from her, but for whatever reason, she didn't bother telling the gym teacher. She wound up finding the tongue when she put her jeans back on after class, and the scream I heard from across the locker room was extremely satisfying. 

I was called into the principals' office the next day and they said they had to suspend me. The school police officer was also informed of what happened, but he patted me on the back and told me he had heard plenty what an awful girl she was. The principals told me to consider my suspension, which fell on the last day of my senior year of high school, a ""day off,"" and my parents took me shopping.

For those of you in the know, simply stating ""I-290 to west bound I-90/94"" will suffice but for the rest of you...so there's an 8-10 lane highway that crosses a 10-12 lane highway just a stones throw from downtown Chicago. The east-to-north-bound ramp, (technically east-to-west bound despite running north, for added confusion), was designed by Satan himself, its I-beams forged in the fires of hell. It is but a single lane wide. You are alerted to your impending doom miles before-hand, because that's how long the exit lane is usually backed up for. Reasonable people gradually move into that lane and accept their miserable fate. Assholes like to fly up to the front, and sit in/completely block one of the lanes of traffic going straight until they can weasel their way in, avoiding the line.

I'm in this line, and pretty close to the actual exit ramp - I've put in my time. It's moving at a (relatively) decent clip too. Yayyy! Now, I play a pretty mean asshole defense when I'm in that lane. More than 2 feet of space is enough for one of these pricks to slither under the bar of common courtesy and wedge their bumper into the space in front of you. I've successfully warded off several attacks. I laugh as my victims have gestures and obscenities hurled at them from the lanes these douche canoes are blocking as they try and cut the line at the last second. They give me the irritated ""Seriously bro? You're really not going to let me merge in?"" look. I return with a look of my own - ""I'm for reals, bro. I play for keeps. There's no cutsies while I'm on watch"" As an fyi, this is during rush hour. Everyone on the road knows damn well about that exit. I feel bad for the lanes that are being blocked, but this is a necessary evil. An example must be made and the line must hold! I'm about to get on to the ramp when all of a sudden, some turd nugget and his wife in a hybrid Lexus SUV (don't know why the car make/model makes it worse, but it does) comes flying up, slams on his brakes, literally skids, and slides his wheel into the 6 inch space between me and the car in front of me. I'm still shocked he didn't actually hit anyone. Shit. I know I've lost this battle - he's got his nose in and any collision would be my fault. But I may yet win the war. I lay on the horn to let him know I don't appreciate his reckless driving. He sticks his pasty arm out the window and he. Flips. Me. Off. Ohhhh its on like Donkey Kong, my balding, middle aged friend. My jimmies demand to be sated! I know I'll never be able to get in front of him and cut him off later, traffic won't allow it.

But it is not enough - them fancy cars have mirrors that auto dim, my first attempt at petty revenge would be but a minor irritant doomed before it even began. Then I see my chance. He's having an animated conversation with his wife. Talking about Ed Hardy t-shirts or some other douche bag thing, no doubt. I wasn't listening to loud music at the time, but I suddenly feel in the mood to re-live SA with some Bassnectar...on the 4000 watt RMS sound system my younger and (just slightly) less mature self had installed. I turn it to the rarely used ""11"". The bass is approaching ""soul rattling"" on the really-fucking-loud-o-meter. I see his wife lean in. She can't hear him anymore. His hand motions grow more exaggerated and wild with each passing second. She finally just shrugs at him. He turns around and looks out his back window in an ill conceived attempt to stare me down. I shall have none of it! Instead..a stroke of genius...he's not using his fancy mirrors! His defenses are down! Quick...the hi-beams! He jerks back as the brights nail him in his beady little eyes. He smacks his head on the side of the passenger seat head rest. Victory is mine! I immediately turn off the stereo so he knows exactly what just happened...and because its annoying to everyone else on the road. My jimmies are satisfied and I'm all grins the rest of the way home.

Anyways I posted a picture of me in costume acting out the scene where he puts his finger to his head, well apparently someone didn't like this. Around the end of 2012 I'm working the closing shift at work and a cop walks in and asks for me, I of course was scared shitless thinking someone in my family just died, but no, it was because someone called the police over this costume and said that they thought I was going to harm either myself or someone else. Well two more cops come in, talk to me, laugh it off for the most part and let me get back to work. Not only was this fucking embarrassing but it could've also got me fired. 

Well about a week later I get a call from my mother telling me she now know who did this, it was one of my cousins who well I don't talk to, I don't remember ever seeing, and who well I don't even fucking know. Turns out her and her mother (convinced her to call the cops) are coming to visit my aunt in the summer and were afraid of me. Never got to know me or anything, but fuck me right? No fuck them, so I get my mom to convince them that because of this situation I now have no job, and may become homeless soon. They feel fucking horrible now, apologized profusely to my mom and even my aunt, but not to me of course, didn't even mention anything about trying to help me ""get my job back"" or anything. Now remember how I said they're coming over in the summer? Well that's this month, and I'm showing up to greet them in ripped clothes and without showering in a few days to make them feel more guilty for more petty revenge.

It had lots of great historical details: hardwood floors, high ceilings, arched doorways; but was nicely remodeled with modern amenities. We loved living there, we knew all our neighbors and got along great with them until this upstairs tenant moved in.

This lady was a divorced single mom, who had a brat of a kid around 3 years old. She used to let the kid run up and down the whole length of the apartment in her shoes, the kid would have screaming tantrums that would go on for about 20 minutes and was awful to listen to: she stomped on the floors, kicked at the walls, shrieked at the top of her lungs, threw toys on the floor. At first, we tried to ignore it, thinking the kid was trying to adjust to a new living situation. But we learned that the tantrums would occur daily and the mom would just ignore the kid. After a couple weeks, we introduced ourselves and politely let her know that the noises traveled and bothered us. She didn't do anything about it and made it clear that she didn't care if it bothered us. After a few more weeks, we let our landlord know about it. The landlord bought area rugs with thick pads for that upstairs unit to try to alleviate the noise, but the asshole tenant refused to use the rugs. 

This tenant began to try to cause problems for us, as well. She found out that we had dogs and claimed that her kid started having severe allergies. She made the landlord do a mold test in her apartment and clean all the a/c ducts and filters in her unit. Then she insinuated that our dog hairs were coming up through the air filters and causing allergy attacks on her kid. This was all within only 2-3 months of moving in. 

We continued to have to live like this. Constantly being woken up at 6:30 am to a kid running around the apartment and having tantrums, weekends where the tenant would purposely have play dates and allow the kids to run, jump, and yell in her unit. It was horrible. Home was no longer home. There wasn't a single room in our apartment that we could relax in to escape the tantrums, running, and stomping. All the other tenants hated her and had problems with her, too. The landlord didn't do anything about it because the tenant was also threatening and making her life hell, as well. 

So our neighbor living next door to us owned a single family residence. That neighbor was working out of state at the time and was also in the process of slowly relocating out of state. She was rarely home. One night, the bitch tenant came home late from a date, couldn't find any parking on the street, and decided to just park in our neighbor's driveway - without asking. She simply decided that because that driveway was free, she was going to park there rather than park a block away - that's the kind of entitled crappy attitude she had.

The next morning at around 7 am, I received a text from my neighbor.

""Hey prawntohe, is that your Prius in my driveway?""

I looked out, recognized it as the Prius belonging to the bitch tenant upstairs and texted back, 

""No. I have no idea whose car that is. You should just tow it.""

My neighbor called the tow truck. 

One of the other tenants in the building was much nicer than I am and tried to wake up the bitch tenant, but she wasn't coming to the door. 

Ten minutes later, the tow truck arrives. Without delay, it hitches her car up and starts driving away. That was when the bitch tenant comes banging out her apartment, running barefoot in a guy's long tee shirt, and yelling for the tow truck to stop.

It didn't. Her car got towed.

The break up was ugly. In the aftermath, we did talk, much less acknowledge each other.

One midsummer night later that year, my friend and I are at the local bar watching a game. Midnight rolls around and the bar has emptied out pretty substantially (it's a Wednesday) when suddenly, a rather raucous group enters.

Looking over, the first thing I notice is it's *her* and her friends with whom I no longer have a cordial relationship. The second thing I notice is her birthday crown. It's her 21st. My back is to the entryway, so I turn back to the game and ignore them. They choose a table two or three behind ours. I don't know if any of them noticed me or my friend as they're rather inebriated. Well at some point, *she* walks up behind me and my friend, puts two shots down on the table, says ""Here, I can't drink these all by myself,"" and walks off. I still don't know if she knew who she was giving a shot to.

I decided it would be rude to accept a drink from her, without buying her one of her own on her birthday, her 21st no less. So the next time the waitress came by my table, I asked if I could send a drink to the birthday girl.

""Of course, what should I get her?""

""Send her a redheaded slut. Tell her its from Matt.""

A few minutes later, the waitress returns. ""I gave her the drink, and she was extremely freaked out.""

That alone made it worth the $6 and I thought that was the end of it. However, the next morning, my buddy who was at the bar with me sent me something he saw on Facebook: [her post birthday status.](http://imgur.com/d1KP8th)

Initially.,381,45,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1crktz/garage_revenge_i_knew_nothing_about_initially/,"A week ago I had new tires put on my car at a local shop. I got an estimate the week before and it was for under $700.00. Deal. Made my appointment and had the summer tires put on my rims but not on the car. I left for a few hours and came back to pick them up and pay. It was busy in the waiting area and the guy behind the counter (I have known him from elementary school but we were never good friends, just acquaintances) told me to bring my car around back to pick up the tires and he would do the paper work while I did this. Great!

I put the tires in the trunk and went back to the office area. I stood in line for a few minutes looked down at my hands and they were very dirty from loading the wheels. I said to ""Kenny"" over the few people that were in front of me that I would be back in a few as I was going to wash my hands. ""No problem"" he said. 

When I returned from washing this older guy (60's) was coming in and basically cut me off to get in front of me. Who cares. I never thought any more of it. There was one person ahead of him and then me. The lady in front of him was looked after by Kenny very quickly. Kenny then looked over the short, fattish, sixtyish man and said to me that I was next. Great!

Well, the old bastard went ape shit. Yelling and screaming about customer service and how he was there first blah blah blah. Kenny politely told him that in actuality he had not been there first and that indeed I had been. The old fart went ballistic again and this time turned to face me to try to draw me into his bullshit. I said (very loudly), ""Kenny... look after this guy first. He is going to have a heart attack and we will have to perform CPR on him. I really don't think I will be that into it (referring to having to do CPR) if this old bastard takes the big one right here"" Well at that he started swearing at ""Kenny"" and told him he would never walk through the doors again. He was ""FINISHED WITH THIS FUCKING PLACE"".

Kenny got him looked after and the old shit left telling him and me to fuck off. 

Kenny rang me through told me to have a good weekend. I left. Went home. Sat in the garage and looked at my bill. $483.00. WTF? I called the garage but it had since closed for the weekend. I called him back on Monday and told him that he only charged me $483.00 which was the price of the tires plus tax. Kenny says ""I know. I charged the guy who was yelling and screaming for the balancing, materials, and warranty. I figure since he said he would never be back I might as well make sure he will never be back.""

I worked at Arizona State University's MBA program as a programmer and tech-support specialist. I worked there for about six months and then I was gone over the summer because I had joined the Army and I had Basic Training that summer. After I came back they had expanded the program. They liked my programming skills so they basically just had me do programming and no tech support. During the summer another guy had joined (Chris) who was also a good programmer; we became pretty good friends. They also hired a few other people who were supposed to be just tech support personnel. They were all pretty nice, except for this one guy named Michael.

This guy was one of the most stuck-up and arrogant assholes I have seen. Now I was a huge proponent of Free Software and such, but this guy was a zealot. He would go on and on about how evil Microsoft was, how Linux was going to cure cancer, and all kinds of stuff. Chris and I mostly just ignored him because we were trying to work. But ignoring him didn't help. He would constantly ask us what we were working on and sometimes just to be polite we would tell him. He would immediately pooh-pooh what we were doing and talk about how what we were doing was so ""1970's"" (I still don't know what that meant) and how he had made better software when he was in high school. We would just roll our eyes and go back to work. Once I called him out on his coding skills and asked him to show us his ""amazing software accomplishments"". He said something about how he didn't have the disk on him or some crap and then wandered away. 

I was in my sophomore year and working towards getting a Computer Engineering degree. I also *loved* to write code and so frequently wrote code for fun. I was pretty confident in what I knew, as was Chris. Michael, on the other hand, wasn't even a CS or a CSE major. Yet he would keep talking about all this crap he did and how he was an amazing programmer. I once also called him out when he claimed that we weren't real programmers because we didn't know assembly programming (I had *just* finished an assembly-programming class the previous semester). So I started asking him simple questions about basic assembly-programming. He was taken aback and started stuttering because he was bullshitting about knowing assembly and didn't except to be called out on it. Chris and I just laughed at him. He glowered at us and then went away.

As the weeks went by, we hired more programmers. All of us basically shared these three or four laptops. So when one shift ended and the other person came in, we would hand off our laptops to them. For some reason (I forget why; it's been over 10 years) Michael got a laptop. On this laptop, he proceeded to install all kinds of obnoxious crap that slowed the computer down to such a degree that it made development absolutely impossible. He installed SETI@Home, Folding@Home, and a bunch of other crap. Initially we just thought it was slow, but one time I got it and it was so unusable that I went through and tried to see what was going on. That's when I discovered all the crap that Michael had installed. Michael's favorite thing on that machine was the Mozilla suite (i.e, the browser and everything that came with it. This was in the early 2000's so FireFox wasn't even out). All of our development was in IE and the only reason Michael used Mozilla was because ""Microsoft is evil and I don't want to support them."" Never mind the fact that *he was still using a Windows machine*. I mean, I hated IE as well, but I had to work with it and IE 6 was still a decent browser at the time; there weren't any other good alternatives back then (it was a dark time). 

Anyway, people were getting tired of his crap. We were getting tired of his attitude and the fact that he would install junk on the laptop even after we uninstalled it. 

So using my l33t hax0r skillz, I wrote a little script that would run on startup and uninstall *every* program that Michael had installed. None of us used the crap he did, so it was easy to tell which programs were his. I named the script something important sounding like ""KeyAccessServer32"" or something and also made it so that it would run silently. I installed it and waited for the fun to begin.

For the first day or two we didn't hear anything; I think he just assumed that one us was deleting his software. Then I think he noticed that he had to reinstall his stuff *every* time. So he started sending out emails (I am paraphrasing these):

First email:

&gt; Why is my software getting uninstalled? 

Second email:

&gt; I am noticing that my software is getting uninstalled. Is this a new department policy?

Last email:

&gt; Whoever keeps uninstalling Mozilla and my other software, please stop. It is extremely annoying. I have to waste a lot of my time reinstalling everything whenever I start my shift.

He sent these emails out to the entire department. Of course, none of us responded and we all just laughed behind his back. My boss was in on it as well and he thought it was hilarious. Sometimes Michael and I would be on the same shift and I would glance over at him from the corner of my eye to see him sigh and roll his eyes and basically throw a mini-tantrum every time he started his shift because all his precious software was gone.

Eventually he installed something called ""Startup Cop"" and figured out that ""KeyAccessServer32"" was deleting his files. So he then asked me what that was. I lied and said that ""It is probably something the university put in place. They are getting pretty strict about unauthorized and pirated software so I wouldn't touch it."" He grumbled something about suppressing free speech and free software or something and went back to his work. 

Since that day, he never tried to install anything, and he *never* knew that it was me who was behind ""KeyAccessServer32"".",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1360693830.0,,,True,t3_18e1vr,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/18e1vr/getting_back_at_a_egotistical_knowitall_wannabe/,

During the Christmas season, we take hundreds of orders a day, and around dinnertime we will occasionally run out of our more popular items.

On one particularly busy day we had completely run out of baguettes, which was an inconvenience to most, but our customers were understanding.

Most were understanding.

Through the crowded restaurant I saw an elderly couple enter. They are known as the safari couple at this Panera because they are always completely dressed in North Face and Columbia gear so they look like theyre about to go exploring in a fucking rainforest. I prayed they wouldn't end up at my register, but sure enough they did.

This bitchy old couple orders the most complicated sandwiches you could possibly conceive, utilizing toppings that i didn't even know we offered. And then, of course, they ordered bread as their sides.

When I tried to explain that we had run out of baguettes and offered an alternative bread as a side, they acted as if i had slain their first born son. ""How can a bread company not have bread?"" they yelled, drawing the attention of the room. They had the audacity to demand a discount.  My manager was drawn to the situation by the shouting, and gave the couple a free dessert as an apology. Pussy.

I was not going to let them off that easy. When they offered me a fifty dollar bill for a 18 dollar meal, I knew I had them right where I wanted them. As change, I gave them 20- one dollar bills, 2-five dollar bills, and about 3 dollars in dimes. I returned their change in cupped hands with a deadpan look on my face.

Expectedly, they asked to see my manager again. This time a different manager (much cooler) calmly told them that I had already shut my drawer so there was nothing he could do about it. The safari couple had the two reddest faces i have ever seen, or will ever see, in my entire life. They made the standard threats of loss of business, reports etc. as they stormed out the door. My manager gave me a fist bump under the counter and told me to help the next customer. Justice had been served.

Tl;dr: a elderly couple gives me crap for something outside of my control, so i gave them a ridiculous amount of change.

I married my ""high school sweatheart"".  I met my wife when I was 15 years old and was instantly enthralled. Fast forward through the boring parts (losing our virginity to each other, prom, high school, blah blah blah) and we decided to get married when I was 21.  

I felt that I was mature for 21; I'd graduated from community college while holding down a full time job, two part time jobs, and had started developing a career.  I'd already spent the last six years with this girl and was ready to start building life together.  She was ready to be 21 and have a good time (I missed ***all*** the warning signs and chose not to listen to anyone's advice).  While I was busy developing a career and attempting to save for our future (kids and home), she was busy spending the money I earned and partying with her girlfriends.  We'd fight because we didn't spend enough time together then we'd fight because we didn't have enough money (I stopped working so much in order to spend more time with her).  

I managed to find a balance and we were spending more time together.  I frequently attended concerts and had always gone with my friends as she disliked my music (she was also 5' tall and didn't like to be on the floor).  My favorite band was playing a show soon and she said that she would like to come.  I reluctantly purchased 4 tickets on the mezzanine so she could enjoy herself.  She called me after work that day and said she wasn't feeling well and didn't want to come, instead she was going over to a friend's house to watch movies and relax.  The plan was for me to pick her up after the show and go home.  I phoned her after the show and she was obliterated drunk.  I wasn't happy and told her I didn't want to see her, that she should just stay at her friend's for the night.  Instead she had her friend drive her home so that we could fight for 3-4 hours.  At the end of the fight she said she wanted a divorce.  I asked her if she knew what she was saying and what that meant, she said she understood and it was what she wanted.  I said goodbye, kissed her and headed to her brother's house (one of my closest friends). 

After discussing matters with him, I knew what I had to do.  I called her the next day to make sure she was certain that she wanted a divorce.  She was certain that this was our only option, in reality it was a play for attention. I couldn't take anymore and was done being in an abusive relationship (she was a terrible person and this is already long enough). I rented a moving truck and drove to the house with some friends while she was at work.  I took everything that I had ever purchased or that my parents had given us.  I left her everything I bought for her, that her parents gave us, and that she had given me.  I was as fair as I possibly could be.  Unfortunately for her, I worked a real job, made real money, and spent that money on real stuff. She worked a $9hr 30 hour a week retail job and spent her money on shit.  The house was pretty much empty with the exception of her clothes, one bedroom full of furniture, and some random stuff in the kitchen.  I took my food out of the fridge, the washer, the dryer, and everything else that was mine.  I called her from the house to let her know that I was switching the utilities to her name, she had 24 hours to call the utility companies and the bills put in her name before I closed my accounts.  She was furious, ""How am I supposed to cover the deposits?"" she screamed (never mind the fact we that I was obviously moving forward with the divorce, I guess she thought I was playing games?).

She called me when she got home to scream about her missing stuff.  I informed her that I was exiting her life like she requested.  I reminded her about the utilities and she yelled at me some more.  The following day the utilities were all turned off (it was November, the average low here is around 40F, so not freezing). The day before I called my father in law to apologize to take care of his daughter like I had promised.  
We had a great relationship (still do 7 years later) and he said not to worry that he knew his daughter and he empathized with me.  I had a great deal of respect for this man and knew that he would ultimately back his daughter, as he should, if she pulled him into our divorce.  One week later he called me with his requests.  Here's the conversation to the best of my memory:

Father in law: My daughter wants some stuff back, I don't want to get involved.  Can you just give her some of the stuff back so I don't have to deal with this?

Me: Honestly, I only took the stuff that was ""mine"", I don't even care about the stuff, but this is what she wanted and she has to live with her decisions.  This is what having me out of her life looks like.

FIL: I know, it's stupid.  Can you just give the stuff back so we can be done and I don't have to get involved?

Me: What's she want?

FIL: The washer, dryer, vacuum, and one tv.  

Me: I paid for all that stuff, I just bought the vacuum last week.

FIL: I know, but can you do it for me?

Me: Yeah, I'll drop it off tomorrow.  Tell her not to be home from 5-6pm.

The following evening I put the washer and dryer in the middle of the living room (laundry room was upstairs) and set the [tv](http://www.webanswers.com/entertainment/tv/how-much-does-a-36-sony-trinitron-weigh-db6746) facing the wall.

Her brother recently named his second son after me, I still talk with my ex father in law.  All her friends eventually grew sick of her and became my friends.  I haven't talked to her in years.

The library was fairly quiet, as usual, filled with students who had the same studying mindset as me (hence all of us being in the library).

Now, I don't mind when people speak softly to one another while they are in the library--most people don't seem to mind either.  But on that day, there was the most obnoxious couple sitting right in the middle of the room, speaking to each other as if they were at a noisy restaurant.  I was surprised that two people would be so loud as they are surrounded by people who are barely speaking in whispers--as their voices echoed off the library walls, I felt embarrassed for them.

Despite the passive-agressive looks from my fellow library-goers and me, the couple did not lower their voices.  As my mind wandered from my study material to their stupid conversations, I knew I had to do something.  And then, my golden opportunity came: The girl of the pair gave her email address to the boy. I immediately switched my phone to data instead of wifi, hopped onto the first porn website that I could find, and subscribed to it using her email.  I did it again with a Bible verse a day website. I did it again with a clothing store that I knew sent out a lot of emails. Over and over again I subscribed this email address until I felt satisfied.

Bing!  Bing!  Bing!  Bing!  Bing! went the girl's phone, still quieter than their obnoxious voices.

Girl: ""What the hell?! Why am I getting all of these emails from porn websites and clothing stores?!  I think my email has been hacked!""

They left the library to go investigate the situation.  And I got my peace and quiet (and aced the exam!)



Tl;dr: Annoying people speaking way too loudly at the school library.  One of them made the mistake of saying her email address out loud.

This month marks four years since I married my (now) ex, and 3.5 years since she changed her mind and decided she wanted a divorce.     
For background- we were together a little over 7 years before we got engaged and it was another year and a half before we actually got married (weddings ain't cheap, let me tell ya).      
For those with bad math skills, we're up to almost 9 years together by this point and six months after we *finally* get married, she suddenly changed her mind.  

Needless to say, I was a *bit* pissed.   
I thought about doing the usual things semi-irrational jilted husbands would do- slash her tires, set her up with a guy with herpes, stuff like that. But then something wonderful happened... I met a smart, beautiful, motivated woman that made me forget about all that.  
Fast forward three years and that woman and I are living together in Miami, she's working on her degree and I have a nice boring job that pays the bills and still allows for a bit of fun now and then.  
*Meanwhile...*  
(The following is all secondhand information from my friends back home, the ex and I no longer speak.)  
My ex has apparently been revenge banging her way through her facebook friend list and so far has 2 miscarriages and a dose of the clap to show for it.  She's put on 20-30 pounds, been kicked out of at least three bars for ""unwanted sexual advances"" (quote from a bartender at one of the establishments) and gotten 2 DUI citations. Her freelance work for the oil industry pretty much dried up and she had to move back in with her mother and -according to a friend who ran into her recently- ""can't even get a date at the dyke bars these days"".

She was always terrible to everyone and generally just a mean person.  It seemed that she took pleasure on the misfortunes of her students.  I was a good kid in high school, got good grades, and was respectful to both teachers and other students alike.  For some reason, she just couldn't keep from Bitch-Hulking out on me during class.  Never had done anything to wrong this woman.  

It was about halfway through the semester and we were getting ready to start an experiment with some sort of something that we had to melt down in a crucible.  She went on for what seemed like forever about how ""Hot things look the same as cold things"".  Sure, she was probably looking out for everyone, but she was a villainous weather-bitten horn beast and I hated her.  Over and over again she kept repeating ""hot things look the same as cold things.""

After her long winded safety lecture, we proceed to start the experiment.  I set my Bunsen burner up, got my crucible filled up with the good stuff and clamped onto the stand.  Fired that bad boy up and started cooking some science.  After about a minute of melting stuff, I realized that my clamp wasn't on tight enough and the crucible might fall.  I grabbed some gloves, the tongs, and a ceramic plate to put the fiery hot crucible on while I fixed it and turned the Bunsen burner off.  Before I could register what was happening and stop her, little Miss Bitch comes walking over all judgmental and says ""this clamp isn't set up right!"" and then grabs that wicked hot crucible.

**Background:**

About four years ago, I moved back to my hometown with my then gf. We were running out of money (cause someone spent her paychecks on shoes while I spent mine on fucking bills) in the big city, and my grandmother was getting to a point where she couldn't take care of herself as easily anymore. 

The plan was to move back to the hometown, assist granny enough so that she can continue living ""independently"" in her home, and make some money freelancing as I did in the city.

The hometown has no public transit, so we get a crappy car to be able to get things done. Since the gf grew up in the city, she never learned to drive. 

She gets a job at a coffeeshop, which starts at 5:30am every goddamn day. 50 min. round trip. I burn 300 miles per week on her transit alone. That's a tank of gas. Gas she never pays for. Oh well, we'reallinthistogether.jpeg.

**The transgression:**

Then one day, she hits me with this shit, ""I think I'm a lesbian."" WTF? I try to open things up, let her experiment, but in the end, I can't do it. She says it's ok. Two months later, she dumps me for some bullshit reason and immediately starts dating a girl off of OK Cupid.

When she dumped me, I told her she'd have to move out. She said, ""Fine."" A month later, not only has she not moved out, she hasn't even tried to look for a place. ""I just don't have money to pay for rent."" maybeyoubuytoomanyfuckingshoes.html

Another month goes by. We fight. I tell her to get her shit and go. I'm throwing her out. ""You can't throw me out! This ain't your house! Your grandma has to throw me out!"" Fine, we can do that.

Talk to my grandmother. Explain the situation. Can she please tell the ex-gf to leave? ""Well, you brought her here. She's your responsibility."" WTF? You're not even gonna back me up on this? bloodisthickerthanbullshit.mp3

**The complication**

So time goes by. She becomes such a lesbian that she starts a long term relationship with a GUY she used to work with. At the same time, my grandmother gets diagnosed with hepatobiliary cancer and starts hospice care. As much as I want to throw the POS ex-gf out, she's the only person available who can help me provide care for slowly-dying granny. 

And by ""help,"" I mean the bare fucking minimum. She does the least amount required and acts like she's a fucking saint for it. But if she isn't here to do that, then I'm never able to get out of the house every now and then to remind myself what a normal life is like. So unless I want to make my own life 10x harder and more miserable, I'm kind of stuck with the bitch.

And lest you think that she ain't so bad because she helps out, remember that she lives here rent free, gets free transit to work, and has a habit of being at her bf's for days at a time while I am constantly on the clock being a caregiver. She then has the audacity to be upset if I go out for a few hours. jimmierustled.pdf

**The Petty Revenge!**

As you may have no doubt surmised by now, this girl is into instant gratification with almost no sense of impulse control or discipline. That's not exactly a great mindset for a 28-year old, 5'8"", 135 lb. girl. 

So starting about 14 months ago, I decide to help her outer beauty match up with her inner beauty. I begin buying packs of Oreos, donuts, tortilla chips, cupcakes, etc. and leaving them around the house. She has an insatiable sweet tooth and absolutely no ability to resist sugary deliciousness. I also start buying 12-packs of the heavy, darker beers with the highest calorie counts. Leinenkugel Berry Weiss (207 cal per bottle), Duck Rabbit Baltic Porter (270 cal), etc. Since she never met something alcoholic she didn't like, these get guzzled like Coke at a beetus festival. I even make a ""show"" of being upset that she drinks all the beers without saving me half. ""You should've drank them faster,"" is what I get instead of an apology. allpartofmymasterplan.ogg

So here we are, 14 months later. She has gone from 135 lbs to 180 lbs. She complains that her clothes are shrinking. She's got a double chin blooming. Her belly is now flush with her boobs. Her boobs, once firm and perky, are now sad and droopy when she's not wearing a bra. Her arms are gaining thickness, and her ass has expanded some. Her BMI has jumped from Normal to Overweight and I don't think she has too far to go until she reaches that most coveted stays: Obese. 

The best part about this petty revenge is that it is insanely easy to pull off. I wonder how her boyfriend feels seeing his girl constantly expanding?

**tl;dr:** Move from city back to hometown with gf in tow. She dumps me, but I can't get her out of my house. She starts seeing a new guy, and I start leaving fattening junk that she can't resist all around the house. She packs on almost 50 lbs in about a year.

Revenge time.  I love hot sauce.  I put a little on damn near anything I eat.  I took my collection to JC with me.  One thing was an EXPENSIVE little bottle of The Source.  It costs $100 for an ounce.  It is, without a doubt, the hottest thing on the planet.  

I told the instructors I was sick and spent the day in my bed.  Once the RA left I skipped over to the other dorm, right into Dwayne's new room.  I pulled some of his underwear out of his locker and poured the entire bottle into the crotch.  Let it soak good, put it back.

About three days later Dwayne is being rushed to the hospital from severe burning on his groin, I mean he was crying and begging for someone to help.  He'd also made the mistake of trying to wash it off with water.  BAD IDEA.

Due to the nature of the chemicals we work with, we also have a company that that washes and returns our uniforms to us in separate lockers.

One day, as I was starting work on third shift, I see a fellow employee (lets call him O. He worked the shift before mine) laughing and pointing at me when he thought I couldn't see him. I figured he was just being a dick, as he was wont to do, so I just kept working.

Come break time, I go into the locker room to get my stuff, only to see that someone has taken 20 or 30 of our metal uniform hangers, and tied them in a knot around the latch on my locker, so that it couldnt be opened. I was pretty pissed off, and had to go to maintenance to get wire cutters to cut it off. 

Our maintenance guy told me that O had done it, and he had already cut off a group of hangers from my locker earlier that night. I was super pissed now! I had wasted my entire break to deal with this crap, and its all that much worse that he went back and did it again after it had been removed once.

I stated thinking that I could tell my supervisor, but then I would just look whiney, and nothing would be done about it anyway. I decided to get even with him. O made a pretty dumb decision to mess with my stuff, considering that his didnt have a lock.

I enlisted the help of my friend N, and together we came up with a plan. Our workplace has an industrial strength shrink wrapper. We took every single item out of his locker and shrinkwraped each item individually. Each boot seperare, each shirt, each pair of pants, his hat, his saftey glasses, everything. Then we went to his uniform locker and did the same.

Next, we gathered up every single spare hanger we could find, and dumped all of them inside his locker. The door barely shut, so we duct taped it closed, and went around it a few more times with the duct tape just for good measure.

The next day, O was a good sport about it, knowing that I did it as revenge, and he couldnt really be mad, because he started it. We called a truce and he never messed with me again. 

Man, I hate that guy.

Why this course wasn't a club beats the hell out of me, because it costs $90 for nine holes and a solid hundo-fitty for a full eighteen. You can imagine the type of people this can occasionally attract. For the most part, it's not bad. You can even decide who you're going to caddy for to an extent because some people are regulars. So of course, if it's the first time caddying for that person, you're always nice. If he tips well, you make a concerted effort to have him again. If he doesn't, fuck that guy. This worked brilliantly up until this one old man, and we'll just call him Frank. Frank tipped me awfully and was an all around bitter dude my first time around with him. He's the type of guy that asks for your advice just so he can go about doing the exact opposite of what you say on purpose, only to finish by slamming his club down and blaming you for how much dick he sucks at the sport. Along with watching people butcher a game that should be relaxing and fun for six hours a day without swinging a club, people like Frank were ultimately the main reason that I quit, as you'll see.

As luck would have it, Frank apparently found joy in watching me suffer and requested me a few days later to caddy for him and his group of friends, who were also assholes, for a round of weekend golf. He books the first tee-time of the day at 5:45 AM on Sunday because if he went to church he'd spontaneously combust, and he probably did it on purpose because he's a dick. However, I see it as an opportunity to pick up a second loop after and make double money. Two loops should bring in very close to a couple hundred bucks, and I'm alright with that. Cue the rain. It fucking rains for sixteen holes and he refuses to go inside, he just keeps playing through it with his friends, not really thinking twice about how much his watered down golf bag weighs on me and how miserable I must be. I'd done this before, but it sucks because I am, at this point, being a dick back so that he won't request me anymore. It's not enjoyable. We're walking up the 17th hole when the sirens go off, and we have to go in. He fights it because he wants to finish the round, I don't even bother trying to explain it because after half a day with this man, I know him. He doesn't fucking care. A marshal comes by and forces him to head in. This is where my day really starts to suck.

I convene downstairs with other unlucky caddies in the cart barn, beneath the club house where players are now enjoying gratuitous amounts of alcohol, hoping to get to play again while some of us are falling asleep on carts. Caddy master comes down relieving caddies as their groups give up the wait. They go in for their tips, and go they home. Hours pass, it's down to a few of us left in the barn, our groups have clearly forgotten that we exist/take pleasure in knowing that we are having a terrible time. The idea of a second loop is long gone when 6PM rolls around, and groups are cleared to play. Frank comes down personally to get me, ignoring the ""employees only"" sign because he is at this point hammered drunk, and takes me out again to stumble through his last hole of golf. Fifteen minutes later, we're in, I make 40 bucks for the DAY. Not even joking, I walk right back up to the clubhouse, put in my two weeks notice, and I leave. I go home to mom and dad, and I tell them that ""You play golf, you should work at a golf course!"" is by far the stupidest idea ever, and that I just quit my job. They back me because they are chill.

Two days before I'm done here, I'm called in with 60 or so other caddies for a tournament. Players are allowed to choose caddies. Guess who chooses me? I'm back out on the course with old faggot douchebag shitsniffer fuckface Frank again. I make no attempt to socialize, I am plotting how to ruin his round/his life before we're even on the first tee. I'm in charge of his scorecard, but being a golfer myself, I decide not to write the wrong score on his scorecard. I do the honest thing and I write down what he actually scores. This is fun. Frank starts asking questions that he should know but his old, senile mind forgets. ""How far to the water?"" (Not far, you can carry it) ""Does the red marker mean 100 yards out?"" (No, 200) ""What club should I hit here, boy?"" (Well, you're fifty yards out, so I'd suggest taking your driver and killing me with it) ""What way does the green slope?"" (Yes). This continues at an unbelievable rate. He is hitting ball after ball into the water, he is three putting, occasionally four putting every single hole. He finds himself behind trees, in bunkers, and in generally shitty places that you don't want to be just because I know where they are, and I am giving him the exact coordinates to land right in them. Fuck you, Frank. In the middle of the back nine, he has resorted to using his partner's balls (heh) because I have directed all of his to places where he can't find them and has to take a penalty. Suck it. I remember his score to this day because I am proud. The man that shot double digits my first two times out with him shoots a 139, scoring double digits on all but three holes. Not even kidding; he comes in dead last, it thunderstorms the next day, making this my last loop ever. Frank hands me the minimum $20 that the clubhouse actually gives the players to tip their caddies (meaning really, Frank didn't tip me) while I scrub his clubs clean. He blames me for his round, I smile and agree, he fumes back into the clubhouse, probably to drink more. I take his clubs out to his Cadillac Deville, lay his clubs in the trunk, lock his car, and throw the keys on top of the bag before shutting the trunk and leaving.

Whether somebody cooked or barbecued, popped a bottle or rolled a joint- this guy was always there to partake, yet NEVER contributed or reciprocated. Needless to say, this ground my gears.

One night, we all went out as usual and did a little drinking. Moocher, as it turned out couldn't handle his liquor too well. We ended up carrying the guy home after he got kicked out of a bar for helping himself to a bottle within reach. 

Once home, we put the guy in bed, then put a barf receptacle next to him which happened to be a pot from the kitchen. We partied some more after he knocked out, eventually passing out ourselves downstairs. 

The next morning I woke up and checked on Moocher upstairs. As expected, he barfed, and it was in the pot we provided him. He was stirring now, about to wake up. Thinking swiftly, I took his pot of barf, put the lid on, and headed downstairs. 

I put his pot au barf on the stove, kept it covered and put it over medium heat. After about 10 minutes, I was ready to leave; I stepped out of the front door and yelled upstairs, ""come on down- there's something cooking for you on the stove!!""

As I got to my car, I looked through the front kitchen window and saw Moocher just as he took the lid off of his pot of barf, his face enveloped by a cloud of steam as it simmered away on the stove. Enjoy, dick. 

Yeah, we didn't hang much after that.

(Fantastic, by the way.) Didn't think I'd enjoy it, but it was a christmas gift from my sisters so I figured I should go and try to enjoy myself, ended up really liking it.

Anyway, the concert technically started at 7, but I got there at 6:30 just so I could sit down. I had to walk all the way there from Hollywood/Highland, so it was like a 20 minute walk, uphill, in the cold. So I sat down, the opening act came on, all is well.

And then...ugh. The girls.

I could tell they were dumb, annoying sorority girls even before they opened their dumb, annoying mouths. The kind of group that makes everyone in the surrounding area instantly dislike them. Six of them, all blonde, came with three full bottles of red wine (oh boy). They sat down next to a guy and a girl (both of whom were drunk already), and proceeded to have THE LOUDEST GODDAMN CONVERSATION I have ever heard. I can't give details of their conversation, because quite frankly I was trying (unsuccessfully) to ignore them. They sat down at ~6:45. Mumford and Sons came on at about 9. I did not hear ONE MINUTE of silence. One minute. 

The guy next to me tried to ask them to please be quiet, and I believe they called him an annoying dick and that he should probably just shut the fuck up and let them enjoy themselves. And that was when I lost it. Quietly.

What I've neglected to mention so far is that I had a pretty brutal cold/cough, and I had a sore throat. So I couldn't yell at them or talk to them. I tried to turn around and ask them to stop but they couldn't hear me and then made fun of my voice because I was so hoarse. Anyway, I carry a full pack of gum on me at all times when I'm sick because it helps my throat and tends to make my ears pop when they plug up.

I noticed that when they go to get more wine (they were selling full bottles there, which is a bad choice already), they never empty their glasses fully, they just leave them half-full, get another bottle, and then fill them back up. So, when they all left (I don't know why they ALL had to leave, but quite frankly I don't care I was just glad for the break), I sprung into action.

I pulled out a stick of gum, popped it into my mouth, and chewed as hard as I ever have before. Once it was sufficiently moist and flat, I dropped it into one of their cups. Luckily, it was red wine so you couldn't see into the cup. I popped another piece in. Piece by piece, I filled all their cups with my sickness and spite. Mostly sickness. When I was done, my jaw hurt like hell but my revenge was complete. 

I hope they eventually found the gum, although part of me hopes they never noticed it. I didn't see them again because after I did it I promptly moved three rows to the right so they wouldn't know it was me. Enjoy your colds and sore throats, bitches.

From the distance it looked very close, and as I got to my truck I could see that she literally parked within about 2 inches of my drivers side door.

The woman who owned the car got out just as I got behind her car. Our conversation went like this:

Me: Are you seriously leaving your car like that?

Her: uhhhhhh...

Me: Please move your car so I can get in my truck.

Her: Sorry. (begins walking towards store)

Me: Wooo Wooo Wooo. Get back here and move your car.

Her: Sorry. (continues walking towards store, fortunately forgot her purse and returns to her car).

Me: Why would you park like this? There are three spaces open to your left.

Her: I'm handicap. (begins walking towards store again).

Me: (despite her walking fine, parking in the furthest spot, and not having a handicap sticker I say) What does that have to do with anything?

By this point she was ignoring me. The problem is I would normally climb in from the passenger side but I just pulled my hamstring at the gym and while I could walk fine, making odd bends and stretches hurt far to much.

I seen a cop going through the lot and flagged him over. I explained the situation and he was sympathetic and wrote her a ticket and called for a rush tow. Within about 15 minutes a tow truck arrived and took her car. The cop said she would be forced to pay the tow and impound fee's in addition to her parking ticket. The tow truck left the lot and the woman came out just as the cop drove away and I was getting in my truck.

She was running towards me so for safety sake I stopped (and I wanted to rub it in a little). I rolled down my window and she asked what happened to her car. I answered her question with a question of my own ""what gave you the right to park so close that I could not get in my truck?"". She didn't answer. I explained her car was towed by ""some tow truck"". Now she just needed to figure out which truck. I'll leave the ticket surprise for her to get later. She asked ""what do I do now?"".

A guy was transferred to another position so Chuck moved up, with the new position comes a parking spot. Enter Jake.

I work in a ware house; Chuck and I are generally in the office section of the warehouse. Chuck has taken his new position with pride and believes he's invincible. Instead of doing actual work, he mostly meanders around the office pestering other employees. He meandered over to my cubicle, and somehow, we got on the topic of women. I learned another reason to hate this cocky bastard... to be blunt, he was a chauvinist.I have a very strong set of core beliefs, I don't shout them from the roof tops, I am humble in my beliefs but will defend them.

""I deserve to have more than one woman.""

""Gotta keep my bitch in line.""

""Why the fuck would I do my laundry? I got my bitch to do it for me.""

I had also asked him how he attracts a woman.... what a mistake.

""First I butter them up, then, (punches hand) put the fear of god into them.""

No matter how much I tried to convince him otherwise, he was convinced that I lived in a fairy tale, and I was going to get my heart broken by my wife. (We have been happily married for 27 years, with no serious fights.)

I'm 58 years old. He looks to be about 29. His mindset is stuck in the 1950's. Knowing I have respect for women, he is now infringing his belief on me every chance he gets.

Basically flies hang around the light then eventually die, and fall. You can see where this is going; I had notified Chuck of his new parking spot. 

FF a Week: Chuck curses loudly whenever he see's flies on his car, this being summer, and the both of us working nights, he curses quite often. He gives me another reason to look forward to leaving work.

I look up right in time to see Bitch placing her comically overfilled cup behind one of the yogurt machines. Aw hell no, are you serious?! That shit will melt in minutes and become a huge mess all over the floor. 

Me: You know, if you don't want that yogurt, I'd be happy to take it and you can start over. I'd just prefer if you didn't put it on the floor. It will melt. 

Bitch takes the cup and hands it to me without saying a word. No apology or anything.

There was nowhere to sit and I was standing eating a burger and had found myself a space quite far away from everybody else as I was eating like a disgusting hungover pig (hence giving everyone around me a wide berth) and had a completely full mouth. (I have misophonia and NEVER eat loudly so I always make a huge effort with this.)

From out of the crowd comes some guy wearing a giant backpack and who is obviously stressed out. I can tell as while they aren't openly bumping everyone out the way, they are clearly taking no care in pushing through the crowd. It was obviously a 'me first' situation. We've all been stressed out and hurrying but there's no need to act like an idiot.

As he walked past me he changed direction slightly meaning the huge backpack bumped me enough to make me make an involountary lurch sideways. There was tons of room around me and he'd just decided to 'plough through' because he was in a bad mood. I would have certainly given some room if he needed to get through right where I was standing but the fact he decided to get as close as possible before changing direction into me pissed me off.

As soon as I steadied myself I turned my head and shouted at his back, but I happened to have a mouthful of chewed up cheeseburger.

A huge mash of semi-chewed meat, cheese and salad burst noisily out my mouth and splatted squarely on his backpack like a juicy meteor of justice with a thump clearly audible over the noise of the station. Honestly, there was loads of it. I was instantly calm and just stared at what I'd done.

It was disgusting. It was mostly saliva and burger pate, but I could  also clearly see the yellow of the chewed up processed cheese like a rancid shiny insect had burst onto his stupid back as he wandered through the crowd. A few bits of stringy salad were dangling off here and there, but the force of the impact meant that the bulk of it was firmly stuck to his bag. 

I have no idea how he didn't hear or feel it, but he just kept walking. Perhaps he had heard and just wanted to avoid confrontation (fine with me) or maybe he genuinely had no idea.

Either way I felt that balance had been restored in the universe and satisfied, finished eating in peace. I often enjoy thinking about him having to hose his bag down with tears in his eyes much later.

He's a 20 year old, unemployed guy who considers himself some sort of cross between a Wiccan, a hippy, a gamer nerd, and a goth. He rarely showers, he leaves the kitchen completely disgusting, and he's never done a spot of cleaning in the 4 months he's lived here. He also makes weird, socially awkward comments that come across really creepy and violent. We're moving out in a week, but there's a mental picture for you of this guy.

So this shitty housemate has had his friends staying over for the last week straight. There's usually two of them here, sometimes three, but always at least one. They take over the lounge and kitchen, which is really annoying. They've spent the past week piling up rubbish in the kitchen bins without taking the rubbish out, and the kitchen fucking stinks because of it. Pretty sure there were some kind of meat offcuts or something in there that went rotten, the shit is really foul. They sit at the dining table by this giant pile of rubbish, playing Magic the Gathering. I guess it never occurs to them to just take it out.

The girl that's been staying here is an annoying, loud attention whore. We hear her all the time down the hallway. She's one of those people that doesn't have an inside voice, and is constantly shrieking and squealing and giggling. We've heard her life story by now, and the gist of it is that she's scared her current boyfriend will break up with her and that really worries her because she's relying on him for a place to live -- meanwhile, she's been staying here and fucking our housemate. There's also been several times I've run into her in the hallway, and she wasn't wearing any pants, because it's completely appropriate to walk around half naked in a stranger's house.

Anyway, that's the back story. It's annoying living in a house with people who don't pay rent, don't have any sense of basic decency, and are just generally dirty people. They disturb our sleep, they talk way too loudly, and they're just unsavoury people that don't belong here. They've been using (and not cleaning) our dishes and stuff, even helping themselves to food/drinks from our fridge that's clearly not theirs to be taken, and eventually they used up the rest of the toilet paper.

So as our form of petty revenge, we got more toilet paper, but didn't put it in the cupboard for them to use. 

Now you may be thinking, ""but vitamin23, they can just go to any corner shop or convenience store, spend $5 and get a whole pack for themselves!""

They absolutely can, but don't underestimate how dumb and/or lazy these people are. They keep checking the cupboard to see if the toilet paper has magically replenished itself; i.e. if we've restocked it for them. It hasn't, and it won't. Instead, they've resorted to using [kitchen wipes](https://www.signet.net.au/App_Assets/user/products/full/10442.jpg) as toilet paper. But now they've run out of that, too! 

It's been 3 days so far and they've had nothing to wipe themselves with every time they go to the toilet. THREE DAYS. Even just now as I was writing this post, the girl went to the toilet, discovered there still wasn't any toilet paper, and loudly complained. Bitch, if you think I'm going to go out and get some for you, you're gonna be wiping your disgusting ass with your hand for a long, long time.

P.S. They don't wash their hands.

EDIT: SCA = [Society for Creative Anachronism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Creative_Anachronism)

These are her words:


Long ago and in a galaxy far away...well, it felt like it at least... I lived in an area of rednecks (nearly the entire state). There was a 24 hour restaurant my SCAdian friends and I used to frequent here, often while still wearing garb. I should also mention that we showed up relatively often, and had the habit of over-tipping ridiculously to make up for our numbers and noise.

Even taking the above into account, for some reason, the local waitstaff did not take kindly to our outlandish garb and boisterous nature (we were loud and happy, so sue us). One waitress took quite a bit of offense to us, for no reason  we could fathom. She came, took our order, and brought it to us without any problem...and then she disappeared...

Oh, we saw her. She was very attentive to the other tables in the restaurant; but nothing we could do would induce her to return to our table. We actually were quite polite, simply waved hands, and one of us even got up to ask her to bring us the check. This request simply made her disappear into the back for a while before she returned to help the *other* tables again. We'd long ago given up on refills on our drinks by this time, and just wanted the check so we could leave. We'd been there a seriously long time just waiting for her to bring it to us, after all. She kept us waiting so long that she was the only one working the front; bringing out food, working the cash register and cleaning tables afterward.

In the end, the table next to us kindly waved down the waitress for us and told her to bring us our check. Which, because *they* asked, she did immediately. We, of course, thanked the table next to us.

And, because we always make a habit of tipping our waitress, we made sure to leave a tip for this one as well. We took our pocket change, mostly pennies, and dropped them into a full water glass. Then put a paper over the glass, flipped it, and pulled the paper out. This left the waitress with an upside down glass full of water that she'd have to spill across the table herself to clean the table and get more of a tip than her service warranted.

I did that night and got a call at 8am the next morning asking if I could come in for an interview the following day. Not to toot my own horn, but I am more than qualified for temp office work, with experience, a degree, foreign languages and appearance and not to mention I was **REFERRED TO THEM** by a long term employee, like... *one of their own* that quit only a few weeks prior. I go into the office for a mock interview with the agency completely friendly and optimistic. The girl who interviewed me was around my age, recent college grad, and was so rude to me. During our ""interview"" she kept looking at her watch, and when I answered her questions, trying to engage her in conversation, she just kept saying ""okay."" At one point she even cut me off and said, *""Okay, that's enough, I get it.""* She ended the interview by saying she would call me that afternoon. Well, she didn't. And she also said she would email me a link of sills tests to take (that would be the last step of the hiring process, and I couldn't be sent on assignments until they'd received the results of these tests), and she didn't. So I called her the next day, and she said she would email me, and she didn't. So the THIRD day I called her and we had the rudest exchange I have ever had with anyone, and it SUCKED because I wanted to be hired at this temp agency.

I told my friend about this girl and the experiences I kept having with her/their office she said to call the office back and ask for this other guy (Let's call him Jim) because he has a soul, unlike this girl. So I do, but instead of getting put through to him, the operator routes me to the same girl. She gets on the line and without even saying Hi, she just goes, *""Why did you ask to talk to Jim?""* I say, *""Oh, [Friend] mentioned she'd worked with him and I was still having trouble receiving the emails you sent me so I just figured I'd try someone else.""*

I kid you not, she says, *""Okay, I don't think they ever worked together, number one, and number two, I have sent you that email like four times already, so maybe somebody can help you use a computer.""* Jesus...

I say that I am really sorry but I haven't received any emails. Without hiding any annoyance, she says she'll try to send it to me one last time and to hold. TWENTY MINUTES LATER she comes back on the line and says, *""OK I sent it, did you get it?""* Wow, it showed up in my email. 

I politely thank her and casually say something like , *""Okay, so just take these tests and you can show them to potential employers?""* just trying to politely end the phone call...

And she says, *""Well, I already told you that after our interview, but I.... GUESS I COULD TELL YOU AGAIN... YES... BLAH BLAH BLAH""* I thank her again and hang up.

Maybe I am too sensitive, but this girl was a total asshole to me, and the entire time I had to be polite to her. I continue my job search and move on. I actually land a new job pretty quickly and it ends up being a GREAT fit and I love it (and have been there for about three weeks now).

About a week following that exchange, she calls me again and tries to schmooze me into accepting this temp job that is one month long and 40 minutes away. She WILL NOT STOP TALKING and I can barely get a word in to tell her I've found a permanent job and am not interested. I had time to process our interactions and decided that I really don't want to work with that temp agency if she is my assigned recruiter and I'd have to constantly be in communication with her. Just as temp workers are disposable to them, there are more temp agencies in this area if I am ever in need again. When she finally stops talking, I tell her I actually found a permanent position and that I am no longer available for temp work with her office. She asks me where I work. I say I'd rather not say. She asks me why not. I say because I'm not interested in having further ties with their office and to please remove me from their records as an available temp. She sounds completely indignant and says, *""Oh, okay then, well goodbye...I guess...""* (Goodbye yourself, wench)

Flash forward to today, when I am working. Someone comes into the office and I hear them talking to someone on my team. I head over to the copy machine and see that it's her. She greets me with this HUGE smile like we're old friends or something, extends her hand to shake mine and shoves her business cards in my hand, saying if our office ever needs any temps her company would be happy to provide them to us. She goes on and on listing various stats from her company and saying that I was indeed a temp at her office(!!!!) My supervisor looks at me and I just say, *""Yes, it was a very interesting experience. I should probably get back to work. Nice seeing you.""* After she left, my supervisor comes over and asked me why I reacted like that. I tell her I had been hired on at that temp agency and that girl was my recruiter, and she had absolutely no people skills whatsoever, I quoted some of the things she said to me (as it only happened less than a month ago) and I just had a really bad experience with the agency in general. She was still holding the business cards, and after hearing that, she ripped them in half and put them in the trash and said, *""Wow, thanks for letting me know. We've been thinking about hiring a temp agency before next summer.""*

Probably doesn't mean anything, but I know recruiters focus heavily on their business clients, and obviously treat their temps like shit. Funny, how if you're working with a bunch of people who are trying to find permanent work, it's likely that one day you'll run into them in a business you're wanting to to business with your company.

The couple who owned the dog lived pretty far down the street and were very quiet and kept to themselves so we never knew their real names.  We called him George since we thought he looked like an older George Costanza, so we'll call him George in this story as well.

So George walks his German Shepard around our block two or three times a day.  Now normally this was never a problem, there are woods at the end of the street where he would let his dog go to the bathroom, and although he never cleaned up after her, at least it wasn't on anyone's property. 

Randomly, this changes one day.  Suddenly we are noticing dog shit all over our yard close to the street.  We didn't have dogs at this  point so we knew it was someone who was walking their dog and letting it shit on our yard.  Now at first we were just noticing a couple piles of shit on the yard every week, but after two months almost the entire section of the yard that was closest to the street was a mine field.  With my parents at work and my brother and I at school, we had a hard time catching whoever it was  (since we didn't yet know it was George) that was allowing their dog to shit on our yard. 

Then one day, my dad catches George letting his dog shit on our yard.  Now my dad was a pretty calm guy, but there were certain things that would set him off like a nuke. It turned out this was one of them. Somehow my dad was able to refrain from sprinting out and beating the shit out of George all over our yard as well (I'm sure my mom had a role in preventing this).  Despite not taking immediate action and beating George to a pulp, my dad was not going to let this slide.  

Later that day he went out with a garbage bag and shovel and scooped up every single turd that George had allowed his dog to lay on our yard into the garbage bag. That night my dad went down the street, with a garbage bag of shit slung over his shoulder like a fecal delivering Santa Claus.  He then walked up the path to George's door from the road and sprinkled the hundreds of turds all over George's front steps and along the walkway, covering almost all the cement in his beloved German Shepard's shit.  Needless to say, George's dog never shit on our yard again.

I wasn't there long (about a month due to asshole coworkers), but it was plenty of time to er... 'enjoy' the wonders of retail.

Anyway, we had a customer that would regularly come in and upstairs with her children, never to purchase, only to use us as a free zoo. I never had a gripe with that, as I'd say about 70% of the people who came up did so for that reason. What I did have a gripe with, however, was people using us as a free 'daycare' and dropping their kids off whilst they went to the bank or shops. This particular customer would do this a lot, despite us asking her not to. I think she was wacked out on drugs most of the time to be honest. She had two boys, the oldest about 11 if I had to guess, well behaved and polite. The youngest, about 7/8 and a complete asshole. Long blonde hair and a stuck up nose.

Anyway, on this particular day, she came, dumped the kids whilst my back was turned removing some old shed from a new Chameleon and left. The oldest child was okay, he was looking at the fish, clearly not pleased at being stuck up in the hot, stuffy department. The other little shit, however, decided such peaceful activities were below him, and decided running around and around the display vivariums and hooting was a better idea. I turned around, and asked him, nicely to stop doing that, as he was frightening the animals. So he gives me a shitty look and keeps on going. Uh, fine, whatever, I'm thinking, and turn back to the Chameleon. After a few minutes, I notice it has gone silent. I put the animal back and turn around, and that little shit had taken great handfuls of the prepared veg for the lizards, strewn it all over the floor, and was now sat snickering to himself behind the Tokay Gecko display.
I am pissed. It's hot, I'm sweaty, hungry and tired and am not in the mood for this shit. So I decide to teach him a lesson about respecting the animals. I hook a dustpan brush from next to me on the floor with my foot, and shoot it so that it slides across the floor, coming to a stop right next to this little toerag.

See, what I haven't told you, and what this little sod didn't realize, is that we had a 3ft Bosc Monitor that was allowed to free roam during the day. His favourite spot was tucked away underneath the vivariums, as it was nice and cool. And he loves the colour pink. Infact, one of his favourite games was chasing the pink dustpan brush. You can see where I'm going with this right?

The Bosc shoots out from hiding, straight for the brush that has landed next to this kid. BAM. He's on the brush, sweeping the floor. That kid practically shit himself, let out some inhuman screech and booked it out the door and down the stairs. His well behaved brother looked around, got really excited to see the Bosc and got to pet him and give him a locust.

Sadly, the next time he was in, the young kid was up to his usual tricks, but damn did it feel good to get a bit of petty revenge.

Very non descriptive about the ad, and from experience sounds like a scam right off the bat.

It really irked me that nobody would be consistent when they printed these signs – whenever someone printed one they used a different font, didn’t pay any attention to the style/format of the sign it would sit next to, and generally didn’t care about the aesthetics of whatever it was they were making so the shop looked awful and terribly unprofessional.  What was worse was nobody knew how to spell and their use of grammar left a lot to be desired.



I would always politely point out when a spelling mistake had been made or when a comma or apostrophe was in the wrong place/missing because it looks REALLY bad when a huge corporation can’t get a simple sign right and I didn’t want customers thinking we were all idiots.



Mostly everyone would fix the glaring spelling mistakes and begrudgingly add in/omit commas or apostrophes where applicable.  But my boss in particular was SUPER bad at spelling, he always made mistakes – one particular week I kept pointing them out to him – I even offered to do ALL the signs in the shop to make sure they were consistent and correct (but he refused to let me) – it got to the point where I guess he just got fed up of me correcting him and told me “it doesn’t matter” about the mistakes and to “just forget about it.”



So I did.



He printed a sign for the Olympics and held it up asking me in a sarcastic way, “see any mistakes?”  I just laughed.  He put the board up, took a picture of the display and sent it to the regional manager.



He came storming up to later in the day shouting “WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME I HAD SPELT OLYMPICS WRONG?  I JUST SENT THAT OUT TO THE WHOLE REGION.”

In case you didn't know, there's a teeny tiny camera on top of the speaker point, so I can see you AND hear you. 

Well this guy comes in and is really pissy about an order so it takes a little bit of time for me to get it to appear correctly on the register (the customer has to review their order on an adjacent screen before proceeding to pay at the window). 

Anyway, when I eventually sort out what he wants and I tell him to drive round, he silently flips me off at the speaker point, thinking I cannot see him. 

So I wait until he gets round to the register and when I take his debit card to put into the register, I ""accidentally"" drop it. This wouldn't be a problem, if the drive-thru wasn't only just wide enough to fit a car and wasn't fenced in, like ours was. The card fell onto the tarmac and landed underneath the front wheel of the car. There was no way this guy could get his card back without reversing back out of the drive-thru, walking up to the window to retrieve the card and pay for the meal, before having to walk back to his car and drive in again. All while I stood there, smiling. 

I think he worked out that I saw him giving me the finger because he was very quiet and didn't utter a word after I made him get out of his car.

The speed limit for the whole park is 20 mph since there are deer, pedestrians and cyclists everywhere and it discourages people from using the park for shortcuts. 

Now, I like to play little games when I am driving. One of them is that I keep the exact speed limit over hills and through dips and so on. Yes I am that cool. Anyway, I was going at exactly 20mph along the road when this woman in a fancy car catches up to me. 

She starts trying to overtake, but there are too many cyclists and too much oncoming traffic, so she starts honking her horn and waving her hands for me to speed up. Sorry, I have no intention of breaking the law so you can go at a dangerous speed. I keep at 20 all the way through the park.

Eventually we get to the top of a hill and she sees her opportunity. She speeds up to at least 35mph and zooms past me, honking her horn, swearing and giving me the finger. She actually turns around in her seat to insult me. I simply smile. 

I smile because I know that at the bottom of the hill, as there often is, is a police car. Because she is too busy looking at me, she does not see it, and zooms past them. The police officers clock it on their speed gun and pull her over. 

I got my petty revenge when I got to drive past her as the police officer was approaching her pulled-over car and I gave her the biggest grin and even a little wave.

I carried on through the park at 20mph.

I take public transit to work, usually leaving at the same time, and there an UNGODLY rude person, a lady between 35-45 who makes me want to push her into oncoming traffic every day. 

I take a bus then a train to work (short 20 mins total though).  She gets on the same bus/train as me.  When we get on the bus, its always quite full, and we're only going for literally a 5 minute trip. 

She *needs* to sit down in this 5 minutes, and will push her way through to get there.  This is fine of course, but 5 mins later, when we get to the stop, she *needs* to be the first one off the bus for some reason, so she shoves her way back through the crowd to get to the front of the doors. Never once have i heard the words ""sorry"" (and this is Canada ffs) or ""excuse me"".  

Once off the bus, there's an escalator up to the train.  She's first off the bus, first to the escalator, and then she fucking STANDS instead of climbing the stairs.  Its mind boggling.. is this bitch in a rush or not?  General etiquette here says standers move to one side of the escalator and walkers get the other, most of the time she abides by this, so that's fine. 

Now the train I take is the same one as her also, and its always very full when it gets to this stop.  Full to the point where people are definitely left behind, its a good system so its never more than a couple minutes during peak hours.  Since she stands on the escalator, I get to the train first, and there's lineups everywhere. 

I'll be standing a foot away from the train tracks, and she will literally just walk right up, and squeeze herself into this space so she can get on first.  Its such bullshit.  Its so rude, and its daily, and habitual.  If not me, I often notice her doing it to others. 

This morning, she was wearing sandals.  She stepped in front of me, and I stood firmly on the back of her sandal.  Train doors open, her foot pulls up, and boom, broken sandal.  I did not apologize.  I feel fantastic about it.

It as the type of resort that was all inclusive;drinks, food, towels. All the good stuff pretty much. We were there for an unexpected high season it was ridiculously busy the whole time. This meant lines. 

So no one has to pay for anything so the lines moved pretty fast as it was a serve and go situation. Generally everyone was good about the wait and were fair when they got to the front. So if a server went to serve you before the person in front of you, you'd tell the server this to make things equal. We were pretty civil about the whole thing if I do say so myself.

Well except for this one bitch. We started to notice one lady among ourselves as being an inpatient twat. She would sigh loudly, grumble to herself about poor service and last but not least:butting in line. I detest this. We are full grown adults lady, we all waited and were patient about it and here you come barging through line ups apparently under the impression that this civility doesn't apply to you? I don't think so missy.

No one ever said anything to her but eventually we all formed an unspoken bond. Whenever this lady decided she didn't feel like waiting with the rest of us someone would take it upon themselves to make sure she didn't make it to the front. They either subtly moved in front of her or you know, not so subtly ;)

This resulted in her getting more angry and flustered and moving among the crowd trying to get through but to no avail where she would eventually give up, move to the back and wait her turn like the polite young woman she was :)

Last week, a very important man-in-suit in a hurry comes in, grabs a pre-packed sandwich and some soup in a bowl and goes to stand in line behind me, displaying aggravated signs of great unrest. I can admire it via a mirroring side panel. 

He's radiating it. Living it. His body language is masterful; shoulders twitching forward, feet shuffling like a arabian racehorse seconds before start, head twitching on his neck like a chicken looking for grains, exhaling through mouth and nose every five agonizing second spent waiting, eyes searching for the cashiers to plead swiftness or special treatment . Just on the verge of screaming out how his schedule is incompatible with this torture of a 1 minute delay. 

Suddenly, a second register opens. I start my way there, but get shouldered aside by the Artful Linedodger. ""Sorry!!"" A splash of soup on my shoe is testimony to his unwarranted arrival there first. He pays, fast-walks to a seat and starts with his soup-minus-a-splash.

I pay as well, and walk to the microwave because the soup is luke warm. Needs about 15 seconds of nuking.

Surprise, who's suddenly galoppping to the microwave as well just as I'm reaching for its little door? It's Linedodger, who shoves his soup inthere as i'm still stretching out my hand. He starts deciphering the instructions on the microwave for about 1.5 microseconds and decides ""Fuck it, i'm pressing number five.""

The right button for e.g. heating up a cold plate of chicken pasta. It gives 3 minutes of 1000W instead of 15 seconds of about 650W.

Sucesfully in overcoming another obstacle, he starts doing Important Things on his phone, coincidentally also avoiding my DeathStare^TM. However, in doing so he doesn't keep an eye on his soup. Which started boiling after about 30-40 seconds. How interesting. I continue to watch it boiling for the next 2 minutes 20 seconds. 

Ding! goes the microwave. He looks up, and sees me grinning. He understands why when he has to get a plate to put the red hot bowl onto and spend an eternity blowing and cooling the soup.

I finished my lunch and left when he was still halfway incinerating his mouth with the soup. (I tried smirking,  but he never looked up from his labour of lava.)",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_1jqebr,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jqebr/eat_lava_linecutter/,

I've not made a post yet because I'm usually not a petty person, but I think you guys rubbed off on me on Friday. 

I'm a pretty calm driver, assertive but not aggressive. My university is in the middle of a city and around the time I get out, traffic starts to get thick. There's a main avenue, fed by numbered streets, that's only a one lane two-way street. As I turned onto it I was quickly stopped at a light. There was a long line of cars waiting to make a right turn onto the street, and since I was already stopped I let a car out. It's common courtesy. I looked in my rear-view to see if the people behind me got the message. This middle aged lady behind me zoomed up to hug my bumper so no other cars can get out. I'm not sure why, but this really gets to me. Letting cars out helps ease traffic, and it doesn't add anything to your commute time ... especially since you were already stopped. As I continued along, I got stopped at another light with this same lady behind me. As luck would have it, there was another line of cars waiting to turn right, and I was in a position to let them go. I decided to let 3 go out, 1 for me and 2 for her (to make up for the one she didn't let out, and the one she wouldn't let out this time.) This lady couldn't be decent even if someone made her, and let on her horn. That was it, I was going to move on but decided to let every car in line, around 10 total, go in front of me. I stared at her the whole time in the rear-view as the light cycled back to red before the last car got out. She was extremely huffy and I could see her shouting at me, but all I could do is smile. Next time she should show a little patience and decency. 

tl;dr: Lady behind me didn't let a car out, so I let out 10 in front of me.

edit: I wasn't at the intersection with the light. That was the next block down. The people turning right were at my intersection, which again, didn't have a light.

(x-post from talesfromretail),357,45,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/14cwei/the_tale_of_my_cheesy_meatballs_and_the_bitch/,"So here's a story of a woman in subway who was a bitch and got what she deserved. After finishing college for the day (UK college so I was 16) , I go into the local subway to get myself a sandwich and drink for my lunch which I can eat on the bus going home. In the queue the woman in front is extremely slow, she took ages just figuring out what she wanted and constantly changed her mind.

It finally got to the point of the sub being near completion, then she changed her mind AGAIN and told the (what I thought) new sub maker to start it over. This time it goes relatively smooth.

Let us skip ahead to cashier time. The amount of sheer ignorance, anger and stupidity this woman (W) had just left me in disbelief. The conversation between her and the cashier (C) went like this.

C: That will be £6, please.

W: Excuse me, I ordered 1 sub, not 2 dont try to fucking scam me.

C: I'm sorry ma'am but after you told the ""sub maker"" to discard your first sub we need are charging you for 2.

W: This is bullshit, it's not my fault she fucked up my food.

C: I'm sorry but she followed your order exactly and you decided to change it, also if you use profane language again I'm going to ask you to leave.

This went on for a clear 5 minutes about how she tries to imply that she can use as many subs as she wants before she is satisfied. After insulting more staff, having the manager called over and holding up the queue she eventually paid the £6 and stormed out the door shouting more abuse at the staff. I finally get to pay for my order and get my drink, giving a nice tip to help make up for the bitch infront.

When I got outside I noticed the woman on her phone inside her car. Amazingly she was parked on double yellow lines as well across the road. Fuck. You. Random. Woman. I walked across the road and ""accidently"" spilled both drink and sub (meatballs, cheese) on her window and it running down the side of the car.

She got out, shouting something about police or how I'm a fucking retard but I walked off with a good ol' smile on my face and a story to tell my friends.

A couple days later and im back in the sub shop looking foward to a delcious sub I can actually eat this time. To my surprise not only did I get a free sub, drink and cookie. I got them for the whole week. I wondered why this was and the manager (who was at the cashier that day) saw what I did to Mrs. Douche car and thought it was pretty funny as well as noticing how I have always said for the cashiers to keep any change given as well as a nice tip.
So I have amazing respect to all people working in retail that have to deal with people like this and many times can not act on it due to risk of losing their job, luckily I don't work there.

The server had a large badge that said trainee, and informed ms.bitch that they just ran out of that type of bread but she can grab some more from the back. Ms.bitch obviously couldn't wait, as she gave a loud ""UGH"" and muttered under her breath. 

The trainee asked xeno if he wants his bread toasted, but forgot to ask ms.bitch as well. This of course set ms.bitch off, as she ranted about wanting her bread toasted and that the trainee isn't doing her job right at all, etc.

Xeno chose his ingredients, the trainee offered guacamole to him (I think it's part of their policy to do this), he declined as ms.bitch's bread just finished toasting. As the trainee was still putting stuff on Xeno's sandwich, ms.bitch has a fit over how the toaster has beeped and her bread is done, getting annoyed by the fact that the trainee isn't getting it IMMEDIATELY. The trainee is panicking a bit, and starts doing ms.bitch's sandwich. Ms.bitch gets everything except olives, but says each item individually and she was muttering under her breath about how the trainee isn't doing it right, the sandwich looks disgusting, and whatever. The trainee offers the guacamole to ms.bitch, ms.bitch glares at her, ""if I want guacamole then I'll ask for some damn guacamole.""

After seeing how much of a cow ms.bitch is and how visibly upset she made the trainee, Xeno took it on himself to get some revenge on the trainee's behalf.

Ms.bitch let out an exasperated sigh.

Xeno continues, ""I might get an orange juice.""
""what cookie would you recommend for this type of sandwich?""
""on second thought, can I get apple juice instead?""

Ms.bitch was over the moon with her impatience, ""can't I pay at the other till?!"" trainee looks at her and tells the most obvious lie, ""sorry ma'am, we only operate one till at a time.""

Xeno payed for his order, ""some people just want to piss you off cause they're bitches."" He then turned to ms.bitch and said, ""don't be such a bitch."" and left. The trainee ended up giving him two extra cookies. We think it was ms.bitch's.

It comes up on tail end of fast-lane lineup, tailgating the rear-most driver and flashing lights. Then, within maybe 20 seconds, Challenger man swerves over into my lane and starts tailgating ME.

To my right, in the slow lane, is a tractor-trailer, with another truck about 25 yards in front of him. So I slowly start to accelerate -- surely in response to the manly pressure being applied from behind.

You can guess what's coming next. I step on it, staying parallel with him (and probably using up a quarter of my tank to do so). Tractor-trailer sees what I'm doing and also accelerates.

So I work at a small family-owned pet store, and most of my responsibilities lie within the animal department. It had been a fairly average day so far, until this lady walked in. I knew the second I saw her that she was going to be one of *those* customers.

She wanted feeder comet goldfish to stock her new pond. Two dozen, to be exact. The entire time I'm catching her fish, she is ranting to no one in particular about how she likes the other store better, and how our goldfish are so much more expensive than the other store (note: they're not. Our comet goldfish are the cheapest within a 3-county radius), and how she wished she had just gone to the other store, because their service was much better than here. 

Then she began berating me because I was apparently taking too long to catch her fish, and she had left her car running and I was costing her fuel. I finished bagging her fish (taking just a bit longer than I normally do) and she snatched them out of my hand without a ""'thank you"". I had a pretty smug grin plastered on my face when she left though. Why you ask?

I only gave her 22 goldfish.

Don't fuck with me.

But wait! There's more!

Fast forward about two hours. The she-bitch comes stomping back to the animal room, red in the face and just fuming. She virtually throws the bag of fish at me, screaming ""ALL THE FISH WERE DEAD WHEN I GOT HOME!!!"" Sure enough, every single goldfish in the bag were belly-up. I also noticed that the water in the bag was hot. I'm talking like roiling jacuzzi temperatures here. Not exactly fish-friendly. I knew exactly what had happened. She had gone shopping elsewhere, and had left the poor goldfish in her car in the summer heat. They got cooked.

Now, we don't have any replacement guarantee on feeder goldfish, for obvious reasons. I did my best to fight back a vindictive smile as I informed her that there was nothing I could do. She could pay for completely new fish, but I couldn't replace the ones she had steamed in her car.

Her eyes about bulged out of her head as she shoved a finger in my face and screeched ""I'M GOING TO CALL CORPORATE! YOU'RE GOING TO GET FIRED FOR THIS!!!"", and she stormed out of the store, knocking things off the shelves in her rage.

Good luck bitch, this is a small business. We don't have a corporate HQ for you to call. If you had been pleasant, I probably would have replaced your fish, no questions asked. But no, you had to act like a raging cuntnugget. Enjoy your empty pond.

My leader who was probably 6 or 7 years older than me decided to steal my mediocre gift and replace it with his mediocre gift; a 12 set of glassware. I remember thinking to myself, ""What am I supposed to with this crap?! I want my mediocre item back.""

At the time he was courting this pretty young thing, one of the other leaders, and everyone knew they were going end up together and then eventually marry.

I said to to him ""You just wait, this will come back to you when you get married.""

6 years later I get an invite to his wedding. It was time.

That glassware had been sitting on top of our fridge for 6 years. I never let anyone touch it. 

I took it down, wrapped it myself and placed a nice bow on top. The satisfaction was immense.

I wrote him and his wife-to-be a fancy card. In the envelope I included a little note just for him. 

It read, ""I told you it would come back to you.""

I was recently at a concert sponsored by a local radio station called Krock. The concert was called DFB. (Dysfunctional Family BBQ) It's just a name for a concert, not a picnic. I remember 2 of the 6 or so bands that played, Volbeat and 10 Years. 10 Years being the second to last band, Volbeat was headlining.

Onto the event.

I was in the front of the concert crowd, about 2 people in front of me. This is only my second time trying to get in front and I think I got the etiquette down pretty well. It's a passive-aggressive fight. If someone moves from their spot, take it. And, you can't bully your way in. I met a dude with his wife who was vehemently defending his position at the very front. I'll call this guy HusBro (HB).

Here comes skinny-big-tit-white-chick with bleach blond hair, I'm guessing she was 16 years old. We'll call her White Bitch (WB). For a good 5 minutes, she was shoving people aside to get in front. For whatever reason, she was really going at me. HB had my back, (literally) wrapped one arm around my back to hold me in place to defend against WB. WB REALLY THRASHING. 

Finally WB crossed the line. She grabbed a fist full of my hair and yanked, HARD. OH FUCK NO! &gt;:O For those who don't know me, I'm a skinny white guy (hypocrite) with a fuckin amazing Jew Fro. It's my pride and joy, I take care of my fro, you ask permission to touch my fuckin hair. 

Because of HB still having my back, I stayed put. I'm telling you, I don't know how I didn't kill this bitch. I had gotten high off second hand pot smoke all day (Drugs are bad, mmk) so I think my senses were fuddled and I gave a surprisingly calm response....

""Excuse me, can we keep this civil? I am trying to enjoy 10 years and it's rude of you to be pulling my hair.""

I saw her face was pure rage as I spoke to her. Feeling that much anger, and pulling my hair because I wouldn't let her up front, lead me to believe she was a spoiled brat. Security pointed right at WB, reaching for her, he saw it. Everyone who saw WB pull my hair lifted her up. Security pulled her over the guard rail. WB acted like she was going out in style. I saw WB getting an escort off the premises. 

I don't know why I didn't choke a bitch, but this was so much better.

TL;DR Entitled bitch pulls my hair to get to front of crowd, gets kicked out of concert.

BONUS KARMA! As WB was getting pulled over the rail, I saw she was wearing a Volbeat shirt, she got kicked out when 10 Years was playing and never got to see Volbeat.

EVEN MORE KARMA! The security guard who pulled WB over the rail, (was a total badass throughout the concert) was talking to some attractive drunk chick. I know flirting when I see it, that was the only time I saw him smile, and I saw them exchange numbers. Mofo got laid that night.

**EDIT: I Completely forgot to mention that Volbeat did a SICK tribute to Slayer's fallen guitarist Jeff Hanneman. They had played a face melting riff from Raining Blood. Slayer fan?

Back in High school, there was one girl that was constantly rude to everyone around her, even the teachers. She would bully people around her and she would especially bully our math teacher simply because he was from Russia. She hadn't bullied me too much but every once in awhile she would target me for a round of insults/jokes, usually because I would defend our Russian teacher from her horrendous insults and Russia jokes. I disliked her. I never showed it too much, but I couldn't stand how she thought that she was better than everyone, and she would constantly ""prove"" it by simply being rude to everyone and showing everyone how much they suck to make herself look better.

The revenge: 

I worked at a nearby retirement community as a cook/server after school. I loved the job, and I was well liked by our great managers and my co-workers. Every once in awhile, someone from my school would apply for a job there, and my awesome employer would trust me with my opinion about the applicant before my employer hired them (you already know where this is going).
So, Bitch comes in and fills out an application, and sure enough my boss comes to me after a few days and asks me about her. I tell her about her bullying and my boss immediately throws her application into the trash. She probably wondered why she wasn't hired, even though she knew that we really needed the help. Bwa ha ha.

It was my first year going for a music degree and I was very excited about learning how to read an orchestral score (music geek that I am).

I spend most of the week figuring out how to read the score along with the music. At the end of the week, we return to class and the professor says to take out our scores. He starts the music and tells us to follow along with the score. After a minute or two he leaves the classroom.

About 30 minutes pass and he is still out of the room and I am still following along, but no one else is. The rest of the class realizes I am following along and asks me what page are we on. I tell them, everyone flips to that page, and they all continue to stay in sync with me as I turn each page.
A few more minutes pass and the professor finally returns. He has a smug look on his face and asks us in an arrogant tone, what page is the score currently on. We answer, ""Page 208"" (or whatever it was). It was like we punched him in the stomach. I, unintentionally, blew his lesson for the day.

I don't know what floor she lived on, but I love exercising and bolted up the stairway, going to the elevator on each floor and pushing the up buttons until I made it to the top of the building so her elevator would have to stop on each floor.

Over the summer, I went to study abroad. Since I wouldn't be in the apartment, I took my valuables (Xbox, TV, etc..) back to my hometown for safekeeping.

Now, while I was at college, my mom had converted my old room into a guest room for people coming into town, complete with its own TV (32""). When I brought back my sweet as heck 40"" TV, she had it set up in the guest room. At the end of the summer, when I was getting all my stuff to bring back to my apartment, Mom made me take the 32"" TV that used to be in that room, because ""it'd be too much trouble"", and ""it's no big deal"", and so on.

My revenge? I had left the remote for the 40"" TV back in my apartment when I brought it over originally. Now whenever my parents have guests watching my sweet TV, they have to walk all the way over to turn it on. My TV may be smaller, but I can control it from all the way on my couch. Winner: Me.

Thought you'd enjoy this incredibly petty revenge story from my first summer job after high school.

I had a great job working at a restaurant in an amusement park.  The people I worked with were fun, I got the hours I wanted, free soda, and free passes for me and friends and family.  It was an awesome job for a teenager.  Until the boss's daughter started working with us.

We knew we were in for trouble when our supervisor stopped by to tell us we were getting a new employee the next day and made a point of explaining who her daddy was.  We were warned to be on our best behavior and to treat her well.  It seemed a silly thing to say since we were all friendly and got along so well, but I understood why we were warned when Her Majesty came in the next day.

This overprivileged, self-absorbed bitch was a very attractive blonde college student who had zero interest in working, especially in such a lowly establishment.  This job was obviously her father's idea.  She made it clear from the moment she stepped foot in the restaurant that her family owned the place and she was going to do whatever she damn well pleased.  After the first week, she got into a routine of showing up 20 minutes late and then standing by the soda dispenser for her entire shift and line up the white lines on the [wax Coca-Cola cups](https://www.google.com/search?q=wax+coke+cups&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lyoLUd7vIozuigLVr4CIBw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=768&amp;bih=900#biv=i|2;d|SUdoiw_1JIILuM:).  We complained to our supervisor that she wasn't doing any work, but he shrugged it off by saying we had plenty of people to do the work and to continue to be polite to her.  Now to be honest, she was an *extra* person on the shift and we had the exact same workload as before.  It was still annoying as hell having someone standing around doing nothing and getting a bigger paycheck.  This restaurant was by far the best place in the park for someone under 18 to work, so we could choose to tolerate Her Majesty and her snide comments or move to a tiny unairconditioned concession stand in 100°F^+ weather.  We begrudgingly chose to play nice.

I opened one morning with another coworker and after we finished setting up, she started idly lining up the restocked Coke cups.  I laughed at her and she said, ""You know, this really is kinda fun.  Let's do Her Majesty's work for her.""  So I started twisting the cups and lining up all the white swooshes too.  Another coworker joined in, and in minutes we'd lined up every single Coke cup on the front counter.  

Her Majesty showed up late as always and dilly dallied around before taking up her usual spot at the soda dispenser.  She grabbed her first stack of cups for the day and looked confused when she saw they were already lined up.  And when she finally realized that *all* the cups - several *hundred* of them - were lined up, she burst into tears and ran out screaming how horrible we were.  She never came back.  Best.  Day.  Ever.

**TL;DR  Coke and white lines shouldn't be done at work.**

Working there for years, you start to recognize the same people over and over again and figure out who's a decent person and who's a shitbag loaded with cash.

At our location, when we'd drop off the vehicle back to its owner, they'd have the option to drive parallel to the mall, which is a straight shot back to the interstate but where there are also a lot of pedestrians. Or they could drive away from our restaurant, perpendicular to the mall, and then get on a curvy road that takes a little bit longer to get back to the traffic light. Naturally, most people took the straight-shot and we always had assholes who just didn't care about pedestrians so they'd floor it in their sports cars and race out to the exit. Every time we returned the cars to certain people, we'd ask them politely not to speed *because they could murder someone* but the chronic-douches never cared or listened.

Well, after a child was struck elsewhere in the mall parking lot due to an unrelated bit of moronitis, they had wide, raised-up speed bumps put in at all the entrances to the mall, including our location. We were told to remind our cherished speeders of the new speedbump/walkways but I ""forgot"" and one night I watched with absolute delight as one smug prick floored it, then locked down his brakes once he saw the speedbumps, hit them at full-speed because it had rained recently and his car squalled tires trying to brake. I couldn't tell if it went airborne or not but when he came down, he came down hard and parts of his car (including his rear fender) broke off underneath him. He was pissed and his date was embarrassed. I'm told that in the months following the speedbumps' installation, five cars had been damaged in similar ways and some had to be towed away -- all from the same group of speeders that we've been asking to slow down over the years.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1358460740.0,,,True,t3_16ry5j,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16ry5j/wealthy_speeders_wreck_their_cars_on_new/,

At least twice a year since I was six years old.  On that figure alone (the actual number's a fair bit higher), I have more lifetime flights under my belt than years alive.  I say all this not out of ego, but out of a need for context; I get how airports work.  Lots of people do.  We check our bags, go through security, wait in the lines, show off our fabulous boarding passes, cram our asses into seats built for Nicole Richie's alternate universe pauper self.  I know the drill inside and out.  Many fliers know the drill inside and out.

This motherfucker did not.

More context is necessary, I feel, to understand.  This was a flight from Heathrow to O'Hare.  An international flight.  Most folks boarding the plane are seasoned air veterans (or just British); get in, find seat, get bag into overhead, get in seat, buckle in.  Five step process.  Simple.  Barring the occasional Baggage Bin Tango - the ritual dance of the airline passenger when the carry-on does not initially slide into its place - everything is going perfectly smoothly.

Enter motherfucker.

Older Indian gentleman, his wife in tow, with a young (grand?) daughter trailing behind them, already wailing and screaming at decibels not heard since Nagasaki.  Usually, young children by their lonesome have the power to turn a quiet, not unpleasant journey into hours of abject misery.  And while I'm all for kids striving to reach their vast potential at such a young age, such things are not conducive to the rest of the flying people.  To be totally fair, a lot of kids are flying for the first time, and it legitimately can be a scary experience.  For that reason, I do my best to not hold it against them.  And in this girl's case, I'd have been happy to let it go had she stopped.  She didn't.  What sort of training or freak accident she went through to get the lung capacity of a blue whale eludes me to this day.

But with her parents - proof positive that walruses are people too - I have no sympathy.  Right off the bat they're both making their comrades-in-flight miserable, pitching a fit about the how's and why's of their sitting in the back (protip: likely because you paid to be there) in broken English, the object of their discontent being the flight attendant at the end of the corridor.  Opening the overhead bin above my head (protip: a closed bin means it's full), he hoists his Oh-my-God-this-man-calls-that-a-carry-on-bag behind his head and forcefully tries to shove it into the thing while his wife glares at me for not letting her through to her seat (protip: likely because your dipshit of a husband is making himself busy trying to prove the physical application of non-Euclidean geometry [optimistically]).  After being told point-blank that his efforts were in vain and having to be led towards the front of the aircraft to find an available bin and getting into his seat beside me, I thank God above that I'm on the aisle and we take off.

I thank God that I'm on the aisle for two reasons.  One, it's an easy escape route from my seatmates that otherwise could have ended very badly.  Two, the parents of the now-relatively silent toddler are bashing their handsets and their touch-screens, loudly complaining that the in-flight entertainment was broken.  With no real desire to do any of the flight's options, I unpack the pillow and unfold the blanket, undoing my seat buckle on the sly underneath.  One of the few points of pride I truly hold is that, despite my tall frame, I've managed to make sleeping in economy work with some degree of genuine comfort.

Nope.  Motherfucker was having none of that.

The caveat to this honed skill is that you need a seatmate who isn't a complete armrest hog (if we ever draft a set of commandments for flying, I can personally assure you that this will make its way to the top of the list, punishable by death).  So no matter what I do, this guy's bony-ass elbow is digging either into my side or into my back.  My one true saving grace denied me, I grumble as the in-flight is turned on and decide to watch some Big Bang Theory to take my mind off of the next several hours.

Toddler once again begins to shriek.  A woman in the row ahead of us, herself flying with a young child, turns and politely asks Dear Aunt Jabba if she could try to quiet her little tyke down.  Visibly shocked and offended that this woman would dare infringe upon her child's right to make another child's sleep impossible, she tells her in no uncertain terms to get fucked, cursing her out even as the woman's polite smile fades and she turns around.  Going back to my BBT, I realize something's caught my eye.

Motherfucker, having decided he couldn't be bothered to get past the instructions, opts to just watch my screen.  Not his wife's.  Mine.

A personal space issue, admittedly, but dude.  You have your own.  Damn.  Screen.  The asteroid you call a wife has one as well.  As does the sonic screwup on the far side of the aisle.  But no.  It has to be mine, hasn't it?  You can't even hear what they're saying.  And the only thing preventing you from watching it your own damn self at your own damn pace is your own damn laziness.

He gets up to go to the bathroom several times in the space of the next hour, after the meal is served.  It's understandable; part of the power that comes with the aisle seat is the courtesy to stand and move out of the way.  It's not nearly as much trouble for you as it is for the person in need of the lavatory.  But that's a type of courtesy that has its limits tried when you're doing this every seven or eight minutes.  Especially when your daughter, now incapable of sitting still after eating both her and her mother's dessert, is running around the cabin like the child of the corn we all knew her to be.  Chalking it up to age-related bowel problems (realistically) or food poisoning (hopefully), I pay it no mind, still trying to tune out their adorable little banshee as she sings what I can only assume is some Indian commercial jingle.  But then, Gramps decides he needs to sleep.

And my shoulder gets the honor of being his pillow.

No.

*Hell* fucking no.

**---THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR---**

I sit there, no longer deriving entertainment from my flashing screen, biding my time.  Waiting.  I know how Han Solo and Pincess Leia's escape in *Return Of The Jedi* was foiled because they failed to wait until the massive slug in the room was asleep.  I don't make that mistake.  Soon enough, the woman falls into her slumber and begins to snore, her sugar-crashing hellbeast of a daughter following suit.

I watched them board.  I knew that the old man was clutching both his passport and his boarding pass.  I knew that he had slid them into the front seat pocket (a tactic I use often enough myself to save time flying to the USA, not knowing either my passport number or my flight number by heart, one I chalk to mere coincidence on this monster's part).  With the deftness of the wind under the cover of darkness, my hand slides along the rough-spun backing of the seat as I slowly maneuver through the pocket and find the now-familiar paper of the boarding pass.  I knew, also, that the immigration forms had already been passed out.  I stand and go to the back of the cabin, asking to borrow a pen.  I acquire the instrument of my revenge and, still working in the shadows, write four S's onto the man's boarding pass before encapsulating it all in a hastily-drawn oval.  A quick loud burst of inhalation from the wretch next to me throws me off my guard for a fraction of a second.  No time to fuck around.

The boarding pass finds its way home, the enemy unaware of my sabotage.

When the plane lands and comes to a full stop, I undo the latch and spring up, my motion honed by years of training, my reaction propelled by my fervent need to get away from this man.  He takes the opportunity to step in front of me for no real reason other than to just get that much farther ahead in line.  A petty offense, but a minor one.  When the line is allowed to move forward, he stops and takes his sweet time to pull his bag out of the overhead bin a good ten rows down, holding up everyone behind him to the point that some cut across the seat rows and move through that way.  Ordinarily I'd have done the same; it's a personal peeve of mine to be stuck behind slow-moving people solely by their own inconsiderate, obstinate nature.

But not today.  I must watch my work bear fruit.

We get in line at Customs.  Being a US citizen, I slide right along in my own line.  O'Hare is not especially busy when we arrive, so I manage to see Clan MacHellspawn go through their customs line, passports and boarding passes being inspected one by one.  As they leave, I see the gate agent reaching for and speaking into his walkie-talkie.

*Goooooood...*

Just before he can enter the corridor into the concourse, my seatmate is stopped by the TSA agents.  They ask to see his boarding pass and he hands it to them, genuinely confused.  The agent in charge hands it to his partner, who nods, and they both open a door going into the hallway wall, indicating for him to step inside.  Many who pass through the gates in American airports are greeted with open arms, and initiated into their American journey with the welcoming ritual called the ""Freedom Fondle"".

This man's greeting will be worse.  Much worse.

Welcome to America, motherfucker.

I have a roommate that I've been living with for a couple of years, and most of the time we get along pretty well.  The problem is, she likes to put words in other people's mouths and tends to walk all over a couple people for no apparent reason.  She'll bitch out our other roommate and her boyfriend infrequently, and she will always be the person who started the fight but never apologized for it.  Part of this is her passing off the stress on her OCD (she actually did get that diagnosed) and part of it is her inability to admit that she was ever in the wrong.  She can also be pretty passive aggressive and makes a number of rude comments to me on a pretty regular basis.  I like her overall and didn't want to go off on her, so I came up with sweet revenge that wouldn't make her go off.

Last year, we got a pet cat because our rental house finally allowed it.  She was ecstatic because she'd wanted a cat for years and could finally have a pet of her very own.  Unfortunately, she's a very busy woman and often doesn't get home until 9 at night. I, on the other hand, usually get home around 3:30ish.  You can probably see where this is going.

Because I usually get home much earlier than her, I started spending more and more time with her cat.  I'd play with it, I'd give it treats, and I'd sit on the couch for hours at a time with her in my lap, taking a nap.  I never rough-housed with her because she's an older animal, and she loves having my fingernails scratch under her chin.  After a few months, I clearly became the cat's favorite.

So now, whenever the roommate gets upset and yells at her friends or makes some snide remark at me, I just think about all the times she's tried to pick up the cat and hold it, only for the cat to bolt out of her arms and onto my lap.  The best part is that I usually try to hand the cat back or encourage the roommate to give her treats, all to no avail.  She seriously thinks the cat likes me better for no apparent reason.

So every Saturday last winter I would find myself making the 10 minute trek home in subzero weather.  For this PR, that Saturday had been particularly brutal (I had to work a bachelorette party on top of a 10 hour shift) and I finally managed to leave at 2:45am.

Any other night this would be where the story ends however about 10 minutes later, I reach the path to my apartment (from the street it connects to the parking lot) and I hear music *blaring* from the apartment next door.  Simultaneously I also notice that my path is blocked to the parking lot by a shitty, drunken park job by (I shit you not) one of the Obnoxious Cars, now empty.  This means that in order for me to get to the parking lot I have to squeeze in between a snow bank and the side of the car soaking my pants in the freezing cold.  Now I'm absolutely fuming, when an idea pops in my head.  I take the 2 water bottles that I happened to have in my bag and pour them in between all the doors knowing that the doors will freeze if given enough time.  Now I can only hope that they don't come back soon.

Cut to the next day at around 11am, I get up and immediately check outside and to my delight the car is still there with a light dusting of snow, *perfect.*  From my apartment I can see everything clearly and I decide that I want to see the reaction of the drunken assholes.  Well it didn't take long considering the apartment owner, a pretty decent dude, kicks all of these randoms from his apartment as he has to go to work.  When the hungover pricks make it to their car, they realize the doors will not open!  Well they start getting mad and begin tugging on the doors but to no avail.

The collections people got more and more hostile, like we were hiding this girl in a back room or something.

It was pretty obvious to us that Tandi didn't change her mailing address with ANYONE. Personal letters got returned to sender, but everything else was fair game. So when a package arrived in the mail (about 8 months after moving in), we were curious and opened it.

It was a great-looking pair of black leather ankle boots. Bought and paid for by dear old Tandi. She forgot to change her mailing address on her Lane Bryant account, and they got mailed to us. And, wouldn't you know it, they were *exactly* my size.

My family is conservative, and all my siblings were raised, I won't *say* Mormon, but I'll let you think it. My mom has two sisters that have families, also all the same religion.

Well, what happens after my older sister graduates high school and still hates Mormonism? She quits. She moves away for a while and does all the non-Mormon stuff she couldn't do while she lived with my parents. Drinking, smoking, and (gasp) has sex.

She lives this way for a great while, like, five years. Even while still in high school she rebelled, so none of us were surprised, though I will admit my parents were pissed. But okay, 5 years, we get it. She's different than the 'norm' for the family.


**Story**

Well, she moves back and what do you know. She's pregnant. I'm about to be an uncle. Cool. The dad is nowhere, and my family is shellshocked, briefly, but come to terms. She's a daughter/sister, and it's weird, but she's cool. Family bond. Nice. She has my nephew. Great kid.

Well, my nephew ages -- as normally happens -- and when he hits three, maybe four, my sister gets a letter in the mail from our Aunt and her family. I can't quote directly but my sister summed it up as follows:

Dear Thebumm's Sister,

We've prayed a lot. We care about you and your son. So much. God does too. He wants us to adopt him. Also, your cousin is married in God's house, and she could also adopt your son. We're family see, so this would be a stable environment you could not provide. He was born out of sin, but that's not *his* fault, and we can see to it he won't suffer for your sins. And you'd still be in his family. God says this is best. We know, because we prayed.

Keep in mind my parents had discussed with my sister all her options, *before she had the baby*. They were pissed, but supportive and she knew this. She's a big girl.


**Petty Revenge**

My sister tells us this, and we, her siblings, lockout the Aunt and family. No facebook, no phone calls, no contact. Unfriending, deleting contacts. My Aunt has been a bitch for a while, but trying to call my sister a demon and steal my nephew. I got married, they were not invited. Still haven't heard from them. And my nephew? Not cursed, he and my sister are living just fine and wonderfully. Close to my parents, and they are both happy.

BF's mother also worked for the company, and was also laid off.  Since BF's father has been on Disability for a decade or two, BF's mother (who shall be called HC, for ""Horrible Cow"") was having just as much trouble paying the mortgage as we were having paying the rent.  So it is decided that BF and I should move in with HC and NN (BF's father, ""Numb Nuts"").

This turns out to be a big mistake, as it quickly becomes apparent that HC has been hiding her intense dislike for me, and decides that, since we are trapped in her house, she need not bother to hide it any more.

BF and I are both over 30 years old, and she treats me like a naughty teenager.  She berates and yells at me every chance she gets.  If she doesn't get a chance, she will make up an excuse.

Case in point:  The other day she screamed at me and called me names *because I emptied the clean dishwasher* and put all the dishes away.  Where they belong, even.  

Well, it's not as though we can afford to move out yet, so there's not much I can do about it when she goes off on me.  Not overtly, at least.

So, I waited a few hours, until NN had gone to bed, but HC was still up watching her recording of Wheel of Fortune.  Then I proceeded to have **very loud sex** with her son.

The best part is, it wasn't me that was being loud!

Take that, Horrible Cow!

(P.S: Before people start asking why BF doesn't defend me, he does.  A lot.  And he has made it clear to HC that all of her backstabbing attempts to get him to dump me are pointless and just piss him off.)

**UPDATE: I have just gotten a job interview for 4:30 today (Fri 04/05)!!  If I get the job, it will be the last piece in the ""get the hell out of here"" puzzle, and we can move before next month.  I hope HC and NN enjoy NOT getting any rent or bill money from us any more!  Keep your fingers crossed for me!**

**Update 2:  Interview nailed.  Second interview nailed.  Job has been offered.  Pending a clean piss test (no problem) I will be employed by next week! (04/11)**

**Backstory to put it all in context:**  

So i work in a mom&amp;pop kind of store where we sell computers and computer-related accessories. We also offer free diagnostics on computers and after that give a price-quote on what fixing it would cost. If the customers accept we fix it and if not they pick their junk up at no charge.

---

So this man, we´ll call him Jerkface (Because i cant remember his real name, not that it matters.) comes in with his by the looks of it 6 year old acer laptop that the customer and time has NOT been kind to. He slams the laptop on the counter and tells me how he had a minor coffee-related accident with it and now half of the keys on his keyboard didn´t respond to keystrokes and the second half just wrote out multiple unrelated keys whenever you pressed any of them.

The coffee must have been really hot because the plastic keys on the keyboard who recieved most of the coffee-shower had lost their original shape from the heat.

I completed the diagnostics and called the customer, the call went something like this:

**Me:** Hello this is mean_tech from $STORENAME, im calling regarding your lapt.. (Before i could finish my sentence he cuts me off and just tells me he´ll come in later or whatever in a *very* rude and condecening tone.)

-----

**Fast-forward 10 days or so.**

Jerkface comes in acting all important talking loudly in his worn-down iphone (1st gen, the one that came before the iPhone 3G.)  
I greet jerkface with a hello and smile, he just puts his hand up signaling me to be quiet and talks with his buddy for 5 minutes while i wait with his laptop.

After he hangs up he walks over and the conversation went something like this:

**Him:** Yes so whats wrong with it?

**Me:** Well firstly, the keyboard is soaked with coffee and

(He cuts me off mid-sentence again)

**Him:** YES, i can see that and i know it since i spilled in it! Can you fix it?

**Me:** I can fix it, but we´ll need to replace the keyboard.

**Him:** What?! Can't you just replace the keys?!

**Me:** No sir, the electronics inside the keyboard under the keys are damaged aswell, that is why half the keys print of random characters when you press them.

**Him:** I´ve spilled coffee in my stationary computers keyboard many times, you just have to wash it off! What are you, amateurs?!

**Me:** Well sir, a laptop-keyboard is alittle different from the keyboard that you connect to a computer, the circuitboard and the keys usually have an extra plastic layers betw-- (He cuts me off again)

**Him:** You obviously know nothing about computers! Im taking my computer to &lt;The equivalent of Best Buy in our country&gt;!!

**Me:** Fine sir, you just need to sign this waiver that says you have been notified of what is wrong with your device.

Me signs the paper and takes his computer, turns arround and leaves without a word, as he reached the door i gave him a friendly ""Have a nice day!"". He scruffed and muttered ""Idiots"" just loud enough for me to hear it.

**The Revenge part**

Remeber the beginning of our conversation?

&gt;**Me:** Well firstly, the keyboard is soaked with coffee and

Well this good sir cut me off before i got to the part where i was going to tell him that his harddrive was most likely going to fail within a not so far away future. (The drive had multiple SMART error warnings and gave the typical ""I hope you have backups""-clicking.

Fun fact: Jerkface had visited us earlyer with his computer with an unrelated error, when we spoke to him we asked if he kept backups..

His response? ""I paid &lt;The equivalence to roughly 1200 dollars&gt; for this computer, its not going to just break!"" (I remeber him saying this in a rude tone aswell)

Take that bitch!!,376,70,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ikupw/berate_me_at_work_take_that_bitch/,"I used to work a late shift in a supermarket chain and so would always have to cash up as the store was closing, meaning we had to wait for the very last customers of the day to come through...no biggie.
However, this particular day I had a woman approach my till and I could just sense a vibe from her...she was not in a good mood.

Never mind, she still gets a cheery hello from me (ignored) and I start scanning her items. I could see she had a handful of her own bags to pack her shopping into and so I assumed she was going to start packing herself, seeing as they were still in her trolley. 

But oh no, she just wanted me to have a huge gathering of items taking up all the room at the end of my till before throwing the bags down and asking 'don't you even offer to pack in this place?' 
'Certainly madam'

So I'm half packing/half scanning (she'd done a fairly large shop) and eventually, it's all scanned with plenty left to pack.  She's just watched me up until now. So now she wants to pay as I'm clearly taking too long. She thrusts a card at me and just snaps 'I have to sign for this card'.

At the time, the whole Chip &amp; PIN thing had only recently come into effect, so some cards that hadn't been activated for it yet still automatically made the till print out a slip so the customer could sign.  However, if the card WAS activated for a PIN to be entered, we weren't able to override that, even if the customer wanted to sign, so if they hadn't received their PIN yet, they were pretty stuck.

Because of this fact, I asked the lady, just to double check, ""so you don't have a PIN for this card?""  I shit you not, this bitch LOST IT.
She started screaming at me ""I JUST SAID I HAVE TO SIGN FOR THIS CARD, HOW STUPID DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO NOT UNDERSTAND BLAH BLAH BLAH""  
I was in shock, and SO embarrassed. Nobody had ever spoken to me like that in the whole 2 years I'd been there at that point, people were looking over and I could feel myself turning red.
She then insisted on seeing the manager about it, as apparently, she had a disability meaning that she had to sign for things, and I was discriminating against her (not entirely sure how - or, indeed, what the disability was) so I called my supervisor and simply told her ""this lady would like to see the manager"" so off she went to complain about me, leaving me to pack the rest of her bags.

MISTAKE.

Amongst the items purchased were eggs, and a couple of bottles of shampoo/conditioner.
I'm not entirely sure how, but I THINK the shampoo bottles may have accidentally opened slightly, and been packed under some fairly heavy items. And the eggs, well they may have also ended up underneath some heavy items, some of which I may or may not have dropped on top.  Whoops!

I've been a server.  Was one for four years.  And yes, I know that when you end up being seated a table full of teenagers and twenty-somethings, it can suck.  But, you should always begin your serving journey nicely, and treat the table like any other table you may be sat.  Sometimes the biggest surprises are when you take good care of young people, and receive a bitchin' tip.  

One late evening, a group of my friends and I decided to head down to the local Waffle House to get some grub after a long show they had played.  It was quite the group; tattooed and bearded boys, pierced and decorated women.  Not exactly something you see every day in southern Alabama.  We ended up taking over three booths and a table with our group.   Mind you, half of them were working food industry jobs to help fund their musician lifestyles.  All good people, and good tippers from my experiences eating out with them.

Now, we were nothing but polite.  Perhaps a bit loud at times, but polite and respectful nonetheless.  

Well, the waitress that served us didn't even bother being polite from the get-go.  

""Gimme your drink orders.""

""Can't you guys hurry up and order?""

""You're taking too long; I'll get you last.""

""Don't you leave a mess!""

After we ordered and began our wait for the delicious scattered hashbrowns and artery clogging bacon, we ended up emptying our drinks fairly quickly.  She would glance at our cups, and then proceed to keep walking back and forth, filling up other customers' drinks.  

Whatever.

By the time our food started to come out, we had completely empty drinks and hadn't received a refill yet.  We were thirsty!  All that slam dancing and head banging from before really makes one parched.  She began to hand out the plates of food, but instead of setting them down on the table, she would drop them onto the table at least two inches from the surface so that they would clang really loudly, and food would slide off of the side.

Not cool, yo.

Being young and stupid, we never thought to get a manager.  So we quietly and quickly ate just to get the fuck outta there.  Just as we were finishing up, she finally gave us some refills.  By this time, we just wanted our checks, so we asked for them.

Waitress walks by, drops the stack of checks on the table, and walks back off.  We have to sort through the checks to figure out who had what.  It didn't help that she had god-awful handwriting, but that's neither here nor there.

I was done with this bitch.  I was seeing red.  You don't treat customers this poorly for any reason.  Especially since we didn't do a damned thing to deserve it.  So I gathered all of my friends who had small tickets, and plotted out a mean little slice of revenge.

We sent the larger checks to the register, to pay and distract the waitress while we executed our plan.

You see, as a server (and I'm sure all you who have been can relate), I would let huge amounts of change from my tips at work pile up in the bottom of my purse.  I had roughly $30 worth of change in that black hole.  (I also acquired a nice dent in my shoulder from the purse being so damned heavy.)  So I took this change, counted out enough for seven people to pay their checks, and had them put it in their now full beverages.  Take one laminated Waffle House menu, place it on top, and flip the cup over and onto the table on the menu.  Be gentle as you slide the menu from between the glass and the table, and VOILA!  The drinks stay in the cups!  Now, you have yourself a huge pain in the ass to clean up!

I yelled over to Waffle Lady to announce that we paid in cash and left it on the table, and then we all proceeded bounce out of there with haste!

We all turned around as we were walking to our cars to watch her reaction.  She started running towards the door, to, I don't know, yell at us?  We laughed and left.

She was going to have a hell of a night.

Bitch.

TL;DR:  Waffle bitch was a bitchy bitch and we get even.

Anyways, onto the story. As you may imagine, every now and then someone in my line of work will come across someone a little less than happy to talk about environmental issues. For some reason it's ""controversial"". So I walk up to this old ladies house and knock on her door. I'll refer to her simply as ""Old Lady"". Old Lady comes to the door and starts screaming profanities at me, accusing me of being a druggy (which, honestly I'm not, hardly even smoke weed), telling me I'm some crazed liberal trying to make people afraid so they'll give us lots of cash, etc. After maybe a minute of standing there smiling and getting my fill of crazy for the day (I've been doing it for years and was used to this; also I find smiling and being overly friendly towards these people just pisses them off all the more), I wish Old Lady a wonderful day and bid her farewell.

Despite this fact most of us still make shit wages because the owner and his wife are greedy. Still, no biggie… we enjoy our work environment a lot due to our coworkers being in general just awesome people.  Every department gets a pot of shitty coffee in the morning. But hey, we make the most of it by taking turns bringing snacks for our own little coffee lounge to go along with coffee. That is until a client was visiting and accidentally broke our coffee pot. 

We informed our employers that this had occurred and asked for a replacement. What answer did we get? A solid “No - it is too expensive”. A company making millions can’t afford a R$ 50 (more or less 20 USD) coffee pot? Are you serious? This is a bullshit reason and we know it. They just hate the fact that we are united and have coffee breaks. Because of this now we have to go down a a flight of stairs get coffee and return the same way to our department. I personally don’t mind but 1 of my female coworkers just had 4 days of paid leave because her foot was and still is very sore and she can barely walk because of her bad articulation.  That just isn’t decent.


I went home and got started looking for one of our old coffee pots. My mom and her cousin show up and ask what I was doing with shuffling through her old coffee pots. A few hours later that night my mom out of the blue shows up with one of those fancy Nespresso machines and says “My cousin got one of these for her birthday and doesn’t enjoy coffee - Hope your coworkers like it”  Suck it greedy bosses - Now only my department has good coffee around this place. 
Cherry on the cake: Owners wife had the nerve to ask me if she could have a cappuccino… I bet you can guess what my answer was. “I’m sorry but these are too expensive.” VICTORY DANCE IN MY MIND!

I collect them and some times modify my own cars. So yeah im a gear head and usually engage in friendly track competitions and the like. 

I really reserve speeding for the track and since I track often I rarely crave speeding especially on public roads.

One time I was travelling on the road and I see a few hunded meters ahead of me a guy just speeding cutting people off and being a danger to everyone. I guess after some time he sees me on his rear view mirror, my car had day time running lights on and I guess from my car's stance he figures i was driving a sports car/modified car. He slows down and waits for me. I slowly pass by him and after some time he decides to step on it hard. He then cuts me, taunting me to ""race"" him. I ignore him and then he lets off the gas and goes right behind me and starts tailgating. He keeps flashing his lights trying to lure me into racing. 

You see, I am really familiar with the road and I know theres a huge pot hole some distance ahead. So i thought about it and decided to teach this young punk a lesson. I shifted down and accelerated making sure that the douche was close behind as I was headed towards the pot hole.

On the last second I switched lanes, causing the guy's wheel to go in the pothole... BAM! He stopped as I looked on my rear view mirror. I made a U-turn to check what happened and saw that his wheel was completely shattered and that his front bumper fell off. 

I approached his car putdown my window and told him (in our local language) ""Thats what you get for being a douche on the road!"" then I sped off.

However, during this final performance, we noticed this one girl was intent on not paying attention. 

Well, she continued for the duration, never once looking up. Now, when the director comes out and tells you before a performance that texting is distracting, let's be honest, we couldn't give less of a shit about a few times, but when you text throughout the whole thing, not only is it disrespectful, we notice it, and it consumes a bit of our attention too. 

Back to the story, once the play is over, everyone is quite upset with this girl, and one of the actresses, a friend of mine, begins to cry. She tells me that this girl was the very same girl who had told her to kill herself during a low time in her life. That little loony tunes thermometer hit steaming. Go time.

We head out to the lobby to meet with the audience, and I approach to give the girl my mind. ""When you text throughout the play, it's distracting as hell. We'd appreciate it if you didn't do that from now on.""

I was bullied a lot in middle school- somewhat in school, but moreso on the bus.  I had a bad bus.  In a typical five day week, the driver would take us back to school 1-2 times for disciplinary problems.  In a bad week, three or even four times wasn't impossible.  I sat next to a friend of mine who had slightly more more clout with the bullies than I did so they didn't usually bother me too much, except for one kid.  David Hernandez.  He was bad enough that my driver moved him closer to front of the bus so she could keep an eye on him.  Unfortunately, this moved him away from his friends and across the aisle from me.  So he was bored and needed entertainment, and I was usually that entertainment.

Unfortunately for him, he was an impulsive idiot, and I'm smart and manipulative.

I overheard a conversation one day between my Vice Principal and a teacher where the VP was talking about how he'd come along way in his behavior.  They were in the front of the room while my class was taking a test and they didn't know that could hear them.  Granted, they probably assumed that even if students could hear then that they would be paying more attention to their tests, but this didn't take into account that I usually only needed 15 minutes to finish a test designed to take 42 minutes (one period).  Anyway, there had recently been a major meeting between his parents, teachers, the district psychologist, and a few other important things.  A lot of stuff about he and his parents were told in no uncertain terms that he was on his last chance, but that he'd seemed to finally get the message and was changing.  Apparently, no one realized that I was still a target of abuse on a daily basis.

I made a plan and put it into motion.  I waited until a day that the aforementioned VP was on-call after school (our bus came back to school often enough I figured out the rotation).  Once the bus got moving, I waited until David was sitting next to me and until the bus driver noticed his CD player and headphones and told him to put it away.  This always made him pissed off and on edge.  Then I took out my math homework and started working on it.  He always targetted smart kids so I knew this would get him started.  After about 5 minutes of harrassment- knocking my pencil to mess up my work, tearing a page in my book, calling me various names, I told him to stop or he'd regret it.  He called me some more names and started laughing.  I turned and spit on him, hitting him right in the face.  I then closed my book and waited.  After about 2-3 seconds of shock that I stood up to him, he starts screaming at me at the top of his lungs (use your imagination), jumps me, and punches me in the face a few times- hard.  He starts screaming about how he's going to kill me and if I ever do it again he'll break my jaw.

He calms down and gets off me after a few good punches.  Bus driver stops the bus, comes back, short yelling match between them.  The driver calls in something on her radio and we head back to school bus goes back to school and our bus, for the first time ever, is *silent*.  He's not touching me but staring daggers.  We get back to school.  The VP who had previously been so impressed by him is waiting arms crossed and face blank.  With her are four cops- town police, not school district police.  The police take him and me off.  They send me away with the VP, one of the cops coming with us.  As I leave I see the remaining cops cuffing David.  I go into the VP's office alone with her and she asks me what happened.  I told her *everything*- I was writing something, he was doing this and that to me, I spit on him, and then I described the beat down I got along with all the threats.  I also told her of some of the better things he'd said to me over the last month (when I knew he was on thin ice)- his threats to kill my dog (knowing her breed and color and name), talking about how he rapes teachers who give him bad grades, so on and so forth.  My dad arrives, talks to her alone for a few minutes and we go home.  My dad has me write down everything and takes my letter to the VP the next day.  I was given a day off so the school could sort some things out (not suspended, just told that I didn't need to come in).  The day after that I come back to school again.  I wasn't told anything but noticed my usual tormentors were leaving me alone.

Turned out that Dave got suspended for two weeks.  That was long enough to get to the next school board meeting where they approved his expulsion.  The last time I ever saw him he was when he was being cuffed.  I have no idea what happened to him after this, though I picked up enough chatter from his friends to know that he was still around- his family was dirt poor so they couldn't move to a new district.  I didn't even get a note in my record's margin about this and I have no regrets.

(X-post r/askreddit),363,59,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/150e6c/someone_suggested_that_you_guys_might_enjoy_this/,"Okay, this is probably the most fucked up thing I've ever done in my life, so here goes.

I lived with an awful roommate my freshman year of college. She was a HUGE bitch to me from day one, for no reason. For example, she refused to let me keep anything in the shower and if I did she would dump all the wet contents on my bed. If I left ANY food in the room she would throw it out because she thought keeping food in the room wasn't sanitary. She demanded that I not talk on the phone in our room if she was there because listening to half of a conversation made her uncomfortable. And she was OBSESSED with Sex and the City. She watched the whole series all the way through I think four times by the end of the year and would refuse to use headphones. She would routinely lock me out of the room when she had friends over. She would vacuum the room at 2 in the morning even though she knew I had class the next morning. Yeah, I was a huge pushover back then and definitely should have called her on shit more often.

So one weekend about four months into school, I went to stay with my aunt and uncle who lived about two hours away from campus. That night I got an angry text message from her accusing me of stealing her toothbrush. I finally lost it. I sent her a pretty mean reply accusing her of being paranoid and telling her that she needed to stop being such a huge fucking bitch to me all the time. She dropped it after that.

Later that night, I went to go get ready for bed and lo and behold, there was the toothbrush sitting right in my bag. I was so mad at fucking everything. I was mad at her for being a bitch. I was mad at me for being wrong. I was livid with her for being right. I was angry and frustrated and embarrassed and pretty much any other negative emotion you can think of.

So I did what any insane enraged person would do. I fucking masturbated with the toothbrush. To this day, I don't know what was going through my mind. I don't know why I thought that was an okay response to the situation. All I know is that I angrily fucked myself with her toothbrush and then came. HARD. In the midst of my angry jerking session, I briefly started to get off on the idea of giving it back to her. And I did. I washed it off and then apologized for taking it and gave it back to her. She was a fucking bitch about it too and would hide all of her stuff from me for the rest of the year. But every time I saw her use the toothbrush, I would giggle to myself a bit. Because, as we've established, I am a fucked up person.

Don't let shit build up. It doesn't end well for anyone.

It's fun. 

**The Transgression**: When we were in line for the ride, the line was formed by two fences. The fences were wide enough so that four people could stand side by side comfortably. Since there were only two of us, there was a lot of space on either side. As we were standing in line, two small boys (probably about 8 or 9 years old) walked up to my left between me and the fence past us up to where another group of people were standing taking up the whole path, cutting us in line to the ride. Naturally, I didn't say anything because I like the rest of society am socialized not to say anything when other people violate social norms in small ways. 

**The Revenge**: After the ride, my wife and I were walking towards the exit when I saw the two boys running towards us (with the boundless energy of children at an amusement park). Immediately, I stepped to the left of my wife and nudged her to the right, so that the two of us took up the entire exit line (which was much thinner than the entrance line) and they were stuck behind us. I put my arm on my wife's shoulder and walked as slowly as possible, forcing them to wait in total about 5 seconds longer to exit the ride.

I live in Los Angeles, a city that is bisected by a small mountain range. I live on the South side of these mountains (the basin) and work on the North side (the Valley). For me, the only way to cross these mountains is to drive over one of several narrow, winding canyon roads. Also, I'm lucky to have a sort of ""reverse commute"", meaning that traffic is heavy in the direction that I am not traveling, both in the morning and in the evening. This leaves me free to drive quickly (I mean, a few mph over the speed limit, nothing crazy).  
So I'm heading home one Friday evening, not in a rush, when a minivan turns in front of me, cutting me off, and forcing me to slow down. There was no one behind me, he could have waited just a few seconds and gotten behind me, but he chose to cut me off. So I decelerate to accommodate this guy and leave a safe following distance. I'm really not in a hurry, and I'm opposed to tailgating, unnecessary horn-honking and other douchey means of communication often emplyed by fellow Angelenos. But, this guy is going 10 mph in a 35 zone, and there is no possible way a sane person could pass on that road. With his Nevada plates, he is unlikely to be turning into one of the driveways along the road. I'm stuck.  
Slowly, painfully, we creep and crawl and approach the summit of the Hills. There is a long line of annoyed drivers behind me, but I keep my cool, taking deep breaths, thinking positive thoughts and singing along to Abba. I do really want to get out from behind this person, though, and an option is approaching. At the top of the hill, one can either take a left to go onto Mulholland, or continue forward to descend the hill on Coldwater (the road I came up on). My desired route is to take a left, because it plops me down in the basin closer to my house. Forward is an option, but it takes a little longer. I decide I'm going to take whatever direction this jerk ISN'T going. I won't be trapped by you, Mr. Nevada Plates! I have options!!!  
So he signals a left turn, and goes into the left turn lane. I continue forward, to avoid him. At the last second, he changes his mind and drifts back in front me. Because I wasn't tailgating, he has room to do this. And it is too late for me to turn left. So now I have to follow him all the way down to Sunset Blvd, THEN deal with LA traffic all the way back to my house, to boot. I am pissed. I'm wishing I had some sort of missile capability on my car, hoping Mothra will appear out of nowhere and trash his minivan, anything. I can feel my blood just starting to boil, and there is nothing I can do about it. Damn.  
I do want to stress, that even at this point, I wasn't tailgating, not honking, not flipping him off. I left him a whole two car lengths following distance for safety. I was angry, not murderous. So I continue to eat shit all the way down Coldwater to Sunset, when I am finally able to pass him and go on my merry way. I wanted to give him the finger, at least, but I didn't. I stopped at my local Starbucks to take a break and grab an iced Americano. On my way out, who pulls up to me? Mr. Fucking Nevada Plates, in the flesh. I recognized his van, because I just got through studying the fucking thing for the last twenty-five minutes. He asked me if I knew the fastest way to LAX, because he was really in a hurry. In a hurry, are we? I can help you with that. I put on a pleasant smile and I say ""Sure, I can help! The best way to get to LAX at this hour is to take a left here onto Santa Monica Blvd. here, take that all the way to the 101 South, then take the 10 East to the 405 South. It's actually a lot faster than taking Sunset to the 405, trust me!"" He smiles, and says thank you, and I watched him make that rather difficult left onto Santa Monica Blvd, and enjoyed my iced Americano. I hope you really enjoy your beautiful view of Downtown Los Angeles. At fucking rush hour.

Fair enough.

So that night at 5pm, his opening time, I rang his shop.  Once he answered, I put the call on mute, put the handset on the benchtop and went out for the night.

She would stay up insanely late, coming back at 3 in the morning to watch Robot Chicken loudly with me only ten feet away trying to sleep. She kept the windows open during winter because she ""got too hot"" so it wasn't unusual for me to come back to a room with temperatures below 0. She belittled me if her friends were over.

The thing that annoyed me above everything else was her stupid alarm clock habits. It started off where it would go off at least two hours before she had to be up for classes and she would hit the snooze button. At least ten times. Every morning. Not long after that, she decided that sometimes she didn't even want to get up to do that and would just leave it going off. I don't know how, but she somehow would manage to go back to sleep and ignore it. Yet usually she'd eventually know when to get up to get to class. 

People in our hall complained, especially when she'd leave it going off for her record time of 2 hours, I complained... she just didn't do anything about it. 

For my revenge I started turning her alarm off as soon as I knew when she was asleep. I tried to do this more often whenever I would be staying the night at a friend's as well, so she wouldn't suspect it was me. She started missing more and more classes, and suspected her alarm clock was broken, so she began using her phone as her alarm since she couldn't afford another one. Well, I turned that off as well or set it to a different day/time.

She failed her classes and dropped out of college after the first semester, leaving me room mate free and finally getting some decent sleep for the rest of the year.

Not many people have it, but it's real and has been confirmed by a real live doctor. It's called Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome, and basically certain sounds (sibilant ""s"" sounds, spitty plosives, but most of all the noises people make when they chew with their mouths open) fill me with anxiety and rage. Sometimes people describe it as the ""fingernails on a chalkboard"" feeling. Mostly this is fine. Always eat in loud places, never listen to NPR, don't hang out with people who have a sibilant lisp, carry music/earplugs with you.

He, sadly enough, uses Reddit via smartphone and cannot post this himself. As this is a text post, I will gain no karma for his amazing shenanigans. Enjoy!

So my buddy (now referred to as Toby) works at a small town pizza place as both cook and waiter. As we live in a small town, everything tends to close around 9 in the evening. Now a young fellow (we're going to call him Chester. Why? I find the name silly) comes in with his girlfriend ten minutes to closing. 

Chester:""I want to get a large pizza.""

Toby: ""I'm sorry, sir, but we're getting ready to close, the ovens are off.""

Now, I don't think that this is a particularly unreasonable thing, for whatever reason, Toby's boss shuts the ovens off so that they can leave at a reasonable hour.

Chester: ""This is a pizza place right? Well I'm not leaving until I get a pizza!"" Douche-mode has been activated.

It's worth noting that he was on meds for his tonsils and they cause two major side effects: low patience, and an amazing sense of justice.  Toby, not wanting to tell the guy off, asks his boss to do it for him. His boss (Jim from now on) gives him an interesting opportunity.

Jim: ""Toby, how much did you make in tips tonight?""

Toby: ""Maybe 30 bucks?""

Jim: ""Want to make $20?""

Toby: ""...""

Jim: ""If you can tell this guy to fuck off, **AND** make me laugh, I'll give you $20.""

Toby: ""You sure? Because I don't want to get in trouble for this.""

Jim: ""I'm sure.""

After securing his boss's blessing, Toby sets his plan into motion. He walks out front again.

Toby: ""I just talked to the head chef and I feel really bad about a minute ago, he's agreed to give you a free one-topping pizza. Which topping would you like?""

Chester: ""I want sausage."" 

At this point Toby's boss asks him what the hell he thinks the's doing. After a moment of persuading his boss to play it cool, Toby goes in the back to ""prepare"" the pizza. A few minutes later, Toby comes out to the booth where Chester is sitting and slams a raw pizza down in front of him and his girlfriend. Written out in sausage is the message: ""Get the fuck out."" Chester has absolutely no idea how to react and storms out of the restaurant with girlfriend in tow. Jim is laughing his ass off and my buddy is coming to terms with how awesome he is.

Some time around the middle of year 12, I had a maths class first thing after recess. It may have been Discrete Maths or Applicable Maths, or some other irrelevant but equally boring iteration of the subject. Usually, it was a drag having maths around this time, especially after gorging on treats - usually the day's lunch - and running around antagonising other students.

One fateful morning, a fellow classmate had, for whatever reason, not been able to eat during recess. We'll call him Don. Don had a ravenous appetite which usually spurred him on to performing dares and stunts in exchange for cash and/or food. Jumping off the school's roof, sneaking away on field trips, that sort of thing.

But I digress.

It's after recess, Don hasn't eaten and his stomach was saying ""feed me."" He pulled out his lunchbag (no ordinary box for this bloke - nothing but the best bread loaf bag for him!) and went to town.

Just as the teacher walked in.

Said teacher didn't take too kindly to eating in class, but then what teacher (besides a Home Ec. teacher) would? he immediately told Don to put his food away, there's not eating in class!

Disgruntled, the food disappears, books and notes appear, class, the universe and time march inexorably forward.

Some unknown time later, same class, we're all waiting for the teacher. Who's late. Again. He shows up apologising and claims that he was pulled away for a meeting during recess. Or some such. We were 16, it was maths, we didn't care. What we *did* care about was the large, moist, delicious looking muffin sitting on a plate held in the teacher's left hand. Surely not! What about the cardinal rule?

But yes. Out come the books, down go the heads, smack go the lips (while we're not looking). Looking? No. Paying attention? Oh, my word, yes. How dare he use the old ""Do as I say, not as I do"" like on us?

More time, universes and marching occur and it's now towards the end of year 12. Everyone's forgotten the muffin incident. Everyone except for Don.

It's here that I should probably point out that our desks were arranged in pairs. And Don was sitting right next to.... we'll call him Barney. We file in from recess, get to our desks. Teacher comes in, tells us to get out our books and notes.

Don pulls out his books. Barney pulls out his books.

Don pulls out two plates. Two forks. A knife. Barney pulls out two glasses.

Don pulls out a cheesecake and proceeds to slice and serve it to himself and Barney. Barney pulls out a bottle of Coke and proceeds to pour two glasses.

The only way I can describe what happened next is that they proceeded to **dine**.

All in full view of the class and the teacher. Who, by the way, is staring dumbfounded at the scene unravelling before him.

I'm also fleshing out some of the details that I didn't have in my original post.

This was in 2001. There was a hate site called Dalitstan.org that was all about hating Hindus and India. I forget how I came across the site, but I just thought it was a discussion forum and I joined. I soon figured out that these people were beyond reason and no amount of logical arguments were going to persuade them. They were just bigots through and through. At some point they decided to just straight out ban me.

I initially started making troll accounts to spam the board. They would just ban the accounts and I'd create new ones. This was starting to get tiring. Seeing as I was a computer engineering major, I had some tricks up my sleeve. Since this was 2001, there were no captchas and the site they hosted the message board on had no real protection for their forms. You could copy their submission form to a local file and submit from that and it would post on the board. So at first, I simply wrote a script that submitted the form from the same user over and over again. They banned that user and I'd create another one. It was a little annoying for them, but they seemed to react quickly to ban the bot.

Then I took some time to do it right. The board's user-registration form had no protection as well. So I wrote a script that would randomly generate a username, register it, and then start posting from that. After it had posted a few hundred messages, it would register another random username and so on. Once I finished, it was around 10 or 11pm. I started up multiple instances of this script and let them go to town.

I woke up next morning to find over 10,000-20,000 spam messages on their forum. I had the script logging and looking at the logs, I could tell that they simply couldn't keep up with the bots. Every time they banned one bot, another one would appear. They ended up blocking all posts on the site and slowly set up on the task of deleting the spam posts. I think it took them a month. During that time, I made no effort to spam them again. After they cleaned up the spam, they opened the boards up again. For a week or two I didn't spam and I think they thought they were in the clear. Then BAM! I started it up again. This time, I started large number of instances of the script and let it go to work. 

The next morning, there were upwards of 50,000 spam posts in ALL of their sub forums. The forum was pretty much unusable. They never really recovered after that and the site went dark after a week or two. I like to think that I had something to do with that. :)

**TL;DR;** I stumble across a forum. I start posting only to discover that they are racist fucktards. I get banned. I use my l33t hax0r skills to spam them into oblivion.

Have two pink eyes.,347,51,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1j2hnp/you_use_my_eyeshadow_have_two_pink_eyes/,"This is by far my favorite subreddit and for the past few weeks (since I discovered it) I have been wracking my brain, knowing I must have gotten petty revenge on someone in my life at least once. Last night, I finally remembered. 

In college, I lived with two other girls. One, I had been friends with since preschool, we'll call her Annie; the other, she had been roommates freshman year with our other roommate, we'll call her Natasha. We all got along (and still do when we see each other), but living in close quarters with not a lot of money leads to tension. 

We were all pretty lazy, no neat freaks here, but we kept our stuff to ourselves. Natasha and I wouldn't eat Annie's Velveeta shells &amp; cheese, we wouldn't drink Natasha's Bud Light, and neither of them were to use my bathroom. We had two, but because the other girls took the larger bedrooms and mine was a glorified closet, I got my own bathroom. Totally fair. 

Of course, I never actually cared if they used it, just clean up after yourself, ya know? Well, my bathroom was directly across the hall from Annie's room, so she always did her business in there rather than walking the 5 feet to her own. She would shower in her own bathroom, but then get ready in mine. FOR AT LEAST 2 HOURS EVERY DAY. I didn't mind until the day I went to use my blow dryer and it just didn't work. I rarely dried my hair, but she did every damn day. I knew she broke it, but she just shrugged it off, like whatever. Fine. I bought a new one. Then I noticed that nearly all my super cool metallic eyeshadows were gone. I only used them when I had a fancy event (rare.)  There were more incidents: leaving laundry in washer, loud music late at night, never doing dishes, the usual bad roommate stuff. 

I truly never planned on revenge. I was very passive and would just complain to Natasha, and Natasha would complain to me. I had my dad's retirement party one weekend, so I used what was left of my metallic eyeshadow. Out of six colors, there were like 2 left. The entire day, my eye had been itching really bad. It got worse the more I itched it. It got really red and crusty. Whatever, I have to get ready for my dad's party. I put on my eyeshadow anyway and am out the door. 

Well, naturally, I had contracted conjunctivitus (pink eye to you laymen). My mom took one look at me and took me to the doctor. She gave me a gel to put on my eye and gave me instructions to disinfect everything in my apartment that I touched. Dutifully, I went back to school (both roommates still gone for the weekend) and proceeded to clean, clean, clean. 

By the time they got back Sunday night, I had gone to bed, so they knew nothing. Monday, I didn't have class until noon, but Annie had one early morning. Later that night I told them that I had pink eye, that I cleaned everything, that they should stay away from all my stuff in case I missed something. 

Annie wakes up the next morning with two crusted, barely opening, itchy eyes. Totally unintentional, but totally worth it. She got it way worse than I did. Natasha says to me, ""You know, she may finally stop using all your stuff, now.""

She supports our house of 3, which consists of her, my sister, and myself, by soaking up child support from my dad. My dad is a great man. He's a disabled veteran who is on dialysis and has multiple other health problems. He gives my mom more money than is required by the state (if the state handles child support) and he sometimes goes without to provide for me. Anyways, One day I'm about to begin my journey from my bus stop after I get out of school, and it starts raining. Fuck the phrase ""It's raining cats and dogs"" because it was raining hippos. Usually when it rains, my mom comes and picks me up from my bus stop because its quite a walk. Not this time. I'm stuck walking home, being pelted by sky water bullets, and my mind gives birth to an idea. The unplug ninja. Whenever my mom is lazy or just being an ass, I'll sneak into her room and unplug something. Her tv, her antenna, her phone charger. Anything that would inconvenience her for maybe a minute. It gets better though, because when something isn't going right for her (Ex: tv isn't loud enough, overhead light or fan needs to be turned off), she calls me into wherever she is to fix it. Not this time. I won't be there to save the day, and chances are it'll be an hour or two before she does it herself. On that fateful rainy day, the unplug ninja was born.

I was in a foul mood, my sister and I were organising it on our own and she had turned up 15mins before the guests were arriving and had not committed to any of the tasks she had offered to do, like putting together a slideshow of photos of dad. 

Things only got worse when we finally started to set up 10mins before the guests were to arrive. My sister had borrowed a friend's MacBook and of course the room we had booked with a projector at this pub didn't have the appropriate connection for a MacBook. 

So luckily there was a relatively big shopping centre around the corner so I power walked there to look for an adapter. Outside the shopping centre at the back are some basketball courts and a big ramp that shoppers can use to walk from the ground floor, up to the car park or food court inside. I walked under the bridge part of the ramp to access a single shop first on the exterior to the shopping centre. This is when I noticed a huge wad of spit fall a few inches away from my feet as I walked under the bridge. 

I quickly examined it, it wasn't bird shit, it wasn't raining at that time, and I was aware that I had just waltzed under a bridge encrusted with lowlife teenagers with nothing to do with their lives. Without looking up after having put two and two together, I swung around the base of the ramp and started walking up it. I saw the perpetrator, leaning over the bannister snickering to himself, my eyes grazed across the other teenagers and I saw that they were laughing too. As I passed this kid, I was so angry at the time from conflicting feelings of grief for the loss of my father, frustration at my sister's incompetence and now fury as a result of a dumb kid who had picked the wrong day to send a golly my way. 

I paused at this moment in time and let him go. I just kept walking, but I was still fuming. I stormed around the shopping centre looking for this adapter. Apple store was out, JB HIFI was out and Dick Smith. I finally gave up. I was exhausted and wanted to just cry my eyes out. As I exited the shopping centre down the ramp, it start to rain very lightly. The base of the ramp was approaching and I saw that the kid who was spitting on people, not just me, was still standing there.

But then as karma would have it, he moved from his spot because of the rain. He walked down the ramp and ended up walking his own path of death. I predetermined his walk path under the bridge just like all of his unfortunate victims, and quickly thought of something better than just spitting on this kids head from the bridge. I didn't have time to take a shit on him or find a bag of dicks for him to eat, but I do have the ability to give myself chronic nosebleeds whenever I require them as a result of an inflamed blood vessel at the back of my nose which several operations have failed to completely fix. 

So I tap the side of my nose firmly in the exact spot I know will make it gush blood. (I've been having nosebleeds my entire life so I know them better than I know my own menstrual cycle). So sure enough, my nose starts pissing blood and I close my mouth and tilt my head back, letting it well in the back of my throat. I swallow a huge gulp and lean over the bridge, timing it just right. The blood sure enough upsets my stomach and I projective vomit a small amount of bile, blood and spit all over this kid's head. 

The whole ordeal was down so subtlety that nearby shoppers rushed to my aid, thinking my innards were exploding in front of them. This allowed me to pretend ""blergh! I'm so sick from all that shopping or whatever!"" And the kid saw how many people where looking after me and didn't think to start shit. All his friends laughed at him, and the rain was so tepid and weak that the kid covered in bloody bile chunder and remained so until I left about 5mins later. 

I was late to the wake, but I got the help of all the onlooking civilians, the teenage spitting virgin (I assume) who was laughed at an ridiculed tenfold by his friends, I didn't get a drop of unsavoury liquid on my clothes, I was sweaty from the adrenaline but for the first time that day, I was ecstatic.

I hope the little fucker learned his lesson.

It's bad enough they literally have to pay me to do it. But I can get to it with gusto, or at least without crying most of the time. Most customers run the gamut from aloof but polite, to downright lovely.

This guy didn't.

So he comes up with a trolley just filled with fruit, like, more fruit than I had seen that day all put together. I have no idea what he wanted with all that fruit, but there it was. A lot of fruit. Fruit out the wazoo.

He starts unloading and I get to work putting the bananas on the scale, (they're weighted items that don't get scanned) and then placing them in the packing area. Then the guy gets all grumpy, ""Watch it! Don't drag them like that (rather gently if I do say so. No one has ever had a problem with my banana-handling technique before) or you'll bruise them! I didn't buy them to get bruised, now did I?"" and made a few more comments to that effect. 

""Oh, but you just *did* "" 

So I started squeezing his bananas when I placed them on the scale. Getting forefinger and thumb and just squeezing them. I imagined the bruises forming inside. The banana chemicals turning that lovely pale gold to a putrid brown. It was the closest I've ever come to orgasm without getting an erection, quite frankly.

The transaction finishes, he holds out a coupon for me to scan but jerks it away when I manoeuvre it to scan it with the handscanner. I expect he thought something like, ""Ha! The final blow is mine to give! Watch as I now walk away victorious, having just slapped you in the face! Hahahahahaha etc."" 

Yet now I imagine him at home, putting on his bizarre monkey porn, clipping on his tail and getting ready for a few hours of fun, only to find his bananas bruised. But not just bruised...oddly bruised...why, they're almost in the shape of fingers...

Then it hits him, and he shall sit there, weeping, erection fading, and he shall know that he has been wholly and utterly defeated.

That being said, he also did little things that pissed me off.

Whenever I was doing homework, I would ask him simple questions, like, ""How do you spell this?"" or ""What happens after this step in this math problem?"" Small questions that could easily be answered in one word. But his response, always, was, ""look it up.""

Although now I see the importance of learning to look things up, it still irritated the crap out of me when I was younger. 

So, years later, when I was 14 or whatever age people are in high school, he gets himself a laptop. My parents are technology-stupid, so they constantly ask me to do the simplest things.

""How do I get these pictures on my computer?"" ""How do you download music?"" ""How do I make it go faster?""

My response, every single time to this day?

[Here is the final part](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1412rc/the_coup_de_grace/)

_

My revenge against Jose having gone so well, I decided to try to come up with something else involving hot peppers to deal with the remaining issues. my groceries were safe and the toilet remained flushed but I wasn't done. 

_

Now, as a result of my love for all things kitchen-related I have a lot of kitchen equipment for a college student, including several sets of knives and pots and pans. I have junky stuff that I got for free or at yard sales that I use if I'm trying something for the first time and am worried about wrecking a pan or knife or something, and then nice stuff for everyday use. If you burn something onto the bottom of one of my junky pans I really don't care. Hell, if you burn something in a nice pan it's fine as long as you scrape the burnt stuff off. But Jose...well he just didn't get it. He'd grab whatever pan was handy, burn the crap out of something, then just leave it on the stove until he needed to use it again, at which point he'd add another layer of burnt crap to it until eventually I'd get fed up with it and clean/scrape it myself. This got old fast, and finally came to a head when he scratched up my favorite non-stick pan and put most of my nice cooking knives through the dishwasher. The handles survived but he bent the tips on a few of them and it took me the better part of an afternoon to repair them. I was, predictably, really pissed. I had been planning to stop after the hot sauce shot incident but the afternoon spent heating and flattening and sharpening my knives changed my mind. It was time for hot sauce.

While he was in class I went into the kitchen and got to work.

I took out every pot, pan, plate, bowl, mug, and glass that I had, and set them on the table. Using a paper towel I wiped the inside of each one with a little hot sauce and then left them to dry. With the crappy lighting in our kitchen and living room they didn't look any different, however if you put anything in them it would come out with quite a kick.  The residue was a little sticky though so for the outsides I cut open a leftover habanero pepper and rubbed it all over the places where Jose was likely to touch them. Outsides of glasses, pan handles, bottoms of plates, etc. I finished up by rubbing the pepper on the handles of all the cabinets and drawers, as well as the fridge handle.

_

For those of you who've never cooked with hot peppers before, my advice to you is to wear gloves while handling the peppers, and then throw the gloves out when you're done. The cut peppers will leave pepper juice on your hands, which will burn like a motherfucker if you have any cuts or scratches or if you rub your eye or nose, or if you touch your lips.



As a side note, I'm a mechanical engineering/premed student and Dan is Biology, so both of us had a near limitless supply of gloves we could wear while cooking if needed.

_

I was studying for a test at the time so I was home all evening to listen as Jose spent a good hour and a half screaming, cussing, groaning, shouting, and eventually whimpering his way around the kitchen trying to make himself something to eat for dinner. Eventually he gave up after finding that everything he touched would make the broken skin around his chewed fingernails burn. 

He went to the dining hall. 

When he came back his eyes were still red from being rubbed with his capsaicin-covered hands, and I noticed he'd bought two jugs of milk from the campus grocery on the way back. 

Oh no you don't. Know what happens when you add vinegar (or any other strong acid) to milk? It curdles very quickly. Know what has a lot of vinegar in it? Hot sauce motherfucker. 

While my original plan had been purely defensive, it quickly evolved into an all out war on Jose's groceries. Fresh produce? Dipped in hot sauce. Box of cereal? Bet that goes well with cayenne pepper. chicken breast? Rubbed with hot sauce then placed back in the package. Nothing was safe. This was culinary scorched earth.

He lasted a week, and then stopped keeping food in the apartment. My kitchen now safe, I cleaned off the various surfaces that I'd booby trapped and basked in the glory of my victory. Me: 3, Jose 0.

Stay tuned for my girlfriend's brilliant finale.

The backround:
Jack had just moved into a new apartment complex in a residential area on the edge of the downtown area. The complex had its own car park, but you needed a permit and the management company were slow as heck getting the permit to him and pretty unreliable in general. So for fear of getting clamped he parked elsewhere until the permit arrived. 
He chose the street just behind the complex - a small cul-de-sac with terraced houses. There were NO signs relating to parking on the street - which in this country means you can park anywhere you want, for as long as you want as long as you don't block a driveway or an entranceway and you are within 1.5 ft of the kerb. The people who lived on the street were parked on it, usually outside their house (no driveways for these houses) but occasionally not if that space was already taken. There was always plenty of space, it never filled up. Jack works odd shift hours and is liable to arrive and leave for work at any hour day or night depending on the rota that week. Also his wife had just had a baby.

The Cone Wars:
Jack would rotate where he parked due to availability of space. One day he came out to his car to find a note on it saying that he was parked in (house number) 56's space, and to please move and not park there again. He was in a hurry and tired and grumpy (new baby=no sleep), he glanced to double check the legality of what he was doing (it was still legal) scrunched up the note and went to work. He forgot about it. He parked somewhere else when he came home and for the next few days until he accidentally ended up outside number 56 again. This time he was getting into his car when a man stuck his head out window of the house and started yelling at him. Various insults, threats to call the police, have him clamped, towed, ticketed. Generally quite the overeaction - and all nonsense. There was no parking restrictions on this street. My friend, now more irked at this assault first thing in the morning - tried to explain that this space was not reserved and there was plenty of other space on the street if the man needed to park - not 20 ft away in fact. More yelling and threats. Jack told him impolitely where to stuff it and went to work. When he came home from work...he was looking for a space (any space) when he spots them - 2 traffic cones outside number 56 - one of which with a paper sign on it saying ""reserved for number 56"" or something along those lines. Jack could not resist. It was quite late at this point, maybe 2am or so - no one around. He pulled up, removed the 2 cones and parked in the space. For no particular reason, he decided to put the cones in his trunk and replace them in the morning. However in his sleep deprived panic to get to work the next day he forgot. He came home that night and...spots 2 traffic cones outside 56 again. Did he take them out in his sleep? No...still there in the trunk. Thus began a repeating pattern - my friend would take the cones to work and more would appear when he got home. He didn't always park outside number 56. So over about 2 weeks he took 6 cones, stashing them at work when his trunk got full. Each time replaced by more outside 56. Where the hell is 56 getting so many traffic cones?! It was around then he noticed the cone type / manufacturer mached some being used by a construction crew laying gas pipes on a nearby street.

So the next time he came home, he brought all the traffic cones he had taken back (quite a squash in the car) and added them to the 2 already on the street. He formed a nice square ouside 56 in the size of a car and hung up the reserved sign. He also added that striped red and yellow safety barrier tape he got at work. It looked ridiculous - the most reserved space that was ever reserved.

Then he called the local parking authority and said someone was blocking the parking on that road and waited. At the moment he saw them pull up he wandered down to the construction guys and told them he thinks he knows where all their missing cones are. The simultanious arrival of the construction guys and the parking guys made for a hillarious encounter. He never blocked the road again.

My little brother is probably one of the most kind and pure-hearted kid I know.  One of those people who would rather let a spider outside rather than end its life. I, on the other hand, am a cruel and unforgiving person (when it is needed). I'm 5 years older than my brother and was in high school at the time, so I would get home about 30 minutes before he would.

We lived within walking distance of our schools so everyday we walked rather than take my car (good exercise). One day my brother gets home with some unusual bruises on his forehead and arms.  After some poking and prodding he finally told me that some older shit heads follow him home on their bikes and punch him on occasion. This did not sit well with me. In fact my blood boils just recollecting this event.

Instead of letting my fury get the better of me and simply beating the spit out of them, I decided to formulate a plan. The next day, I waited for them a couple of blocks away from my house, envelope in my hand, until I finally saw them riding behind my little bro. I could already hear their little mouths spewing so much shit, their assholes must've been jealous. I approached them 

My brother sees me and stops, a look of worry and confusion on his face. I give him a quirky smile. I walk up to the ring leader and extend my hand with the envelope, drawing his attention away from his front tire. In my best douche-style voice I say ""Yo man I'm having a killer party this weekend. Here is the address and shit"". The look of awe and happiness that came over his face was priceless. (Being invited to a high school party was a big deal back then)

I guess I should mention that as he was accepting my party invite, all while telling me how pumped and excited he was, he failed to notice me nonchalantly jamming a small but solid piece of wood into his bike spokes.

He began to pedal, but is quickly upended. With a squeal of terror, his face met the ground with a sound I will remember until the day I die. He cried, lost a tooth, and did something nasty to his nose. His ""posse"" ran to his aid. I patted my brother on the head and asked him how his day at school was as we walked home.

Never had any problems after that... also the envelope contained a piece of paper that said ""fuck you"".

**TL;DR** Bullies harass and abuse my brother on his walks home from school, I sabotage one of their bikes and the asphalt sexually assaults his face.

During my college days I added to my cash flow by designing websites during my breaks between classes. I would look for companies that didn't have a website then would purchase a domain, build a website, then present it to them.

My deal was simple, the website is free as long as they host through me. I would retain ownership of the website design and domain name. 

More than a decade later and I still have several clients hosting their sites through me. One of these clients even credited me with helping them secure more than 50% of their sales since that is the percentage that was done oversea's because of the website. 

That same client retired a few years ago and sold his company. Within a few weeks of the new owner coming in I get a call from an IT contractor asking me to give him full control of the domain because he had built a new website. I explained that there was a contract to continue hosting through me and I would be happy to setup an account on my server for him to use for this new website.

That didn't go over very well. The next day I got a call from my client, the new owner of this company. He demanded I give this contractor (who happened to be his brother) control of the domain. I explained the contract and even emailed him a scanned copy of the signed original in case he didn't have a copy of his own. 

I didn't hear from him for a few weeks. I assumed he finally understood the arrangement and left it at that. Then bill due date goes by without receiving any money. I called several times unsuccessfully. I managed to speak to the accounting department who explained that the owner hasn't approved it yet.

I waited a couple more weeks then called, again unsuccessfully. This went on for just over three months before I showed up at the office unexpectedly and managed to catch the owner. After asking him what the deal was, he said he refused to pay me until I gave his brother ownership of the domain name. This wasn't even control anymore, it was ownership. 

I explained how the contract worked and how he was obligated to pay me. He said ""well take me to court"". I know full well he was assuming I would give in and let him have it. Fortunately his bully techniques didn't work on me.

I went home and redirected the domain from his mail servers to my own personal mail servers. I then put up a dummy website that had in big letters:

**Dear [Company] Customers,**

**Due to an impending lawsuit with [company name] this website and associated email addresses will no longer be available. [company name] is more than three months delinquent in their payments and have offered no assurance of being able or willing to pay.**

**For all of your product needs, please visit one of these other great websites to see their latest offers.**

Within a few hours I was called with a demand to remove the default page and return the site and email to its previous state. 

I offered them a solution: ""pay your damn bill!""

The owner drove to my house and paid me cash. A few weeks later I decided I didn't want to do business with these guys again and came up with a very large number for them to buy out their contract. They reluctantly accepted and paid. That money paid for a new car, a couple months in Italy, and a down payment on a new condo.

**TL;DR** Company tries to withhold payment so I took down their website and email. They eventually bought out the contract and afforded me a new car, a trip, and a downpayment on a condo.

The neighbor in the back, a crotchety old lady thought she could extend her land by a few feet. While he was away on a week-long fishing trip, she had a construction company erect a big cedar fence, about six feet high. 

This guy was no dummy, he knew exactly where his property line ended. When he arrived home and saw what she had done, his revenge was the stuff of legend. He was not the sort to write a strongly worded note or seek legal advice.

Without even unpacking, he grabbed an ax and went right to work. He was not a tall man, but he was quite strong. He didn't use any finesse on that fence, but splintered it to kindling and tossed every piece into the old woman's yard. 

The epic part is that he started at dusk just as a thunderstorm was moving in. Picture Danny out in the yard, shirt off and swinging that ax like a mad Celt, lit by flashes of lightening. I pictured him screaming curses the whole while, but a neighbor described the event as ""a human wood chipper.""

I have worked as labor for a well-known global company for six months. I am the junior member of the staff, so I have the duty of keeping the four restrooms clean. I clean them every day in the morning and occasionally other times if there is some sort of ""accident."" I have no problem with this. I'm grateful for my job and get paid a fair wage and I do my best *damn near* all the time for this company in whatever I do.

However, at least once a week, I get asked to speak to our boss about the females' staff restroom being unclean after I have serviced it. Usually this is because there is one- yes, singular, one- hair on the floor or because of reasons I cannot discern. I know it is a specific person. This has been pissing me the fuck off since I started. Even the boss shakes his head in disbelief when I show him the restroom before I return to clean it *for the second time*.

**The Revenge**

Two weeks ago was my last straw. I was tired of cleaning that fucking restroom twice.

I work with some pungent and corrosive chemicals everyday. Because of being exposed to them so much, I have built a tolerance of sorts. I went into the restroom, and sprayed **EVERYTHING AND EVERYWHERE** with bleach. I'm talking the floor, walls, counter tops,  assorted dispensers, the mirror, door, and the ceiling. It was such a strong smell, I could barely breathe- which is saying a lot with my tolerance.

No one could use that bathroom for at least a few hours without burning their lungs. I was confident I would win this battle because the only argument that the stupid bitch that reports me could bring to my boss would be that the restroom is now *too clean*. Which would make them look like a total asshole.

The best part is that it totally worked. I haven't gotten a complaint since! Fuck you, Carmen, you wench!


**TL;DR** Cunt makes me clean the restroom twice multiple times, made it impossible to use for awhile.

Yesterday we met up at the gym to work out after work. It's during peak hours so it's super packed everywhere.

I ended up going to a squat rack to do some squats and deadlifts while the husband was watching my form. Next to me is a lady doing some some sort of bicep curls and talking to another guy.

Honestly, she was kinda loud and obnoxious, but I just ignored it and did squats with the bar as warmups. Overhead snippets of her conversation with random gym dude about how ""squatting was her favorite exercise"" and how she ""would've squat better"".

Next thing, husband loaded on plates- first 25lbs, then 35 lbs, and finally I ended up squatting 150. I wasn't planning on going heavy today, but he is the personal trainer so I didn't question it. 

After my entire workout and leaving the gym, husband told me the reason I was going heavy today was because the lady next to me was saying ""a bunch of crap to the guy"" and ""being an attention whore"". 

""i got pissed off at the stuff she was saying, so I decided that you are going heavy today. Once I started racking on the weights, she just shut up. Didn't say a word after."" 

Usually I am the more vindictive type of person, and he never lets anything bother him, but I was rather glad I was an instrument of the husband's pettiness.

Never had I had such a golden opportunity for petty revenge, and I may never will again.  As she's walking up her driver's side (opposite from my car), I push the cart behind her SUV and quickly enter my car in one swift motion.  I start the engine, and wait...

My street was a crowded one because it was without parking restrictions and surrounded by office buildings so getting a spot during office hours was difficult to say the least.

One afternoon I returned home and was fortunate to catch someone pulling out of a spot so I parked on the street. We only had one spot and two cars so my wife and I took a street spot whenever we seen one. As I was walking from my car to my apartment I noticed this small rusty POS car attempting to parallel park a few spots behind me. The spot was way to small, but this guy looked determined. 

I was kind of fascinated he was even going to try and walked a little slower to watch. As he pulled in he rammed the car that was behind him, followed by ramming the car in front. He did this a few times to each until he was tightly fitted in the spot. Then he finished it off by pushing each car a few inches in either direction so they weren't technically touching him. 

For those of you who aren't familiar with touch parking, it is a practice common in Europe but not in Canada. In fact it is illegal here. 

When the guy exited his vehicle I suggested he leave a note to the two car owners whose car he just hit. He denied ever hitting them and ran off to his office. I left a note on both cars and received calls later that night. One explained their car was a POS and didn't care about the extra dent but thanked me anyway. The other sounded angry about the incident but that was the last I heard from them.

A few days later and I had a note on my car and the number looked familiar. I called it and it was the first person whose car I left a note on. They witnessed the same car doing the same thing to my car. I ran down and noticed my plastic bumper was scratched.

The next day I waited for the car to show up and ran outside when he did. I confronted the guy, but he denied it again. 

A couple of weeks went by and another note appeared on my wife's car window this time. Same person as before witnessed the same vehicle hit my wife's car. Again I waited and confronted him again. He denied it all again. The damage was very minor so we didn't think we needed to get the police involved.

Instead, we had a whole drawer of keys we no longer had a use for. Keys we've collected over years of moving from place to place. 

We knew the times this guy arrived for work and the times he left work so we parked down the road about 30 minutes before he was to leave work and walked up to his car and stuck a key in the locks on both sides and in the trunk. We then snapped them off so only a small chunk of the key was in the locks. Enough to stop him from fitting his keys in.

We then went back to our car and waited. He came out and tried his driver side first. Looking confused he tried his passenger side, then his trunk (not sure why, but glad we got it as well). Then he looked closer and seen the problem. He threw one of the best hissy fits I've seen an adult do. He threw his keys to the ground and literally jumped in frustration the same way a child would. He then walked back to his office. His car was there the entire weekend and on the Monday my wife seen him getting the door jimmied open. 

That was the last time he ever parked on that street. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_15mj2f,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/15mj2f/perfect_use_for_random_keys/,

The job was straightforward. If you brought in a Mercedes for service, I'd give you a Mercedes loaner car. If you were a VIP bringing in a Carrera GT or a 911 turbo, I'd give you a Panamera to cruise around in. Everybody I helped expected professional service, but I had no problem doing so because almost every one of our regulars were very nice.

However, we had a few customers that were either rude or treated the Mercedes loaners like shit. You could tell who the worst offenders were because they always bought pre-owned Mercedes from us, and the cars were absolutely filthy every time they were brought in for service. Since the customers treated their own Mercedes like shit, they didn't hesitate to treat a loaner Mercedes like shit. Dog hair, dog puke, a kid's attempt to turn the roof into the Sistine Chapel with a colored marker, scratched bumpers... the list goes on.

We'd make them pay for detailing or repairs if the car returned in poor condition, but the people are too much of a liability to keep giving them a Mercedes. I had a car waiting for them the next time the came in for a service: the Honda Accord. I don't have any problems with Hondas, but I'm not about to let you treat one of my Mercedes like shit. We go to extra lengths to keep the Mercedes sparkling clean and dent/scratch-free for our customers. If you treat the car like shit, I'm going to give you a dented/scratched up Honda to drive around town in.

There is no greater pleasure than forcing an entitled asshole to move his ass from a German car with seats made of leather that came from some endangered animal... to plopping into a Japanese car with hard, plain-cloth seats. Of course the customers would ask why they have a Honda this time and not a Mercedes. My go-to response was that we're very busy and all our Mercedes loaners are out. They were pissed, but there was nothing they could do about it. If they didn't want the car, I had a driver on call who can chauffer them around town in... a Honda Accord.

We never explicitly told them that they're blacklisted from Mercedes loaners for life, but this one lady in particular didn't take the hint. She always came in with this filthy Mercedes with wrappers, fast-food cups, animal hair all over the place. I started ""running out of Mercedes loaners"" when she brought back a loaner in horrible condition. She thought that we mysteriously ran out of Mercedes loaner cars due to my incompetence. This infuriated her. She would always ask if there were any extra Mercedes that she could drive, but my answer was always that we ran out of them. Bitch-mode engage.

She never got a Mercedes loaner car anymore, so she got the manager involved the next time she came in for a service. I got a page from my manger that she DEMANDED a Mercedes over the phone. My manager wasn't a moron, though. He saw how horribly she treats her car and the loaner car. He promised her a Mercedes over the phone, but after hanging up, told me to give her a Honda Accord. Not 5 minutes later, I get a call at my desk. It was HER. She told me that she was coming in that day and that the manager promised her a Mercedes since I was never able to give her one. I said ok and let her think she was getting one.

One hour later, she pulls in with her filthy Mercedes. She walks up to my counter with the biggest shit-eating grin, thinking she was getting a Mercedes. ""I'm here for the Mercedes loaner car that I reserved,"" she said, smiling through her teeth the whole time. I tell her to wait at her car so that I can bring the loaner car around side to her. I could still see her grinning though the corner of my eye as I went to grab a Honda for her. Her smile disappeared as I pulled around and gave her the keys to the Honda.

He would straddle two parking spots in our garage every single day.  Not crappy out of the way spots where nobody would care but the good spots that everyone wanted if they were available.  The car would move daily and always come back to taking up two of the good spots.

After a week or two of this I suspect security or something got a hold of him and said something about parking like a douche.  After that, instead of being smack in the middle of the line he would just be slightly over the left line so it would be really tight to squeeze in.

I talked to a few neighbors about this dude and everyone saw it and felt the same way.  He really was as obnoxious as I thought.  One night I get home and see my opportunity.  The guy parked next to a cement wall and the spot to his left was just big enough that I could squeeze my car in.  I had to fold in my passenger side mirror to make it.  I slide in and the guy has about six inches of space to open his door, no way is he going to get in.  He might be able to squeeze in the passenger side and climb over but not if he's a fat dude, the wall will block that door too.

I had always wanted to contribute, but had no good story to tell...until I witnessed this.

I played the role of an innocent bystander in this whole fun time, and it was funny (and petty) to watch.

So, I was at my local gas station, refueling my vehicle as was customary of a functioning member of society. As a necessary introductory detail, this station was located at a street corner, with an entrance on either side of the physical corner.

As I'm fueling up my vehicle, a woman drives up through one entrance and takes a nearby pump. She gets out of her car and starts setting her car up to be refueled. While this lady was getting ready to pump gas, this slightly older man drives up in his BMW.

He uses the same entrance that this lady had, which is extremely close to the pump currently in use by this lady. Feeling the need to not drive to any other pump, he starts a honking frenzy while making shooing gestures at this woman as if she were an animal. To make matters worse, based on the layout of the gas station in relation to the street, he was not only being a douche in the gas station, but he was blocking one whole lane of a major street.

Not wanting to prolong this fiasco or start a new scene, the lady cancels her credit transaction and drives her car up to the next pump. Thinking he has won, our ""fine gentleman"" proceeds to begin his transaction.

At about this time, my refueling has been completed and as I'm preparing to leave, I catch a bit of activity in the gas station convenience shop. The employee inside walks over to a panel, and lifts it to reveal a number of switches. After a quick check at the scene of the offense, the employee flips a single switch off.

Lo and behold, our ""fine gentleman""'s precious pump is no longer receiving a supply of fuel. After a few expletives, he is forced to get in his car and make the drive of shame to a pump on the other side of the station. 

As I'm leaving, I hit the employee with a thumbs-up and continue on my merry way, knowing that justice had been served.

I try to explain to her why we don't leave our toothbrushes out: poopie water from toilet getting on it, germs from everyone else using the bathroom, it's in the way, etc...for weeks we go back and forth about her refusal to open the cabinet and put her own damn toothbrush in there!

Finally I am fed up and tell her, ""If I find your toothbrush on the sink one more time I am going to scrub my butt with it."" She gives me an incredulous look. ""I mean it"", I say.

I walk her to the bus stop, come back up to the house, yep, her toothbrush is laying IN the sink. 

""Oooh! You little shit, I'll show you!""

Bring in the Hershey's Chocolate Syrup and proceed to coat the bristles, not too much but just enough.

I wish I had a picture of the look on her face when she found her toothbrush. Classic! It was all I could do to keep from laughing my ass off. (Cause that just would have been mean.) 

She never left her toothbrush out again. She's an adult now and I only just recently told her that it was actually Chocolate. She mock hit me in the arm and then we cracked up. 

TL:DR My kid refuses to put her tooth brush away, I make her believe I scrubbed my butt with it.

Nothing big, just a few friends and a few drinks. Well, one of my friends, let's call him ""C"", came over. He's a great dude, but he is a raging alcoholic and gets a bit more than wasted at any gathering we have. He also is known to drive drunk home even though he almost killed himself on his 21st birthday doing so.

 So as soon as he gets to my house, which me and my best friend literally have only been living at for no more than 3 weeks, I take his keys and hide them. Which he is surprisingly good natured about and even makes a few jokes.

Fast forward to about midnight. We've all had a few at this point and as usual, C is hammered. But we all are and everything is going smoothly. So I decide to head to bed because I had work early and was exhausted. Fast forward again to about 5am. Another friend of mine comes into my room and tells me C has just invited (unbeknownst to anyone else at all) a few of his friends and they're all in the back yard, totally wasted and loudly carrying on. 

I go out back and politely tell C that his friends have to go and he needs to come inside. Which again, he seems that he was totally fine with. So I head back to bed. 

This morning I wake up and find that two whole rolls of toilet paper had been put into the toilet and half-flushed. now I am pissed off at this point, and I feel justifiably so. So I go around bluntly asking all my friends that had stayed over if they had clogged my toilet, they all said no. Then I get to C. I ask him and he says (still wasted and half awake) ""Yeah I did. You need to stop acting like my fucking dad and let me have fun.""

Pissed goes to rage instantly. I stand there for a second, then walk away. On my way out the housework, I remember I still have his keys hidden. So i grab them and walk out the door. He has work today at 4. Which is when I get off at my job.

Bitchlady says she can't move all her stuff down to her new apartment and she needs to store it at our place for a week. Okay. Fine.

I pass the message on and he decides to do it if only to get her out of his hair sooner.

In the time that we're living together, I learn that crazy lady *hates* the smell of vanilla. It literally makes her vomit. I take a couple of bottles of vanilla scented oil and a bottle of vanilla body spray and make sure to really rub a shitload of it/spray it into all her wood furniture (it was dry as hell, so it really soaked in), and any other possessions she had stored at our place.

Good luck finding all your stuff.,341,54,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1frisq/steal_someones_prized_possession_good_luck/,"It's important to note that we're all still best friends and hang out regularly to this day (10 years later) despite being hours apart in different cities.

In high school my friend group was about 8 people large. We were all smart, popular, some nerdy, some athletic, some fat, a balanced group. One guy in our group (Jonny) was really smart, and liked to let you know. But, in a way that was condescending. We would always tell him to shut the fuck up.

Jonny had the bright idea one day to steal another's prized possession, a signed Hulk Hogan poster. He didn't just steal it, he hid it and boasted we would never find it.  After years of his smug, my intellect is better than though attitude, the theft was the catalyst for what transpired.

The 7 of us got together one day while Jonny was out of town. We went to his his parental-guardians house where we was staying (his parents had moved away but he wanted to stay to finish high-school). Like most foster parents that I assume don't give a shit, his were no different. We told them we were there to grab something from Jonny's room and that we'd use the back entrance, as to be quiet. They didn't care.

With access to his room, we proceeded to load up all his stuff into our cars. Clothes, bedding, guitars, TV, gaming system and games, DVD's, CD's, laptop, desktop computer, computer chair, posters, blinds, and rug. We stole everything and Hulk Hogan was still unaccounted for. We took all his items and distributed them to a large number of people from our high-school for safe keeping.

When he returned to find his living space completely stripped, he actually found the humor in it. What he didn't find funny was all the riddles he would have to solve in order to get his stuff back.

But of course he couldn't receive the riddles before apologizing and returning Hulk Hogan to his rightful owner.

PS: As I was writing this I chatted with my friend who owned the poster. He said, ""I never cared about the poster, I just wanted to fuck with Jonny, and so did everyone too"".

**Some backstory** I had been up until 4am on Friday morning following the scanner feeds and updates regarding the chase for the Boston marathon bombers, so I didn't have time to make myself lunch and decided to order pizza. I ended up ordering from a local place my bosses buy from quite a lot (sometimes buying 20 boxes for the whole staff), that is about a quarter of a mile away. They deliver to our building quite often, and there's free parking for loading/unloading and deliveries (plus an alleyway right next to the building). There's a parking garage across the street, but unless you have a pass you better be rolling in money because it's $5 just to enter and exit during the first 15 minutes, $20 after that.

**What happened** So I order my pizza around 1pm, they give me a delivery time of around 2:05. Perfect! My lunch is at 2 (only 30 minutes, or I would have walked there) so there was plenty time for the delivery to be a little late. Still just in case, on delivery instructions I had written (and this is word for word): *cross streets: main and 9th, the entrance is on 9th st, if I'm not already waiting please send text to 555-555-5555*.

So it's 1:45, and my phone goes off - it's the pizza. Earlier than I expected but I get permission from my boss to go down to get it. Instead the girl had already taken the elevator to the 8th floor...even though the receipt say's 3rd. I'm on the phone with her and we arrange to meet back on the 3rd floor. I pay for my pie ($20.40, with $6 tip! [ I tend to be a generous tipper]) and go back to my desk. 

A couple minutes later my boss comes up to me, says the pizza girl is back. The moment I exit the door she starts accusing me of sending her to the wrong place to park. She had ended up parking on the parking garage across the street, and is now being asked to pay the $5 fee. Firstly I'm confused, as I don't recall giving any parking instructions. So I get my receipt and show her it doesn't say that, but I understood her situation (she has deliveries after all, and they don't make much) so I'm willing to pay, but I'll be asking her employer for compensation. This doesn't sit well with her. Fortunately my boss comes up and says he can get the front doorman to stamp her ticket so she doesn't have to pay, and I go back to my desk to let the boss take care of it. 

My boss approaches me again, says I owe him a slice (he only took half, lol) and explains that the girl got impatient, stormed off and yelled that they were never delivering at our building again. I assured him that I'll call her place of work and take care of it.

**The Revenge** Really, that she lost a big chunk of the tip I gave her should have been revenge enough, but the behavior she exhibited to my boss needed to be addressed. So, knowing that she would still be out on delivery,I called her place of work, and requested to talk to her boss. But instead of being a nasty bitch that she and the boss can later laugh at, I was *super nice*. Really, my boss was looking at me oddly because he didn't see where I was going with this. But by being super nice, and *concerned* that she had to spend out of her own pocket, I won her manager over, who apologized profusely (more than she needed to I think), assured that they regard us as great clients, and emphasized that they deliver quite often so of course they know of the free parking areas, and that she'll talk to the delivery girl regarding making statements on behalf of the whole company.

So my daily commute is about an hour one way.  Very rural area.  First part of the drive is a two lane road divided by guardrails (because too many tourists caused accidents trying to pass without looking) so one lane each direction.  Usually I'm going in very early so there's little to no traffic, but this month I'm going in later.  And at least three times since last week I've ended up on the road the same time as a guy I'll call Asshole Bully driving a big pickup truck.  He rides up on the bumper of whoever is in front of him, blowing the horn, flashing his lights, weaving back and forth.  I've seen multiple cars pull onto the shoulder to let him go by.  And seen him drive onto the shoulder to pass.

Twice he's ended up behind me.  Now I usually run about 10 miles over the limit.  But that clearly wasn't fast enough for Asshole Bully and he's punching the steeringwheel, laying on the horn, flashing the lights, all right on my ass.  I just kept it steady until we reached the major highway and he floored it.

But today I'd had enough.  He managed to get two cars to pull over to let him pass with his aggressive actions.  So when he got behind me, I deliberately slowed down to the speed limit and moved over slightly so he couldn't pass me on the shoulder.  And he is losing it behind me.  Looks like he's screaming as he goes through his usual theatrics.  

I pull my phone (I'll say here, do not text/talk and drive, it's dangerous) and called the county sheriff.  Talked to a dispatcher I kind of know and told him the situation, aggressive dangerous driver.  I gave him a description of the truck, what I could see of the driver, and yes the tag number.  It's a vanity plate so easy to catch.

We reach the highway and he guns it to come up next to me, flipping me the finger and yelling something at me.  I just smiled and waved as the blue lights came up behind him.  I slowed up and backed off as he tried to run.  But a State Trooper came out of a side street and blocked him.  By the time I came up to them, they had the driver out at gunpoint with additional cops coming on scene.

The reason for all the attention?  It turns out that when I gave them the tag, they found it belonged to a guy wanted on multiple warrants around the area.  Added to the attempting to flee charges, I shouldn't have to worry about him on the road for awhile.  

Lesson one, it's not a good idea to piss off the woman in the SUV by driving like an asshole bully, she works with cops and will call them in a heartbeat.  (Yeah should have done it the first day.  No excuses.  When I called in for the details on the arrest, I did get reprimanded slightly for not reporting sooner and found out they'd received a few calls from people who waited hours to report it and couldn't give any description of the truck/driver.)

Lesson two, you shouldn't do it when you are (A) wanted by the cops and (B) driving an easily identifiable truck with a vanity plate.

So asshole, who's *DA BOSS* now?????

It was her memories of her grandma and her mom, and all the home cooked meals she had with them. But later after this story, she got cancer. And it's not too good to exact more revenge on someone dealing with this. But her awfulness took its toll. Not a lot of people came out to help her. And that sucks. Be good to people, and when you must deal with hardship, your love will be returned to you through the help of others! She's better now, but going through that alone was the seeds she sowed and reaped unfortunately :(


•So this story takes place when I was about 8 years old. I was in Girl Scouts, a group of young girls with a group leader or two, and we would try to plan camping trips and hiking and horseback riding and all that cool outdoors stuff. However, I had a group leader who was one if the laziest people I've ever met. She was about 45 years old. She would ""plan"" for us to go in all these cool camping trips, and never follow through. She would get us all excited to go horseback riding, and then cancel. I don't think we did 99% of the stuff we spent hours planning. I'll name her ""Ferret"" because she had two ferrets she would let crawl under her shirt and she would lift it up and show the ferret nestling under her bra in her, ahem, *ample* breasts. It was MESSED UP.


So anyway, Ferret decided she would do one ""camping"" trip. In her backyard. In the rain. With her crappy tents. I was shivering most of the time. It was awful because basically we sat in the backyard doing nothing but play with sticks and talk. We were cold and wet, and she refused to let us inside unless we had to go to the bathroom because we were ""camping for real"".


 So I went to the far side of the backyard to play on my own. I picked up a leaf and pretended it was an airplane. Yeah, I was eight, and imaginative. So this maple leaf became a jet and I was spinning and twirling and having a great time. Ah, those were the days full of such simple pleasures.


As I was spinning, it seemed that Ferrets' dog, a very large black lab, took an interest in what I was doing. Ferret must have been lazy in training the dog too, because it was VERY aggressive. It ran over to me at full speed and just CLAMPED down on my arm holding the leaf. I screamed in pain and freaked out as this dog started to shake its head to rip at my arm. I kept spinning to try to shake it off my arm. Ferret runs over to me the instant she sees this happening and wrestles the dog from my arm. 


I hold onto my arm, so grateful she caught the dog before too much damage was done. Only a few tiny bruises would form. Shaking, I wiped the tears from my eyes and looked at her. I started to thank her profusely for saving me. She interrupted me to grab my shirt and hold my face close to hers. In a low and threatening tone she said ""I saw what you did. You were taunting my dog to get it to bite you. Don't you EVER go near my dog again, or so help me you will regret it for the rest of your life. If you were my own kid I would spank you so hard and ground you for months. You are a horrible child."" And with that, she stormed away with the dog. I ran to my tent and silently cried my eyes out. I didn't understand what just happened. Now, I can love dogs. I really can. But if you can't control your dog, and it attacks kids, YOU SHOULDN'T OWN ONE. 


So fast forward a few hours to dinner time. Ferret had a very very large cast iron cooking pot. I don't know if pot it the correct word because it was huge. It was used for cooking large amounts of food for large amounts of people. It was Ferrets prized cooking pot. If you don't know about cast iron cookware, you spend a long time seasoning them. You cook in them again and again, scour it with salt to get food off, and then cook again. The oils and flavors build up in it over the years, and it can make food taste AMAZING. No joke, you should get one and season it if you don't already have one. Great investment. Ferrets pot had been seasoned for decades because it was passed down from her grandmother to her mother to her. The food tasted really amazing because of the seasoning on the pot.


Ferret however tasked me with cleanup duties, and I was stuck with half of the dishes and the cooking utensils and the cast iron pot. The way you clean a cast iron pot is you scour it with salt, and maybe use a little water. But you can't use soap because it rubs all of that seasoning off and years of hard work go down the drain. Literally. But this pot was caked with food. It was impossible to scrape off. She said to me ""clean this and don't use soap at all!"" So the most difficult cleaning job I have ever done started. She tasked me with this because she knew it was incredibly difficult, and she wanted to punish me for the dog incident.


I was given a small, shallow bucket of water and a lot of salt. I was sitting on the backyard lawn, in the freezing damp grass that was soaking my legs, trying to clean this behemoth of a pot. The light on the porch was low, I was mainly cleaning in moonlight. I was shivering and my arms were shaking from fatigue because it was so hard to lift. The rest of the girls sat on the porch around a small metal stand that could hold a camp fire. And they were under a cover, too. One girl asked Ferret if I needed help and Ferret said ""no, meow_mix8 is fine"". I wasn't allowed dessert until I finished cleaning.


About an hour and a half into cleaning (no joke, people. It took that long!!) I was ready to give up. I had seasoned the pot with my tears of defeat. I looked longingly up at the porch and my eyes met Ferrets eyes. She did it. She gave me that shit eating smirk that makes you want to punch her in the mouth. She turned to the other girls and INVITED THEM INSIDE for TEA and MORE DESSERT.


""JIMMIES SET TO MAXIMUM RUSTLE. JIMMIES WARP DRIVE: ENGAGE.""

""But cap'n, the jimmies can't rustle any higher! I'm givin' her all she's got!""

""Damnit Jim, I'm a doctor not a Jimmie calmer!""


That was it. Time for some sweet and petty revenge. As she went inside, I was left all alone in the cold damp backyard, in the dark. And this food was not coming off the pot. And I know you all see this revenge coming from a mile away, but I'll tell it anyways. I took the garden hose and filled up my washing bucket to the brim, and hefted the pot inside. I then took the bottle of Dawn soap and poured in about two thirds of the bottle. Which is a ridiculous amount, but the pot was big and I was so angry. I took an S.O.S. pad and went about my malicious work. I scrubbed down every part of that pot and I know every trace of that seasoning was washed away. I scrubbed and soaked and scrubbed some more. I then took it out of the water, for a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes washing the pot. But I was proud of my work, and I had full knowledge of what I had just done because my mom had told me how cast iron pots get their important seasoning. I dried it off and poured the wash bucket out into the flower bed to hide my evidence.


Ferret came out and looked over to where I was. I was walking towards her with a clean pot, and a smug smile in my face. She was genuinely surprised to see I finished without giving up. That's right lady, you can't break me. She told me it was too late for some dessert and that it was bed time. Freezing cold and wet, I crawled into my tent and shivered myself to sleep in my sleeping bag, laughing silently about how I washed away decades of work.


The next day was uneventful. We got to go home, thank goodness. But the next time we had a Girl Scout meeting, I could tell Ferret knew what I had done. She was so angry around me she couldn't even look at me. She didn't want to talk to me and lashed out when she had to. But it was worth it. She was so angry her prized heirloom pot was ruined.  But she couldn't tell my parents because they would be livid if they knew she forced me to clean it. Check mate, weird ferret lady. Don't mess with the person in charge of taking care of one of your favorite items. It's not the smartest thing to do.


TL;DR Girl Scout leader's dog attacks me, she says I was ""provoking it"", puts me in charge of cleaning her prized cast iron pot, and I ruin the crap out of it.

1352872670.0,285,self.pettyrevenge,13636b,Revenge over eviction notice.,358,73,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/13636b/revenge_over_eviction_notice/,"This is the only other time I've had a great sense of revenge. The first story is also on the sub-reddit as 'one year of revenge'. 

This takes place about 4 months after getting revenge in the dorms. I moved into a house with two other girls because they got rid of their terrible roommate and needed a third. They told me about how awful she was, and it turned out I had lived in the same floor with her in my first year and the only thing I could really remember about her was that she liked upsetting her Catholic grandmother by saying she was a witch or some other nonsense.

Fruit names worked well before, and here we go:

* Lime- She was rarely home, she had gotten a new boyfriend and they were attached at the hip.
* Kiwi- One of the most helpless people I have ever met. For this story, she didn't do much aside from cry.
* Durian- The girl who had been kicked out and caused problems!

I came home from school and found an eviction notice taped to the door. I assumed it had been a mistake, since we were all playing rent and I went upstairs to find Lime and Kiwi and figured out what had happened. They were both in Lime's room, crying because they had called the landlord and turns out, Durian owed a fair deal of money while she lived there and when she left, she left us with the debt. Landlord obviously wanted his money and so the notice was pinned up.

I was still enjoying my new confidence and decided that I would fix things... somehow. First, I got Lime to call Durian so we could work this out, I has assumed this was a mistake. I was wrong. Durian dropped out of university and had gotten fired from KFC for having an affair with her manager. Lime couldn't find her because her and her KFC boyfriend were couch hopping and I think she had her cell changed, or she just refused to answer Lime. Then, I told Lime to call Durian's parents and see if they could help us and they said that there was no way their PERFECT daughter would do such a thing and if we needed to find her, we could find her ourselves.

I got mad. What kind of person knowingly screws three people over? 

I got Lime to call the landlord, but first I told her to start crying again. I thought that maybe, if the landlord heard this story, maybe it would soften things a little and give us some time. Plus, sad story + crying= maximum sympathy. It worked, landlord gave us some more time.

Kiwi was still crying, but her boyfriend had come over because he wanted to comfort her and I had a brilliant idea. I wrote a short message saying that she owed us money, we could not find her and we were going to be homeless unless we could find her and get things worked out.

That message was sent to everyone on our Facebook friends list. Mine, boyfriend's, Kiwi's and Lime's and since I lived with Durian the first year of school, I had a lot of old dorm-mates that were still on the list. Things got funny when I learned that Durian had dated the now boyfriend of Kiwi. He had a lot of mutual friends with Durian so this worked very well.

Within half an hour, Durian's aunt phoned the boyfriend SCREAMING that this was slander and libel and lies and that she would take him to court unless he took down the messages. I told him to tell the aunt that the messages would be removed as soon as Durian contacted us and settled this situation. That and I was confident that even IF she tried anything legally, it wouldn't work because no one was lying or embellishing.

By the time evening rolled around, Durian frantically called Lime, saying we had 'ruined' her life. Her family was furious at her, not because she owed the money, but because various cousins had seen comments on FB saying ""I can't believe you would do something so awful"" and these family members were calling her mother and father and asking questions. Plus, our old dorm mates had all dropped her from their lists and her friends were calling her, asking what had she done?

I coached Lime to not sound angry, just be calm and make plans to visit the landlord tomorrow and meet up and figure out this mess. After that, I told Lime that tomorrow, first thing in the morning, she would go to the apartment where Durian and her KFC boyfriend were crashing and take her to the landlord. Never letting her out of her sight and taking a cab to the landlord's place so that she couldn't try and run away. This worked, and despite being very unhappy and angry, Durian went to the landlord and admitted that she alone owed the money, she no longer lived at that residence and she signed a document stating she would reimburse the landlord.

I drafted another message for Kiwi's boyfriend to put on Facebook, saying thank you for any assistance provided. We were not longer being evicted and Durian had 'done the right thing'.

When everything settled, my roommates thanked me and the boyfriend was so amused by the way I kept calm and controlled things, I was given a cake with the words ""Thank You Winston Churchill"" written on it. Apparently my calm and take charge nature was very Winston-esque.

I don't know what happened to Durian, and I don't particularly care. I was exhausted after that day of 'battle' and although I am very proud of how I conducted myself that day, holy fuck was it every stressful.

Oh, and Kiwi's boyfriend had to change his phone number because despite the message on FB stating that everything was cool, Durian's aunt kept calling him at al times of the day and night and just screaming threats and obscenities so he got a new phone.

The incident actually improved my life in some ways:

* My confidence was even higher and I had the satisfaction of 'winning'
* CAKE
* People called me 'Winston'
* When I think back on this event, I feel like the most badass lady ever.

TL;DR- I orchestrated the greatest revenge of my life and was rewarded with a badass nickname and cake for my efforts.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,False,,,True,t3_13636b,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/13636b/revenge_over_eviction_notice/,

When I was in kindergarten, there was this girl who was as bitchy as a 4/5 year old can be. Lets call her T. She would wear sloppy lipgloss, talk in story time, and tease any girl who wore any colour besides pink or purple - god forbid you ever wore blue. Luckily, our class was fairly large, so my friends and I could avoid her most of the time. 

One day T was even worse than normal. In ""outside playtime"" a few of us were running in circles on the monster truck tyre that laid flat on its side, and T decided to just push me off of it for no reason. It didn't hurt, but there was plenty of room for her to join us, and she didn't even say sorry. I even said ""T, that wasn't nice and I didn't like it"" as we were taught to, and she still didn't apologize. It wasn't nice and I didn't like it. 

That same day, in ""inside playtime"" my friend and I were sat at a table with her to do craft. There was just a bucket in the middle full of ribbons, glitter, buttons, etc. that we could use, and it was basically first come first served for anything you found. This time, my friend found a massive, fake, purple jewel right at the very bottom of the bucket. We all ooh-ed and ahh-ed because as far as our little minds were concerned, there had never been a discovery this significant made in all of history. Because of this, my friend saved it for the very last thing to glue on so she could get it absolutely perfect. However, before she could, she had to go to the bathroom, and we were bathroom buddies so I went with her. Low and behold, when we got back the jewel was nowhere to be found, and T had a massive shit-eating grin on her face. 

We asked her where it went, and she said she didn't have it and told my friend (who was now crying) she should take better care of her things. T couldn't even **use** the jewel now because then we would know she stole it, but she still kept it as a memento like a serial killer or something. 

This friend was the kindest person I knew (she would always play the mum in dress ups) and I needed to get T back for being mean to her. We couldn't hit, and I didn't want the pending crime to get me sent to time out, so I was stumped until ""quiet learning time"" where again, I was placed at a table with her. This time was for puzzles, reading or writing, and today T and I were practicing the alphabet. 

I was a pretty smart kid, I could read at age 4 and knew the alphabet by 5, so people always asked me for help when the teacher was busy. Today, T forgot which way an ""e"" went and as luck would have it, I was the only one who could help. This gave me the opportunity I needed. 

I taught her to write it backwards, and told her to copy it out 10 times so she wouldn't forget. After that, I convinced her that she had ""b"" and ""d"" switched around, the tail on the ""g"" actually went the other way, and that ""v"" was the round one not ""u"". 

Bitch believed me and stubbornly wrote that way for months, even after others tried to correct her. 

TL;DR: bitchy kindergartner pushed me off a tyre, didn't apologize, stole my friend's fake jewel, and lied about it, so I taught her to write a few letters wrong. ",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1373467263.0,,,True,t3_1i0c7m,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1i0c7m/a_kindergarteners_revenge/,

I'd get up in the morning, put in a full day working on armored vehicles in the hot sun, and finish exhausted at around 21:00. 

There were only two redeeming things in my service: one was the fact that I worked with the greatest guys in the armored corps, and the second was the shower I would take at the end of the day.

This shower was a sacred ritual for the field technicians. It was the last few minutes of the day where you'd have a few precious minutes to yourself; where you washed away all the grime, grease, sweat, and dust, and tried to get the knots and aches out of our sore muscles. The water was plentiful and hot, the pressure was great, and sometimes that shower was the only good thing about my day.

One time, after a particularly brutal and long workday, I get into the shower at around 23:00. I was pissed because we were kept out so late, and just wanted to shower and go straight to bed. But one of the other guys in the platoon, a computer tech, had other plans for me. As I was showering, he turned a hose on me and blasted me with freezing water for a good minute. I yelled at him to stop before I murdered him, but he wouldn't listen! So I started chasing him while ass-naked, and the commotion drew out people from the barracks. I slipped and fell on my ass, everyone saw this and laughed, and this fucker seemed pleased as a pig in shit. An officer told us to pack it in, so everyone left and I had to finish up while fuming at this guy. My shower was ruined, and this disrespectful deskjockey had to pay.  

So I bided my time. I waited six months for winter, when we had field exercises and buttmunch had to leave the cozy confines of his office and join us out in the mud. The exercise was horrible. It was freezing and rained nonstop. I had no problem with it since this was my day-to-day, but assbreath was suffering tremendously. On the third day, he was near collapse and went to shower late at night. 
Then I knew I had him.

I filled a 20 liter cooler to the brim with ice cubes and water, and waited till he was well into his shower. Since the shower was filled with steam, I could tell he was having a good time. I called everyone to come and watch. I hoisted the cooler, walked in silently, and POURED THE WHOLE THING ONTO HIS HEAD. For a second, he looked around confused, then let out a huge, mooselike bawl that told the world of his despair better than any words ever could.

It was truly glorious. The satisfaction I felt was magnificent. The whole thing was captured on video, and I told him that thus shall be done to him that ruins the showers of other men.

Here, I'll help you take that exit you're trying to avoid.",324,40,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1alf6v/violate_traffic_etiquette_nope_here_ill_help_you/,"As background, I live in Houston where traffic has its special rules.  Leave early or leave late to avoid traffic, drive aggressively but not like a total dick, try to avoid trading paint every day, and let traffic gracefully merge to avoid causing disruptions that inevitably turn into traffic jams.

The exit to my work is from a major highway (US59).  The exit has an exit-only lane, so the highway temporarily goes from five lanes to six, with the sixth being an exit-only lane (at the Chimney Rock exit, if anyone wants to know).  That sixth lane, however, is fed from a tollway (and not a surface street) so it's generally pretty full.  Generally speaking, the cars from the fifth lane and sixth lane want to switch places, as people from the highway want to take the exit and people from the tollway want to get on the highway.  Thus, people make room to let the cars in the two lanes switch places, thus staggering themselves to make this process go faster.

Not today.

When I approached my exit the front of my car in the fifth lane was about halfway along a blue car in the sixth lane.  I was signaling to get to the sixth lane and the blue car was signaling to get in the fifth lane.  No problem!  I slowed to allow the blue car to get over in front of me and I was about to move over into the sixth lane until Driver Douchebag, who had been behind the blue car in the sixth lane, sped up to get in front of me and ALSO move over to the fifth lane.

NOOOOOPE and FUCK YOU!

I pushed the four little cylinders of the Mirth Mobile as fast as they could move, positioned my car so that there was no chance that Driver Douchebag could get over, and smiled as the weak bleats from his horn washed pure satisfaction over me.  

Yes, I missed my exit.  But it was worth it to watch Driver Douchebag have to take the exit that he'd been wanting to avoid.  I went a bit up the highway and still ended up being on-time.

Every few months, we would have a special 50% off week, where everyone who ordered online would get a 50% discount. As you can imagine, it was always a pretty busy week. 

Towards the end of my shift, halfway through the week, about 9PM give or take, we got an order for delivery from a rather sketchy apartment complex known for stiffing drivers (actually not important for the story, but fuck those people all the same). 

So I get the delivery off the heat racks and walk out the door. I get out of my car at the complex at 9:32. I know the exact time because the time on the delivery tag was 9:02, exactly 30 minutes and notable because A) it was exactly 30 minutes and that amused me for some reason, and B) because wait times at that moment were generally in the 45-60 minute range.

I find the door and ring the bell. Some guy answers, but when I try to make the exchange, he gets confused. So I read the name on his tag. It's his roommate, who, he explains, went out for a walk about 10 minutes before because ""his pizza is taking so fucking long"" (the guy who ordered the pizza said that, not the guy at the door). The guy at the door, henceforth named ""Roommate,"" offers to call the guy who made the order, henceforth known as ""Douchefuck McGee.""

Now, roommate is a pretty nice guy, and is clearly uncomfortable with whatever Douchefuck McGee is saying. Roommate cautiously tells me that Douchefuck doesn't want to pay for the pizza. I offer to talk directly to Douchefuck and roommate hands over the phone (again, nice guy, I feel bad for him). As soon as I introduce myself, Douchefuck immediately spews forth a torrent of verbal diarrhea, culminating in the statement, ""If it's longer than 30 minutes, it's free!""

Domino's revoked that policy in 1993, a year some of you may recognize at two fucking decades ago. I calmly and politely explain as much, using nicer words, but the guy won't budge. So I tell Douchefuck his options are simple. Be back at the apartment in five minutes to pay for the pizza or I take it back. He tells me to fuck off, so back to the store I go (after thanking roommate and apologizing of course).

When I get back, I search for my manager to explain why I still have a pizza. I find him on the phone with none other than Douchefuck McGee. Douchefuck is screaming loud enough for me to hear him while my manager tries to calm him down. Keep in mind it's official Domino's policy that, when dealing with irate customers, employees must bend over and take it like the little bitches that they are. Finally, my manager just apologizes and offers the guy a free pizza. Douchefuck angrily asks how fucking long it will take. My manager looks around the now empty store and calmly answers ""We are pretty swamped, so about three hours,"" and then proceeds to put in a timed order for Douchefuck to go out in three hours. After hanging up, the manager went ahead and made it right then, then left it on the heat rack for three hours, but not before ""forgetting"" to shut the box all the way, and not before I ""accidentally"" put way too much garlic oil on it. 

I hope Douchefuck enjoyed his soggy, lukewarm pizza at half past midnight, if he ever got it. Petty? Sure. Satisfying? Most definitely.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1358062906.0,,,True,t3_16h8jz,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16h8jz/from_30_minutes_or_less_to_2_hours_or_more/,

Customers can ask for a water cup and fill it up with a little tab that they pull down under the lemonade dispenser. If customers don't know how to use the water tab, they get lemonade in their cup.

**Story:** An older male customer came to me and asked for a water cup. I gave it to him, and two minutes later he shows up at the counter screaming about how his water tastes like lemonade and our water machine is broken.

Of course I ask him nicely if I can show him how to use the water tab as sometimes it is harder for people who have never used the machine before, but he denies me nastily saying ""no, just give me a damn bottled water."" Now, we charge $2.75 for fancy bottled water in a glass bottle. I think it's outrageously expensive. So I asked him again if he was sure he didn't just want me to show him how to use the machine. He yells at me about how he doesn't want me to waste his time anymore, so whatever I sell him the bottle and give it to him. Of course he storms away without even looking at the bottle.

It's not a plastic bottle, you need a bottle opener to get the cap off.

Tables at such events are long and communal. At the table in front of us facing away was what looked like parents and their adult son, who had brought in their own drinks. The beer garden serves as a fund raiser and there was line up to get it. I'm slightly annoyed at this but whatever. 

Joining us at our table were two I presume lesbian couples, very pleasant  and talking amongst themselves as was everyone else in the beer garden.

The son turns around to them and says ""blah blah blah shut the fuck up you dyck  cunts"" .  The women don't respond to him and change tables.  He is now on my radar so I spend some time observing him. Anyone of those women could have taken him out with one shot. 

My husband goes to get beer and accidentally returns to the wrong side of the table, to make matters worse he kinda slips pouring a beer onto the poor fellow. He apologizes, and  tiny neckbeard graciously accepts.  

Guys are now across from us having a great time.  Neckbeard seems to have no problem with their conversation. 

Husband and I haven't said a word about our petty revenge to each other, and the asshole at the next table has no idea we are together. 

It's time for us to go. From my observations of him it's pretty obvious he's got a large dose of paranoia. 

I've been told many times that I have kind eyes,  I'm 45, attractive without trying to be; no surgery, little to no make up, long natural hair, kinda earth motherish without the hippie type clothing.  

I decide its my turn for some petty revenge. So I write a quick note. ( it's been about two hours since the incident with the women). We are heading home. 

Husband has to use the washroom, he leaves a minute before I do. As I leave I hand the poor fellow my note, folded so it will take a minute for him to read it. It says simply, You reap what you sow.

While I'm handing it to him I say "" I'm so sorry about what is going to happen to you"".  Then I disappear in the crowd. 

But waiting for husband I can see him. His leg starts twitching while he's reading it.  I don't know what's going on in his mind but I can only hope that he thinks the feminist Borg is coming to take him.

Not the safest driving conditions to be sure but we're out of bread and macaroni, so I drove to the store.

I stay under 40mph the whole way there and usually keep it around 25 because the road has few clear patches. On my way back, there's a looong single-lane stretch of road. It's here when I notice I've got a tailgate.

I'm driving about 20mph and the guy behind me is less than half a car-length behind me. The slackjaw moron alternates between pounding his steering wheel and waving his arms at me. I try to ignore him as I come up to the first of several stop signs on this stretch and come to a halt.

I'm not even fully stopped when I hear a certain shitbird's horn blare behind me obnoxiously. ""Really? You fucker. Okay.""

I proceed to drive at no more than 10mph the rest of the way up this stretch of road. Any time I feel he gets too close, I stamp on the gas enough to send a shower of slushiness all over his windshield. And I stop for at least 10 seconds at the 2 remaining stop signs.

I'd end the story there, but the dumbfuck gave me a perfect ending.

This stretch of road grows wider and gains a lane as it links up to a 4-way intersection. Seeing his chance for freedom as I get into the turning lane, he floors it.Shouting curses from his slurring piehole, he fails to notice the light go yellow.

1358446536.0,282,self.pettyrevenge,16rhyl,How I made half my Senior Class shit themselves (Very satisfying petty revenge),352,70,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16rhyl/how_i_made_half_my_senior_class_shit_themselves/,"Found this lovely gem of a sub-reddit the other day, thought I'd add my hand to the tales. 

First, a little background. My high school career was, as are most, anything but glamorous leading up to my senior year. I was a goth kid. The only goth kid in this school mind you, so I was a constant target for jokes, pranks and other such things. I was even kicked in the head by the punter for the football team during lunch junior year. But, i was taught patience and to just let them do it. They always got in trouble (though not as much as I'd like) and that was that. However, I never forgot anything that was slighted on me. I remembered each little infraction and made note of it.

Now, fast forward to Senior year. I have steadily been taking little shots of revenge here and there on my fellow senior classmen while looking out for the misfits of the under classmen. Little things, like messing up a wood project for the resident ass hole in wood shop, bending the metal frame of what one douche hoped would be a dune-buggy by the end of the year (we had fabrication and metal shop classes) and other little snips. But it was what DIDN'T happen to me, that illicit the most drastic action I'd ever take against the whole of my senior class.

It happened during our yearly Prom Royalty assembly (sadly I had no way to dodge out because most teachers watched the doors) so I took my usual spot in the top most corner of the senior section of the bleachers. I'm barely paying attention as the bimbos who go for the titles of Prom Queen and Prom Princess (yes we had a runner up slot *gag*) read off their sob stories, etc. etc. It's at this point, i noticed the girl at the end of the line of the usual bimbos. It was one of the girls from our Special Education class. It turns out that her school dream had been to at least be in the running for the Prom Queen title. She hadn't even wanted to win, just to participate was her goal. So now this whole speech thing has my attention as I watch the girl, with apparent Down Syndrome, come up and give her speech to the school. Her speech is stuttered, but discernible and it makes me smile to see her up there with that amount of courage. She finishes and the school applauds. What happened next is what cause me to see red.

The two bimbos (who would go on to win the top two spots, go figure) each slightly stuck their feet out and caused the poor girl to trip and fall flat on her face. Of course, the whole senior section erupts in laughter, while I try my best to hold my seething fury in check as the assembly empties out. Once school is let out, I make my way home as fast as possible and pull out a small little chest of ""tools"" from under my bed. Such a horrid display of humanity needed a very special form of payback, and it just so happened they had the Senior Royalty party that night at the school. What better way to get back at them, than to ruin their lovely little dance? Why, with extra strength liquid laxatives!

Fast forward to that night, I'm at the party, making my way around the food dishes (pizza, tacos, lots of greasy foods) and just beginning to discreetly drop the clear liquid laxative juice on the food and in the drink bowls on the tables. 

""Hey, what ya doin' hovering near the food?"" I froze, and turned to the voice. I gave a swift sigh of relief as I saw it was our school janitor. Now, this guy, was as cool as they come. For all the times I'd had detention for fights and the occasional curse word in class, this guy had been the one to help me out during my sentence. He even gave me some band suggestions to try, such as Lordi and Dimmu Borgir. Anyways, I tell him whats up, and what I'm doing. He pauses and I see the brains in his head working. He raises a finger, and steps away for a moment. A few minutes later he comes back with a big grin on his semi bearded face. 

""Just locked the last set of bathrooms that are open for the dance. No other bathroom is open in the school."" He gives me the ""Rock On"" sign and goes on his way as I finish my devious intentions and scuttle on myself. After about an hour or so, the fun began, as I saw the others at the dance frantically trying to find a place to void their bowels. Satisfied with my revenge, I left for the night. The next day at school, nearly half of the senior class was still gone with bowel issues. Worked better than expected! 

TL:DR: Girl with Downs wanted to run for Prom Queen, got tripped by stuck up bitches. Went to the after party, put laxatives in all the food and drinks. Janitor sees me, fill him in, locks all the bathrooms and helps me out. Thanks for reading!

They all made friends fast, going out to bars together, getting wasted, rubbing their asses on random guys. I however, only went out with them on a few occasions, I had an SO back home and therefore my definition of fun didn't quite match up with theirs.

But at first this didn't bother me too much, our lack of friendship. It's pretty rare for roommates to actually be friends, so I was fine with a respectful, acquaintance-ship. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before I was being completely disrespected.

They started blaming me for anything that went wrong, missing, or broken in the house. They would ignore me or talk shit about me to each other, I could over hear them from my room, which was luckily a single and on the opposite side of the house from their two doubles. I would often take refuge, unable to even be in their presence without getting frustrated by how rude they were.

One Monday night, they had a bunch of friends over. Playing music, drinking, and yelling until 12:45 am when we all had school the next day. I was trying to sleep, particularly tired after having dealt with a similar situation over the weekend- although I had refrained from stopping them since it hadn't been weeknights. But this night was different, I had been exhausted and just wanted some sleep. I was very quickly growing upset by how little regard they had for another person living in the house.

I went downstairs, after asking them to not be so loud, or to go out to the bar instead of bringing it to our house, I was only given the response of 'we can do what we want, it's our house too!', followed by 'don't even bother, she's not worth it' before they all loudly departed.

I went to bed, angry and annoyed. Only to be woken up 2 hours later by them persistently ringing the doorbell. I thought for about 3 minutes about leaving them out there, which was hard given the incessant buzzing, but I figured leaving them in the 34 degree (1 celcius) weather overnight was too mean for them. 

So I got out of bed, walked to the door, and let them inside. In stumbled them and there friends, laughing and talking, not a single apology or thank you. 

I walked back to my room, unable to get over how insufferable some people could be as I listened to one of them drunkenly start a load of laundry, the laundry room being next to my room.

[REVENGE]
As I listened to her wobble back down the hallway, I decided there was only one thing to do. I slipped out of bed, my own cold feet silently padding out my room, and proceeded to take one of her socks from the laundry. I continued to do this every time someone was doing laundry for the next month, taking advantage of my close proximity to the washing machine. I would try and always take one sock at a time that still had a match, spacing out how often I took them (as not to arouse suspicion), then I would throw each one away in a random trash bin as I walked to school.

I know it wasn't much, that they deserved something a bit more confrontational, but oh how the pettiness and though of their cold feet made me happy.

TL;DR- Took single socks from mean disrespectful roommates laundries.

I was at an all day festival that had hit 50 degrees celsius, stood in this heat and direct sunlight for four hours to see The Killers from an excellent spot. Slowly moving forward as the crowd went in and out around me for other bands.

One particular guy - let's call him Jack - had been there the whole time too. Security guards at the front had been handing out water to ensure health. Instead of handing back the water, him and his mates decided to pour it over their faces, hair, down their shirts. Water that I could have drunk, or other people around me or were definitely needing it. Jack and friends also take selfies, sticking tongues down each others throats, scream out of time with current bands, general annoyance.

Eventually The Killers are about to start. I've got a good spot, second row, when I realise Jack's talking to me - telling me to get out of his spot. I shrug him off. He'd moved off to pull a friend through (breaking classic front ettiquette) so there I was.

He decides to start shouting at security guard to move me, and they weren't taking it from him - they'd seen me move in an empty space, that was that. By this time I'd had some water, handed some back, was good to go. 

Jack decides it'd be a good idea to start swearing at the security - massive guys you do not want to cross. He states a racial slur I will not repeat, and gets yanked upwards into the gate next to me. Security guard turns to me, asks

'Did he say what I think he said?'

After four hours of being stepped on, sworn at, pushed, elbowed, and general unwanted physical contact I smiled and said

'That's exactly what he said'.

He got yanked out of the pit, told to not try to come back or Security would rearrange his face. The petty revenge was overwhelming... then the music started, I was front row, no Jack allowed. 

Extra revenge: Girlfriend of Jack turns up crying, 'Have you seen my boyfriend?'

'Yep, he got yanked out for being a dick.'

So we divided ourselves into teams and started a little battle; all the guns were fake so if you got ""hit"" it was based on the honor system/the other kid yelling ""I GOT YOU! I GOT YOU!"" well naturally there was the classic scumbag childhood friend in the mix that, when I aimed my fake gun at and pulled the trigger, would just smirk and say ""no you missed me"" or ""no im invincible.""

Well 10 year old me got pretty pissed, especially since I already didn't like the kid. I went and grabbed one of the stomp rockets, thinking he couldn't claim I didn't hit him if I actually hit him (mind you these are the foam ones, nothing dangerous) so I get about 10 feet from him and stomp as hard as I can on the stomp-pad, him still smirking, and the foam rocket hit him straight in the face. He started crying, it was beautiful.

Have a speeding ticket.,338,58,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1egd8f/honking_at_me_because_youre_a_bad_driver_have_a/,"I was riding my bicycle along the street after just having finished my workout. Cars were passing me, all was well all was normal until mister Doucheface McJerkypants came along.

The street was narrow at this point so I get it if you don't feel comfortable overtaking, but instead of making some space he was tailgating me, staying a maximum of one meter behind me all the time. This was really annoying and uncomfortable so I waved him to signalise I noticed him and that he could safely pass me. But he didn't, **he even honked his horn at me** for whatever reason. A little further down the road there was a sidewalk again so I drove up on the sidewalk so he could finally pass. **BUT HE DIDN'T.** 

The sidewalk was only about 30 meters long and after that I had to get back on the street. At the point where I was coming back on the street it went downhill and there was a blind corner. This is the point where DMJ decides it's ok to pass me. 

**My Revenge:** As I mentioned the road went downhill and it was pretty steep. The speed limit was 50 Km/h and I knew that there was a speed cam right ahead. I thought to myself, 50? I can totally make this. So I sped up and was passing DMJ at exactly the right moment. The cam flashed and DMJ hit his brakes really hard. I laughed my ass off.

I don't know how those cameras work exactly and if hes actually going to get a ticket but it dosen't really matter because he certainly thought so, he was furious.

1354130865.0,284,self.pettyrevenge,13y5ks,Don't mess with IT,319,35,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/13y5ks/dont_mess_with_it/,"I worked for a small university as the Help Desk Manager and supervisor of a few help desk students. I had worked at this place for 5 years, left for a year to work at another campus, and then came back (despite my better judgment). 

At the campus I spent a year at I got to know the staff, including one of the business office people, Sally. She and I got along just fine. Soon after I arrived she decided to try to transfer to my old campus to be their business manager, replacing the boss I had had and who had forced me to leave due to her alcoholism and brutal demeanor. Sally got the job and was hired. 

I eventually left and went back to my old campus. Sally, who had been my equal at the other campus, was now my supervisor. She told me that, since I knew IT and she really didn't, that she would be hands-off for the most part.

Unfortunately, this was also Sally's first taste of power and it went straight to her head. Being the sole business person (we were a staff of like 12 people) she was responsible for our budget, purchasing (other than IT stuff - I had my own purse for that), payroll, accounts payable and receivable.

It soon became apparent that she lacked the skills necessary to do her job properly. She ended up spending a lot of time with the senior accountants who somehow patiently trained her on the same things over and over. In payroll, she was causing issues by paying people who weren't teaching that semester and not paying some who were. My first paycheck, at $26/hr and having had 80 hours in for the period, was around $200. Things were not going well and Sally knew it. 

She began overcompensating for her lack of job skills by micromanaging me to the point where I couldn't so much as order a replacement keyboard without running it by her first. So I started sending all of my purchases to her, like DVD labels and toner (toner was technically an office supply and not an IT expense). She would, in turn, sit on these purchases and we'd run out of DVD labels and toners. I, of course, would be blamed for not purchasing them earlier and she would ""save the day"" by ordering it next day at a significant expense, which then was paid from my budget. 

Luckily the people I worked with, with exception of the director who wasn't a leader and who was also vastly under-qualified for his job, were good friends of mine. We'd have lunches where the 10 or so of us would go and leave Sally and John, the director, behind. 

Things came to a head when I discovered a damning document in Sally's home folder. I was not snooping; rather, I was trying to clean up the file server since we had recently migrated to a new machine and disk space seemed vastly different. The culprit turned out to be Sally's 25 gigs of MP3s in her home folder (but I digress).

I came across a document that had the title of ""Jays transgressions.docx"". 

*Now* I was snooping.

I opened it up and my face instantly flushed red. Inside this 3 or 4 page document were time-stamped entries in a diary of lies - how I called her a bitch to her face, how I said I would be better at her job than she was, how I accused her of delaying orders on items until we ran out (so that one was true), and on and on. I instantly saved the document and showed a close co-worker friend of mine. She knew it was all B.S. 

I knew that something had to be done. This was, after all, the same Sally who had spent taxpayer's money on superglue to keep in her drawer at work for when she broke a high heel. 

I started with the switch. She was plugged into our gigabit switch (we had two switches, that one and a 10/100 for the non-gig stuff). I turned her port down to 10 MBPS half-duplex. Her desk phone was replaced with the one that had a bad humming noise going on in the background (the one she wouldn't let me throw away because it had cost money at one point). I removed her from a few email lists that she had somehow managed to finesse her way onto, like the assistant deans lists (she wasn't one) and the human resources managers (she wasn't one of those either). I set her printer to economode and put very used toners into it when she was away from her desk. I removed her from some Active Directory security groups that, again, she didn't need. Her machine went to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity. Her MAC address was blocked from the wireless. Several budget documents would disappear and, when she was near hysterics trying to find them, they'd turn up right where they had been before. 

I left soon after and got my dream job (where I am at now). To this day Sally is still wondering why her network connection is so slow and why she can't get onto the wireless network.

Whatever you say bounces off of me and punches you in the face",315,38,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1iok7k/im_rubber_youre_glue_whatever_you_say_bounces_off/,"A few days ago, I made a post detailing revenge I got on a kid at a band festival. Now, I'll be telling of how I fought back against a bandroom bully.

In the 8th grade, we had 2 lunches. If you were in one lunch, then you'd be reading during the other lunch. Most teachers strictly enforced this rule. Luckily for me, I had a kickass Algebra teacher who let me spend both lunches in the band room. During the second lunch, a 7th grade class was held. In this class was a kid who we'll call Frank. Frank was a douchebag. For reasons unknown to me, he liked to make everyone feel bad about themselves. Especially me. On a daily basis, I'd be met with greetings like ""Hey homo"", or ""Where are your fag friends at"". I wasn't gay and I had no problem with gay people. I usually just shrugged off these insults.

I was always a tall kid. In the 8th grade, I was around 5'11"". I wasn't exactly the most muscular person, but I certainly wasn't a beanpole. Frank was average sized, probably around 5'5"". For someone of his size, he sure seemed to have a large ego. He was probably a stronger than me. He walked like he owned the school and always had his posse around him.

One day, as I was working on some music in the band room, the 7th grade class containing Frank was beginning to roll in. The band teacher was usually off in the teachers lounge for the first 5-10 minutes of class, and Frank had always used this time to bully people. On this day, Frank said something along the lines of ""What up, bitch"" as he walked into the room. Phrases like this weren't rare from him, but I found it strange because he never talks to me when he first enters the classroom. A few minutes later, a few measures from the end of my music, my pants suddenly drop to the ground.

""What are you gonna do, pussy"", says Frank. Before that moment, I had never been more mad. My face red with anger and slight embarrassment, I quickly pull my pants up and punch him in the face. I probably wouldn't have punched him if I had more time to think through my actions, but it felt so good to sock him in the face. After I hit him, I looked at him and his bloody nose. Then, without saying a single word, I picked up my stuff and walked out. 

At the beginning of my next period, I was called into the principal's office. As I walk in, I see Frank sitting there. The principal asks if I hit him. When the words ""Yes, I punched Frank"" came out of my mouth, it felt euphoric. He asks me why and I immediately tell him about all of the harassment that I had endured. Of course, Frank denied it. But after questioning several of his classmates, the principal suspended Frank for a month. I got off with a week of detention and was told to come to him if I ever had any problems with another student.",,False,,t5_2vg7t,1374340087.0,,,True,t3_1iok7k,http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1iok7k/im_rubber_youre_glue_whatever_you_say_bounces_off/,
