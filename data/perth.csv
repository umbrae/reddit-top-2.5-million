1366689253.0,580,self.perth,1cwxjk,I am an Aboriginal person AMA,724,144,941,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1cwxjk/i_am_an_aboriginal_person_ama/,"Hey guys. I lived in Perth for a majority of my life, although I currently reside in the Kimberley. I am both of Nyoongar and Yamajti Aboriginal heritage. I have family across the state. I also work in for a large and long-standing Aboriginal Corporation that fights for Aboriginal rights. I have at least basic knowledge of most Aboriginal matters. 

I am writing this as a matter of interest to this subreddit in regards to many threads that have been posted over the previous few months. Most people here seem to talk as if there are no Aboriginal people who are on Reddit and I just wanted to clear the air.

I will take time to answer my questions and I will be back and forth here over the next few days at least.

Edit: Awesome. I just got my first few tough questions. I will answer them in time.

Edit: I need to clarify that I use terms 'Aboriginal' and 'Australian' as a means of explaining things. I am not implying that Aboriginal people are not now Australians and shouldn't seek to live together for a better future. I am fairly patriotic myself.

We're The Greens in Western Australia and we want to say hi. As you're more than well aware, the election is dawning upon us and we wanted to introduce ourselves after lurking for a while. Also our Senator /u/scott_ludlam is up for re-election this year and we wanted to introduce our other Greens candidates in WA, but for now, this is just a warm welcome.

We didn't want to astroturf Reddit and we understand how important trust is with Redditors, especially in regards to politics. We're big fans of Reddit and we just wanted to hear your opinions of the Greens in Western Australia, or even about the Greens, in general.

We wanted to update you guys on any Greens events happening in Perth, such as this weekend's [Homeless Rally](https://www.facebook.com/events/542856912442069/), as Scott has campaigned strongly for the homeless and social housing in Australia and will be in attendance. And we'd also love to draw your attention to our [Greens Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/147564152115154/?fref=ts) in West Leederville with [DJ Anton Maz](https://soundcloud.com/deathdisco-2) , this Friday. With the updates, we don't wish to flood this or any other subreddit, but make people aware of what's happening and we understand if we get downvoted into oblivion.

We'd love to thank for those who attended Scott's event at SpaceCubed last night and whomever created [IsScottLudlamReElectedYet.com](http://isscottreelectedyet.com), thank you!

In addition, working in property management seems to be quite the profession where you can go straight from your TAFE course in Geraldton to the big city where you get to nit pick adults paying upward of $600/week about oven grease and shower scum on glass. 

After two years in a ""luxury"" apartment in Fremantle managed by the most ineffective management company I've ever experienced in 15 years as an ex-Pat renter, I've had the luck to move out.  Now, I'm being dinged for ""dust in the corner of the laundry room"" and ""paint color off in wall repairs"" that, oops, THEIR contractors did. 

Sure, paying over $600/week in a 3/2 that managed to have the mbr air con broken and leaking into the wall for most of two years was luck, and dealing with an ever-changing string of ""property managers"" who seem to hail from the same ads I see on the back pages of the paper for those looking for a good time was super fun. 

The rental market here is INSANE.  There is no want or need to treat renters, even high-paying double-professional FAMILIES who keep a very clean house like anything other than the scum of the earth.  There is literally NO incentive for a landlord or manager to do anything other than treat renters as a bother when in a place, then like horrible dirty scum when they move out - trying to keep over $1000 in bond.

I was just listening to a song called 'is pyaar ko main kya naam du' - Hindi for 'What do I name this love'. And I did it while sitting in my office after nth number of glasses of wine at my office on a Friday night. You people out here in Perth are glorious. Apart from the ones that reckon 'there goes the neighbourhood' just because of a couple of Indians moved into the neighbourhood, (I mean, I've lived in suburbs where parties have gone on till 5 in the morning, and they weren't necessarily Indian), and the one's that don't want the Indians as their roomies, just cuz. 

Perth is epic. I've lived in Melbourne, I've been to Sydney, but just, argh, it's so pretty out here. I love Mounts Bay Drive, I love the simplicity of the city even though there's heaps more people around since the mining boom. I love the fact that no matter what, the next suburb is only 20 minutes away. (Sorry Rockingham, but I still love your beaches). I love the rains, I love the summer. I love that no matter what, the beaches are always pretty and the people are always laid back. I love the fact that whenever I'm sitting here at my desk way past normal hours, people come up to me and say ' What the hell are you still doing here mate'. I love that people wish me whenever I'm on a morning running or an evening run.

I just love, Perth :D #dealwithit

Perth has it's share of local street legends known for their crazy behaviour. Who is your local crazy, and what out there behaviour are they known for?

Here are a few I've known...
 
First off the classics that everybody is familiar with.

[Mad Dog Adrian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7CwzubudE0) Just about everone in Perth's got a story about this character riding around on his pushy and yelling at cars/pedestrians. 

Edit: [Even Nic Naitanui's a Mad Dog fan!](http://statigr.am/p/390365588557836096_36590426) Check the tee!

[Crazy Aussie Flag Bike Lady](http://images.watoday.com.au/2013/01/10/3944122/crazy-bike.jpg?rand=1357814909295) You know she's startled you with an ""AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE!"".

Then the hidden gems...

Piney. This little Noongar bloke used to pretend he was driving a car all the time. He'd make the noises, change gears, beep for reversing, everything! He also liked to ask your name and write it in his pretend notepad.

Vic Park Kookaburra Man. Couldn't find a picture of this funny little bloke. He would sidle up to people quietly and submissively, saying ""Hello, hello"", and then once he had your attention he would unleash an incredibly loud Kookaburra laugh that made you drop your damn groceries in shock. I once saw him get chucked out of Cash Converters for doing it.

Tightpants McGee aka Alex aka The Strider. An extremely skinny man who wore the tightest of skintight black jeans with a big white dress shirt tucked in and handcuffs clipped to his belt loops. In summer he had the same uniform but with tight shorts. I once heard him yell at a Coles checkout chick that he had AIDS.  

Tell me about your local street legends. Bonus points if you know any actual facts about them.

She is currently in hospital with encephalitis and, as it's not getting better and they can't figure out the cause, the doctors have told us that it's time for her parents to come out. We gathered up the costs for the flights, but they will be out there for a while (we very much hope) and we are struggling with their accommodation.  Does anyone have any suggestions for cheap-ish accommodations around this area? Is there any sort of help we could look towards for families who are dealing with a deadly illness?  My in-laws are from England, none of us have been to Australia, and the hospital hasn't been particularly forthcoming so I thought maybe one of you would have an idea.

[HORSE MASKS](http://www.mcphee.com/creepyhorsemask/images/horselounge.jpg) ARE OPTIONAL, CREEPY, WEIRD AND STRONGLY ENCOURAGED!


**LUNCH AT 1PM:**

BBQ at King's Park! We will meet at 1PM and have a BBQ at around 1:30PM:

 * Sausage on a roll: $2

 * Sausage on bread: $2

 * Steak sandwhich: $2

 * Soft drink: $1



It's hard to guess how many people will show up. I will be aiming at catering for about 30. So if tons more show up it will be first in, best dressed sorry.

Feel free to bring your own food and drinks of course (no alcohol in the public park please).

The BBQ will be in the [Pines area, just off Fraser Ave](http://i.imgur.com/Q2Y3H.png) near the exhibition ground. We will be identifiable by a poster/sign, and I will update this post with *exact details* of where we are seated. If the weather is bad I will update this post on Saturday morning confirming cancellation.

Once the BBQ is over we will pack up and those attending the scavenger hunt can head to the start location nearby.



**[SCAVENGER HUNT](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/valhg/scavenger_hunt_is_on_with_a_prehunt_picnic_quick/) at 2:45**:

Legoyman's scavenger hunt starts at 2:45 at Fraser Ave in King's Park. Please RSVP /u/Legoyman if you would like to attend. 

It should go for a couple of hours, sounds like it will be tons of fun! Check out the [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/valhg/scavenger_hunt_is_on_with_a_prehunt_picnic_quick/)!

**EVENING AT 7PM**:

OK so I have secured us the *UPSTAIRS VERANDAH* at [Rigby's Bar](http://www.rigbysbar.com.au/). Rigby's is located at:

221 St Georges Terrace Perth WA 6000

And we have an entire downstairs bar to ourselves. There will be signs saying ""REDDIT MEETUP"" because upstairs there is a ""Dirty Dick's"" dinner show? Whatever that is.. But signs will be pointing to the basement where our meet up. DON'T BE TEMPTED BY THE DIRTY DICKS.

There will be a **limited menu** of food available. I.e. light snack meals I think.

The whole day should be epic and I hope everyone will attend. I did put down $200 for the function hire so donations of alcohol will be very appreciated :)

Update: Don't forget to bring chairs and or blankets to lunch in case there is limited or no seating available

I say ""Im not trying to lie to you, i just want to do the right thing."" 
He again says ""Bullshit, you saw this in the machine and tried to get past, you dont get that using coins."" the rest is just semantics about writing the fine, and him saying ""bullshit, you're lying."" for about 15 minutes.

So someone left it in the machine, i was in a rush and through ignorance i grabbed it and ran onto the train.

Yesterday morning I experienced something horrible on a Transperth Cat bus on my way to work, and I just want to make fellow bus/train users aware of what happened, in case it happens to them or they witness it happening to someone else. 

[I posted my story in TwoXChromosomes yesterday]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/195rhy/im_not_sure_what_just_happened_on_the_bus_but_i/)  and I've pasted it below to save time. 



&gt;I hope this doesn't sound stupid but I feel very confused/angry/stupid right now.


&gt;I got on the bus, as I do every morning, and as there were no seats I had to stand in the aisle. I noticed the man seated alongside me checked me out as I was walking on, but I didn't really think anything of it.
It's only a short bus ride but a few minutes into it I felt his leg against mine, just kinda bumping it every now and then. After that I felt his legs closer to mine, so I just moved forward as much as I could in case he needed to get up/move/etc. The next thing I knew, he stood up and was behind me. He then started getting very close to me and when the bus bumped, his body (including his crotch) would bump against mine and he would hold it against me, and his hands would subtly brush against me when he went to grab the things to hold on to (I can't think of what they're called, but the things you hold on to on buses lol). When his crotch pressed against me I could 100% feel he was ""aroused"". To be honest, it reminded me of those pr0n videos with the girl on the bus and the guy keeps bumping her and then they get it on.


&gt;Luckily the bus came to a stop and enough people got off that there was finally enough room for movement, so I ""accidentally"" flung my handbag back so it hit him and then I moved up to sit next to the biggest man I could see, and the weirdo followed and sat opposite of me and fiddled with his pants a few times (in the downstairs department). At this point I realised it wasn't my mind playing tricks on me, and this guy actually was being creepy and if he followed me when I got off I'd either have to fight him or ask someone to walk with me (and possibly look like an idiot?). Thankfully when I got off he just stared at me and didn't follow.


I'm completely aware that I should have done something at the time, but like I mentioned in my post I tried to convince myself it was innocent and I guess I just froze.  

Anyway, the reason I'm posting this is to just make everyone aware, and unfortunately it can happen anywhere and at any time of the day. Please keep your wits about you and be aware of the people around you.

Thanks all

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your comments. I really am taking it all on board in case there is a next time. It's something I never expected to happen before 7am on a Monday morning but I guess it just goes to show that creeps can appear at any time.",,False,self,t5_2r78m,1361859131.0,,,True,t3_198huk,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/198huk/warning_to_ladies_and_possibly_men_who_use_public/,

1CCA-085 fake cops license plate.

The events:

* at kenwick link train station heading to spencer rd (2 lanes into 1).  
* I in right lane, idiot in left.  
* I pass the guy as he is driving slowly.  
* Just as I pass him he speeds up and starts swerving wildly at my car.  
* The swerving repeats 2 more times for a total of 3 times pushing me into the far right lane into oncoming traffic. 
* Braking let him get ahead so I can get to safety and then he suddenly slams his brakes.  
* He is in front of me as Im driving home and I see him on spencer road waiting at the lights, I signal wind down your window and ask him what his fucking problem is.  
* He tells me, ""Your driving to fast like an idiot so Im going to force you to crash"". Id like to note I had not exceeded the speed limit at any period before and during his attack.  
* I tell him, if you dont like how people are driving call the police like a normal personal instead of acting like a dangerous fucking idiot. 
* He promptly replies ""I AM A COP"".  
* to which I say, if you fucking are I'll be having words with your sargent, lights turn green I go home and report the incident.

Traffic police are helpful but after 3 visits to the cannington police station this morning to finally get to speak to a policeperson to make my report Im told that unless he had lights or flashed a badge its ok for him to say he is a police officer and I have no recourse. This is counter to what I was told and does not match up with the pdf's I have read of wikipedias definition of impersonating a police officer.  
I realize that should we end up in court, due to no witnesses It would be my word against his and as I understand it that means id just be wasting my own time.  
So I can see that perhaps the policewoman was just trying to save me wasting my time in court and she is likely right to do so. 

 So in summary:

* if you know the 50 year old owner of this car he is a dangerous idiot that thinks endangering himself, his victim and surrounding people driving on the road is perfectly fine if someone has dared offend him by passing his car.  
* He impersonates a police officer, but he is not one - this I have confirmed already with the police.  
* Im getting a dash cam !!!! fuck this shit.  
* Please dont take the law into your own hands, just call the real cops ok.  
* Be careful driving out there, there are some lunatics like this person on the road.  
* Slow down, give way, dont lose your shit if someone passes you while your idling along under 40km an hour.

I have moved across the road with a new family who love me and have been taking care of me.I need a 'forever home' because my new family have lots of pet birds, and they look very tasty to me!

&gt;I love cuddles and pats and won't hesitate to curl up in your lap and fall asleep if you'll let me. I enjoy exploring outside and don't mind coming inside sometimes when it's cold. I would rather spend my time cuddling with you than playing with toys, but I do enjoy playing in the great outdoors when you're out and about. I am happy and patient and love people.

&gt;My family have been feeding me their spam war rations but have recently been giving me dry cat biscuits. I will eat whatever tasty things you would like to feed me. I have a blue flea collar and am in good health.

&gt;I am still a baby and have not been spayed or microchipped however the Cat Haven on 23 Lemnos St in Shenton Park will spay and microchip me for $125 during the month of July.

&gt;Please contact my family if you feel like you would like to adopt me!

&gt;p.s. My name is only temporary! Please feel free to re-name me. Also I don't actually have fleas :)

We aim to have it up before October, but to start on the final parts we need your help.

Nightlifer is launching soon in beta phase in Perth. It's an events and location guide for anything and everything that is happening in Perth - from what bands are playing that night, festivals are coming up and even to the what is happening for WASO and the art gallery.

We aim to cover the lot - if any event happens in Perth, we'll know about it. Why Perth at this stage? Because most people involved are from here, it's not a massive market that will overwhelm us and it doesn't have anything that holds up as a Yellow Pages of events just yet.

That might sounds ambitious, and it is. At the moment, we're building. Not everything we wanted exists yet. And this is where you come in.

**We would like some suggestions of what places you enjoy the most, and more importantly, what things you want to know more about.**

The site is: http://www.nightlifer.com.au/ - there is nothing there at the moment though! The app when it releases shortly afterwards will be free (at this stage - there may be a premium one later on).

We'll make another post soon to announce when it is live, and go through everything in a little more detail. And every redditor (that is interested) will get into our launch party for free, and a free membership on the site for exclusive events, promotions and whole lot more!

We aim, later on, to take it national; and add in features like taxi and ticket booking. Even an event/location randomiser for those of you that are too indecisive to decide where to go or what to do!

If you have any questions as well, please leave them here and I'll answer them. But think of it as a one-stop guide to every special event, festival, party, night out, restaurant, fair, show, carnival and musical act!

I've seen a few comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/t11m6/the_annual_global_reddit_meetup_is_approaching_it/) about another meetup in the short term. So before then, let's have another meetup on Saturday the 19th of May.

When: 8pm on Saturday night

Where: The Moon and Sixpence in the CBD. We've had a couple of meet ups here and they've gone really well.



Why?: Come and meet other Redditors, I swear they aren't all as crazy as you think they are. The last meetup 
we had at The Moon we had about 45 people and it was great. Check out some great [pics](http://imgur.com/a/2giPi#0) from it.

The website for The Moon and Sixpence is [here](http://www.moonandsixpence.com.au/) *warning: website has bad music*

Dinner: If you would like to come and have some dinner, please come between 6pm and 8pm. I'll be at the moon from 6pm holding a sign and looking like [this](http://hobosigns.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/homeless-signs.jpg) except the sign will say REDDIT and I won't be quite as well dressed.

Our first meetup at the moon we hit town after, but the next one we stayed at the moon.. So who knows, we'll see what happens.

So, please comment if you think you will be coming. Just like last time I will organise for us to get our own room and bar at the back of the pub. If you have any questions just let me know.

Edit: I forgot to print up a ""REDDIT MEETUP"" sign but it will be really easy to find the group. Just go into the Moon and Sixpence and head around the first bar and to the bar at the rear. There you should see an area with some booths around the outside and some tables in the middle. That will be the group!

We will be doing another meet up on Saturday the 4th of February at The Moon &amp; Sixpence in the CBD. The meetup will be at 8pm!

 * For anyone who wants to come early for a meal, the table will be booked for 6:30. So I'll be there if you want to come then and grab some eats, [this is what I'll look like](http://cdn.head-fi.org/b/bc/bcac39b3_Patient-Bear.jpeg). 

 * The actual meetup will be 8pm, but come early if you want :)

 * Just like last time we will probably be sitting at a large/long table in the back of the pub. I'll have a little banner with /r/perth and the Reddit alien on it displayed somewhere.

After a couple of hours we'll probably go for a walk over to Northbridge and partè down! As always feel free to message me if you would like my mobile number..

The last meet up was awesome and really great fun :D hope to see everyone there for this one!

You were probably scammed $10 from Transperth,47,13,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1erb0u/had_to_take_a_railreplacement_bus_after_tagging/,"Last Monday (13th) it wasn't confirmed whether the train after 8pm would turn up or not due to a mechanical failure. The hundreds of passengers who tagged off after waiting 15+ minutes for the train were all charged a Default Fare ($9.60). I asked the station attendents if they could put out a message on the PA telling people they'd have to chase up a refund, Transperth told me to fuck off.

After leaving a complaint about this dishonest and illegal practice, Transperth told me they couldn't be bothered refunding the 50%+ people who were ripped off, because they couldn't be bothered.

Their only solution was to contact Troy Buswell.

I encourage everyone who has access, to check their Smartrider balance and see if you've been scammed. If you have, I'd like to hear from you, as I'll be taking this up with the ACCC/Consumer Affairs.

The area was always in dispute between the DEC who own the car park and Subiaco Council who own the reserve. Because of the ongoing issues, the DEC claimed to not be able to fine people parking without tickets- hence it became a smorgasbord for anyone parking freely all day for the last few years. 

In this break over Christmas an agreement has been sought and the ranger has advised that there will be daily checks and fines handed out. There will be parking officers on site as students arrive, to make sure they have paid for tickets. This will be effective as of this week. 

Thought I would give everyone a heads up, as I know there was talk of it earlier and pandemonium when they applied this rule for one day over the last year. 

You can not buy membership at Royal Perth Yacht Club just to park in their grounds, every year there is a rumour about this, they will fine you $50 for parking there without a sticker and will clamp your car on the third strike. They pay particular attention to members who are students having parking stickers and pay close attention to cars left there all day. Especially if you're seen walking out of the grounds with back pack in hand after parking your car or scooter. 

Mounts bay sailing club request a donation to their rescue boat fund but they are also about to start and put up gates like Royal Perth yacht club. You will most likely have to pay to become a member there as well. 

Sorry. No free parking on Hackett drive anymore.

Went up to him, asked if he was ok and offered to call a cab. He seemed like a decent bloke and rather amusing, going ""beep beep"" like a toddler whenever a car went by. :)

Anyway, called Swan, told them I'm calling on behalf of a guy who was so drunk he could hardly stand up, asked if they could help. They said no problem, which actually was a little unexpected.

I waited for the taxi, didn't take long to arrive. By this time, the guy was fast asleep on the lawn, had to shake him for a minute, with the taxi beeping helpfully. ""Beep beep"" he said again, as he woke up. Hilarious dude.

He sees the taxi, gets up, faced the right direction, and proceeds to walk sideways. :) Had to lead him to it by the hand! Anyway, big props to the cabbie for his patience and good nature, and to Swan for taking a random call asking to pick up a lost soul pissed as a newt.

Snapped some frames of this mofo opening my car door and having a look around (then leaving my car door open..)

My car kept getting broken into so I installed a camera and decided to remove all valuables (not that I kept anything in there) and just keep it unlocked. I guess it worked, since the window hasn't been smashed since. But obviously some people can't resist!

You all might no me from my sporadic activity on the subreddit, I'm a 20yo kiwi guy who's only been in Perth for 3 or so months now. But now I'm coming to you all asking for some help.
    On tuesday night me and my girlfriend were fast asleep in our house in Hamilton Hill (that we rent) at about 1am. We were woken up to the sound of our door been kicked in and then me and my male flatmate were even more woken up by a big bearded caucasian at the top of our staircase. To wrap things up without going into to much detail me and my flatmate gt the shit beat out of us before this psycho fled. We didn't know this guy, it was a completely unprovoked vicious attack and it has left me and my girlfriend very shaken up. The police found the guy and their dealing with him at the moment. I dont really want anything more to do with the situation and just wanna move on.

*So here comes the cry for help*
Me and my girlfriend need somewhere to live. We're wrapping up the lease on the Hamilton Hill house at the moment because it was such a violent and out of the blue event its kind of 'ruined the sanctity of home' if you know what I mean. If anyone (preferably south of the river, my girlfriend works at Garden City and I work in Canning Vale but I am in the process of finding other work) has a spare room available for rent I would be so so so grateful. We're a tidy couple and always carry our own weight. Message me or reply here if you or anyone you know can help us out. Sorry if this was hard to read putting pen to paper (keys to screen?) has never really been one of my strengths.

There will be a **full freeway closure at night on the Mitchell Freeway (southbound) between Hutton Street and Vincent Street** tonight and tomorrow night (Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 November) from 10pm until 5am.
 
In addition, the following on ramps to the Mitchell Freeway (southbound) will also be closed:

**Hutton Street on ramp** 

**Powis Street on ramp**

**Scarborough Beach Road on ramp (for buses and taxi drivers)**

The overnight closures are required to install temporary traffic management barriers on the median side of the freeway. These barriers will allow the Public Transport Authority (PTA) to safely complete service relocation works between Powis Street and the Britannia Road footbridge (opposite Lake Monger).

There will be no reduction in the number of traffic lanes once the barrier is in place, however the existing traffic lanes will be realigned and speed reductions will be in place.

The service relocation works are being undertaken by the PTA on behalf of Main Roads. Once complete, it will enable Main Roads to begin work on the widening of the Mitchell Freeway (northbound).

The vital project will add an extra lane on the freeway, from the Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel through to Hutton Street, and a slip lane from the Loftus Street off ramp to improve safety and weaving arrangements.

Detours will be in place and motorists are advised to seek alternative routes.

Got ripped off by a cleaning company.,36,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1jhd41/warning_other_movingout_tenants_out_there_got/,"Hi Perth, I'm in the process of moving out, and made the bad decision of hiring a cleaning company (got their contact from a flyer, Careful Cleaners) to do the 'end of lease' cleaning as he was giving us a good price for the cleaning and carpet cleaning.

So he came and cleaned the place last week, and when I came back there was still hard-water spots over the shower screen and mirrors, the sliding door to the balcony was still smudgy, added a few scratch marks on the wall, oven still greasy etc. I pointed out a few of these and he gets defensive and says ""When is the inspection? Have the agent inspect and call me if he's unhappy. I'll come and clean it up."" I'm taken aback from the (lack of) politeness, but fair enough.

HERE COMES THE GOOD PART. Today, the agent did the inspection this morning and calls me up and gives me a full list of things to clean up (what a surprise!). Tried to call the cleaner up, but it says the number is disconnected. Tried to find them online, and got another phone number on their website (only changed on their home page, still got the disconnected one on the other pages). Tried calling it but it goes to voicemail straight away, left a voicemail but not holding my breath since I need to clean the unit up by tomorrow afternoon.

Did a bit more digging and whad'you know! They've ripped people off by 'cleaning' their houses, and getting aggro when they're asked to come back to do their job correctly this time:
[Gumtree complaints](http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/perth-region/cleaning/careful-cleaners-suite-42-50-st-georges-tce-ground-floor-shop-6-/1023047616) [Yelp complaint](http://www.yelp.com.au/filtered_reviews/13swp1Yqomel_trPLoaPOQ?fsid=RGLSYJVaa9LsqZVJ5NL-bA)

My guess is, one of the stubborn disgruntled customers must be harassing the poor guy and he was forced to change number and screen his voicemail for death threats now.

Well here's my rant, and I hope that David crosses the wrong guy when 'carefully cleaning' his apartment and gets his ass handed to him. But life's not fair, that won't happen and simply changing mobile phone number seems to keep him in business.

Was thinking of trying something slightly different and reserving the two back rooms at Pot Black in northbridge, might be a welcome break from M&amp;S.

There's pool and table tennis, plus a mini bar, sectioned off from the main area. Not sure if there'd be enough alcohol there :p but [look how fun it is](http://www.pbcentre.com.au/images/Functions.jpg)!

Alternatively there's Rosie O'Gradys just down the road, they have a few [function](http://northbridge.rosieogradys.com.au/Content/broderick_room) rooms to pick from

He asked if I was near my PC and I said yes. He then asked me to verify the following details, asking me to open the command prompt and enter the command ""assoc"". 

Now when you enter this command it gives you rows and rows of info, but the line they want you to look for is near the bottom and has got CLSID in it. They then ask you to verify whether this is your number and proceed reading ""888DCA60-FC0A-11CF-8F0F-00C04FD7D062"". Of course it is the same number but it is the same with all latest Windows operating systems. But most people don't know this. I didn't know this, but I thought that this was fishy, but decided to play along. I asked them to send me an email from their Microsoft email address. He fed me the line of MS have millions of customers and that they just can't send all of them mails. I knew by then that something was up. I played along a bit more to see where it would go.

They guide you to open up eventviewer to show you that there is errors, telling you that there is a virus on your PC and that it is corrupting your files making your PC more vulnerable to hackers. They then ask you to go to a website called ammyy.com where they tell you to open up a program where they can then gain remote access to your PC. Hint: when your desktop wallpaper disappears, it is because they now have remote access to your PC. They can then view everything that is open on your desktop.

They then ask you to whether you want to solve this problem, to which most people will say yes. And then guide you to a website to buy a product where they can see you enter your credit card details. 

When I noticed the website was going to try and get remote access to my PC I immediately called them out on their BS and put down the phone. 

These guys are very slick and I'm sure they are going to scam a lot of people. Be wary and let the people in your social circles know.

I'm talking things like good food places/cheap shopping/nice parks/views/cheap things to do/etc. Perth and surrounds I guess (eg. Yanchep, Rockingham/Mandurah (bad), lancelin etc.).

My contribution:

Food:

-Alfred's Kitchen in Guildford is a bit of a hike from everywhere but the prices are reasonable and the food is good (albeit it is take away styled and not health food).

-IKEA: cheap. Average-reasonable food. Again, cheap. Plus you can shop for tupperware and infuriating flatpacks.

-Little Creatures (Freo): Good brews and food, though a few menu items are a little odd and it's reasonably expensive.

-Cicerello's (Freo): Good seafood, average prices. 

-The Monk (Freo): Good food/beer, average-slightly expensive.

-San Churro's (Freo/Northbridge): Nice desserts, very unhealthy, reasonably expensive for dessert.

-Fast Eddy's/Hog's Breath: Reasonable halfway points between scummy fast food and proper restaurants, though overpriced IMO.
 
-Gelare: Decent icecream, slightly overpriced.

-Baskin Robbins: As per Gelare, though fewer ""fancy"" desserts

-Mexican Kitchen (Freo): Half price nachos on tuesdays ($12), which are plenty enough to feed two. Very good milkshakes.

-Jus Burgers: Nice burgers, average price

-Sienna's: Nice food, nice place, price to match.

Shopping:

-Spud shed: Some really good specials, meat is good value, vegetables are cheap but inspect them thoroughly as plenty aren't any good.

-Harbour Town: I'm sure everyone knows it, but it's often very cheap. Money and time here will please any woman.

Clubs:

The Shed: Bad, would not recommend. Not a great atmosphere. Average bands. Probably one of the more violent spots. Would only recommend if you're looking for a fight (glassing).

Newport (Fremantle): Pretty good, slightly more relaxed, reasonable on Wednesday (student) nights.

Metropolis Fremantle: Average, reasonable on Saturday nights.

The Clink (Freo): Classless, dark atmosphere, not nice.

The Deen: Reasonable, closes fairly early though. Free entry. 

Paramount: Below average, classless. Free though, definitely a good spot to stop for an easy hookup/fight.

Air: faux prestige, not very interesting. Paid entry but worth giing if you get free tickets.

Mint: See Air, minus the ""classiness"".

Universal Bar: Average, busy for a ""bar"". Older crowd. 

HipE: Bad

Minq: Nice bar for a function, but not exciting. Drinks are extremely expensive.

Black Betty's: See ""The Shed""

Brass Monkey: Not bad, nice atmosphere, though not exciting.

Pretty stuff to look at:

-Obviously Kings Park/gardens

-Yanchep Park/caves

-Supreme Court Gardens

-The river from either South Perth or Matilda Bay

Does anyone else think this is really taking the piss?

Tipping in the states is fine cause the food is actual value for money and adding the 10% tip on is no biggie. Also, the servers there get paid very minimally so provide excellent service to earn the tip.

The servers here get paid the same as me. I don't ask for a tip to do my job.

After talking to other redditors on Thursday night, a plan was to go to the Moon &amp; Sixpence at 3pm on Saturday, sit outside and drink, eat and talk, and stay until late.

I don't want to see r/perth turn into a jobs board, but the quality of people coming through seek and recruiters hasn't been very good lately. I think a lot of people here are quite technical and maybe hoping to find people who aren't necessarily looking for jobs at the mo. 

We are a great company of 20 staff, with 15 of those being in the technical team. A great culture and great company to work for (although I may be biased).

These positions are the result of growth and this is a very exciting period to join a growing company. Any questions you can message me or I'll reply in the thread.

* A Hammock and Fire Pit!
* A constant supply of bacon, beer and Dr Pepper!

* Game of Thrones, Walking Dead and Dexter nights!

How much does this cost you say? For a low low price of $230 a fortnight you can live in this pristine abode that's close to Carousel (euck), Victoria Park and Curtin University for you academic types.

Other bills you ask? $35 a month for internet, other bills are split 4 ways.

We're pretty close to public transport if you're a bum like me.

I want to make /r/Perth  a better bigger place?
I have made some chat rooms for us to hang out in
Let’s get to know each other :-)


After the success of my recent post about “Perth Reddit mate’s rates” and things we can do for each other and random skills we have,  I was surprised to learn most of you were nice normal people and actually adults,  not 15yr old social anxiety cases or weirdos the normal hive mind of Reddit would have us believe...


So basically I want to get to know you all, and I want all of us to get to know each other. Perth can be a beautiful prison sometimes and finding new interesting people can be tough, 

I think we can make  /r/Perth  a bigger better place, have some good local discussions and get up some interesting posts 

I have made a chat-room for us Perth Redditors to hang out in... as an experiment

You don’t have to sign up, give your life or emails away..  Just enter your Reddit name or another name and we can “real-time”  Reddit chat together

Check out the chat-room

 * use http://www.chatzy.com/PerthChat for desktop  and 

or

 * http://www.chatzy.com/m/PerthChat  - for mobile / iphone version 

 
-   Click link and  open in a web browser - 

bookmark  in you browser or smart phone now..  should be mobile compatible.  ..   we can chat as a group and PM each other …  its an experiment, it might not work, will be slow at first but  lets see what happens..  :-)  


To help publicise it I made this pdf for trying to get us more members,  /r/Perth only has 4000 thousand Redditors. We could get a bigger community going easily I reckon..    Print out the pdf..  Go stick it on your local IGA notice board or something similar..  Let’s get all of Perth's interesting folk  onto Reddit..  Educate the masses and form a virtual Reddit community with discussions and real-time chat

Eventually we can all hold hands together on the beach,  sing Kumbaya and live in our Utopian desert dream together.. ….Or at the very least find someone interesting to have a beer with..

What do you think?
Here’s the pdf..  print it out and go stick it somewhere ,

http://www.filedropper.com/redditperth_1

•	If you want to be a moderator in one of the chat rooms let me know

•	if you can design a better flyer go for it

•	If you have ideas for other chat rooms I can make some.


Look forward to speaking to you all..

Its difficult to write, because I am still quite drunk, but its safe to say I had fun^3. I hope you all had a good time regardless of the second degree burns (dont worry gizza - the skin inside your mouth grows back real quick).

I thought it would be interesting to meet a few reddit peeps, but I didnt expect that so many people would show and that you'd all be so cool. I wish I'd spent more time talking to....everyone. 

I seriously can not get over how much fun that was. I thought it would be at least a little bit awkward. I was wrong. You all rock. 

Please post photos on the twitter or some other intertube so we can all view them. Anything but Facebook. 

So, what do we do next? I'd be perfectly happy doing the same thing again. Perhaps in a CBD pub so public transport is easier for everyone? That said, I feel the Rosemount is one of the best pubs in Perth and I dont know of many places that has the same kind of vibe and beer garden. 

**What do you guys think?** Paintball, go-carting and Quazar (sp?) were some other ideas thrown around. 

I personally think we should do at least one more pub meet - just so we can try and draw a few more ppl in. If we have a bigger group it will be easier to book paintball/cart/lazer activities without worrying about ppl not showing. 

Also I just like drinking, so consider my opinion biased. 

I'll cross post this to /r/Australia in the hope we can catch more WA people not subscribed to /r/Perth. 

Thanks again to everyone for making the effort to rock up - it really was awesome. 

edit: special thanks to puddlejumper for inadvertently providing us with about 30 free shots. That was a nice kickstarter. It also made me feel less guilty for assuming that the table with the wheelchair lady and the dwarf with no arms was the reddit group.

The store I work at in Cockburn is shutting down soon, and I thought I'd give you guys the heads up. I think officially we start marking down everything by 25% on Tuesday (ie: the actual closing down sale starts this tuesday.) However if anyone from here decides to come in before then I'll give you guys 25% off everything today.

I hope nobody thinks I'm using r/perth for advertising here. I just know we'll be starting our sales soon and I wanted to give you guys the heads up in case you wanted to come grab the good stuff.

For the record, Waldecks Cockburn is a garden centre. We carry a large selection of plants, pots, indoor and outdoor furniture, water features and garden accessories. 

Location is 83 Hammond Road, Cockburn Central, next to Tony Ales. ",,False,self,t5_2r78m,False,,,True,t3_ush5q,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/ush5q/waldecks_in_cockburn_central_is_closing_down/,

I've recently moved to Perth from Auckland, New Zealand and I think locals attitudes should change.

First of all, these are problems that locals have identified:
* ""Perth is boring."" I think people here only say this, because they live inland and don't explore the main things about Perth. A guy I spoke to recently, has lived here all his life, and has never visited Scarborough Beach. At my uni, Curtin, it seems like 50%+ of the students I've spoken to have only been to Scarborough Beach or Hilary's a few times in their life. Wtf.

* ""Perth has the worst public transport in the world."" This is normally when I want to pull out a baseball bat, and pummel someone. As a user of public transport every week day, I have never been more impressed in my life. Catching the train from Whitfords to Canning Bridge Station is so easy, you never have to look up scheduled times, because it's every few minutes. The train system is amazing. People say Melbourne's transport is amazing, but having visited many times, it's really not. SMARTRIDERS are the best as well!

* ""Perth is backwards."" How? Perth is such a **clean**, modern city. HOWEVER: Use of Eftpos is ridiculous here. Throughout my time living in NZ I never carried cash. Now I carry at least $50 on me, because so many places don't accept my card. In fact, I never use Eftpos anymore :( Meaning, I can't keep track of my transactions.

* ADVERTISING. People here are the worst. People that live elsewhere exaggerate how awesome their city is. People in Perth however, exaggerate how bad we have it. It's culturally trendy to bash Perth, and I often feel pressured into agreeing with my peers. I think there's a lot more patriotic people living here, but it's almost a bad thing to love this city. Before moving here, I had never even heard of Perth. Yet I knew of Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Perth needs to stop being so submissive, and be more aggressive in showing the world who it is.

* Weather. Perth wins. ITS LIKE SUMMER ALL ALL YEAR, EVERY YEAR.

* BEACHES. Sydney boasts about how popular it's Bondi Beach is. It's only so popular because it's conveniently located next to the biggest CBD in Australia. Perth however, has the cleanest and most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. Mullaoo Beach and Scarborough Beach on calm days look just like we're living on a tropical island. You cannot believe how lucky you have it here, yet people seem to ignore the beaches. 

* PEOPLE. People here are not like the rest of Australia. Actually people here are unusual for such a large city. Never have I experienced and more open, friendly and attractive bunch of people in my life. When i got here, I couldn't overcome how welcome people were of me. And also, SMOKING HOT. Perth has to have the most attractive girls in Australia. All along the coast, especially along West Coast Drive by Hillary's, there are an unlimited amount walking everywhere.

* FITNESS. Related to people above, but I have never seen so many in shape people in my life. And so many people along the coast exercising in groups in public with personal trainers, or jogging/walking along the coastal footpaths/bike paths, or swimming. It's just unreal at how active and healthy everybody keeps. 

In conclusion, Perth has an amazing lifestyle. More people need to realise that and make use of it. Promotion needs to change as well. Out of all the cities in the world, Perth is currently ranked [8th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_most_livable_cities). Perth is one of the best cities to live, one of the best lifestyles to experience, one of the best places to be in the entire world.",,False,self,t5_2r78m,False,,,True,t3_g2ll1,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/g2ll1/why_do_so_many_of_you_hate_perth/,

Also, my car had MOVED up a spot [I was behind another car, and now I was behind the curb]. I checked my handbrake and it was on. It's a huge longshot but did anyone witness anything?

Edit: Forgot another gem. A-town, the local aboriginal gang wanted to fight some mouldys at my school, they jumped the fence during lunch armed with machetes and baseball bats. Safe to say none of the mouldys were to be found anywhere. The ironic thing is, that was about 4 years ago, the Maoris are now grown as massive guys and I have heard they seem to be winning the fights now.

Edit2: Thanks for the stories guys, I use to roll round with my boys back in my high school years and used to have a new story each week because of our shenanigans. Since leaving and going to uni (so gay) nothing badass has happened to me apart from a couple things so I really enjoy reading and relating to these stories.

They included about $5 million over four years for a project to strip nutrients entering the fragile Swan River system by restoring wetlands around Ellenbrook and building or repairing rock walls.""

They're holding it for forensic investigation and I should be able to get it back around the end of this week.

There were 16 of us (out of 36 seats to a cinema) and the staff proceeded to take all the orders for food/drinks and THEN associate them to seats.

There is no self-service option for water - just Coke, Sprite and Diet Coke. So I had to queue up again for a container that would have been no more than 250ml (1 cup) worth of the stuff...

They did not announce that the trailer/movie had started, and we were not directed to our allocated seats - had to find them ourselves. Sure not hard, but then again, how hard it is for a employee to at least point us to the right ones?

Also, although the wider chairs have little tables - there are no cupholders. Standard on a regular cinema seat, but not your luxury ones? Doesn't make sense to me.

The hot chocolate I ordered was barely a shot worth - probably 3/4 of the glass was froth. I can't comment on value for money on my $8.50 chips and $14.00 chicken burger - because I NEVER GOT THEM. Despite that whole ordering debacle earlier or I never received my meal - which I had skipped lunch for.

I found out later they had delivered my order - to two completely different seats without checking. What was the point in associating the orders with the seat numbers then?

I wasn't the only one who didn't get what I had requested prior to the movie.

For the record, I didn't pay myself, it was my employer. But when they had spent over $600 on the seats alone, not to mention food and drink well...it's a total joke. You would expect more for that.

Formal complaints have been lodged and phone calls will be made tomorrow. I am still so angry at how bad it was.

We saw Prometheus. The movie itself is actually quite good, you should see it at some stage - but just hopefully not with the experience I had...maybe rent it. My first and last time I will be doing that with Hoyts. And I have had some bad movie experiences in my time.

Just thought you would like to know, and I had to vent a little. That's all. I would actively encourage people not to go, waste of time and money.

**It was fucking awful.**

Just on our car club alone, there's been a spate of thefts involving high-performance and modified cars all over the city. 

People are just walking into houses and taking keys, or threatening occupants to hand over wallets and car keys. Workshops are being knocked over, as well as the f**king AAC car impound yard the cops use to hold their confiscated cars ($30,000 HSV taken from the impound yard the other week)

Just this week there's been a WRX, a Liberty, and a turbo XR6 stolen in the space of two days. Even my brothers car was stolen on Christmas eve - someone walked in and helped themself. Watching the Perth Crime Watch facebook page, it's easily seen how frequently this happens.

Keep your doors locked, even when you're at home. Clearly these thieves know that the current legal system will just give them a slap on the wrist, and I know the police are just as frustrated with the situation.

Since we're not allowed to shoot the pricks, honestly guys, keep your stuff locked up and keys hidden. This is just becoming ridiculous. 

---------UPDATE-------------

From the owner on another forum:


""Update: My car has been found - written off in Thornlie. used stolen plates from a car this morning and was in numerous car chases over the past few day/nights (outrun cops on all accounts) and crashed head on into another passenger car today. 2 people arrested and in questioning.""

The great reveal also happens now!

The event happens at everyone favourite Perth/Northbridge hangout; 1Up Microcinema!
(https://www.facebook.com/pages/1UP-Microcinema/154584244586389) (312 William Street, Northbridge WA 6003)

I've organised with the owner (Matt) to host this shindig there and allow us to have a little fun.
I will be bringing down some 360s and some HALO4 that can be played, some internetly RvB, and I will introduce you all to a lovely game I was introduced to at RTX called; Cards Against Humanity.
There will be a small fee ($5 per person) payable to 1UP Microcinema for the rental of their facilities. We've tried to kept it as low as possible so to not exclude anyone because of ridiculous costs... but people gotta eat and pay rent. There will also be snacks available to purchase so if you have a tingle in your tastebud for Peanut M&amp;Ms or Junior Mints, 1UP has you covered.

Plan is to meetup at 1UP Microcinema at about lunch time, grab some food (at Jus Burger or similar) and then enjoy the next couple of hours.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to contact me here and I'll try to give you the best answer I can.
I'll try to keep everyone updated as I come to learn more or decide upon further details.

I once saw an interesting post which i can no longer find about living in a City in Australia without much money. I have been backpacking for just under a year now and in July i am headed to Perth on a working holiday visa, with enough money to enter the country on this visa so dont worry.

I am wondering what tips and tricks people know about Perth, are there all you can drink nights at certain bars? where can i eat decent food for cheap? should i live in hostels or is it cheaper to rent a room? Are there 2 for 1 offers which are good or all you can eat buffets on certain days?

Basically any information about the city and how to get by on a budget would be great!

also information on cheap activity's and things to see, half price cinemas for example or free enter to art gallery's and museums.

I was wondering if there are enough people interested in a Paintball meet up... hopefully there are enough people interested to make up two teams. (you can even make your own team names or logo!)
I think minimum team size should be 4 so we can have a few matches 4 vs 4 but would prefer teams of 6 -8


It will of course be held on a weekend, the date is open and likely not to be till after christmas / new years as most people will have their calendar full at this time of the year. 
I'm just getting in early to see what number of people I can expect before making bookings and everything.


If I can guarantee enough people I will arrange transport to and from the paintball grounds. (I'll rent out a Van or two for the day)


The only expense you will have to cover is the standard fees for the Paintballing itself, usually between $30 to $70+ depending on the amount of paintballs you require.


I was thinking of this location / company for the event:http://www.wasppaintball.com.au/

Unless anyone knows of any others they prefer?


And for the alcoholics among us, I will try to arrange post drinks back in the city somewhere (most likely at Moon &amp; Sixpence) where we can get drunk and regale on the events of the day. 

I would really like to make this into a proper event, make a day out of it, the winning team will even get a Trophy!

Thoughts?

Just saw this on the news but have mixed emotions. Initially, I was feeling ""Wow, we have an alternative like the rest of the country"" then found out it was a simple 10% discount of gas usage (no other charges) plus you need to sign a 24 month contract.

Sure, you can take that contract with you if you move house - but as a current Alinta Customer with a 2-month gas usage bill of around $110 ($87 is actual usage), this is going to save me less than the amount of GST I pay on the total bill.

What happens when Dodo, AGL or Origin Energy decide that they can undercut Kleenheat in 3 months time? Has the free market been opened, or in typical WA style has the state government only opened it to Kleenheat in exchange for some other dodgy deal?

Just found out 4 hrs ago that I'm moving from the US to Perth in May,18,1,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/rg7kf/alright_perth_redditorsi_need_your_help_just/,"My wife and I are both about 30...no kids yet, but plan on having them in the next couple of years.  We're moving from the US (near Houston, TX) and should be arriving sometime between early May &amp; late June.  Neither of us have ever been to Australia...I've been to mainland Europe, and she's never left N. America.  We're really looking forward to soaking up Perth!

First priority is figuring out where to live.  I've done some research and it looks like there are several good areas to live in.  The criteria are below:

Probably looking to spend ~$1000/wk (if we need to spend that much).  We're thinking something that will be near all the ""action"", like shopping, restaurants, parks, gyms, public transport, etc., but not too crazy.  I will be working downtown, and do NOT want a super long commute in the morning or evenings (no more than 30 min max).  We're in a single-family home now, but don't necessarily need that in Perth...a townhouse, flat, apartment, etc. would be OK.  We'd like to live around other young professionals...not too ""university"" of a crowd, but not a bunch of uptight older folks either.  If at all possible, a view of the water (Swan River, a small lake, the Ocean...whatever) would be awesome, but not a necessity.

We'll be renting...not buying.

From everything I've read, Subiaco &amp; Freo seem like a couple of places we'd enjoy, for different reasons.  That being said, they're probably more high-demand, so I want to know from the locals what some of the better places to live may be given our criteria.

Any guidance you all could provide would be awesome, and I'm sure I'll have follow up questions based on what you tell me.

Can't wait to get over there and start the experience!

And I'm furious that they targeted a charity fundraiser. If anyone is interested, I wrote an email to the City of Cambridge Local Government:

To whom it may concern,

I'm writing in regards to last Sunday's CHARITY FUNDRAISER event, The City to Surf. I ran in the 12km race and had a wonderful time. The organisers did a great job managing 40 000 people on the day and the event seemed to go without a hitch. There was a really nice buzz around city beach - everyone really seemed to be enjoying this COMMUNITY event. This pleasant mood was marred by your stupid decision to appoint a park ranger to issue parking fines to motorists who parked on the verge. The carparks had been cordoned off for the event and there wasn't enough parking for the 40 000 COMMUNITY members on the day, forcing them to park (safely) on the verge. I believe the local government is there to look after the COMMUNITY'S  best interest and i believe you let down the people of the city of Cambridge on Sunday. It is my opinion that you should cancel all the infringements that were issued on that day.

Next time there is a movement by the state government to reduce the responsibilities of the local governments I will be supporting it whole heartedly because I really think the WA local governments arent looking after their own communities.

regards,

City of Cambridge Community Member.

• What are Perth’s landmarks that lots of people might know? 

• Any Famous Stories about Perth that stand out? 

• Any World Records? Top 5 in the world ...etc...

Termites, perhaps? It's a pain in the ass when you have to wall mount a TV and wire in an extra outlet, for example.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your responses!

So far the main reasons seem to be:

* Sheer abundance of brick supplies
* Lack of availabile timber supplies in suitable quantities
* Our sandy soils don't lend themselves well to suitable foundations

So we've decided to put the cats up for adoption, and with the recent successes of the cat haven adoption drives - i thought i'd try here first.

So they are two male purebred ragdolls, both approximately 1 year old. Loki is a sealpoint, with pedigree papers, bartleby has some unique markings, however didn't come with any papers. They are both toilet trained, microchipped and de-sexed.

They're going to come with absolutely everything a first-time cat owner will need, including toys/scratching pole/tray/litter/food/beds.

We're not looking to make any money - it's more important that we find a suitable loving home, it's also equally as important that we don't separate them.

So if you're interested, reply here or shoot me a pm.

I have a small first aid kit (and training) but if anyone else has one they can slip in their bags it would be good. For anyone interested, we will be stopping in the pub afterwards for a lunch. Look forward to seeing everyone there!



Due to the short notice on my last attempt, this never happened. But I know there is great interest for a reddit hiking meetup. 



Saturday the 31st March, we shall meet at 9am at the Mundaring Weir hotel, and from what someone said, there is a 7km trail starting from there. Or based on the discussion in here, we can travel in convoy to another starting location. 



Everyone who comes needs to be self sufficient for food and water! Everyone is welcome to go at their own pace, and we (hopefully not just I) will wait at the end to make sure everyone gets back safely!



All feedback welcome


Edit: As Boramere has offered, if you need a lift, speak up! I live in Yokine, he lives in Belmont

Edit: will make the next one on sunday to make everyone happy :)

Edit: Just found a description of the trail, its not a rough trail by any means, and will be good to gauge  everyones fitness, and what everyone wants to get out of it

I'm getting married in February to my long-time girlfriend (known her for 11 years!) in Belgium (where I am from). She is coming to visit in October for two weeks, and it's her first time to Australia, and by subsumption Perth. 

I want to show her the best of Perth and ensure she has the best time of her life, and apart from my bedroom (aww yeah?), I already have the following:

- Kings Park
- John Forest
- Rottnest Island
- Diving around Rottnest
- Diving at Rockingham
- Fremantle Markets
- Going out in Freo (Mojo's etc.)
- The Beach
- Hillarys
- South West wine region (any recommendations?)
- Swan region

And I realise most of these are all fairly common, and we all have different reasons for liking or not liking them. But as a fairly recent addition to this wonderful city, I bet there is a ton of special places I have never even heard of.

So my question to you is: 

If you had one chance to show one place to the woman you love dearest demonstrating how fantastic Perth is, one place that pings your and her soul and puts you in that special place where all is good and life is great, and you know memories will be shared with that same intensity, what would that place be?

Can anyone advise the best places to start looking for somewhere to live for example?

I've read things about the Perth meetup you had, so I know that there are (normal?!) people out there to say hello to... So is there any advice you can give to someone starting from scratch to quell the nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach?!

The Sail and Anchor in Fremantle,

Little Creatures in Fremantle

My preferred is Little Creatures, but the Perth one may be more accessible to people.

 
There has also been a suggestion to do something for the under 18s crowd and the Saturday night workers crowd, so how about a BBQ at Kings Park on a Sunday evening.

I'm looking to get back into the climbing while here in Perth but don't have that many friends who are keen on it. 

I was thinking of heading down this Sunday to Rockface in Northbridge if anyone fancies a meetup and meet some new climbing partners?

I'm not sure what time of day just yet, probably mid afternoon or so. Anyone interested, post below!

UPDATE: Ok, I'm thinking mid-late afternoon, say about 3 o clock and stay til about 6? I'm not sure how late Rockface is open on Sunday but I've gotta split around then anyway. 

ed19 - come along, if it's something your interested in getting into either myself or someone else who comes can show you the ropes (pun completely intended) and you can take it from there. I'll send the rest of you interested folks a PM with my number and you can let me know if you're keen on the day itself. 

UPDATE 2: Just a heads up on entry prices - day pass = $18 (or $15 for students). You can hire gear there if you need (i.e. harness and shoes). I think a day pass and gear combo is $30.

Do you leave gaps while you're stopped at the lights for people to turn across your lane into another street? Do you wave and mouth ""thanks"" if someone lets you turn out in front of them, into, or over, their lane? Do you stand on the horn if someone forgets to take off as soon as the lights turn green? Do you squish up to the lights so you're not blocking the turning slip lanes? Do you stop slightly to the left, or right, at the lights to let motorcyclists through to the front?  
I expect people to leave a space for me to turn across them, but I always wave and say thanks. Hell, I even smile at people as they walk across a crosswalk.  
My driveway is obscured by two bangers of trees on one side and the other side is an intersection. The street I live on has a 50km/h limit, but everyone seems to drive at 60, so everytime I back out there's always someone roaring around the corner, right up my ass. One time, an old dude had to stop (heaven forbid) and wait for me to back out so he beeped his horn at me. Horns scare the crap out of me and I end up shaking for the next hour. So, on that occasion I flipped a shaky bird.

Something that has had me really frustrated on the roads since I moved to Clarkson, and hence have had to use the freeway much longer distance, is people sitting in the right had lane doing under the speed limit.

What is the proper etiquette for this?

I shouldn't really have to under-take them as this is dangerous and they are breaking the law, so I sit there (maybe a little too close) until I get super-frustrated and finally go around them.

Lately I have taken to giving a quick flick of the lights, but rarely has this achieved anything as I am guessing these drivers have no awareness of what is going on behind them, hence their inconsiderate driving habits.

So what can we do about this problem? I don't really want to honk my horn, as this seems to be an invitation in WA that you want to have a punch-up at the next traffic lights, and obviously I am not going to call the cops about granny driving 80 in the fast lane.

I have found this occurring more and more lately, and my colleague from Sydney, who was over for a couple of days, even noted that he couldn't believe how many people here would sit in the right lane with miles of clear road ahead of them and a dozen cars banked up behind them.

Do we need more road signs to make it clear that it is an offense to sit in the right lane when not overtaking?  We could at least put it on those LED signs above the freeway that rarely seem to be used.

Anyway, I don't know if there is a magic solution, I more just wanted to vent! 

I think I will buy one of those LED signs for my back window and get it to scroll ""get out of the right lane"" after I am in front of the perp.

I know this isn't the normal place to do this, however I thought I might put this out to the /r/perth community before Gumtree.

Here is a [link](http://imgur.com/a/Xn5C8#0) and as you can see my beautiful, now 3 months old, grey kitten is needing a stable and loving permanent home. He is the last of four that needs somewhere to be his forever-home. 
After a few attempts on FB, I can't seem to find anyone who understands the importance of the cat needing to be snip/chipped/vaccinated in line with the new WA cat laws, or are stable.
By stable and permanent I kind of mean anyone who has put a great deal of thought into getting a pet and would be people who have been in a long term relationship (or happily single), have a long term rental or own their home and would be financially sound to look after a pet and getting the necessities done. 
It was my absolute intention to have all the kittens to the vet before re-homing however I lost a job the week before Christmas and have only just started a new one. 

A bit about Schmosby; I think the name says it all.  
He's a very loving and friendly cat who gets along with everyone. He is good around other cats and although he's never met a dog, I believe he would accustom himself favourably to other animals and children. He can be very playful but also likes to cuddle. His favourite play toy is fluff and feathers, and it can be very entertaining to watch him growl with it in his mouth. He also likes to watch the TV when we play video games. Schmosby is wormed and flea treated, litter trained and likes to eat kitten biscuits and wet food. 
The place I get all my information about the new WA cat laws is  [Shenton Park Cat Haven website](http://www.cathaven.com.au/new-wa-cat-laws/) You will also find information about their Vet Clinic services.

If you would love the addition of Schmosby in your home, please PM me, you may share this with family and friends who suit the criteria above. The option of meeting Schmosby in person is available.

We want to make sure Schmosby will settle into a home where he will be loved always and life will be simple.
