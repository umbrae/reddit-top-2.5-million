  Half of you that post here aren't introverts. I see way too many posts from people who basically say ""I'm so introverted because.."", and it usually ends with how you don't interact socially with anyone, and spend massive amounts of time on the computer playing games. **THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU AN INTROVERT!** Know what it makes you? asocial. Sitting inside playing video games and neglecting peer to peer, or even family relationships is nothing to celebrate. It's not healthy, and its not indicative of somebody who is introverted.    


Do you want to know what does make you an introvert?    

* The tendency to think introspectively rather than go to someone else with your problems.

* The need to recharge after social situations.  


That's about it in a very generalized nut shell. You're not an introvert if you don't have friends. You cannot classify yourself as an introvert simply because you play video games and watch movies. And if you intentionally neglect relationships, you're still **NOT** an introvert. If you're still unsure whether or not you are an introvert [take the test](http://www.personalitypathways.com/type_inventory.html), or read [about some common misconceptions](http://www.carlkingdom.com/10-myths-about-introverts), all found on the side bar.


Downvote it, but i'm sick of seeing introversion labeled as something its not. This is the reason why we as introverts are labeled as lessers to extroverts. Stop giving off the wrong ideas, please, and get your facts straight.

Thank you for correcting me on the difference between Anti-social, and asocial Zireff.

1355716683.0,570,self.introvert,14z559,15 PROTIPs for Introverts,629,59,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/14z559/15_protips_for_introverts/,"A number of posts on here have posed questions on how to deal with life as an introvert. I'm 41, and thought I'd share a bunch of protips I've collected over my lifetime that may help.

Feel free to ask me questions if you wish. And please, use the discussion to disagree, enhance what I said, or share more tips. I'd love to collect more of them.

1. **Understand that introversion is just caused by brain chemistry**: The short version is that introverts are sensitive to dopamine. When we get too much, we feel overstimulated. The most dominant pathway for us is acetylcholine, the part that affects attention and learning, as well as the ability to sustain a calm, alert feeling. Extroverts, in comparison, have a low sensitivity to dopamine, and in fact, don't get enough of it unless they get help from the adrenaline system. They need excitement to feel good.

2. **Understand how extroverts and introverts are different**: Extroverts primarily use the adrenaline pathway of the brain, which is a very short loop mostly in the middle of the brain. It only touches on five parts of the brain: the alertness center, the thirst and appetite center, a relay station called the posterior thalamus, the emotional center, and the motor area and sensory processing center. All of this, you'll note, is more about action, movement, and external-focused functions. In contrast, the primary introvert pathway has **seven** parts to it, and travels from the middle of the brain all the way to the frontal lobe, and back again to the middle. This includes the parts of the brain that has our inner monologue, the reasoning and learning center, the long-term memory center, and then finally to the part that attaches feelings to thoughts. No surprise that introverts easily get overstimulated. It ""costs"" introverts more to be around a lot of stimulation. We literally think and ""monologue"" about everything that goes on around us.

3. **Recharge like an introvert**: Introverts need quiet to recharge and consolidate events they've experienced. Even though extroverts relax by being in stimulating environments and often suggest you do the same, you should recharge in a way that is comfortable for you. Forcing yourself to do it their way isn't helpful.

4. **Know what introversion isn't**: Introversion is NOT equivalent to shyness, social anxiety, or anti-social behavior. It has nothing to do with the amount of friends you have. It doesn't mean that you don't like parties or being around people, or even performing on stage. Any of these things might apply to you, but they are separate from your introversion, even if they could be somewhat related. For example, you may not like parties because you don't like the crowds and loud music, even if you enjoy meeting new people and have no shyness whatsoever.

5. **Dump the negativity**: Look up introvert in Google, and you get this: ""A shy, reticent, and typically self-centered person."" It's garbage, and its the same in most dictionaries. These definitions have unnecessary negative baggage. I suggest losing that negative meaning, and just understand that it really means simply that you have a different brain chemistry.

6. **Do the required reading**: Read [The Introvert Advantage] (http://www.amazon.com/Introvert-Advantage-Thrive-Extrovert-World/dp/0761123695/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355713299&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+introvert+advantage) by Marti Olsen Laney. It is a wonderful book and explains in detail what it means to be an introvert. The brain chemistry explanations from the earlier points came from that book, but there's a lot more tips, advice, and information in it as well.
 
7. **Schedule downtime**: Build downtime into your schedule. Block out days where you plan to do...nothing. If you want to spend a quiet day in bed where you don't even take off your pajamas, you are allowed. This is where well-meaning but confused extroverts might think that you're depressed or not feeling well. But this is downtime, not withdrawing from life. When you do this you will have MORE energy, not less. If you are still young it's important to let your family know that you just need downtime if they pressure you to try to recharge like an extrovert.

8. **Noise-canceling headphones are your friend**: There's almost no easier way to get some instant quiet time than using them. 

9. **Exercise**: This is good advise for anyone but this is helpful for introverts because it will give you more energy to work with since it takes more of it for us to be around stimulation.

10. **Party Tip #1: Get out of the action**: Extroverts often like constant stimulation and stay in the middle of the action the entire time. If you take ""quiet"" breaks you'll have an easier time. 

11. **Party Tip #2: Schedule your goodbyes**: You can make it easy to marshal your energy for even very loud and overwhelming parties if you know what time you're going to leave. You might even enjoy the craziness for a while since you know it's for a limited time. Tell your friends that you have to go by a certain time, and parties can become easier.

12. **Party tip #3: Have a role**: If you have a role to focus on, for example being the photographer or being the DJ, it can help keep you from being overwhelmed. It gives our active minds something to focus on.

13. **Party tip #4: Find quiet spaces**: Know where the getaways are if you've got a longer event. Lobbies or quieter rooms can give you a break. 

14. **Party tip #5: Wind down afterwards**: Some people can party 'till they drop but usually introverts need some time immediately after events to chill out. Make that wind down time part of your party plan. I usually plan on an hour or more of quiet at home after an event.

I need help.",729,168,538,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1210gl/hi_im_a_scared_college_student_and_i_need_to_talk/,"Hi. This is the first time I've ever made a Reddit post.. and this is indeed a throwaway.. more like an alternate account I guess, but whatever. 

I come to you, r/introvert, because I feel you will better relate to my problems and share greater insight and perhaps how you got through the situation I'm in.

For starters I am 19, and a sophomore engineering major in a Tech School. To put it bluntly, my grades are terrible. I'm not stupid, in fact I feel more intelligent than a majority of the people here.. but I'm not smarter than them. I'm that kid from the TIL's that was always told how smart I am, and I never tried in school and got progressively lower grades (from straight A's to C's to F's). I don't apply myself. I just sit in my room playing video games with friends feeling like it's too late and I've fucked my life up. This is my 3rd semester and I haven't pulled my shit together. 

I don't want to hear college may not be for me, even if it's true. Where would I go otherwise? Call me an elitist, but I don't know that I could handle being stuck with idiots all day, everyday. I'm scared and don't know what to do.

I guess all I'm really asking is how to kick-start my life. How did you do it?",,False,,t5_2qlr2,False,,,True,t3_1210gl,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1210gl/hi_im_a_scared_college_student_and_i_need_to_talk/,

So the last day of class. My teacher was just talking to the class and then she turned to me and said ""why are you quiet? What's different about you?"" (I was kinda offended that im ""different"" but whatever). 

Then I replied, ""why should I talk to someone who has the intent to reply instead of the intent to understand?"". The very second, the bell rang, class ended and I walked out. That night there was many FB statuses on how ""deep"" my answer was.

To others he was quiet but to those of us who knew him well didn't speak of him as such.  He was the type of person that people automatically associated with the 'school shooter' type just because he didn't really like to talk to people he didn't know but I tried to explain to him that this is completely normal.  I don't blame him for thinking this way at all.  To be plainly honest, human beings can be completely selfish douchebags.  

I went to school with him so I saw firsthand some of the abuse he received from other students for being who he was.  It was these people that first made him take a step back from interacting with others and it carried on with him into his adult life.  A girl in our science class Freshman year who the teacher had seated next to him said:  ""I don't know him and I don't want to get to know him"" to the class aloud which made everyone laugh.  This of course resulted in him getting teased by the rest of the popular kids in the class the rest of the year while the teacher barely did anything about it.  

For the rest of his high school career others made fun of him for how he looked, how he didn't talk to anyone, or how he dressed.  Ironically it was all of this that made him turn his back on people and just keep the people close to him in his life.  Anyone else was ignored.  Fast forward to our graduation, our principal had asked everyone to politely wait for applause until after diploma acceptance was over but everyone in the auditorium clapped for everyone anyway.  Except for my friend.  

He had worked a few dead end jobs here and there there.  The co workers treatment towards him wasn't really any different.  The classic question all of us introverts hate ""Why are you so quiet""?  He was even asked this after trying his best to socialize with everyone at work, but he was one of the rare workers that actually came to work to work and not socialize but for some reason this is usually looked down upon in the work place.  

From what he was telling me over the past couple of months all of his trouble with his jobs was seriously troubling him and his latest job was working with mostly girls who had attitudes was distressing him greatly so he chose to quit out of frustration.  He had some trouble finding another job.  Went in for interviews and no one would hire him despite his fantastic work ethic.  

Today I got a call from his younger brother that he had ended his own life today and out of respect for his family I would rather now say how...  

My point in sharing his story with you guys because this might sound like you and I just want to say that no matter how people have wrong you in life and you might feel like they made you who you are please let it go!  Live your life with love and indeed keep those close around you because its true most people don't give a fuck about other people. 

Thank you for reading.  Please pray for his family and friends.  

Love

On a final, semi-related note. There are some in /r/introvert, not many, but some, who have become convinced that introversion is something that makes them unique and better. It doesn't, claiming such ideas as 'extroverts don't experience the richness of the world as deeply as introverts do' or treating them rudely because they themselves aren't introverts and don't understand us is not going to help us bridge the idea that introverts and extroverts aren't different species who are inherently divided.

The problem is that I'm not smart, and I won't accomplish anything great. I'm an idiot and a future failure.

Many people around me think I worked hard to know all I know today. I always tell them ""No, I just spend my time thinking more than you do. All you have to do is stop doing all the busy work life gives you and give yourself time to focus on life itself.""

What I don't tell most people is that I sit in silence for hours even days at a time with nothing but thoughts. My thoughts consume me, I get lost in my ideas. I begin acting upon one thought I have, half way though I lose it and I'm just surrounded by half completed projects, goals, stories, and life decisions. 

They only see what I accomplish and only hear what I think I can accomplish. They only see the pretty picture on the movie screen, not the cold hard wall behind it just waiting to crumble. How I appear to people is nothing but a puppet to me. I control what this puppet does and I just examine how others react to the puppet. I find extroverts interesting, I like to study them, see what makes them tick ya' know?

People hate me, people love me, people don't even know I exist. This is all the result of me experimenting with my puppet. I notice the outcome of certain forms of social interaction, take mental note of them, and continue playing around. It's only when I'm alone I can feel serious.

When I'm alone, that's when I can be me. I like this time I have and I cherish it. I actually have emotions, interests, and motivation when I'm alone. Sure, I have those sad lonely days but I still love them because it's my time.

I was excited and curious - i'd never talked to other introverts before. But the excitment didn't last very long. Instead I found myself becoming frustrated.

I joined the community with the desire to learn more about myself. But as I spent more time here, it became quickly apparent that this community isn't about introversion, it's about anti-extroversion.

Each time I visited the page i'd see the same posts:

* ""This is how I feel when people ask me why I don't talk""
* ""How can I explain to my extroverted friends that I need time alone""
* ""Help me understand my introversion""
* ""Extroverts just don't understand""

The comment threads (regardless of topic) would always contain venomous, spiteful posts about the superiority of introverts and the many ways in which we're superior. It wore me down to a stage where I no longer wanted to identify as an introvert, as the only other introverts i'd seen appeared to be smug, hateful and ignorant.

Over the past few months i've grown increasingly alienated from this community, and i've seriously considered unsubscribing all together. But before I do, I want to talk to you guys about this.

Let's talk about it. I assume there are just as many murders by people who are social butterflies before they snap. I also assume withdrawn in these cases is often likely due to mental health issues and not simply an introverted temperament. 

Yes, shy and introverted are not the same thing, but quietness could result from either and in mainstream minds we're all lumped together, so that's moot.

However, this is a subreddit for *introversion*, which by definition is not shyness. 

In fact, there's a handy guide in the sidebar that describes what the main difference is: introverts can be just as outgoing and gregarious as extroverts, but it drains our batteries to interact with people. We also tend to think better when we're working on our own as opposed to discussing something in a large group.

Introversion is *not* a condition where you're afraid to talk to people or uncomfortable about anything that isn't the safety of your own room. While many introverts will certainly understand those feelings, they aren't relevant to the topic that this subreddit was created to address. I am an introvert who is also an atheist, but I wouldn't post topics about atheism here even if it became clear that the majority of you were also introvert/atheists. It's just not the place for it.

Please keep this in mind the next time you post something in r/introvert about a problem that stems from social anxiety. I ask this because we already face a certain amount of stigma from society about who we are (""You can't be an introvert, you're not shy!"") and if not even the introverts themselves can accurately define what it means, then it only further muddies the waters of what introversion is. If you have a post about social anxiety, there's a place for it: r/SocialAnxiety.

I'm 28 and only recently have I really learnt to accept myself for who I am. I didn't even know there was something called introversion. For the longest time I used to think that something was wrong with me for not liking what everybody else seemed to. It is such a relief to know that there are people like me everywhere.

I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to all you people here. This subreddit and the various books I've recently read on introversion has really helped me clear out a load of rubbish from my mind.

1344209205.0,233,self.introvert,xqhyd,What I have learned about life,279,46,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/xqhyd/what_i_have_learned_about_life/,"Let me start off by telling you a little about myself. I'm a 23 year old university student majoring in anthropology. My family came to the US when I was 4, in order to escape the threats in Argentina during the dirty wars. As a child, I was very cautious when speaking out against anything, so I thought about things allot. I grew up watching people live their lives, forming connections in my head (an, A causing B resulting in C kind of thing). Then I grew up, and got a job at myspace as a content specialist. Other than making me emotionally numb (you people wouldn't believe the kinds of graphic content I had to filter out), it taught me that the world is much more complicated than others want you to think. These are some of the things that I have learned:

1). Be cautious when choosing your friends. 
-This is what innies do best, we watch and listen to people until our minds tell us it's okay to relax. It takes us more time to trust others, which may get in the way of making allot of friends but saves us from having to deal with the shitty people and drama that other less cautious folks tell us about. 

2). Happiness is overrated. 
-Don't believe those who say that not being happy all of the time is a mental disorder. We should at the very most be content most of the time, and cherish the few moments of happiness that we do get rather than feel sad or depressed when our expectations don't fit reality.

3).Don't believe the media 
-(no brainer, right?). There will always be people like me filtering out the bad stuff so that viewers and users like you can continue to think what others allow you to. 

4). I, alone, am not important. 
-parents have raised my generation to think very highly of themselves, as if their existence means the world to everyone that they come in contact with. What their parents failed to mention was that the world is a big place. Nobody in history has change the world on their own without needing help from others. We are all just as important as the next person, some appear more so only because they have the guts to go above and beyond the limits that we impose on ourselves (ie. going public/being the ""face"" of whatever movement even if it gets you shot). 

5). Question everything.
-This I cannot stress enough. Know that there is no such thing as right or wrong, what we think is temporary until we find contradictions.   Question this list, your professors, laws, theories, your senses, etc. Use your brain, often. 

6). Comparing yourself with people who have more than you benefits nobody. 
-instead, focus on those who have less. It will bring your spirits up and may even encourage you to help them out. Empathy is not a weakness, it is what allowed our species to survive this long.

7). Beauty means nothing unless you plan on whoring yourself out in the real world. 

8). Our species does not benefit from sunbathing.
-Ever wonder why our natural hair color is always darker than our skin? It's a protective adaptation, the hair attracts the sun's rays and protects our skin. Tanning is mal-adaptive, hence skin cancer.

9). People under estimate the power of the human body.
-we can heal ourselves, create energy reserves in the form of fat that will keep us alive when we have little access to food, sweat to cool ourselves off, a brain that releases adrenaline to help us out in tough situations, antibodies in breast milk that get absorbed by babies when breast feeding, and the list keeps going. Yet some people are brainwashed into associating fat with beauty, replacing breast milk with formula as if it were a viable alternative, and preventing children from playing outdoors because it is ""dangerous."" What is dangerous is keeping the kids indoors, preventing them from developing the antibodies that would allow them to fight off the more dangerous strains of bacteria that evolve through time, and choosing not to pass on said antibodies through breast milk because of cosmetic reasons or because it doesn't fit their schedule. 

11). Only believe what you have researched yourself.
-a friend once told me that our fingerprints were an adaptive trait used for grasping. I looked it up, it's one of many theories out there. I also used to think that marijuana was outlawed because people smoked it to get high; nope, it was outlawed because hemp would have ruined the lumber industry. Check your sources, unless you don't mind being made a fool of. 

12). Life is interesting.
-Everything about it (the people, insects, geological processes, temperature, cultures, sun sets, the universe) is constantly changing. It's amazing how much there is to learn, explore and understand about it. 

That's some of the stuff I've learned as an innie. Anyone else have epiphanies of their own?  

EDIT: I posted this to learn about other people's big ideas. I've never really considered myself wise, so this isn't a list of good morals or beliefs for anyone else to follow. Why does everyone on reddit have a hard on for debating?

My best friend from high school is getting married. We went to different colleges and grew apart after high school (we are now 27). At the same time we grew up quite differently. 

I became a geek, and spend much of my free time playing online games, going to metal concerts, etc. I have lived with the same guy since I was 19 and we are best friends as well as legal spouses. We do geeky things together like play board games and MMOs as a pair. I am an engineer and the people I hang out with the most are either other engineers (men) or women that play on my sports team (manly women, relatively speaking). I struggled quite a bit at my college since it was a very Greek social atmosphere and I simply did not fit in. I was also cut off from my parents so didn't have the money to party and join a sorority. That's what drew me to online games, as much of my friends at the time were in-game (and many are still friends of mine).

She became more of a social butterfly. She was popular and does girly things like decorating, shopping, etc.

She ended up moving to the city where I already lived and we hang out from time to time, always just the two of us. It's obvious we don't have that much in common anymore but we still can carry conversations for hours and have a good time.

I was a little hurt but not surprised when I was not asked to be a bridesmaid. I knew she had lots of new friends and I was cool with it. It's not really my type of thing anyway.

She asked me to come to her wedding shower, which doubled as a bachelorette party. I got the invitation in the mail. I told her I was coming a month ahead of time.

I despise clubs and dancing, so my intention was to arrive a little early, eat dinner with the group, maybe have a drink or two, then head home before it got too crazy.

I left work early to get ready. I put on club appropriate clothing (not hard as I only have one shirt that isn't either work clothes or a t-shirt), put on makeup (this is very rare), fixed my hair, and left. I stopped and got her a gift card for her favorite clothing store, a relatively upscale trendy place.

I drove 45 minutes to the meetup location and knocked on the door. No answer. I walked back to my car and checked the invitation, then checked my GPS. Yep, right place, right time.

I was a little early and started to wonder if they went out to get some supplies or something, so I texted her and asked where they were.

Turns out they decided to move the time. They already had their food for dinner, and were about to leave. They were another 30 minutes from where I was.

I was so hurt that no one bothered to tell me the time moved, and no one noticed I wasn't there when they left. I told her I was feeling tired and not to wait on me. I went to a sushi bar and ate dinner by myself and went home.

The whole experience left me so depressed and hurt. I feel like I was only invited to be nice, like an afterthought. I guess it's just time to accept that we're not really good friends anymore.

Sorry for the length, but thanks for reading if you got this far. I just needed to get it off my chest.

Edit: This got a lot more attention and support than I thought it would. Thanks everyone for being so supportive. I feel a lot better about it now, and it has made me appreciate the people I have in my life more.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,1367846551.0,,,True,t3_1dqdw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1dqdw9/feelings_hurt_a_rant/,

I'm a 20yo female university student living at home. 

I hate parties, nightclubs, loud/large gatherings. I have very few friends, my best friends being my boyfriend of 2 years and my dogs and cats. 

I find enjoyment in reading, knitting, crochet, cross stitch, sewing, watching TV and sometimes gaming. 

People find this very difficult to comprehend. I am frequently asked ""oh are you off out with your mates to the students union bar?"" and when I say no people look at me like I'm mad. I say I hate partying out all weekend and would much rather curl up in front of the TV with a nice cup of tea, some needle craft and my family. 

At first I thought there was something wrong with me. I had suffered from social anxiety for years but I thought it was just that - I wasn't enjoying social events etc because I had a mental illness. But, with the help of medication and broadening my social experiences I've found that I don't feel anxious while in the company of others anymore. It's just I'd rather be on my own or with a couple of people I'm close to. 

This worried me; maybe I was desensitized due to my social phobia and I'd never be normal. I'd never feel up to going out for a few drinks with colleagues after work or partying into the early hours of the morning like someone my age and status *should* be doing. And it really bothered me for a while; actually it was embarrassing. 

My family have always been very intrusive and in-your-face. They think that if I'm particularly quiet or I want to just spend the day in my room - perfectly content - that my depression is relapsing and have sat for hours prodding me to open up and talk. When I refuse to, because there is genuinely nothing really wrong, it makes them pry even more and become more aware of my need for space and peace. 

I've been lurking on reddit for a while and only discovered this subreddit today. It really opened up a new world for me; I'm not ill or weird or antisocial. I'm just an introverted individual and it's not uncommon. People here actually understand *why* I don't like social gatherings too regularly or *why* sometimes I might be a bit quiet(er) one day. 

So thank you, /r/introvert - you've changed my perspective on myself and my life today. ",,False,,t5_2qlr2,False,,,True,t3_1gaqa3,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1gaqa3/til_i_am_an_introvert_and_this_is_not_something_i/,

So that out of the way. I'm wondering if anyone else just feels like crap when they're around 'outgoing' people. That little voice in the back of your mind telling you your nothing, no fun at all. I get that. 

The thing is I want to be fun of course, but that's not who I am. So I also don't want to be fake. So I be myself, which just is. I just am. I don't really draw in people like those extroverts and I'm not a ladies man by any means. I want to have something meaningful, but I also want to get laid. However, I just don't give off a sexual vibe. I just am. /r/seduction tells me to simply follow these steps, build rapport, and then swoop in for the close. WTF?! Why do I have to pretend to be something I'm not to get the things I want? It's not fair. 

I want to go out and have some fun, but then I see how much more fun everyone else is compared to me...then I get self-conscious and depressed like right now. 

This is a small rant, but if anyone else feels like this too then tell me how you cope. I just feel so damn fake sometimes, but then again I don't want to be completely introverted and never go out...I must find a balance I suppose, but to be with the 'cool kids' I feel like I need to change. 

I find myself thinking that there must be more to life than drugs and alcohol, sex and drama, blah blah blah. I guess I just want to have a meaningful conversation for once, for someone to just listen to me. I guess this is why I'm constantly on Reddit, where the words of strangers have more weight than those of friends b/c reddit just seems to care more. Wow, that's sad isn't it? Everyday conversations are just so damn shallow, of which I too am guilty of doing since I don't want to get all deep on people and freak them out. However, there's gotta be some people out there that don't care as much about who's fucking who and care more about the effect of synthetic estrogens on the environment...maybe that's an extreme example, but you get what I mean.

Why do we need to segregate so much? There are so many similarities between shyness and introversion that even most introverted people mix them up. 

Most everyone deals with a little shyness or at least borderline shyness, and if someone; be it a mostly extroverted person or a mostly introverted person has a problem with shyness and comes to this sub-reddit - finds this particular sub more helpful than, say, r/socialanxiety, isn't it a pity to shoo them away over a small distinction between shyness and introversion?

I am a horse for single harness, not cut out for tandem or team work.  I have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or state, to my circle of friends, or even to my own family. These ties have always been accompanied by a vague aloofness, and the wish to withdraw into myself increases with the years. Such isolation is sometimes bitter, but I do not regret being cut off from the understanding and sympathy of other men.  I lose something by it, to be sure, but I am compensated for it in being rendered independent of the customs, opinions, and prejudices of others, and am not tempted to rest my peace of mind upon such shifting foundations.”

1359688421.0,164,self.introvert,17o8if,"Just got back from a lecture by Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. Lecture notes inside.",177,13,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/17o8if/just_got_back_from_a_lecture_by_susan_cain_author/,"So I'm holding a newly signed copy of the book Quiet, and just got home after seeing the lecture a half-hour ago. I thought I'd share some of the key notes from the talk, figuring it would be of interest to people here.

First of all, if you haven't read the book [Quiet](http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352145), consider it required reading. It has both observations about what introversion really means, as well as concrete tips.

And now, here's a bunch of the best points from the talk, with a bit of annotation:

* Introversion is not the same as shyness. It is, instead, a desire for lower-stimulation environments.

* Introverts tend to take longer to adjust to new social environments. But once they dive in, they often do it with a lot of subtle understandings of the situation from having observed it. Parents that think that their children are anti-social because they hang back should instead let them get involved at their own pace.

* The people who are the most outspoken are often considered to be the best contributors, and they are often extroverts. But they don't always have the best ideas. In fact, studies have shown that group brainstorming is one of the worst ways to come up with new ideas. It's often the quiet people who think about it on their own time, and then give well-thought-out responses and ideas that can be the best quality. This is often antithetical to what people think about these situations.

* The animal kingdom shows the same extroverted and introverted traits as humans. Even fruit flies. Both are necessary for the group's survival, and help in surprising ways. For example, one experiment had a researcher dropping a huge trap to the bottom of a pond. The ""introverted"" fish held back, but the ""extroverted"" fish were caught (and if it had been a predator, it would have been eaten). But then, after using other means to catch both kinds of fish in the population, the extroverted fish adjusted better to the entirely new situation and found ways to get food, mate, and reproduce in the lab environment.

* Introverts and extroverts do better in environments more suited to their natures. In one experiment, they had groups of extroverts and introverts solving difficult math problems. Extroverts did better when there was louder background music. When the music was quieter, introverts did best.

* While introverts and extroverts both are generally of the same intelligence level, introverts are better at digging into tasks, and paying attention longer. Persistence is a key trait, and when introverts are tested, they tend to learn more facts, and have more information than extroverts because of this. She quoted a great Einstein saying: ""It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.""

* When studies explored the highest performers in the world--whether in sports, music, or other disciplines--all of the top performers did a lot of what they call Deliberate Practice, which is a focused kind of practice. This kind of practice is almost always a solitary activity. A lot of time is wasted in a group practice situation that makes it far less effective. This type of solitary Deliberate Practice is well suited to introverts.

* We need a new kind of diversity in this world. While we have come to understand and appreciate the need for racial and gender diversity, there is also a need of a diversity of intro- and extroversion. There are positive and negative qualities to each of these characteristics, and a need for both types.

* Not all leaders are extroverts, although the qualities of a leader are thought of as extroverted. She brought up Ghandi, Elanor Roosevelt, and Rosa Parks as all quiet, shy people initially that decided that they had to get something done. This determination to meet their goals was authentic, and is what gave them such force of personality.

* Introverts often take time to bloom, but can do so much later in life. This is key for parents to understand as their introverted children grow up.

* Cain identified a problem called ""The New Groupthink"" which is a belief that group projects are always the best way to do things. This is nearly always difficult for introverts, and is not always the best way to do projects in the first place. Introverts instead prefer to do work on their own, and integrate it into the whole. Unfortunately, teachers are now urged to do more and more group projects with students, to the point where kids aren't doing anything on their own, which isn't the best way for all of them to learn. There needs to be a balance.

You can find many other insights and tips like the above in the book itself. And if Susan Cain comes on a tour to your town, it's well worth coming to see her. When she asked the audience who was an introvert, a vast majority raised their hands, and it was amusing to be in a crowd of introverts.

Hope you find these useful.

Option A: /r/introvert may only contain posts that reflect introversion in a positive view, any posts (wether they be self-posts or images) that have to do with social anxiety, or distaste in people around you will be removed and a message will be sent to the user telling them to redirect the post to /r/introvertsonly. Enforcement of these rules will be at the discretion of the /r/introvert mods.

Option B: /r/introvert will remain a place where all users can freely post any content they feel is related to introversion.

Option C: (For Informative knowledge Only) Thanks to /u/GideonJWells You have the third option /r/introvertpride, a subreddit made to show the pride of being an introvert.

1366045070.0,153,self.introvert,1cecyv,Was suggested to post this here. X-post from r/Dallas. My roommates 5 year old was suspended from school for being too quiet. Thoughts?,167,14,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1cecyv/was_suggested_to_post_this_here_xpost_from/,"So this is a crazy sounding situation. My roommate has a five year old daughter that attends a private school in a north Dallas suburb. She's a pretty shy kid. I've only interacted with her a handful of times, and she is a still a bit timid around me. Not as bad as the first time I met her though. She lives with his mother as he works two jobs, but we don't live far away. He takes care of all her expenses and still sees her often.

Here's where it gets weird. She was suspended from school for being too quiet. My roommate told me the school cited some sort of safety issue that was outlined in some handbook. I've asked him to bring me a copy and find out exactly what they are referring to. 
From what he told me about his meeting with the principal, she is so quiet they wouldn't be able to tell if she is hurt. 

He told me she has friends that she talks about when she comes home from school. So it isn't like she doesn't speak to anyone, she is just quiet. And she is learning just as well as the other kids, so being shy hasn't affected her education. 

I am of the opinion that her teachers get frustrated with her shyness and quiet nature, and she takes that negatively. I'm still trying to gather more information on the situation, but to me it seems like the teachers haven't made an effort to try and earn her trust. 

Now what I'm interested in is, can a school do that? Suspend a kid for being too quiet/shy? He's pulled her out of school already. This incident happened last week, so it has been a few days. He is going over to where his daughter lives tomorrow and I will update with more information as I get it. I just don't understand the school's reasoning on suspending a kid that is too quiet. Can anyone offer any insight or help on this?

TL;DR
Roommate's daughter got suspended from school for being too quiet/shy. School cites some handbook, safety nonsense. She's a normal kid with friends and has no learning disabilities. More info coming as I get it, anyone have any thoughts?

Edit: removed school and city

Edit 2: So after talking about all this with him and his mother, he's decided to just move on from the situation. He'd rather not bring any unnecessary attention to his kid and doesn't find it to be that big of a deal. He did tell me she was suspended for be ""defiant and rude"", but also said she doesn't talk much to the other kids but plays just fine. He's in the process of getting her enrolled in another school. He was shocked so many people would be concerned though so thank you guys for the help and support.

1364667404.0,150,self.introvert,1bba1u,10 Myths About Introverts,235,85,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1bba1u/10_myths_about_introverts/,"Myth #1 – Introverts don’t like to talk.
This is not true. Introverts just don’t talk unless they have something to say. They hate small talk. Get an introvert talking about something they are interested in, and they won’t shut up for days.

Myth #2 – Introverts are shy.
Shyness has nothing to do with being an Introvert. Introverts are not necessarily afraid of people. What they need is a reason to interact. They don’t interact for the sake of interacting. If you want to talk to an Introvert, just start talking. Don’t worry about being polite.

Myth #3 – Introverts are rude.
Introverts often don’t see a reason for beating around the bush with social pleasantries. They want everyone to just be real and honest. Unfortunately, this is not acceptable in most settings, so Introverts can feel a lot of pressure to fit in, which they find exhausting.

Myth #4 – Introverts don’t like people.
On the contrary, Introverts intensely value the few friends they have. They can count their close friends on one hand. If you are lucky enough for an introvert to consider you a friend, you probably have a loyal ally for life. Once you have earned their respect as being a person of substance, you’re in.

Myth #5 – Introverts don’t like to go out in public.
Nonsense. Introverts just don’t like to go out in public FOR AS LONG. They also like to avoid the complications that are involved in public activities. They take in data and experiences very quickly, and as a result, don’t need to be there for long to “get it.” They’re ready to go home, recharge, and process it all. In fact, recharging is absolutely crucial for Introverts.

Myth #6 – Introverts always want to be alone.
Introverts are perfectly comfortable with their own thoughts. They think a lot. They daydream. They like to have problems to work on, puzzles to solve. But they can also get incredibly lonely if they don’t have anyone to share their discoveries with. They crave an authentic and sincere connection with ONE PERSON at a time.

Myth #7 – Introverts are weird.
Introverts are often individualists. They don’t follow the crowd. They’d prefer to be valued for their novel ways of living. They think for themselves and because of that, they often challenge the norm. They don’t make most decisions based on what is popular or trendy.

Myth #8 – Introverts are aloof nerds.
Introverts are people who primarily look inward, paying close attention to their thoughts and emotions. It’s not that they are incapable of paying attention to what is going on around them, it’s just that their inner world is much more stimulating and rewarding to them.

Myth #9 – Introverts don’t know how to relax and have fun.
Introverts typically relax at home or in nature, not in busy public places. Introverts are not thrill seekers and adrenaline junkies. If there is too much talking and noise going on, they shut down. Their brains are too sensitive to the neurotransmitter called Dopamine. Introverts and Extroverts have different dominant neuro-pathways. Just look it up.

Myth #10 – Introverts can fix themselves and become Extroverts.
A world without Introverts would be a world with few scientists, musicians, artists, poets, filmmakers, doctors, mathematicians, writers, and philosophers. That being said, there are still plenty of techniques an Extrovert can learn in order to interact with Introverts. (Yes, I reversed these two terms on purpose to show you how biased our society is.) Introverts cannot “fix themselves” and deserve respect for their natural temperament and contributions to the human race. In fact, one study (Silverman, 1986) showed that the percentage of Introverts increases with IQ.

While the default state of the average introvert is far from being happy, introversion does allow you reach a state of being that is unconditionally happy. All it requires is a bit of effort, but the nice part is that you have all the tools at your disposal to reach that state.

As an introvert you are aware of much more than the average person, or the average extrovert. This extended awareness often leads to confusion, depression, doubt and a general feeling of malaise.

This happens because you're not using your ability in a way that's beneficial to your state of mind. Instead of a weakness introversion becomes your greatest strenght.

* When you're in a group of people don't zone-out, but listen to what is said. Respond to what is said, beit a joke, a story or something you agree with [or not agree with] and just let your body to the talking. IOW, be present in the group without necessarily participating in the conversation.

* When you feel you need to recharge, excuse yourself and retire. Go walk the dog, take a breather on the balcony/porch, check your email for a while, it doesn't matter. Don't extend yourself if you don't have to.

* When you act with kindess, you will become a kind person as long as your intentions are sincere. You are an authentic person by nature, but an authentic person who is also a kind person envokes a respons in people that's the opposite from what you might be used to now: misunderstanding, patronising and anger. 

* Don't apologise for who you are if your intentions as a human being are sincere. Always be sincere no matter what. Most of us have a hard time with insincerety anyways, so that shouldn't be too difficult.    

* Look inwards first to find your answers, but stay aware of the fact that you sometimes go too far into the rabbithole. Learn the trick of side-stepping your current train of thought if that train of thought is leading you to a bad place. This takes time and practice but you don't always have to be a victim of an overly sensitive mind.

* When you find yourself dwelling on an issue, and if you know this shouldn't be such an issue, think about something positive or funny. As soon as your mind wanders back to the issue, think of another positive memory and keep doing this [and that takes time] until you forget about the issue.

This last trick of the mind is the greatest single piece of advice I can give you. Also, watch Revolver by Guy Richie.

I'm pretty much a shut-in. I don't enjoy parties or large social gatherings even slightly. I find them repulsive.

There's only one person in my life whom I consider truly essential to my happiness, that being my girlfriend. Other than that, I have a close circle of male friends whom I get together with on a more or less frequent basis, but if for some reason I was never able to see them again, I wouldn't feel particularly bad. I enjoy hanging out with them for short periods of time if we're doing something engaging (Such as playing RPGs), but even during those times I barely say anything to them. This does not really bother me, even if I'm sitting there silent while everyone else talks. Aside from these times, 90% of my time is spent in my house.

I'd be more likely to cast my lot in with the hard introverts, the shut-ins, the misanthropes, etc. That's not to say I'm mean-spirited. If I'm in a position to help another person, I feel glad to do it, but I don't desire a personal connection with them. Humans are just...there, to me. They're like machines or animals, just things I have to deal with in my normal life. I take great pleasure in observing and understand them, I'm partial in particular to fields such as sociology and economics, but as far as actually participating in society, I would much rather avoid it.

Nor do I suffer from social anxiety. If I'm put in a position where I must interact with other humans, I can handle myself quite fine. I'm no socialite, of course, but I can do the bare minimum in order to not come off as totally inept. Sometimes, with close friends, I can even go as far as to make myself seem like an engaging person. Again, I don't take any pleasure in this, it's just something that's a part of life, and I'll avoid it if I can. All my hobbies are self-sufficient, such as reading or music or gaming, and I find that most of the time people get in the way of that. I find social hobbies, such as partying or sports, to be tedious, at best, but sometimes downright disgusting.

For a while I suspected I had Schizoid Personality ""Disorder,"" and I still manifest some symptoms of that, but I also desire at least one deep emotional connection (That being my girlfriend), or else I do feel unhappy.

tl;dr I'm a shut-in who is generally completely apathetic towards social interaction. A lot of people here seem to enjoy socializing, they just need ""alone time,"" whereas I'm much more extreme. Am I the only one?

PS: Before I piss anyone off, this is not some bid to suggest that I am superior to anyone here. If you're a light introvert, that's fine, I don't care. I was only wondering if there were any other ""shut-in"" introverts here.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,False,,,True,t3_y53ff,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/y53ff/where_are_the_hard_introverts_at/,

I don't know if it is gauche to make an update in the new post but oh well.

I thought I might have been late at first and my stomach was doing back flips but turning up the volume of my music helped a bit. When I turned on the exit ramp to the theater I caught a glimpse of the person in front of me and he had a vague resemblance to the guy was meeting. The car in front ended up going ahead at a turn and I lost sight. Then when I got to the theater parking lot there was the same car with the guy I was to see Prometheus with stepping out. I ended up parking right next to him. Then started the awkward hellos. He said ""So we have met now."" I said ""mission accomplished?"" Then lots and lots of small talk. The theater that Prometheus was in was a weird theater that was half theater half restaurant [Here is picture for those who don't get what I am explaining.](http://www.marcustheatres.com/Files/Theatres/Media/770_springdale_road_MLS_HID552736_ROOMpaladium.jpg) He has never been in this type of theater (I don't think he liked it :P)

We talked lot before the movie started and during the movie neither of us talked to each other. (Which in my book it is a good point because it meant to me that he and I both know how to enjoy a good movie.)

*This is sort of a side note but I LOVED THE MOVIE!! I love Alien and Aliens I really enjoyed the story, it wasn't flawless but the enjoyment,  interesting story and plot eclipsed the few flaws.*

Afterwards we talked about what we liked about the movie and what we didn't quite understand or what we thought was stupid. For the most part we completely agreed and over all we both thoroughly enjoyed it. We both walked back to our cars and he sat on the trunk of his car and I leaned up against mine. We talked about other things than the movie and it started to drizzle and it wasn't too bad of a nuisance (kinda nice actually, it was 90°F.) It started raining hard and we decided to call it a day. 

Over all I was really impressed with myself to keep talking and keep a clear mind. In the past I would have locked up and say nothing and my mind would be a blur with thoughts of: ""am I acting stupid?"", ""should I say this? No that sounds dumb."" ""I wonder how my hair looks"" ""am I boring him?"" ""That sounded so stupid why did I say that..."" This time though I felt more in control of my mind and I strongly contribute that to my prescription of Zoloft (Sertraline). He and I both expressed interest in seeing each other again (mine was genuine interest and I felt his was also.) Over all I would say it was a resounding success and glad I did it.

I can only attest to my own experiences in this regard and, as is the case with us writers, it must be remembered that a certain affection for eloquence may compromise the exactness of specific elements of this “story,” but I promise that the essence is real.

For as long as I can remember, my heart has been a dam. Turbulent waves of emotion, an entire ocean of feelings and thoughts, of personality and belief, stir behind the towering, ivory gate that holds it at bay. Beyond, the surface of the river is conversely calm and placid, pleasant if a bit shallow and cool.

The dam is powerful, unyielding. It refuses to crack, comprised of an array of nearly endless gates, each with failsafes and duplicates and a repair crew on constant stand-by to fix even the most insignificant of wear and tear.

When I meet someone, and they bask in the calm waters beyond the dam, it is not without the sense that something else is looming on the horizon, that behemoth of a structure that holds an unknown torrent at bay. The seething, boiling energies of this endlessly deep, violently passionate reservoir, so many times the size of that which is visible on the far side.

And then someone comes along who dares to approach it, whose very presence erodes the foundations of this architectural monstrosity. The crew, manning the gates, begins to trust them, to test them by opening each just a crack, allowing a small modicum of the warmth and power of the reservoir to slip through and into the stream.

As a writer, I put a tremendous weight on words. A single word choice can completely alter the meaning of a sentence to me, my ears constantly alert for shifts in intonation. They can go a long way toward determining whether a gate on the dam slides open or remains wholly shut.

What really sets them off, though, is touch. There are hundreds of different sorts of touch, with their own unique connotations: those which reassure, those of affection, the sexual, the dismissive, all conveyed through just a momentary, lingering point of contact or, contrarily, an almost reflexive retreat.

That one person finds that combination of words, of looks, of touches that linger just long enough, of that sparkle in the eye, of their own willful vulnerability. It is for them that the dam breaks.

For them, the repair crew is sent home, the gates and foundations crack and splinter, failsafes held at bay as the torrent rushes out to meet this solitary adventurer, to engulf them and pull them back in, beneath the undulating surface where everything is laid bare. I can hardly imagine what it’s like to learn so suddenly that something like this exists within this person that you perhaps thought you already knew, and I have nothing but awe and respect for those who can brave it and come out closer still.

For them, there is no more barrier, no structure that stands between them and the essence of who I am. They may swim in it, bathe in it, seek to cleanse it or poison it and I will have no more means by which to stop them. That is the brunt of how I love. It can be the most glorious feeling one can imagine or the most tortuous of emotional agonies. It is because of the strength of it alone that I am so loathe to let the dam fall, to allow even the most outwardly kind and accepting of people to see what lies within.

But, every so often, someone comes along who, good or bad, seems worth the risk.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,False,,,True,t3_1dvb86,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1dvb86/an_introverts_love_story/,

The reception area would be out of view of the hair dressing area, because frankly when I'm in a salon I feel weird (as the person doing hair/getting their hair done) when I'm staring at people who are walking in to the salon. 


I really just want to be able to give people beautiful hair without the gossip and superficial chit chat and wall to wall mirrors that make people feel self-conscious in regular salons.

I think it might be linked to 'sudden' situations of over exposure to something, as I can go to a pub or club with friends and not have this (or not as much). Maybe it's linked to when I am on my own (I was on my own for the concert).

Apparently I was wrong. The interviewer told me that he was looking for someone a lot more cheery and ""bubbly."" He said, ""Based on your interests, like reading and playing computer games, you seem to be a really introverted person and we're not looking for that. We want someone who is more outgoing.""

All my life I've been surrounded by bubbly people. I felt like an alien, so I tried to be that way for a long time too, but it felt so wrong.

I mean, I was in high school. There have been these people who have been my friends for 3 years. Some of them 6 years. I was always seen as the wise one, the quiet one, who never spoke unless it was positively necessary. People constantly said ""You haven't said a word since you arrived! What's up?"" to me. About a year before they dumped me, I made a decision to be more 'open'. Immediately, I started noticing horribly negative results. Something about revealing my personality to these people caused them to start being super uncomfortable around me. I never found out what it was. Was my humor too inappropriate? Was it too dry? Was I too awkward? Was it too big of a change?

My bet so far is that since I was very quiet, people started seeing a pattern where I would only talk to people if I needed them. There was no warmth or kindness. No familiarity. Only cold business. I guess when I started being more open, they thought I had some kind of hidden agenda, and felt threatened.

1366669039.0,121,self.introvert,1cw678,Tips for Introverts that I have gained. Recommended for social situations.,146,25,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1cw678/tips_for_introverts_that_i_have_gained/,"Introverts aren't shy. We just don't like acting like a cheery burst of energy to every given social situation. Frankly it's tiring and nonsense to us.

But naturally we're mysterious, and it stirs up curiosity in people. 
What I notice in extroverts is that they don't think much before they talk so their questions to us, can come off as rude. So here's some of them and what I found that works. 

**""Why are you so shy?""**

: *Trust me, I'm not shy.* 

I usually smile or laugh when I say this. I imagine saying this with a blank face will scare people. I like replying with this because it stays in line with our character, straight to the point with a hint of mysterious. It also shows some confidence, used correctly it can come off as flirty. 

If this doesn't work and they follow up with something like **""Oh come on you're so shy or but you're so quiet""/ "" Why are you so quiet?""** 

: I automatically put on my blahblah radar. Not only is this person still chatting about nothing substantial and not contributing but s/he is putting all the pressure on me to lead the conversation.  
Usually I divert and say something among the lines of 

*Ah sorry, my mind is caught up on* (insert normal activity here) 

*... work earlier, It was hectic as hell. How's your job going?/ Do you work?*

*... planning what to make for dinner. I just started to learn how to cook.*

etc. Of course this isn't like a step by step telemarketing manual. The idea is to keep the conversation going. Use your hobbies, pets, interests.

If I feel like that the person/stranger is being an asshole and I most likely have no interest in seeing them again. I usually reply with something more on the offense. *Give me something to talk about.*  
 
Extroverts love talking about nothing. We know this, there isn't much of a intellectual conversation in social situations such as parties and clubbing. Stuck in a party? and ran out of talking material? 

Go ahead and start helping the host, serve drinks, clean up things, being helpful is always a great thing. From there new conversations can start. *Thanks for throwing this party. You okay with drinks?* 

**""What do you do for a living?""** 

This is a tricky question depending on your situation. Cause it's either you have a nice ideal long-term job or a sucky I dont want to do this for the rest of my life job. 

In my case I have a food-service job yes it's not the greatest but the objective is to keep the conversation on a high note, don't let negatives be the highlight of the conversation. 

*""Currently I'm a hostess It's fun, but I'm saving up money to go back to school, Im taking a break from school to figure out what I really want to do before I end up on shit-ton of debt""* 

Everyone can relate to debt. It also shows that you're managing your life and making big-boy decisions. 

*Non-related Tip: Did you know in Japan this question at first meet basis is considered rude and intruding? In Japanese culture, guests are treated welcomingly and are to be made comfortable as possible. So avoiding all judgmental questions is necessary. When I first read about this I thought it was amazing and actually awe-inspiring. Cause honestly cramming your occupation and life-inspirations into simple short sentences can not only be complicated but a bit too much information for a complete stranger. 

Sorry went a bit off topic and documentary-esque there. Obviously an introvert. 

**""What's new?""** 

This is by far the easiest question and the most favorited by extroverts. You can say almost anything and it'd be fine. The point is to pick up the conversation. 
*Ah nothing really, I've been staying up and watching (insert whatever TV show) I'm addicted.* 
It doesn't have to be a personal achievement or a picked up hobby. Most introverts think waaay too hard into the simplest questions. Our minds can be our best friend and worst enemy.

I'm female, 20 years old, a student, and very comfortable with being an introvert. When I'm out during the day my energy depletes extremely quickly, interacting with others is enjoyable but draining, and during the weekends I enjoy sleeping in, then spending the day reading, working on my book, or my screen play, or my poetry, as well watching movies and listening to albums. I go out a few nights of the month and party it up with my close group of friends. I'm in no way a boring person. In fact, most people comment that I'n extremely lively, talkative, funny, and outgoing. I've never questioned any of this. I've always known that I need ample time to myself and I know how not to over-extend myself when it comes to being with people.


However, lately I have been feeling so ashamed of ""the way I live."" An American girl moved into my flat a few months ago and is a complete extrovert. When she's home, she's constantly Skyping or has friends over. She likes to go out every single night of the week and weekend, always to very touristy clubs (my friends and I enjoy going to rock or jazz bars when we're not hanging out at someone's flat drinking and watching movies) or expensive restaurants. We're both students at the same uni and while she can't sleep in past 10:00 no matter when she's gone to bed, I need at least 9 hours of sleep a night. Every Saturday and Sunday when I emerge from my room around lunch-time (13-14:00), she's sitting in the kitchen and looks at me like I have six eyes. ""You're *just* now getting up?"" Yeah, well, I stayed up until 6:00 listening to American Beauty. Not that you would understand; how's that new electro-house playlist anyway?
Her comments are really starting to get to me, to the point where for the past few weeks I've been feeling ashamed of how I live.

""I can't be inside for more than an hour. I have to leave and walk around and shop or something.""

""What do you *do* all day? I can't just sit inside at my computer all day like a mindless zombie.""

""You eat the same thing every single day. I would get so bored.""

""How do you not want to be out all the time? We live in such a beautiful city (Madrid) and you don't even care.""


I've never met anyone who cares about the way I live. I've never met anyone who has said ANYTHING about how much time I spend to myself. I'm in no means a recluse, I see my friends at least twice a week. I woke up this afternoon and heard her in the kitchen, and then stayed in bed for another hour, waiting for her to leave so I could go out and make my rice &amp; eggs in peace. Then I realized how fucked up it is that I was locking myself in my room to avoid her judgement. Then I realized something else- I would hate to feel like I can't be inside for more than an hour. To me, it seems like a sign of anxiety. I can't imagine not enjoying lounging around the house in my robe for the hell of it, snacking and watching a movie. I can't imagine constantly feeling the need to talk to someone, or go out and spend money, all because I feel so restless and trapped *all the time*. I don't know if she feels anxiety, perhaps it's the same kind of anxiety I get when I've been around people for too long, but I must say- I would much rather be able to lead my kind of relaxing life where I don't depend on human interaction to cure my boredom, than the life she lives.


I'm sorry for the wall of text. I've never felt social anxiety before but I am with this girl and I needed to vent to someone.

Edit: Some have pointed out that I sound pretentious when comparing our interests. I totally do. I sound like a bitch. I was trying to keep the rant concise and didn't take the time to point out that I don't think anything she (or anyone) does is of lesser quality than the things I like to do. I should have taken the time to explain that she also asks questions about why I do the things I do, why I like the things I like. Besides that though, I was in a pissy mood and bashed on her taste in music which was just immature. The reason I'm angry is because I feel judged and then I went and judged her.

Maybe it's just me, but the very idea of beating on one's own chest just seems so primitive and unappealing. I also have a problem with vanity. I don't get why people would need to constantly snap pictures of themselves (the infamous mirror/myspace or duckface pics). The very idea of putting yourself on a pedestal is something that I don't get, and the more often that I see it, the more irritated it gets me. I just don't see what the point in stroking your own ego is and when people do it I feel genuinely uncomfortable near them.

For some contrast, I don't think incredibly highly of myself, but I think that I am or at least am capable of being a good person. I almost never take anything without asking first, try to consider the feelings of those around me and how my actions may affect them, and I don't particularly like taking pictures of myself because I don't really see the need or feel the desire. I try to remain humble and considerate as often as possible and usually attribute my level of worth in the world based off of what my skills are rather than my opinion of myself.

Friend: ""Hey, wanna join us for dinner tonight?""
Me: ""Yeah sure, what time?""
Friend: ""I don't know, probably later.""
Me: ""Where?""
Friend: ""Not sure, we'll figure it out.""
Me: ""How long do you think we'll be there?""
Friend: ""No idea!""

Is it just me, or does everyone else feel the need to know all these things beforehand? Tons of people seem to do fine scheduling things on the fly and changing plans as they go. I do not like this at all. I want my days planned out ahead of time and my events scheduled ahead of time. 

Furthermore, this situation holds backwards too. I hate it when I tell other people exactly where, when, and how long we'd be at some place, and they cancel right before or change plans on the fly. The other day, I asked my friend if she wanted to grab dinner at this really cool restaurant on Thursday and she said yes. I asked her this four days in advance. I even reminded her of this every single day until Thursday. She nodded, said one of the following: ""Of course I'm coming!"" / ""Oh hell yes! I'm excited!"" / ""That's gonna be so much fun I can't wait!"". Come Thursday, I'm about to leave and she texts me ""sorry i cant i need to sleep, soo tirred lol"". Things like this seriously piss me off to no extent. 

Is it wrong to know when and where things are taking place, and how long they'll possibly go until? I like to have my days planned out, you know. And why do these people think it's okay to ditch me when I've offered them every single detail that I'd like to know, if I were them?
 God, it's gotten so frustrating lately that I straight up have not responded to several of my friends' invitations to go do stuff. I don't even invite them to do things any more, because of how volatile they are in sticking to something they agreed to.

I can see people are not having the greatest view of me because of this thread or a misreading of my intentions. I was simply intending to get people to think and make discussion beyond a blatant attack of the quote. If you view me negatively because of this thread (and perhaps I am wrong and you do not, I only speak to those that do, I don't know which ones do) then I find it sad for such a negative view to come from a thread with knowing little about me. But perhaps the thread is no longer for me to be in. I am sure you are all friendly and lovely people, and I hope you have a wonderful day.*

**I'm going to add an edit to the beginning as well. When you read this quote, please take a moment and think, and reflect. Don't immediately attack the quote just because you disagree or don't like it. I see a lot of complaining about it because of how you feel about yourself, and I understand that the quote can be a bit harsh. But seriously, stop and think for a bit. Trust me, I'm introverted, Aspie, used to be horridly shy and socially anxious. And sure, this quote pissed me off a little bit at first. But when I thought about it it has substance to it. It may not be a blanket statement, but it has a point, whether or not you like it or are offended by it. And dammit it motivated me to push myself past my social limits of the time and dammit it worked. Right now it's not about whether you like the quote or ""feel like"" it applies to you or are offended. It can be just as vain to believe you are immune to it as what the quote is saying itself. You are not all so different in your shyness(if you are) that you are completely exempt from the quote because of how you feel. Take a moment to learn and reflect, because sometimes it takes hearing things you don't like or offend you to get you to actually think and change.**



As everyone knows and/or complains about, there's a lot of things on here about shyness, social anxiety, being anti-social, and introversion, all of which are not necessarily together.

So I figured I would use an interesting quote I saw to get your attention. ""Shyness is just a cowards vanity."" A lot of people feel like they're introverts just because they're shy. But why? I'm introverted, I like to talk walks by myself, sit in my room and practice some music or even self-study. But I also am studying to be a teacher, I also like to go hang out with friends, I even like to go to friend's parties and meet people.

I've heard it mentioned before that some introverts feel superior or entitled to something because they're introverted in an ""extrovert"" world. And sadly, I think sometimes people want to identify as introvert for that very reason, to feel superior. They feel like they don't need to get over shyness or social anxiety or being anti-social because that's just ""a part of who they are.""

""Shyness is just a cowards vanity."" Perhaps that is why some people are shy, they're vain. They care too much about what other people are going to think of them. They're afraid to take any risks because of their image. Too afraid of how people will act, and isn't caring that much about what other people think just as vain as the people that need a ton of attention?

Now I'm not saying this is the case for all shy people, there's some discretion, but honestly think about it. Maybe people will disagree or downvote me for being another one of ""those people complaining."" But I hope this will actually lead to some discussion.

EDIT: I want to re-emphasize, I am *not* saying that any of this is true for all introverts/shy people/etc. And it is not a blanket statement about shyness, but I see a lot of people being quick to attack the saying and what it entails. I understand some people are shy, I still can be, and often was for a long time, but you can learn from the statement. Just because it doesn't sound ""nice"" doesn't meany anything.

And with all of my close friends finding significant others lately, I've been especially lonely lately. And while I treasure the time I have on my own, I would love to have someone to go to dinner or a movie with every once in a while.

The problem is that I simply can't meet people. I'm in college so the typical mating grounds are generally parties, which I've tried out numerous times but I really do despise them. I try to meet guys through my friends or through my sport (rock climbing), but it is simply impossible for me.

My male friends tell me I'm fairly attractive, but my sarcasm and cynicism make it so men aren't exactly keen on introducing themselves to me. I've been told that I seem intimidating, and I've recognized that men are far more likely to go to the cute, perky, girly extrovert over... well, me.

When it comes to flirting, I can't do it. Not that I don't know how, I'm just extremely uncomfortable doing it. I hate being fake. And on the off chance that someone is flirting with me, I tend to be under the impression that it's some sort of joke and they clearly would want nothing to do with me.

So, my own pity party aside, what on earth do you all do?

An [Ambivert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Ambiversion) is, as you probably already guessed, someone who could be placed right in the middle of the two extremes of intro- and extro- version.

I'd say I'm more of an ambivert. I love to speak in front of large groups of people, but faced one-on-one I can be difficult to get to know and shy. If I'm in the right mood I'll go out of my way to meet new people and step out of the comfort zone, but I've never quite gotten used to it. Around my close friends I'm very open and pretty loud. Around new people and especially someone I feel like I have to impress because I'm attracted to them, I get a lot of anxiety.


I find myself always ""on the fence"" in so many social interactions. Part of me wants to take a lot of chances and really open up. This idea stresses me out usually. The other part of me just wants to escape and be alone. That feels comfortable, but then I start to feel like being with a lot of new and unfamiliar people. I really do like to meet new people, it's really exciting. I also enjoy public speaking. I get a rush out of saying things that a lot of people get to hear. I find myself really enjoying talking to people when I'm in a good mood.


Maybe I'm just a depressed extrovert.

Edit: Thanks, everyone, for posting I feel like I have alot in common with so many of you. I hope everyone enjoyed hearing each other's stories. Since I didn't share mine when I made this post, here it is:

I've always been sort of shy, but up until I was 15 or 16 it was really bad. In my freshman English class, the stress of reading  Mercutio's lines to my whole class almost made me pass out. And I was just sitting at my desk. But somehow I made friends with a few really great guys and because we were all lame highschool kids, we spent  our weekends playing pool instead of going to huge parties. So my being an introvert was never an issue. We even started a comedy website and became small town minor celebrities, which really helped with my shyness. 

After highschool, I joined the army and that helped even more. Besides the basic ""I can't hear you!"" games, I actually learned about leadership and public speaking, and before long no one would even believe me when I told them about how shy I used to be. My job involved alot of face-to-face communication with locals and when I was deployed, it seemed like I was meeting and talking to people all-day everyday (something I couldn't imagine my 14 year old self being able to handle). 

I'm still totally an introvert, though. ",,False,,t5_2qlr2,1348710797.0,,,True,t3_10icgh,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/10icgh/introverted_and_life_of_the_party/,

I would include myself in this group, since I have what I consider to be a great group of friends who I really enjoy spending time with, and I enjoy meeting new people as long as I don't have to spend several hours with them at a stretch.

On the other hand, there's also a group of people who see certain aspects of their life (whether it be social anxiety, a lack of desire to ever interact socially, or what have you) as being intimately tied to their introversion. 

The difference, I think, is that some people celebrate their introversion whereas other people see it as a problem in a society where extroversion is more widely accepted and encouraged. I, for instance, am proud of my introversion -- it's made me who I am, and while life is sometimes challenging because of it, I welcome that challenge because it makes me stronger and I thrive on overcoming that occasional adversity. Others might be more inclined to use this space as a forum for venting their frustrations about the difficulties of introversion and the problems or conditions that may stem from it.

What I'd suggest is that we take a note from other subs and create a secondary sub for advice/issues/DAE posts that come from people who want help or support for introvert-related difficulties in their life. Just like /r/Cooking has /r/AskCulinary or /r/Science has /r/AskScience, we can have the same thing.

I hope that as introverts, we can set aside egos and talk about this civilly instead of attacking one another for being one kind of introvert as opposed to another.

I don't know but sometimes, when I crash down/am really tired, I just suddenly go really silent because I don't really want to talk.

I never knew what an introvert/extrovert was for a very long time, I heard the term from time to time but never thought enough to search it up. I'm 15 now, and I've known I wasn't social, but I didn't know there was a term to it, and mostly didn't know how to describe it.

My Auntie's husband once commented on me being 'shy', ""So, have you even taught her to speak yet?"" I was six and this was the first time someone had commented on me being 'shy'. It hit me like a slap to the face. I remember growing up to my current age, with too many questions like so being thrown at me. Why are these people talking so much? Why don't they just think for once? You can do so much more with a thought than talking. But whenever I tried to explain this to someone, they just gave me this weird look. I tried to force myself into becoming more social, but it never felt right. It just isn't me.

Something I'm rather ecstatic about is the things you have here to describe being an introvert, like the common misconceptions, the definitions. There's something on the front page of r/introvert right now about someone asking if they're an introvert or just making up excuses.

Basic idea is that you go to a place consistently (e.g. bar, restaurant, library) at a fairly consistent time. What happens is that after you've been there for a while, the staff and other regular customers will also recognise you, and chances are you'll be fairly accustomed to the environment as well. Once you're familiar enough with the environment, other regulars and staff, initiating conversation may feel easier.

I frequent one of the libraries at my Uni, so it's actually a really nice feeling to deal with the staff since they recognise me. At the same time I also see familiar faces, and I tend to smile when making eye contact. Whilst I haven't exactly gotten onto the conversational part yet, I do occasionally partake in some friendly banter with the staff.

My dog, Peanut, was a brown Dachshund that we got when I was just a year old. Over the years we had many ""adventures"", he once got run over by a car (nearly). And also once ran away from home. But he always managed to come back with a smile on his face.

One day a few weeks ago he started coughing in the middle of the night, not just a regular cough, a deep, loud, hacking cough. When my mom came in to investigate he suddenly stiffened up and rolled over, then he got right back up. So we took him to the vet, we learned he had had a heart murmur and momentarily passed out, and we also learned he had fluid building up around his heart. He had CHF, Congestive Heart Failure. The vet prescribed some medicine and we went on our way. A week later he started coughing again and we upped the dosage. 

Yesterday we noticed he was breathing very heavily, and his heart was beating quickly, when my brother came over Peanut was so excited to see him he passed out. Later that night he was just laying there and you could see that he appeared to be struggling to breathe. My mom would have taken him to the vet immediately but they are closed on Saturday.

Today my mom took him to the vet as my dad and I left for church. Before we left my mom told me to say goodbye to him, she didn't know what would happen. I said my goodbyes and we were on our way. Throughout the two hours I struggled with myself to keep it together. On the way home my dad told me mom had called, she said Peanut was at the vet and was under an oxygen pump. I was just happy he was alive.

When we were nearly at our house my dad got a phone call, Peanut had to be put down. My dad called my mom and brother and told what had happened. We get home and my dad is turning around to go to the vet. I asked him, ""Dad can I stay home, I want to be al-"" That's about how far I got before I couldn't hold it in any longer. Before I knew it my dad had his arms wrapped around me, telling me it was going to be alright. I got out and ran inside and immediately lost it. I cried for about 30 minutes straight.

.Walking down the street and people are coming past you, I often hate having to look in their direction as they're coming towards me so I stare at the floor but this just makes me look and feel sad so I just look slightly above everyones heads instead

.Someone you're sitting next to in class said something like ""Ugh I really cant be bothered with this"" and you dont know what to reply with? Most of the time I actually dont mind class so im not going to pretend to agree with them, instead I normally just look at them and pull a stupid sad face and that normally gets a laugh... I know that sounds ridiculous but trust me its way easier than trying to start up a conversation you dont even want to have and they wont think your just being an asshole who doesnt care what they're saying

.Headphones ofcourse

.Dont take shit from anyone. I used to be the guy that got teased in my old group of freinds and I honestly didnt mind, im extremely laidback, too laidback. And even though I dont care what people say/do to me it still makes me look like an idiot and a coward so dont take shit from anyone even if it doesnt bother you because it makes you look like a push over and it will probably get to you eventually but by then you will be too scared to fight back because everyone will have built up this belief that you dont mind it and that will make you scared to lash out. Instead just talk shit to anyone who does it to you, you get pushed, push them back. Seriously I dont care how big they are compared to you the bigger they are the more respect you earn.

.I know eye contact is the WORST. But just try to hold glances with people you're talking to for a couple of seconds every now and then, just to let them know you're listening. Glances are much easier than grueling staring contests when conversing.

.If you're not good with phone calls then a tip for when calling a fastfood delivery service is to start by saying ""Hi i'd like to make an order for a delivery"" That's the golden line that you've always miss worded and not been sure how to say every time you call them! After that they just ask you the address and what you want to order which I presume you would have memorised before calling - easy!

Also im certain some of the things mentioned may be more linked to sociall anxiety etc. But I am pretty tired of this sub circle jerking whats introverted and whats not.

Today, I started my new job on campus. I basically work at a convenience store with some variety. I'm either a barista, working the register, or stocking. They had me on stocking duty today, which lasted about four hours. People screwed a lot of things up over the summer... so they gave the new guy some work to do.

The work isn't bad. Moving a couple crates here and there, being a bit cold, but no matter. In fact, I found it pretty enjoyable all around. I didn't have to interact with anybody. I just got to stay in my little hole and do my own work.

But... but then my manager asks me something about thirty minutes into my shift. ""You know you get to listen to music, right? We have speakers in here.""

For the next three and a half hours, I stocked a freezer while listening to Brian Eno, Dustin O'Halloran (Opus 37), and Boards of Canada.

In high school, I had a few close friends whose company I enjoyed, but it was always small groups.

Now that I'm in college though, I'm finding it really hard to make friends.  I might just be really picky, but I can't imagine any of the people I've met being close friends.  But, my issue is that after spending 5 hours by myself in my dorm room, I get really lonely.  My dorm is almost always deserted, and when I am in crowds of strangers, I still get this lonely feeling.  Aren't introverts supposed to enjoy time to themselves?  

I think my issue lies in the fact that I don't like socializing, but I do enjoy other people's company.  With my high school friends, we would always play video games, play sports, or go to movies.  Here in college, the only people who I really like are the people on my sports team, and I really enjoy just being with them, even though I hardly talk.  I also grew up in a large family, so at home I would always be surrounded with people I liked, while not having to socialize all the time.  

This is making it really hard for me to find and make new friends.  Has anyone here experienced something similar?  Does anyone have tips or suggestions?  Am I really an introvert?

I look at other people who seem to be at peace in their head while I feel like I'm always thinking, sorting,worrying etc.  Is this an introvert thing or am I bodering on anxiety/psych stuff?

A situation for me that I find to be the most frustrating is when reading something.  I feel like my brain reads too fast and I'm reciting as I'm reading.  Sometimes it gets so bad that I have to re-read entire pages a few times.  This I know may be more of a psych thing but I wondered if maybe it was because I'm so involved in my head that I can't just read and take in what is in front of me.  This has definitely caused major problems in school for me.

EDIT: Thanks for all the input!  I agree that a lot of people are probably just very good at keeping their ""poker face"" on.  As a teenager I came up with this explanation for myself that people who seem to me to not be distracted by their inner mind ramblings are ""surface dwellers"".  This to me means that they live their lives only be affected by what is in direct contact with them.  They only see what's on the ""surface"" so to speak.

The thing is, I do not think I'm more superior than others. When an individual has more ""power"" or is more superior than me, I tend to get nervous when conversing with that individual.
I feel most comfortable when I'm with my closest friends, and that's when I talk the most. I do not want to be arrogant. And what's even worse is that if I tell people I'm shy, it'll just make things very awkward, and I can't go through that. I don't really like people taking pictures of me too.

There's this uncontested ""game"" that happens in dating that I refuse to take a part in. American ""culture"" treats people as objectifiable sources of entertainment with things such as gossip, trending, idolization, emulation, etc. It feels like being genuine is such a foreign concept to most American people that they don't feel that they need to say anything that they truly mean anymore. I feel like in the current paradigm, people just speak for the sake of speaking, not understanding responsibility for their actions. Because of this we see a large uprising in social media and ""conversation"" that people have and it consumes a lot of them. And don't even get me started on the lack of attention from a lot of people these days.

I personally do not have the energy to expend to try to spoon-feed most people what they want to hear. I don't have the energy to fuck around and waste time because somebody else can't get their own opinion straight, while I'm consequently being lead around like a horse with a carrot. I don't have time for sociopathic games or attitudes, I don't have time for self-inflated egos, and I don't have time for petty bullshit. To make matters worse, people my age (early twenties) are so over-indulgent that they seem to not really know what the hell it is that they actually want because all they do is *consume, consume, consume*. People are **NOT** objects to be used up. People are sentient human beings that have feelings, goals, desires, etc. The reason why I don't fuck around with dating or relationships anymore is because I try to ""civilize"" people that have no intentions of being civil. These days, it feels like everybody just wants to do whatever the fuck they want without any repercussions. Spare me the rat race, because I would much rather ""miss out"" than look back at my past and realize how far I stretched my own identity and humanity, trying to be somebody that I am not.

Edit: Since I'm clearly being misinterpreted, I would like to apologize and state that the ""civilize"" comment was a reference to the show Newsroom. While arguing over gossip being demeaning to fellow humans, the conversation resulted in the main character having a drink thrown in his face from a gossip columnist that was basically going to throw herself at her and sleep with him. Also, never once did I say that I thought that I was better than anyone else, and I was conveying my personal distress.

We talk with her and the student, and told her that once a week I or another teacher would drop by to observe the student (as was our original plan). 

The meeting ended and she apologized a few more times and left.

(long story),86,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1fjg80/i_dont_think_ive_ever_felt_more_alive_long_story/,"I went hiking yesterday with my dog Barbas (named after the talking dog in Skyrim) in the local state park in an attempt to get some alone time. About 10 minutes into the walk, I came across a snake that was blocking the trail. There was no way to go around the snake as there was about a 88 degree slope on either side of the trail. I would have to be extremely brave or stupid to try to step over  the snake. I am neither of those. Even if I did attempt to cross him and got bitten, I had nothing to kill him with except my Pooh Bear Hands. 




I turned around and walked back. Two minutes later, I spotted an alternative route: a 55 degree slope that led to the river bed. I knew that the trail I was on would eventually intersect with the river bed, so  I decided to follow it. It was a decision I was glad I made. After walking about 10 minutes on unsteady and slippery rocks, I found myself above a small waterfall. After traversing the 5 foot drop, I was standing on a large rock in one of the river bed's many bends.




A small patch of steam was rising up in front of me, partly illuminated by sunlight from a hole in the canopy. My golden retriever stood next to me, looking up at me as I took in the scenery with the faint sound of the waterfall behind me. It was beautiful. After 5 minutes, we carried on; eventually finding the trail again.




We finished the trail, but now we had to take it back up. I got back up to where we encountered the snake. Thankfully, it had moved on. I stood there, looking down into the valley. 30 seconds later, I heard the rain coming. I listened as the volume steadily increased until the rain was pouring down above me. I watched as the leaves on the trees slightly moved as the raindrops hit them. It was like the forest was breathing. The sun was shining and I felt I could see every individual drop.



I kept walking, feeling like Natasha Bedingfeild (""Feel the rain on your skin""). Not 5 minutes later, the rain stopped. I walked out of the forest to feel the warmth of the sun on my face. I remember thinking: ""And people think that I'm boring..."" as I chuckled to myself. I honestly don't think I've ever felt more alive. However, my happiness turned to sadness as I realized that I wish that I had someone to share this with; someone who appreciates these things as much as me (preferably a cute girl). So, any introverts here like hiking? :)

It defines it so well and it makes it clear how loneliness and aloneness are not the same thing.

*“Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.”*

Being an introvert does not mean you are lonely, but that you enjoy aloneness. These are two entirely different things and I think we all agree on that.

My question is how much the desire for one is a gateway to the other.

I'm asking this because I recently started feeling lonely in a way that I've never felt before and I think my introversion might be a strong contributor.

Making and keeping friends involves spending time with them, getting to know them, going out. I've been getting more introverted with age, which was alright because I had maybe one or two friends I could spend time with. But I've recently moved to a new city and started a new job. Everything else was left behind and I started a new life. But my introversion has been making it very difficult to meet people and I've been feeling lonely and slightly depressed.

So in which ways is introversion related to loneliness? How many of you consider yourselves to be lonely in your aloneness? How do you cope with it?

I just wanted to let you guys know how grateful I am. I actually somehow miraculously found the courage to approach the other introvert. :] And I think this courage only came to life because I listened to what you all had to say first. It helped me realize that I was over thinking things and that I didn't need an excuse to approach someone.

We had a brief conversation that lasted all of four sentences and then we parted ways

I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but now I feel as though the ""stage is set"" so to speak. He isn't as stoic and detached as he seemed. He actually seemed a little warm and I could of sworn I caught a whiff of a sense of humor. :]

After sitting next to him again, I realized he smelled faintly of nicotine.  Next week before class, I'm going to ask him if he wants to have a smoke together before class starts. :] I think I am well on the way to making my first introverted friend.

So thank you all!

Even the most outgoing and extroverted people appeared to be uncomfortable.  So what is the point of putting everyone through that?  It does nothing but stress me out.  I end up having to do these things 10+ times a year because I have so many trainings and meetings where someone thinks it's a good idea.  

Also many of my trainings involve small group work followed by presentations to the larger group.  Again, nothing but stress for me, which leads me to not benefit from the training because I spend my time being stressed about the presentations rather than absorbing material.

I hate that when people ask what I did over Summer break, I feel ashamed for telling them the truth. So, I exaggerate. For the longest time, I was in denial over my personality but going through this subreddit has all but confirmed that I am 100% an introvert. I go out once a week (not including school/work) and it takes a lot of energy out of me. After more than 3-4 hours, I just can't stop obsessing over the fact that I would rather be at home. I've been trying to change my entire life but I suddenly realized that it is the root of my dissatisfaction in my life. I would make new friends, but several months later, I just... lose interest. I start turning them down because I don't feel like going out anymore - they'll take it personally and stop talking to me. The cycle starts over and I have to make new friends again. Whenever I have a plan to go somewhere, I spend ALL DAY thinking about it to the point that it ruins the rest of my day. I even sometimes think about it the night before and it gives me insomnia. So, a couple hours at a party ends up taking several hours of energy away from me even while at home. I want friends, but I don't want to feel like I have to go out all the time to keep them. I only have 2 close friends who have stuck by me since middle school. If it weren't for them, I would be 100% by myself.

I cannot work properly and efficiently with someone hovering over me. I become uncoordinated, my mind doesn't process properly and the easiest things seem unbelievably difficult.

Now, given that this is training, a scenario manifest where I am alone to do this work would not be entirely feasible, but I am confident that if left to my own devices, I would be able to do the job without much difficulty. That's not to say I'd master it in short order since it's something new, but I don't think I'd be fumbling around like the proverbial deer in the headlights, as I am currently.

I've been following this sub for quite a while now. I am definitely not an introvert by any means. I do really enjoy my personal time and some days I need the entire day to myself to recharge, but I imagine that's just part of being a human being. I generally view myself as outgoing and a fun-seeker, but, my, has my own view of my identity changed recently…

In September I moved to Madrid for school. I've lived in two other Spanish cities before, but this was my first time enjoying a prolonged stay in the capital city. Let me tell you — these people are fucking insane when it comes to partying. You don't go out until around one in the morning and you stay out until seven or eight am clubbing. Granted, it can be really fun to dance the night away, but in the States you'd be lucky to find a club that's open past four in the morning. Not here — you'd be lucky to find that *closes* that early.

I have made a bunch of great friends here — more acquaintances, save a small handful — who generally like to pal around and drink and smoke and do all the shit that extroverts do when they go out together. But my god, sometimes it's too much! They think I'm a party pooper if I don't feel like staying out til three am and then walking home 45 minutes in the dark. They think it's absurd to go to bed at any hour before one in the morning. This isn't just *madrileños*, either — it's everyone… Even Americans!

Now, I know I can be a homebody at times, but living here really fucks up your mentality of sociability. I mean, it'd be wonderful to hang out every weekend, but in order to do that, people want to *go out* to bars, restaurants, clubs, etc. What ever happened to inviting someone to your house and cooking for them? Or watching a movie together in your room? Or even just shooting the shit and gossipping at home? I don't know… it gets highly overwhelming when you know you can't just ""hang out"" because that would involve spending all your money and going places you don't even know if you'll enjoy being at.

You guys. I get it. I get it now and I'm glad I do. I do have some introvert friends (if you know anyone from Finland, you know the true definition of an introvert), but now I respect their personalities that much more. Just wanted to get that off my chest!

Throughout most of my life I have had few or no friends. I loved reading as soon as I learned how. By my pre-teens I was using discussion forums and chat rooms. I have spent most of my youth avoiding people. I have avoided parties, and when forced to attend, I have found somewhere quiet to draw or simply think. I have shunned classroom group-work. In my mid-teens I decided to become completely socially isolated and had no friends at all. I spent school breaks reading in the study hall, wearing earphones to block out all external sound. It was complete bliss.

After a while, though, I have to admit - the isolation got to me. I'd spent so much time being forced into social settings when I wanted to be alone, and then when I finally was left alone as I'd always wanted, I felt incredibly lonely. I tried to break out of my shell and realised I'd forgotten how to make friends. I became something of a misanthrope for a while.

When you talk to people - and I mean *really talk*, and discuss interesting things that matter - what's really the difference between reading and talking? There's a wealth of insight that can only be acquired by seeing real people and interacting with them.

Introverts, whatever you do, please do not end up isolating yourselves. You don't have to go to loads of wild parties or make a lot of small talk with random strangers (although they are a window into establishing meaningful relationships with people), but at the same time, do not trick yourselves into believing that you're not missing out when you spend all your time alone.

I noticed a lot of people on this forum seem to have trouble talking, I am the opposite, but the net result is the same, it feels like every word I have used has drained me completely and I feel like I need to recoup, where as everyone else just wants more hanging out and interacting - thus I avoid it and enjoy time by myself far more, thinking and reading about ideas for creations and artwork I want to do as well as the usual introverted stuff like gaming, movies and reading.

We're both Masters students and we've been taking the same classes since September. We only started talking last month. I liked her because of her honesty. She always says what she's thinking, no bullshitting or mind games. 

Last week *she* suggested we hang out at my place to cook together.  Although we're both not very talkative, all we did was talk until morning -the most fun I've had in a really long time. Sometime during our conversation, she mentions she's been single since November.

So today, I told her I really liked her. I don't have any experience with girls, so I'm not sure if the timing was right -given tomorrow being valentine's day and all the pressure that brings -but I just said how I felt.

She tells me she's a lesbian.

I feel both sad and relieved. Relieved, because I have a feeling I'd have messed this up somehow if she was interested. 

Anyway, that's it. It's the first time I ever asked a girl out, and I don't suppose anyone has a 100% record. It just feels bad putting myself out there, and getting turned down.

On the other hand, I see us becoming really good friends (unless, of course, she lied about being a lesbian to avoid saying she's not interested).

""How do you stay so quiet? I just can't stand it.""

This is simply an offering of my personal struggle with the acceptance and understanding of introversion as I passed through adolescence into adulthood.  My hope is that this may provide some kind of insight or comfort for those who may share my past experiences.  -For those who have questions about my thoughts on Introversion and depression,* ***please*** *refer to the addendum at the end of the post.*

*This is* ***my*** *profile; an illustration of how* ***I*** *became victim to my own perceptions, and how I learned to master them.  How* ***I*** *became lost, and then found myself.  I am 22 years of age.  I am a man.  I am an introvert.*


***Introversion vs. Social Anxiety***

I am not akin to social anxiety, I do not begrudgingly avoid the general public, nor do I feel anxious or uncomfortable in public places; I simply prefer the silence, solitude, and warmth of my own thoughts and wanderings.  Either with the few whom I call friend or in the welcoming, vast reaches of my inner thoughts is where and when I feel most at home.  My spoken word is scarcely heard.  But when it is, my every meaning, my every care, respect, and consideration is given.  My words, few, are likely to hold my true meaning; something I find tends to fall through tattered pockets carelessly left unmended by many.  

*Yes,* I am more likely to befriend a book on a warm summer night than a stranger at the park.  *Yes,* I am more likely to stay at home and browse forums than attend a social gathering.  And *yes,* I prefer the pages of a heart-felt poem or story over the shallow musings of most modern reality tv-shows and pop-music bands.  *But . .* this does not mean that I do not enjoy company at times.  This does not mean that I purposely cast myself aside in attempt to avoid fitting in.  I am simply me.  Me is the only me I know how to be; *and I am happy with who I am.*

***Loneliness mingles with hopes and dreams***

I know what it is to be alone.  I know the painful emptiness, the longing, and the comfortless nights of distant street lights shining through raindrops falling on the other side of the glass.  I know the dim imaginary shades of grey on bright sunny days when rays of smiles, held-hands, love, and happiness seem just a friend away.  I know the frustration that shadows the footsteps of missed opportunities; the women in my life that never were, and the friendships that could have been.  

*I know these tears, filled with the happiness and love I feel when thoughts of a family yet realized come to mind.*

I know both *chosen* loneliness, and the kind that only the desolate know.  I’ve pushed people away and I’ve pulled them back again.  I’ve chased dreams all the while tearing them down; I know the futility of wanting something I don’t.  I know the constant tension between me, myself, and I.  

*I know what it is to be aware of my own loneliness . . . even when I am surrounded by those who love me.*

***Growing***

When age and discipline come to pass and the tyrannical reign of chemicals and youthful angst are torn down, the mind, once again, becomes a friendly place.  I slowly crawled out of my cage into the sunlight; forgotten since my innocence.  I was reminded that the stranger, too, has thoughts, hopes, and dreams.  I was reminded that what I knew as home was not the only place in this world where I could stretch and enjoy myself. 

I became aware of what I was, who I was, and why I was.  I practiced stepping beck and turning my focus inward; something alien to me having always peered out.  I forged new experiences, relationships, and goals I previously felt unattainable.  I learned that reaching the seemingly unreachable can push me farther than I ever thought possible.  I learned that the world was not my enemy; but a garden, bountiful, offering fruit to those who overcame its challenges.  

*But most importantly,* I learned to challenge myself.  I learned that the only something standing between what I’ve always wanted and who I thought I was, was me.  All blame and frustration came crashing down as I accepted that ***I*** was the man behind the door.  

*I was the ever-elusive construct; I had facilitated my own misery.*

***New Experiences***

With new experiences comes new knowledge and understanding.  I had come to learn that the feelings and thoughts wandering the halls were things called perceptions.  I came to learn that my moods, biases, beliefs, thought processes, and pre-conceived notions all influenced how I perceived the world, myself, and my place in it.  I went to college; I opened my eyes to various schools of thought.  There I found an environment that didn’t constrain thought and effort to pencil and test.  I found an environment that encouraged the curious mind.  A place and a people that valued an open mind.  I found friends and mentors I could open up to and share in the revelry of unchained ambition.  

*And, for the first time in my life, I let loose any thought or fear of returning to my cage.*

***Acceptance and Understanding***

While I am free of my cage, I am still learning.  Young, I'm still figuring out how I work.  Young, I am still figuring out where my place is in this world.  It's what drives my interests in Psychology.  It drives me to better understand myself and my perceptions.  To be more cognitively aware of my surroundings and those who inhabit them.

*Through understanding, I grow.* 

*Through new experiences, I learn.*  

*And through new relations, I love.*

*I am an Introvert, and I am not alone.*



***Closing thoughts***

For the few who truly understand what it means to walk the line between self and one’s self, there is a long chain of struggle; each link representing a challenge.  All it takes is one weak link to free ourselves of perceived exile.  We are not excluded from the rest of the world; *we are of it.*  We all feel that pressure in our chests when challenging our perceived boundaries; scary as it may seem, the rewards for pushing through are nothing less than our hopes and dreams.

Having spent so much time in our cages, we develop a sense of helplessness.  All one needs to do to find one’s self and open their eyes to the possibilities is to find that one weak link.  Find a challenge, small as it may be, and conquer it.  Keep taking on challenges and, over time, build up confidence in yourself.  Learn to trust yourself and to believe in your goals.



***ADDENDUM:  Depression and Introversion***

While depression and introversion are not mutually dependent, those who know the two well know what a cruel and unforgiving bitch they can be.  And while one does not necessarily or directly cause or correlate with the other, *they can and do facilitate one another when combined.*  This unfortunate pairing makes for a very difficult cycle to break out of.  Sorting out and understanding perceptions that seemingly support one another and then attempting to grasp the idea that said perceptions are delusions is no task to be taken lightly.  If you feel like you are struggling, *seek help.*  *There is no shame in a helping hand.*

He didn't really have an answer for that. 

My family just doesn't get that I don't want to go downstairs and have to socialize with everyone and talk about what I'm doing this week and such.

I can't tell you enough how ecstatic I was when I stumbled upon a comment posted by some redditor with a link to this subreddit.

I've always known myself to be an introvert ever since high school and have always been quite comfortable being one. However, during years of formal education, it has somehow been buried deep down in my psyche. 

Allow me to extend my sincerest gratitude to you for helping in rediscovering myself during a critical time of my life. 

To the entire community of introverts on reddit and the world over, I raise my glass to you.

Cheers.

I think it's pretty important to make sure that like minded folk are spared the same experience.

First, forget all of those images in your mind of pristine beaches lined with empty lounge chairs. There is no place on the ship or on the shore where there will not be a crowd of people. Even when you're alone in a crowd (what I often enjoy for people watching purposes), it's not a regular scenario. Everyone thinks that because you're alone and you're all on this ship together, that of course you want to chit-chat! They'll talk about the weather or where you're from and you'll cringe because none of this matters and you'd rather either zone out or have some type of real conversation rather than superficial nonsense. But the people who love cruises seem like they're all extraverts and it's not always their strong suit to understand that some of us *like* being alone.

Second, if you are intent on doing something alone (like eating), everyone is baffled. In an exchange with the wait staff one morning as I was seated for breakfast, the waiter asked ""Why are you so lonely?"" and because this was at the end of the cruise and I was frustrated, I retorted with ""Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely."" His smirk turned serious and he apologized for joking but after being questioned again and again if I really only wanted a table for one, I needed to say *something*. My husband isn't a breakfast person so I ate it alone every day. Is it so strange that someone would enjoy a quiet meal sipping tea and staring out at the ocean? 

The few times when we did feel most happy and comfortable were usually at dinner or in the one little bar that seemed to be on the ship only for us. We chose the dinners that were an extra cost because we realized that we were bombarded with chatty vacationers much less. And our little bar, quite literally, served only us for hours on end and was the haven outside of our little room.

While I don't want to leave the impression that cruises are worse than burning in a pit of fire for all eternity, it's just not my preferred way to relax. Being alone in the middle of the ocean is pretty cool until you realize that you're trapped out there with 3,000 people and there are very few ways to get away from them.

So let's make this more productive than just my little rant. Has anyone had a similar experience with cruising? What are your favorite vacation types/destinations?

It monitors our time spent on the projects we do, when our computers are idle, when we take a break,  and the admins of the program can take screenshots of what any of us are working on at any time the program is on. I freaking hate this program. 

It feels like I'm constantly being watched now. Like someone is breathing down my neck, and I hate it. I'm on a break right now, trying not to cry over it, I hate it so much. I'm not trying to hide anything. I do my work, and don't waste time if I can help it. I'm productive. But now this freaking computer program is constantly spying on me. I just can't get over this feeling of constantly being watched.... 

I work as a graphic designer. Used to we just kept track of hours on a paper time sheet. Simple, and I liked it. I'm honest and wrote down breaks and such too. Now our new business manager, who I strongly dislike, has implemented this Time Doctor thing and just.... Blah! 

I don't know how to deal with this. I'm starting to get scared coming to work. I can't have my privacy to work alone anymore it feels like.... 

Maybe I'm just being paranoid and not just introverted....

**Edit:**

Wow, so much response. I'm calmed down now, so maybe I can convey my feelings a lot more clearly now.

Another coworker and myself talked with our business manager about this some. This Time Doctor program is on a trial basis supposedly, and our business manager will ask us what we think about it after awhile. I guess this will give me a chance to speak up about it. The whole idea of installing this program is so that we can more accurately bill our clients (we often charge them on an hourly basis). I just know how such things are a double edged sword.

What really gets to me though is the feeling of being watched. If someone stands over my shoulder and watches me while I work, I become a nervous wreck and make mistakes left and right. That's what bothers me most about this program... that if somehow I'm doing something the wrong way, I'll get yelled at about it later... or that somehow I'm not doing my job the right way, etc. This is why I posted this to r/introvert, because needing to work on my own, in my own way, and with my privacy is necessary for me to be productive and at peace in my head. 

To those who say to quit my job, I wish it were that easy. I do want to look for a new place to work, as I have lots of other complaints about this place, but I have a lot of stressful things I'm having to deal with at the moment. I'll look for a new job as soon as I'm able to, but until then.... I guess I just gotta deal with this and not be a nervous, paranoid wreck about it.

People I know well describe me as possibly the most cynical person they've ever met. Don't get me wrong, I have a reasonable number of friends (including a gorgeous partner) and I love all of them to death. So my comments here don't apply to them as they have ""proven themselves"", I guess.

But as far as other people go, I have an active distaste for most people. I don't trust them, I don't want to or like interacting with them, I question their sincerity and motives constantly and I have a hard time trusting other people. It takes me quite a long time to warm up to people, and I absolutely cannot stand meeting new people.

I feel like I'm the only man on the island at times in that other people don't have this to the same degree as I do. Now, I should clarify, when I say I ""have an active distaste"", that does NOT mean I would harm anyone -- I'd rather just choose to ignore them and not have to deal with them than interact with them.

I got picked on a lot as a kid, and whilst I don't think this has contributed to my introversion, I think it has contributed to my outlook on people. I guess you could say I've just gotten sick of being disappointed when people don't turn out to be who they or I might like to think they are -- so it's now my default position that people are arseholes until they prove themselves otherwise.

But somehow, surprisingly, those who know me describe me as quite a nice guy. I have no idea why because I know that I must come off as a real jerk at times.

I work in an office with about 75 woman who are very ""cliquey."" I've been here for six months, but I don't get involved in office gossip or drama between the cliques because that's just not my thing.

It's shaping up to be a very FML kind of day.


**Edit:** I'm not actually worried about getting home, just dreading asking people I barely know for a favor and thought r/introvert could probably relate.

1360644243.0,59,self.introvert,18cyaj,My theory is that partner dancing like swing or tango is the perfect social activity for introverts because of the structured nature of the interaction.  ,83,24,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/18cyaj/my_theory_is_that_partner_dancing_like_swing_or/,"To start out I'll first admit that yes I was super nervous asking people to dance for a long time but once I got over that dancing has been the perfect social situation for me.  I'm wondering if anyone else on this subreddit has had similar experience.  

Let me summarize the social protocol for a typical dance.  

1. Ask someone to dance.  They almost always say yes.
2. Dance with them for 1 (or 3 in the case of tango) song(s).  
3. Thank them for the dance and you're done.  

Why do I think this is ideal for introverts?  I'll use letters this time.

A) Club dancing is difficult for me because I don't know what I'm supposed to do so I feel like I'm just randomly flailing.  In partner dancing there are lessons so you can actually know what you're doing.  
 
B) You get to deal with one person at a time - very manageable.  Also, once you're dancing with someone you don't have to compete for their attention, which makes it a lot easier to meet people for those of us who don't like to force our way into the conversation.

C) The end of a dance is a totally natural, non-awkward, end of interaction with someone.  You never have to worry about extracting yourself from a conversation with an overly chatty person because the song is going to be over in 2 minutes anyway.  If you're not dancing and someone is talking your ear off, you can just say that you want to go dance.  

D) The fact that people are friendly and almost always say yes when you ask them to dance has been a big confidence boost.  

E) The feeling of structured interaction lets me be myself as an introvert.  'I can't talk and dance at the same time,' and 'I'm sitting this one out,' are both acceptable things to say.

Horrendously, unspeakably lonely, stranded on a desert island in the middle of a still, sweltering ocean.

I can't seem to make friends. I quit drinking over a year ago and I haven't been able to get close to anyone in the time since. I had two close drinking friends and obviously I can't be around them much any more. I've made a few acquaintances but there's nobody I spend time with, nobody I will call just to chat, nobody to go to the movies, nobody to go hiking. I don't get invited places very often, and when I do I'm usually too exhausted to go (insane schedule with school, work, therapy, etc.) I think I have a reputation as a ""refuser"" because of this, because people don't understand that I **want** to do stuff- you bet your ass I'd love to- but I'm *fucking tired.* 

Even if I weren't tired, I don't really feel connected to anyone. I don't particularly like many people my age. When I do go out with people, I don't get absorbed in to conversations, I usually sit by myself in silence and when I do speak up I get ignored. I vastly prefer one-on-one interaction. Or even online interaction. But I feel like when I reach out to people on these levels I get rejected. Not to mention the silent panic I feel in groups, where my brain tells me, ""RUN! GET OUT! GET OUT OF HERE! GO!!!"" And I give in to the panic more often than not, because I feel woefully unequipped to fight it.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, what's wrong with me, why everyfuckingbody else can seem to make at least one friend or worm their way happily into a clique, but I'm alone. Me and my book. Me and my car. Me and my plants. Me and the internet. A lot of the time I'm perfectly content to be by myself, but I'd like maybe just once a week or so to just have a nice relaxed time out of the house with someone. Lately I just feel suffocated under my own loneliness and the weight of my responsibilities. I feel like it's been ages since I did anything enjoyable.

Lately, I've been feeling a bit worried. See, I'm an introvert, but the thing is, I can easily spend a month or two alone by myself and not be bothered at all. Even then, when I came back (My family owns a cabin up in Colorado, so I went up there to do some work on it) and started hanging out with friends, my desire to be alone was almost instant. I'm not socially awkward by any means and can socialize quite well, but the desire to be alone has grown significantly, to the point where I frighten myself with how much I actually want to be left alone. It's not good, and I'm seriously starting to conflict with myself and getting depressed in the process. I'll often force myself to hang out with people just to prove to myself I can still do it, but right away, BAM, I want to be as far away from them as possible, and alone. It's not that I hate them by any means, and I guess I'm having an OK time with them, just the desire to be alone has become too strong now.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Any advice for me?

It is perhaps, for me, one of the most difficult things that I deal with because as a married father I am surrounded by a family that I love and loves me back but at the very same time I am lonely.   Perhaps it is because even within my own family I am not understood and I can’t put words to the way I am really. 

I enjoy doing things with my family all the time but I am very “back and forth” I am good with doing something all of us together for a short time and then I want to be left alone to do my thing and then I want to do things again for a bit and then go back to being left alone.   I am sure it is difficult for my wife and I know she doesn’t understand it completely because I am often not left alone to be by myself for a bit and this can cause some anxiety or frustration.   And the lack of understanding who I am makes me feel lonely within my own family.

At the same time, I have such a great capacity to love my friends and extended family but the shy introvert in me makes it so that I cannot express it the way I wish I could.   It’s too late now for much of it.  I have cousins that I grew up with that I love and think about and hope the best for but I have zero close relationships with any family members outside of my immediate.   They don’t even know how much I care.   They aren’t happy to see me when I go to family events or spend time talking with me like we are friends because I have never done that with them.  I do not fault them, I fault myself for never being able to overcome this feeling that I can’t properly connect and express my love.   If it makes any sense, I feel like I protect myself because I feel as though I love too much or get too emotionally invested that I try to dial it back so it doesn’t seem strange and so that I don’t get hurt by silly things.

When it comes to friends I am more open with them but only a couple.  These are the friends I grew up with that I love like a brother and sister though I do not know I ever really said that to them.   We have been friends for nearly 30 years.   I don’t even like to call them friends they are so much more… but as I’ve grown older, more cynical, more awkward, more introverted… making any kind of new friend is extremely difficult because I just do not find that I relate and I’m so guarded.    It’s tough to be surrounded by people and yet still feel lonely.   I wish more people understood me.  I often wish I could be different.

Usually, presentations are given by one or two people -- you sit there and watch. Cool. I can deal with that. But this one's ""open table."" It's solely meant to network with others.

Increasingly, I'm finding that careers are all about networking. It's not necessarily about what you know, but the fact that you know PEOPLE and regularly meet up with them. This, to me, is direly unfortunate.

Almost every day of my life I wish to just sit behind the scenes and not have to meet up with people just to network. It's a dream to me. But more and more, I get roped into going to these meetups. I've declined several times, but it's still troubling when you're constantly turning these things down. 

It's just not *me*. And many people don't understand it -- especially in the workplace. My close friends understand it, sure. But at the workplace, you're encouraged to cater to the client/customer and meet with your peers for no other reason than to chat and network. I guess I'm just not one for smalltalk.

I've always been a huge proponent of introversion. It's a beautiful thing and it's great to help others who feel as though it's not normal. It just gets to you sometimes, when you're expected to do the sort of thing without batting an eye.

I think we all agree, that a majority of societies aspects are extrovert-based. This forces me way too often to pretend being someone else, ""being extroverted"". Maybe some examples that come to my mind:

• at college (lectures): it's not like I don't know the answers, but I just don't want to get drawn to the center of attention, so mostly I stay quiet and observe the discussion. My professor misinterprets this as lacking motivation and gives me far worse grades than the people that are just talking and talking and talking (even if its nonsense)

• at college (outside the lectures): of course, if it's something that draws my interest, I'm up for a talk, but in most cases the time you get to know people its boring small talk. And I hate small talk. So I just give short answers, people misinterpretend this as offending behaviour and stop talking to me, making me isolated in the class community.

• at the doctor: I visit the pedriatist monthly, and (the poor lad) works on my feet for about 45 min. This means 45 min talking. Mostly small talk. But what choice do I have? If I just give short answers or tell him to talk, he thinks I'm rude. 

• going out: I denied invitations from my extroverted friends for some weeks now, and they are starting to get pissed. Like it's expected for a normal person to go partying every friday and saturday.

Those were just some examples. In most cases I have to pretend being more extroverted than I am (I'm quite the introverted person), in order to succeed in society. It's expected of me to make friends, blabla in lectures etc. to become sucessful. Another thing is my hobby. Luckily, I'm not the only introverted person with strange hobbies. However, I claim that some interests attract introverted people in special. Some stuff I REALLY like: speedcubing, kendo, anime, artisan crafts, doing photoshop stuff, cosplay, sitting on the bed listening to music for hours. I can talk with my friends about music - but none of them likes the other stuff. Hell, some people would even stop talking to me if they knew how obsessed I am about anime and artisan crafts. Well, society tought us (or atleast me), that it is wrong for a 23 yo male to tailor stuff or watch anime. Rather, it's expected that I go out every day with friends, go to the movies, having lunch with them and barely be at home. This lead for me to a dichotomy. I can't enjoy being myself since I feel that I'm wrong. I do not fit the societies idea of a normal person. Meh, it's hard to put it in words, I hope you get my point. It's not like I didn't think about changing this. But I barely get to meet new friends, it's even more rare that they share my interests. And of course I just can't stop attending college or receive medical treatment. I feel so many restraints, that I even lost track about who or what I am. Ultimately this leads to living a uncomfortable life, barely able to enjoy stuff.

Back at a barbecue with some work friends in the summer, the host's wife's sister brought her son to the party. Something hit me really hard and I realised I wanted to start a family. I got talking to the child's mother and she stressed that the most important thing in having a kid is having a support network around you.

My husband and I don't have family within 250 miles of us. I don't have a support network. How do introverts start families if they don't necessarily thrive on having that support?

Another thing is depression and chronic illness. People go on about needing a support network for that, too. They say they learn who their 'true friends' are, and who really cares for them. But when I was depressed and now that I have long-term health issues, I didn't and don't feel an urge to reach out to other people.

Unfortunately in my company that is not an option.  They are big into face-to-face communication and just spent many millions of dollars on a new office building.

Well, I suffered a little accident last weekend which resulted in an overnight hospital stay and a broken vertebra.  I was released after one night but, needless to say, I wasn't in a hurry to rush back to the office.  My boss agreed to let me work from home and a friend who lives nearby brought my laptop.

Working from home is better than I imagined.  For one, I gained an additional 2.5 hours of sleep while ""returning home"" at the same hour (my drive is 1 hour each way.. I know, it sucks).  Secondly, I found myself *more* productive than I am while at the office.  A comfortable, quiet atmosphere does amazing things for my cognitive abilities.  I was able to think through issues better, work things to completion without distractions, and I genuinely enjoyed doing my job more while I was at home (even with a broken back!).

Another learning: so much office time is wasted chit chatting with coworkers.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not misanthropic  and I have made a few close friends from work but the objective of work hours should be productivity, not socialization.  Perhaps the best benefit of working from home was that once 5pm came, I was energized and eager for the evening, unlike my normal routine of getting home, changing into comfortable clothing, and decompressing after an exhausting day ""on"" both socially and mentally.

I really like my job and the company I work for so quitting and finding a job that allows telecommuting isn't a practical option.  In fact, I'd happily take a $1,000 pay cut for the privilege of working from home.

I can only hope that some event will push telecommuting to ubiquity.  Until then, I'll always have this week.

If you'll help me I'll be grateful forever.

I'm an extremely extroverted person, with an introverted girlfriend. We've been together for five weeks. We're doing almost perfectly, and we both know that our relationship is going to last for a long time. But there are some problems which are becoming more apparent every day. Even though she does say that she's perfectly fine with how I talk to her more than she talks to me, it makes me anxious about if I'm talking too much or if she's uncomfortable.

I also have a lot of introverted friends. Most of my friends are. I'm in an international high-school system that is known for having a lot of introverted people in it. Most of the time everybody (-else than the clique of extroverts we have-) just keeps to themselves. I like all of my friends, but the introverted ones are my best ones. They might be hard to get close to, but when they're friends, they're the best ones. Deep and philosophical without saying anything that they don't see as valuable to the discussion. But I have a hard time interacting with them. I don't know if it's me being obnoxious, which I'm afraid of being, or because they're introverted.


Anyways, the questions I'm presenting here are:

* As an extrovert, how can I be better boyfriend to an introvert?
* Are there any things that extroverts probably don't know about introverts which I should know?
* Any general tips on how to interact with introverted people?
* Will our relationship suffer from the differences in our personalities?
* If it will suffer, how can I make myself more introverted? (I'd rather change as a person than lose her)

Also, I just wanted to use this post to also say that you're all very wonderful and intelligent people. I love you introverts. Your way of talking only when you have something very important or profound is something I like about my girlfriend and my introverted friends the most. While I know the exterior world extremely well, you introverts seem to know more about yourself and the world within than I ever will. I admire this, and with the meditation I have been doing, I will hopefully reach the same levels of interior observational skills as you have.

If you know a subreddit for this type of thing, do let me know and i'll x-post it there.

So I've been experimenting with handshakes lately during first-time social encounters.

The idea is when someone you're meeting for the first time is raising their hand to you, you maintain eye contact and you put a little extra strength into it. Not too much so as to be unconfortable and considered a challenge by that person, but enough so that the other person is caught off guard with a tight grip.

The reactions have been fascinating. Some people immediately straighten up and apply extra strength to their grip. A small group simply doesn't care, most likely because they themselves have a strong grip and were unimpressed by yours. The most interesting group is of those people that seem to immediately be fascinated by what you're saying and doing. They maintain eye contact, ask you questions and genuinely listen to what you're saying. 

It's as if you've established your dominance and there are those which are not impressed by it, those that try to challenge it and those that completely surrender themselves to it.

Being the introvert quiet type, I have always felt that people where not impressed by my first impression. After starting this, carefully varying the strength of my grip, I notice some interesting changes. 

The best results come when, for example, a common friend introduces you to a group a three to four people. To the first person you offer your normal handshake, to the second a stronger one and to the third an almost non existing one. It's fascinating how the initial social exchange operates from there. I also notice different behaviour from men and women.

Anyway, this is probably absurd, but it has been the source of much entertainment during the first minutes of conversation with someone you just met.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,False,,,True,t3_pzebp,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/pzebp/on_handshakes/,

Basically, now that it's summer, I've been enjoying a lot of relaxing at home, and I haven't been completely alone so it's not like I'm lonely.

People will always give out or swear by this seemingly deceptive advice: ""Stay true to yourself. Be who you are. Don't change yourself to impress others"". What a load of crap. Job interviewing tips and tricks constantly tell you to come off as confident, bold, and strong. They'll tell you to communicate like you know what you're talking about, even if it's total nonsense that's coming out of your mouth. New employees are trained to make lots of small talk to make themselves seem friendlier and more approachable by their co-workers. At job interviews, they expect you to answer every question on-the-spot, without taking the time to think anything over. Most want you to ""think-out-loud"", so they can hear your thought process. Introverts don't do well with this, they'd rather take 10 mins, think it over themselves, and then explain their process.

So, to succeed in Western society that came out of the popularization of the extrovert ideal, the introvert has to FAKE it. Fake all of it. I fake social interactions on a daily basis. Yesterday, I was in meetings from 9 AM to 2 PM, had another social event to go to from 2 - 5 PM, had dinner with a bunch of friends from 5 - 7 PM at a fancy grill, attended a networking convention from 7 - 9:30 PM and got driven home by a colleague. To anyone else, it looked like I enjoyed ALL of it. I smiled, interacted, socialized, and hell, no-one all day would have known that I was heavily introverted. They all think I came off as extremely friendly and sociable. This is all a lie. I can't ""stay true to myself"" if I have to completely change who I am to keep up impressions with my peers. 

I'm halfway through [Susan Cain's QUIET](http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362209254&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=susan+cain+quiet) book right now, and oh my god it is life changing. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet. It seriously exposes all the flaws with society and how humans fabricated it and put the extrovert on a pedestal while shunning introverts all around. Yet, it's the introverts who are changing the world with their revolutionary ideas. There's tons of interesting topics, like how creativity and innovation comes from pure solitude, not bullshit ""group brainstorming sessions"" that your boss might seem keen on.

Even [Amy Cuddly's TED Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc) on Body Language (one of the best TED talks I've ever seen, by the way), her key takeaway is to ""Fake it till you become it"". She essentially gives you the golden secret to faking confidence through dominance posing, i.e., you come off as more confident in a job interview if you power-pose for a couple minutes before the interview. I've actually tried this myself and it does indeed work. I noticed a drastic improvement in my verbal communication abilities and body language during the interviews that I power-posed beforehand.

So whenever someone tells me to ""Be who I am"", I can't help but laugh in my head. If I was myself, I wouldn't be who I am where I am right now. I faked my way uptil here, and I'm going to keep faking it till I become it. Fuck, sometimes it just hurts that I can't live the way I want to because I wouldn't get anywhere if I did. I just used the good old ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" advice and I fake extroversion on a daily basis now. If any of you watch the TV show Dexter, you'll know what I mean. He's a hardcore introvert and survives by seeming normal to the outside world.

Don't know how I'm supposed to feel.,59,11,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1cu16n/extroverted_boyfriend_brought_up_something_that/,"My boyfriend is VERY extroverted. Loves to party, has more friends than I can count. When we first started dating a year and a half ago, I tried to pretend I wasn't an introvert and I tried going to parties with him and going out to bars and all that. Ended up having anxiety attacks that just embarrassed me in front of him and his friends. Eventually we talked and figured out what kind of things I'm comfortable doing, and what things I need to sit out on.

It was about a year ago that we had that talk and no issues related to my introversion came up until recently. I've just been feeling depressed lately because I don't make friends easy and I'm pretty lonely. Usually I enjoy the solitude. But this also makes it so my boyfriend is really the only person that is close to me. He is starting to get annoyed because he feels as though he has too much responsibility being the only one I really talk to. Like if he's busy and can't talk, or if he just wants some time alone, I get depressed.

We got into a small fight (he goes to school very far away so we mainly talk through e-mail or texts)... And this is an excerpt from the e-mail he sent me...

&gt;""Why do you think every goddamn time you're like ""I met someone at work"" I beg you to get their number, text them, hang out. I might be the only person to give you attention, but I have friends. I have roommates. I have other people in my life. I'm feeling pretty spread thin with the amount of attention I have left to give to people. And the whole friend thing is a tough situation. One of my biggest fears is what happens if we move in together and you don't make friends. In the time I've known you you've put in such a minimal effort into making friends (they don't just happen. You have to find them, talk to them, put effort into hanging out even if it isn't convenient). We will not work out in the long run if I am the only person you have. You can blame it on anxiety or your personality or whatever, but just because you have obstacles in your way doesn't mean you can just say ""meh I don't need that anyway""""

I don't know what to do. I can't make him understand. People don't *want* to be my friend. I HAVE tried texting people to hang out, I really do try. But most of the time I'm okay on my own.

People on the low end of neuroticism, like myself, are resilient introverts that a lot of the above mentioned introverted needs/desires don't apply to. Resilient introverts can study in public, don't care if their office door is open or not, don't care about distractions, and are not as bothered by crowds and noise.

I've always been an introvert. I went to a small high school and had a group of friends only because it was hard *not* to have friends in that environment. When I went to college, however, I avoided social activities like the plague. I never made a new friend in the 5 years I was in college. I even avoided my roommates as much as possible. I married my highschool girlfriend (who was my girlfriend on and off through college), and she had been pretty much my only friend (all I felt I needed) for nearly 7 years until we divorced.

I'm now 34 years old and over the last several of years I'm really starting to regret the way I've completely wasted my 20's. I realize that I have no social skills, and I'm completely alone. I've been doing my best to keep up appearances, not be depressed, keep a positive mind, etc. I take care of myself, keep physically in shape, and try to get out of the apartment whenever I get the chance. But, as each day passes, I feel a greater pressing need to have people in my life. My ultimate goal is to re-marry and have a family, but I know that I can't just look for one woman to alleviate my loneliness. Also, I know my chances of meeting someone will be much higher if I have a group of friends.

I've read Dale Carnegie's book, *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, and I understand the principles of making friends (at least I think I do). But I feel the book just wasn't written for people like me. I don't even know how to put myself in situations where I can meet new people. And when I try to force myself to do it, ie, go out to a bar or something, I feel completely uncomfortable and end up just being that loser sitting alone at the bar staring at his beer. Most people have places like church or work, but as an atheist who works from home, my options are more limited. Being 34 makes it even more difficult. Most people my age are married and have families of their own. 

This is partly just a way for me to vent some emotions, but I would also love some feedback from some other introverts. I'm hoping someone else out there has been in a similar situation and has found a way out of what seems like a downward spiral into ""forever alone"".

Im usually the guy who is easy to communicate when you are alone with me, otherwise the other people starts talking too much that im not ""keeping up"". If we are more than three people and everybody has stuff to say it always ends up with me being quiet until the discussion dies out, and at that point i may start another discussion (which im pretty good at actually) and i wont talk again until there are several seconds of silence (or when i know that someone else wont say anything when im trying to speak because my voice is low and not that recognizavle). You get the point.

so me and my two workmates (boss and colleague) just went to eat lunch in our cafeteria. Two other people who are new to our workplace sat down at our table, and everybody started talking. Before everybody had sat down at our table i asked one of the new people what she was eating (to prevent silence i guess but also because i was interested). But after that i was silent for 35min straight until i left the lunch table (rest stayed a little bit longer because they enjoy talking or w/e). I just cannot participate in discussions when there are no room for me to chime in and say something, before i left the table there were even 2 discussions going on (2+2) while i was quiet. Im not annoyed by this myself, but i recognize that every time im not saying anything for a while people think about this and if a sudden silence shows up, i know theyre like ""why isnt he saying anything"", since im not just that silent guy, in this situation im not saying anything in like 20min. Until they all come up with something new to talk about.

I'm an immensely introverted person; I tire of socializing very quickly and need breaks often (like most of you). But when I finally do get my solid alone time to recharge, people are always texting me. I'm fine with ignoring them, I have an ""I'll get back to you when I get back to you"" attitude, however it still feels a little like socializing in an obscure way. When I'm alone, I want complete detachment from everyone except myself, so having my phone on and hearing/seeing a text come in keeps me from feeling truly separated from the society of others. It's wearying. I need this time every single day for at least a couple hours (normally I'm finally able to get it at night). I had been feeling depressed and couldn't figure out what I needed. I hadn't done anything with my friends in a while, which got me wondering if I'd been too antisocial and needed some camaraderie, but I didn't really want to hang out with anyone either. After some reflection, I ended up concluding that I haven't had enough time to just myself. I usually know this by the slightly souring disposition rising within me toward my friends. I never do anything outwardly, but when I feel mentally overwhelmed and exhausted from the ceaseless hobnobbing, I notice my empathy takes off out of the window. I find their conversation and first world woes tedious, causing feelings of indignation. So, I decided to just shut my phone off for an unspecified length of time and now I feel fantastic! I'm finally **alone** and have been alone for an entire night and day. I don't care if I get swamped with texts when I turn my phone back on (honestly, chances are I won't return ~~all~~ most of them), I've been feeling great from not even knowing if they're coming in, which is providing me the *left alone* feeling I've been in terrible need of. Do any of you other introverts ever feel and do the same? Also, is it bad that I don't want to turn my phone back on? I mean, I'll have to Monday because of work, so this isn't forever, but I don't want to until then. I love feeling only obligated to myself recharging right now.

So I keep myself recharged with a weekly (as an ideal, anyway) day hike, solo. I also do a fair bit of reading (though not as much as I'd like) and my daily shower is a bit of ""me"" time I look forward to. I also take occasional solo trips to museums and bookstores. I can even be happy by myself in a busy coffee shop; the key for me is not interacting, even if there are other people there.

I am an extrovert who wishes to commune with you all. I've noticed there's quite a lot of you here so I want to know a few things.

It seems that introverts make up a large percentage of the internet, for obvious reasons, but I see a lot of you here seem to hate extroverts, or at least express a disdain for them. For example, I see posts saying they wish they could tell extroverts to ""shut the fuck up"". I mean, there's introversion and then there's just being a jerk.

I get that you guys feel oppressed in an ""extrovert's world"" but what I see here is this groupthought-esque behavior from introverts saying that they're the champions because they don't ""waste time on trivial small talk"" and ""actually talk about things that have meaning."" This is another point I wish to bring up: Why does everything have to have a deeper meaning? When I'm around a group of people, I just talk about whatever comes to mind. It fills the silence, and I hate silence. I like mingling and getting to know people and you can't get to know people unless you talk to them, right?

I'm an extrovert (ESFP on the MBTI if you're into that kind of thing) but I don't let being an extrovert define me. It makes me sad to see introverts engage in this kind of behavior because I genuinely want to like you guys, as I do all people. Help me understand why you feel you need these ""rules for interaction"" and ""How to Live with an Introvert"" infographics. It's a bit demeaning reading them from this side of the fence.

Which brings me to the core of the issue: I feel like with all this talk of extroverts, it makes it seem like you don't want us here sharing this internet with you. I'm an extrovert, so I'm an annoying, obnoxious, incessantly talking automaton without meaning or depth, right?

It was a pretty big party in a small apartment, with a lot of people I didn't know. During the first few hours things went well. I managed to have nice, quiet conversations with a bunch of people I knew and some I didn't know (usually one-on-one of course), and then ran out of steam. That was probably the moment when I should have left, but I stayed... because I would have been the first to go, and also because I do enjoy taking part in conversations by simply listening and smiling. Mind you, I was not the only one - there were a couple of others doing the same thing. But I made the mistake of taking out my phone and playing a quick game while waiting for the right moment to call it a night.

That's when the Loud-Mouthed Patronizing Extrovert (LoMPE) spotted this preposterous transgression, and her banshee screeching and wailing made everyone in the city check on their elderly. ""YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!! I'M NOT SEEING RIGHT!"" she yelled. Countering my carefully worded, explanatory ""Huh?"", LoMPE attacked me with an avalanche of words too numerous to remember. Something along the lines of ""YOU KNOW THIS IS A SOCIAL EVENT, RIGHT? YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SO-CIA-LIZE."", but stretched into enough words to power her mini-gun-like style of conversation for much longer than necessary. And certainly loud enough for everyone to hear over the music and all the conversations that were already fighting said music themselves.

So I had to signal to her that if she actually wants to hear an explanation, she'd have to shut up long enough for me to put a thought into words. Which by 2am and after a number of unusually many small-talk conversations wasn't exactly easy for me to do. But finally she obliged. I told her what I told you - I had some nice conversations that night and I've run out of fuel. I'm an introvert. I can also just sit and listen. No, that doesn't mean I'm always *happy* like that, but that's the way it works. Yes, I could go home and sleep, but you don't get to tell me to do that.

And then I began to explain how there's always someone like her at a party, trying to talk to me in a very patronizing way, trying to ""fix"" me or worse yet, congratulating me on being brave enough to leave my house and go to a social event. How I end up feeling bad for starting to hate a person who never meant to make me uncomfortable, who obviously meant well and may even be genuinely interested in something they know they don't understand. And how she must be feeling very clever for pulling me into a conversation about not being able to have another conversation.

Instead, a few incoherent words tumbled out, falling onto the floor and forming a sad puddle with the reflection of a semi-retarded loner staring back at me. I just ended up looking at the LoMPE with a weird mixture of a tired smile and the look of disapproval, ending the conversation. I proceeded to awkwardly look at the other people in the room, trying to listen a bit, until finally someone started leaving.

Finally, something clicked in my head. He loves playing D&amp;D with his friends on weekends, and he hates seafood. This sounds kind of random, but bear with me.

I gave him two different examples:

1) Whenever I get seafood when we're out, I offer him a bite. He usually refuses, but sometimes he does try it. He sometimes really loves it, to his surprise, but most of the time he quietly washes it down.

I explained to him that to me, socializing is seafood. I will try it for him, but if he tries to force it on me every time, he can't be surprised if I refuse over and over, or say okay and then change my mind when the seafood is looming near to my face. I also explained that I NEVER force him to eat seafood, especially not via guilt, but he DOES force me to socialize, through making me feel bad about my personality/preferences.

He started to understand what I meant, but I continued the metaphor into a new one, using his hobby/hobbies as examples:

2) He loves D&amp;D and Warmachines with his friends. I've played both here and there but really don't have a vested interest in either. I'm obviously 100% fine with him playing those things, but if he invited me over to a friend's house to watch them play Warmachines, I'd be bored and uncomfortable (and I would definitely say no). Then I replaced the words- if he has a hobby ([Warmachines/D&amp;D/Extreme Volleyball/Socializing/miniature trains]) and invites me out for [socializing] when I'm not part of that hobby, he shouldn't be surprised when I say no. Just like I shouldn't expect him to suddenly like [seafood] just because I keep forcing it on him, or for either of us to suddenly want to start [quilting].

Sorry, I know this is long winded, and for some people this may be really basic and you already came to this solution, but for everyone else who's around extroverts who just don't Get You, maybe try to think of a hobby they hate (or a dislike they have) and liken it to being forced to sit through several hours of that hobby or being forced to eat a food they hate.

*tl;dr:  Let others know that ""socializing = hobby I'm not into"". Socializing isn't a necessity for happy, healthy living, just like being a bottle cap collector or card castle builder isn't.*

I recently started college, and people have been telling me similar things, along the lines of ""we can fix that"" or ""that's OK, I'll make you social"" when I tell them I'd rather stay in my dorm. Some mean no offense, but it's been very irritating to hear, and I can never think of something to say back.

Also, how do you get people to stop randomly hugging you? I can't bring myself to be blunt about it, and constantly meeting these wildly hyper people who do this is so aggravating. And these are the same people who come up to me in the cafeteria to sit with me, and chat away while I listen awkwardly. Earphones don't repel them :|

I always get the ""you're too quiet"". And what sucks more is that people tell me that I'm too pretty to be quiet (in no way am I tooting my own horn) but I feel as if my being an introvert is unattractive to most. I used to be wild, crazy, life of the party but I don't know if it was my depression that changed me. I've changed so much. I never want to go out. I'm a hermit. What sucks/hurts more is that I'm single now because of this. My ex boyfriend chose the partying and going out life over me.

I like to be social, but I can only take so much.)  and in turn what introverts are, but they usually will say things like 'No, you aren't."" or ""you have to get over that."" whenever I say something bothers me, or that I need to not play 100,000 questions, and it drives me insane. There have been a few times that I got them to acknowledge what I said, and for a couple of days it gets better, but after that they start reverting back to whatever they were doing/ saying before. I've kinda given up on trying to talk to them, simply because they don't listen/ forget, because of this I've started to become extremely passive aggressive. I don't like it, because I'm used to people understanding that I love them, but I don't like to be around them the Majority of the time. everyone at school understood that I needed alone time, or quiet time, and they'd give it to me. 

I shared a room with my extremely extroverted best friend, but he knew if I was playing Halo, or Mass Effect, that it meant that I didn't want to play interrogation, but my parents/family doesn't understand this. My question to you is how are some ways besides speaking about it, because it doesn't work with them, or results in an argument that ends with ""you live in our house, so its our rules."" or ""is it to much to ask that you do something for me?"" (which the second one is there answer for me saying something about being their house-elf) how do you get people to understand that I need alone time, and that I'm an adult who knows perfectly well what is psychologically healthy for me to do?

P.S. My mother is also going through some kind of medical stuff, and while there is nothing I can do to change that, she kind blows my head off every time she walks through the door. Which is kind of hypocritical, because when I had an Emotional Breakdown a few years ago she told me to suck it up, and get over it.

There are two friends in particular who tell me they are ""worried"" about my introvert-ness. They say I need to stop this behavior and get out and meet people.

No one here has had a grasp of HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Content Management System, etc.  I am the first person here with my level of experience and skill set.  To a degree they are still fleshing out my role here.

So what does that mean?  I sit in front of a computer and figure out ways to improve processes here.  Create mockups, wireframes, learn more details about Wordpress.  Code, plan, mockup, propose.

I think I do a fine job and so does my supervisor but guess what: The president of the company, who only sees me once a week in a group meeting, wants to fire me.  

Why?  Partly because he doesn't understand what I do (he gets irritated when people talk about technical issues).  Spending my time coding and planning means I don't have enough ""visual"" things to show him.  

The other reason he wants to fire me?  I'm not enough of a ""team player"" and I think this relates to me being introverted (and relates to the nature of my job).

My girlfriend suggested to me that it may be due to my introverted nature. I forget that this is a problem sometimes.  I feel very naive about it.  I don't have a lot of job experience.  I've either worked from home or have been in school for several years.  So this is strange to me.

A few days ago my flatmate told me he doesn't like living with me and that he's thinking of moving out.

Apparently he can't read me and I never open up. According to him, I'm always alone in my room and I never engage in a conversation. All I do is spend time by myself and I never seem to care about anyone else in the house. I'm a robot with no emotions. I reply with simple statements and take a very unemotional approach to everything. When asked how I'm doing, I answer ""I'm ok"" instead of smiling and screaming ""Oh, I'm so happy today!"". I never share when I'm excited or when I'm sad or upset. I speak in a constant tone of voice and I reply in simple words. I never tell them how my day went. I'm very direct and I never show interest. I'm indifferent to most things. I live in my head. I only stare at my computer and I don't care about anything that happens beyond my room. I'm a machine.

But maybe it's not my problem, he says. Maybe it's his problem.

Well, maybe... But maybe this is not the first time I hear this. Maybe I've heard that so many times before. Maybe I've seen so many people drift away from me because of that same thing. 

Some days I'm really confortable with the way I am. But sometimes I really fucking hate it.

(More inside),81,34,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/tn1zs/how_do_you_talk_to_girls_without_losing_your/,"As an introvert, I find it difficult to talk to girls I'm interested in. Not because I'm shy around girls, but because when I socialize with girls, I put all of my energy into being social and holding a conversation. 

My biggest letdown is when I've been talking with a girl and she isn't single/interested, and then all of my social 'energy' is wasted. Then, after I've established myself as friendly and outgoing, they expect me to be that way all the time.

So, how do you approach a girl and talk with her without wasting your energy? Do you ask her straight-up if she's single? Just looking to see what others do. 

Edit: Like you guys, I fucking hate small talk. 

**Edit 2:** 

   Some people seem to feel that I'm coming across as an alpha asshole who's only interested in fucking chicks. That's not what I meant, and I'm sorry if I came across wrong. As an introvert (and an INTJ), quaint social interactions are *not* high on my priority list. When I connect with someone, I want to really connect with them, beyond acquaintanceship. With girls, that usually means I want to try for something more than a friendship, aka a relationship of some sort. While I may not be very emotional on the outside, I readily express my emotions with people that I'm deeply connected to, like a girlfriend, close friends, or family.

   Trust me, as an INTJ introvert, all of my energy can be put towards one conversation. My interests aren't in finding a good lay. I just want advice on how to connect with strangers--in this case, girls--in a meaningful, informing, non-boring way.

TL;DR: I want to know how to talk to girls in a way that works for other introverts. I'm not trying to be a dick about this. Thanks.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,1337047510.0,,,True,t3_tn1zs,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/tn1zs/how_do_you_talk_to_girls_without_losing_your/,

To me it was a fulfillment of a dream I've had for a while, finally being free from family and able to truly have some quiet and time to myself.

But now that I've left college, I'm starting to feel the utter dearth of social interaction and the soul-crushing loneliness that comes with it -- even as a hopeless introvert, I still feel that pain.  And being an often-shy introvert, I really prefer that limited, controlled ""small group of friends"" sort of interaction; posting on Reddit or the like just isn't going to do it.

I can't really connect with the people in my office.  I don't have a car, and I don't know *anyone* near me besides coworkers.  Social events have always made me extremely uncomfortable, and I don't drink.  I'm not really interested in looking for a boyfriend right now.  I've let myself largely lose the few connections I still had to college, as my former friends grew distant and diaspora'd to their various post-college careers.

College really spoiled me for easy, comfortable interaction with other introverted nerds and I don't know how to get along without it.

I've tried online, but it's surprisingly difficult.  I'm not into social networking.  I can enjoy online games, but the communities for most of them are mind-numbingly immature and often make me feel uncomfortable -- and at least half of the reason I'd *play* a multiplayer game is the community.  I've hung with fandom communities and found a couple amazing people there, but it's like diamonds in the rough, and the rough is full of weird and creepy people.  I've gone and tried some open source contribution -- which was an interesting challenge, and full of smart people, but it's all work-focused -- not a place to make friends.  I've done some online tabletop gaming and roleplay -- something I did in-person in college -- but it almost never turns out well and I'm honestly pretty terrible at it.

I can't be the only one like this.  For the introverted, nerdy, post-college women out there, where should I try going next?  After college, where am I supposed to find friends?  Is this something everyone else knows but me?

The program splits off into four different categories depending on what you really want to study, so there are about 60 students in my stream and we all have pretty much the same classes together.

Last semester we were in a computer lab and I would always sit in the same spot, every class, and people would just sit around me (the room had two levels, so most people sat at the top row, while me and a few others sat in the bottom row)

Once this semester started, we had the same classroom with pretty much the same people, so I sat in my normal space.  There was this small group of people who sat in the same place as well, which was just above where I sat.  I talked to them a little bit, but just really only about sports (i.e. did you catch the game last night.  Yeah it was pretty brutal).

There was also a girl who sat with them, I met her once but never actually talked to her.  On the first day back, she said ""aha we are pretty much all sitting in the same spot as last semester... even that guy"" *points to me*

I just sat there until one of the guys said ""...That's Leafer91.""

She then said ""Oh sorry, it's just that you never talk to *us* so I don't really know you.""

I just felt weird when she said ""us"" as if I have to talk to them first.  She never once talked to me before, so why do I have to initiate conversation if I don't have anything relevant to say?

I guess I don't talk to her because I really don't want to.  All she talks about are all the parties she has gone to.  What am I supposed to say to that?

This has been 'bothering' me for a bit, and I just needed to get it off my chest.

Just like the title says, I was wondering what other introverts in this subreddit have done to find a partner / SO.

Most people that I know do the most common thing: go to parties / clubs and try to meet other people there. But I just can't stand being at these places for a long time. They are just too loud and crowded and are only enjoyable if getting drunk (and I really don't like drinking). Plus as an introvert myself, it's not that easy to meet people; I somehow feel that most people that I get to know are boring (especially if they are extroverted). I'm pretty sure most of you can relate to this feeling.

So my question would be: as an introvert, what's the best thing to do to find a partner?

I fall into the ""gifted"" category as well, which I've heard is where most introverts fall into. But I'm one of those people who's not just introverted, I'm a bit shy as well. My friends tend to take it offensively, and so do my in-laws. I get tired, and sometimes angry being in social situations. It frustrates me to no end. And I've found few people who understand that about me. Like I said, my husband is quite extroverted, and I've come to somewhat enjoy being on different schedules because I get my relax time. It's time when I don't feel the need to talk, and can relax and wander around in my own thoughts. I've been reading through this subreddit for a bit now, and I'm just so happy to find some people that relate and understand. 

A friend of mine was constantly inviting me over to her place before I moved away, and I would go because I didn't want her to feel like I disliked her. I just like to be alone, and my best friends are those who don't expect there to be noise or conversation all the time. Those people whom I can sit in the same room with and have my ""recharge"" time.

(feel like I needed to start with that) I talk with my mom on the phone once or twice a week and normally need about an hour after each session to recharge. I absolutely HATE content-free talk. It just sounds so stupid and mindless to me. My mom is the opposite, she is the queen of chatter. Last night we were talking and she talked for 20 minutes straight with me going ""uh huh, right, I see"". 
Now, she is coming out for 3 days and staying at my place. I normally can't go more than about 3 or 4 hours with someone before I need to retreat to my place and recharge. She knows that I need alone time, but doesn't understand how much I need, or even how much quiet time I need. I love her and don't want to hurt her feelings, but she believes that conversation needs to keep continually going, and in the past has gotten mad at me for being too quiet!

Is there any way that I can politely say that when she mindlessley blathers it sucks the energy out of me? (It can be really easy to offend her - she is better now but has the potential to go into crazy screaming woman mode)
Thank you!


Edit: Thank everyone for their responses! I read them all and now feel more confident going into this. For all the people telling me to ""suck it up"" I do understand where you are coming from. She is my mom and I love her very much. However, I have a long history of emotional abuse from her and the last time she stayed at my house she went ""crazy lady yelling"" at me for not talking enough at dinner - This episode left me physically ill (I also have clinical anxiety and depression) and basically my doctor telling me that I should not talk to my mom for a year. It has gotten much better since then, my mom and I have a much better relationship now, with both her and I pretty much learning who I am at the same time. I am at a point with my mental health now where I can concentrate on myself, not just my Depression and Anxiety, which was taking over about 90% of my cognitive functions. She wants to understand my needs, it's just the issue of explaining them to her in a way that will not hurt her feelings/lose it on me.

I see them speaking their hearts out; not stopping once. Their tenacious tongues spitting out every single word in their lexicon. I used to believe I had some sort of mental disability -- an in-activeness of mind. I'm not the one with the most witty remarks or enough material to keep the conversation going on; they notice my disinterest and move on, in search of someone else to bicker with. And I'm generally glad for it; I have no interest whatsoever. But during past few days, it's taken a toll on my mind.

I have concluded that you cannot push through high-school/college without being judged in some way. Being an introvert makes it even worse, or at least in my case. I have been regarded as anti-social, shy, weird, and intimidating. I'm the one with a book in hand during breaks or chatting with my group of three close friends. In class, if I have a question, I will approach the person seated beside me, because I don't like the attention I didn't ask for when I put my hand up. In case they don't know, I'm left with no choice.

Why do extroverts feel the need to ""fix"" introverts? My father has been very persistent about me going into therapy. I have stopped explaining that I embrace my introversion and would very much like to be at peace with it, if he would let me. On family gatherings, I'm forced by my family to speak out. I'd rather listen to what people have to say and chime in if I feel like it. I have also been called ""rude,"" because my replies are usually short.

",45,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/11tfaj/i_know_this_isnt_specific_to_introverts_but_i/,"I originally posted this in response to another thread in /r/psychology.

I have struggled with this literally all my life. I talk fast. I mumble. And no matter how many times I've tried to work on it, I never get anywhere. Everyone still goes ""what?!"" after a lot of things I say. 

Someone gave me some advice a few weeks ago: think about every individual word as you are saying it. It seemed silly and simple but it seemed to do the trick immediately. 

Instead of saying sentences in...well...sentences..say them word by word. 

Example: Instead of saying ""Hi, my name is bob."" say ""Hi. My. Name. Is. Bob."" 

Reading this, you will probably think ""ha, thats funny. I don't want to talk like a robot."" But try it. It might sound like you are talking like a robot to you, but it will come off much more natural if you tend to talk fast. The more you do it, the more natural it will seem.

For me, this did two things. First, it forced me to slow down. Because my words weren't so rushed, they were easier to understand. And because I was taking more time to say *each* word, it gave me a better chance to enunciate each one. 

An unexpected result was that my ""ums"" and ""ahs"" and ""likes"" decreased and my vocabulary increased. I found that I was often talking way faster than my brain was actually processing sentences. This lead to me not really getting my point out clearly and coherently but rather in a jumble. When I was trying to say something but I wouldn't give myself enough time to think of the word I wanted to use,  I would just rush and go ""um"" and use a simpler word instead. I realized sometimes I would get anxious to get all of my thoughts out as if there was a timer. When I started to pause and realize its ok to take a second (and honestly, pauses can help conversations) my brain would catch up and that better, more accurate, more intelligent words would come out allowing me to get my point across much better. Those pauses would also allow me to think about what I was saying first, instead of thinking *as* I was talking so what I was saying was actually more thought out.

And ALL of this almost immediately lead to a huge boost in confidence for me because its been something Ive been struggling with forever. Nearly the next day, I found the confidence to talk to this girl on the train I've been seeing for weeks. 

It's to the point now where I'm excited to talk to people just so I can try out my new voice. It's like getting a new toy. 

TLDR: slow down and think about each word individually as you speak it and you will get tons of chicks.

Anyways, I am an introvert, and I am looking to vent (honestly, I'm probably looking for some sort of recognition. Why else would I post my thoughts?). 

I have been losing all of my friends, but I have also been losing any sort of desire to have friends. This worries me. Recently, I have found more comfort in keeping to myself than talking to anybody. One of my better friends is my roommate, and I haven't said more than five words to him in the past two weeks. No exaggeration.

I do venture out into society, and I do have a few minor acquaintances with whom I enjoy being around; however, I feel like to have to emphasize the minor aspect. I have no obligations with these people, and I am only around them for brief periods of time. This suits my present lifestyle choice. 

Now, to the problem: I like to be alone, but when I'm alone, I tend to think about being with someone. To be more specific, I fantasize about having a significant other with whom I can share myself with. Chalk it up to high expectations, thus having a disappointing adolescence, but that's all that I've ever really wanted. 

Since I have somehow convinced myself that I am better off having no close interactions with anybody, this makes it extremely difficult to find any sort of connection, let alone a romantic one. 

This has been quite the mouthful, and honestly, I hate that I have gotten to the point where I have to tell my secrets to the internet. I knew that it was going to happen though. This has gotten to be too much for me to handle. I probably should give a reason for posting this, so here goes: I can't say that I'm looking for advice (although, I wouldn't object if somebody were to give some), and I can't say that I am looking for any sympathy (even though i find that forums are the number one hotspot for such things). All I can say is that I needed to say what was on my mind, and this seemed like the safest place for me.

I remember being like this since before my teens; I'd get very attached to one person at a time - whether it was an aunt who stayed with us for a few days, a best friend at school, my younger sibling, and eventually (once the hormones kicked in) a person I was romantically/sexually interested in. I've always been quiet, shy and preferring to live in my own world and never really fitted in whichever society I was thrown into. 

As I grew older, I realised I was quite introverted and felt less ashamed of my preferences to be alone and away from people for most of the time and felt content with educating and entertaining myself. Nevertheless one thing that has not changed, is the strange attachment I develop when I come across someone I like, romantically.

It starts with a common ground, which turns into friendship and quickly sees me building feelings for them, and a desire to have their attention. It seems that it has narrowed down to only romantic interests now - I don't get attached to friends or even my family any more. For some reason however, when I become interested in a potential partner, I can't seem to shake it off and I get annoyingly attached to them despite wanting to be alone otherwise. It's like they always have that exception; that 'undeserved advantage' over the other people in my life who probably want to see me more often. (I say 'undeserved' because I have had a few failed relationships after which I've realised it may be best *not* to show how much I like them; my family and friends deserve my attention more).

Even after wearing my heart on my sleeve, being hurt a couple of times, and becoming increasingly comfortable with being a loner, I still know that I yearn for a close, affectionate relationship with a partner. I feel myself getting strangely attached to them, even though I'm mature enough to be able to read signals telling me it won't work - but I don't usually feel the need to be around friends or people in general. It's almost as if other relationships are 'unsatisfying'. While this can be a good thing (I read that many introverts don't have thousands of friends, but have very strong relationships with the few close to them), I fear that I get uncontrollably attached to every potential partner. I may not show it any more, but I certainly feel it and it's often unpleasant.

**TL;DR Always been introverted but get unusually attached to the few who are close to me. Now that I'm a bit older I find that it is particularly with romantic interests/partners, even though I don't ""need"" friends or company in general and usually prefer to be alone. Anyone else feel this way?**

Eyes.
Gentleness.
It's all about the first impression, you know? And I've always appreciated the art of first impressions, although its known to lean on the fake side these days. I just appreciate the attempt, get me?

I just took the opportunity.

In everyday life, you see and even experience the wear and tear of relationships. Any of them. After a few years, a relationship obviously doesn't feel the same it did when it started, butterflies and all.
Same goes for friendships. People tend to make more of an effort to be  at their best and in check at the start, when you don't know anything about them and they don't have anything to lose.
But then they have secrets. They have things to lose and imperfections and flaws that you clearly don't see clearly at the start.

That's always been my problem with relationships, always: the inability to see anyone the same for longer than a few months.
I just drop them, these people who after a while develop a strong emotional bond with me and then I hurt people I don't mean to.

Strangers don't expect anything out of you because everyone primitively care about themselves. So why should you care what the guy sitting across from you on the bus is going to think about you for those ten minutes you're next to him?

I only learned within the past year (on a DAE reddit post) that some people's thoughts actually use language. Until then, I had always assumed that voiceovers for thoughts in books and movies were just a kind of conceit.

It seemed pretty split in the thread: that about half the people thought in words, and others (like myself) just sort of free associate with images, feelings, connections, memories, maybe some phrases.

Times when I might think using language are if I'm trying to parse something very logical out, like if I'm coding or doing math; or if I'm *preparing* to speak and trying to figure out what I'm saying.

Which brings me to the point: I know that part of the reason social interaction is exhausting for me is that I have to parse my thoughts into language. It's like adding an extra step, compared to people who think their thoughts using language, anyway.

An example:

I know that if my bosses asks me ""What do you think about this design?"" if I were to simply put voice to my thoughts it would go something like:

""Bad. Ugly. Smooshed. Can better. Not liking. Trim. That there that there that there.""

But in order to not sound like a potato-head, I have to gather my thoughts and parse them into something like: ""This could be better if we expanded the cropping and nudged it up to the top."" What a mouthful!

I'm an INFP. I can see this as maybe being an Introvert trait (it makes social interaction draining); or possibly a Intuiting trait (I think about connections rather than concrete objects); or even a Feeling trait (my initial reaction is often a sense of who I feel about something rather than a logical thought). It could even be a Perceiving trait because it's not as orderly as a Judging trait, but I've never been too clear on the J/P thing.

**tl;dr I don't thinking in language and have to parse my thoughts before speaking. I find this exhausting. Anyone else?**

-----------------

Edit - Thanks for the positive responses. I'm glad a lot of people agree this is a good idea.

I'll mail everyone and set up an invite to some sort of private group within 24 hours. Anyone else who is interested feel free to PM me. I'm realistic that the 80/20 rules applies here. Out of everyone who has indicated an interest only 20% will really follow through... but that's fine. I really think we can work as a group and build something amazing here. Many other people do it, why not us?

-----------------

So I've been having ideas again, uh oh.
 
I'm an introvert. I recently quit my job. I currently plan to take a year out. My goal is to read a lot, go to the gym a lot, relax a lot... and try to build up an independent income that will mean never going back to 9-5 work.

As an introvert I struggle with normal office life. It makes me miserable. The emails, the phone calls, the meetings, the small talk, the expectations.

I want out and I am taking this year to go at that hell for leather. I may fail but at least I've gone down fighting.

My plan is to try and make an income online. Other people can do it, so why the hell not me. I'm currently creating websites, writing articles, trying to generate interest in a lot of the different business ideas I have.

So I guess this must be a common dream for introverts and I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone would like to form a group of people striving for the same goal.

We'd set up some kind of private forum and then we'd chat about where we are at, exchange advice, help each other out, co-operate on projects.

So if you are running online businesses or want to then you join the collective and we help. Even if you know nothing about online business then if you have the english language skills to type a post on reddit you have value to add.

Things I could see the collective doing -

- giving advice on business ideas
- giving technical advice - best wordpress theme, good affiliate programs
- swapping links and guest posts on each others blogs and sites
- comment on each others articles
- helping seed each others forums when they start out
- help and encouragement in a private community
- outsource paid work to each other (article writing, etc)

So, I appreciate this will be hard to start up. It's the kind of thing where people will show an interest then drop out... but hopefully we can build something.

I know that a lot of introverts struggle with many office jobs and I believe there is a better way. 

PM if you are interested and I'll set something up.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,True,,,True,t3_rj5ek,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/rj5ek/anyone_interested_in_an_introvert_business/,

Just about every single classic sign of the introvert reminded her of me. 

This was a godsend. Our relationship has been strained in the past because of her inability to understand why conversation and social events are such a chore for me and my failure articulate why it is so difficult. She now understand where I am coming from and I her seeing as she is very much the extrovert. Instead of feeling bad for requesting some time alone, I now feel like it won't be interpreted in a mean-spirited fashion.

Reading some of the other posts, I don't feel alone any more knowing that others endure the same feelings and situations. Thank you.

So we meet up at the library, it starts with an awkward handshake and we immediately get down to school business. She starts laughing at my awkwardness at some points and things start to go more smoothly after the tension is broken.

After school stuff I walk her to the bus stop, I let her know I'm going to go help a charity group on campus for a bit before I go home and say goodbye. She stops me and says she wants to go with me. Long story short we go there, make a ton of progress for the group and then walk back to the bus station. She moves in for the awkward goodbye handshake, I open my arms and say ""how about a hug?"", she smiles and hugs me instead. I say goodbye, she stops me and says ""let me know when you're around tomorrow"" and that she enjoyed the day.

This all sounds like it went well. But personally I was struggling like crazy during our interactions. I had to plan out carefully everything I said to her in my head. When she was staring me down at some points I got lost in her and forgot what I was saying.

His strict observance of this tenet of good behavior was the reason, no doubt, for his being given the false characterization by the white man of being a stoic. He has been judged to be dumb, stupid, indifferent, and unfeeling.""

I was told in the beginning that everyone was really social and liked to hang out in the common room.  I don't mind sometimes, but I also really like time in my room, but I wanted a comfortable living situation.  So I was downstairs pretty much all the time.

And guess what?  No one was ever home, and they were rarely downstairs.  I had plenty of free time, but they were never around.  They wanted a roommate to hang out with (supposedly), but they were never there, and they never invited me anywhere either.  I was new to the area (3000 miles from home) so I didn't have friends yet.  That's fine, really, but what really bothered me was that they made it clear the type of roommate they wanted, and then they were the ones that didn't follow through.

A little while in, and they decide to let a friend stay for a couple days, which turns into him *plus* his 2 brothers, and a week turns into 2, which turns into a month, which turns into almost 3.  They were living in our living room.  So, I kept to myself in my room.  I went from actually trying to be social to not being able to handle the living situation.  I explained my introversion, but none of them really understood.

Eventually, the 3 brothers move out, but we get a new guy.  Super extrovert, and looks down a bit on introverts.  He made a couple offhand comments that kind of pissed me off, but whatever, I let it go.

Then my one roommate was just showing a friend around the house, and she talks about how everyone is so social, except pyrobyro, who just keeps to himself in his room and doesn't come out with them, and says that it's weird.  I've barely had a living room that wasn't being used as a bedroom for the time that I've been here, and I'm seriously never invited out anymore, even though the couple times that I did go out with them, we all had a blast, and everyone loved me.  Okay fine, they did recently when they were going out for drinks, but she asked by saying, ""You can come out with us if you want to...but you just got off work, I bet you don't want to.""  Why even bother asking?  Why do people have to look down on others like that?  I'm not bothering anyone, and I'm very easy to get along with.

I teach English to French kids (ages 12-15), and I'd really love your advice to help my introverted students.

For those who are not familiar with the French system, a lot of emphasis is put on grades (we do 0-20 instead of A-E), and in languages we have to grade their written work (reading and writing) and their oral work (listening and speaking).

I have lots of great kids who do really well with reading, writing and listening, but who will not speak at all, whatever the oral activity and participation in class is inexistant. We also are encouraged to grade participation, and I must admit it does help the kids who are a bit shy but just need that kick in the ass to raise their hand.

Anyhow, I'm rambling a bit now, but I was wondering if you guys would have any ideas so that they're not penalised so much for just being introverts.

I have spent a few months now dating an introverted man, and his introverted nature was something he told me about early on and I was perfectly happy and prepared to deal with. But he's told me other things too, and his behavior doesn't seem quite as... healthy as other introverts. Can you guys tell me if this is normal?

He told me he often goes through severe bouts of depression, but hides them very well - he just withdraws from everyone and ""goes through the motions"" but a couple years ago he attempted suicide and failed. 

He seems to have a lot of self-worth issues. Instead of wanting to stay in frequently because he doesn't have the energy for people, he'll frequently insist that his friends don't like him (even though he's clearly the most adored in his group) so he thinks he shouldn't bother them. He keeps telling me that he's afraid of me getting to know him too well because he thinks I'd find him stupid or boring, and leave, no matter how many times I tell him otherwise.

We don't communicate well. When I try to be straightforward and ask for his opinions, he'll look surprised and say, ""Does it matter? I don't know, it's not really important."" He initially told me he really likes to debate, but when we do debate things, even just for fun, he quickly reaches a point where all he'll say is ""I understand what you're saying"" over and over again. 

I'm worried that he may not be as introverted as he thinks, because he does crave more friends and more activity, but that his withdrawal is a symptom of depression. And, I mean, I don't mean to call him out on it, but... he seems to cry a lot. It makes me really sad and worried. I love him so much. 

Can you help me? How much of this within the normal quirks of introversion, and how much is other issues? I don't know where to consider something a ""problem"" and where to respect the difference.

I assign personality traits to all of my friends and to all people I meet.

There is only one person I have not been able to really succeed at doing this with, and it fascinates me to no end.

I feel that a lot of people here are confusing true (oftentimes outright unhealthy) antisocial tendencies with just being introverted... and the discovery of the concept of introversion gives them a shield they can use to chalk up all of their ""problems"" to it, instead of looking for real solutions.

Example... if you don't like being in huge crowds, or you just need some time to recharge every day or a few times a week, sometimes you just don't feel like going out, etc. then you're probably just introverted.

But if you never leave the house because you'd rather play video games or watch TV all day because you have no friends, or have no other hobbies, or have no motivation, etc. then you probably have deeper problems that *could* be solved and shouldn't be put under the guise of introversion.

Of course some people can be more introverted than others, and may get a little more anxiety in some situations that others don't.  That's not the issue.  It's things that, to me at least, seem to be **clear** asocial tendencies that shouldn't really fall under the introversion umbrella.

25% are introverts

**Extraversion** is ""the act, state, or habit of being predominantly concerned with and obtaining gratification from what is outside the self"".[3] Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.

**Introversion** is ""the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life"".[3] Introverts tend to be more reserved and less outspoken in large groups. They often take pleasure in solitary activities such as reading, writing, drawing, and using computers. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, engineer, composer, and inventor are all highly introverted. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though they tend to enjoy interactions with close friends. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate[4]. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement. They are more analytical before speaking[5].

Introversion is not the same as shyness or the social outcast. Introverts choose solitary over social activities by preference, whereas shy people avoid social encounters out of fear[6] and whereas the social outcast faces solitude, but not by choice.

Introverts process their emotions, thoughts, and observations internally. They can be social people, but reveal less about themselves than extroverts do. Introverts are more private, and less public. Introverts need time to think before responding to a situation, and develop their ideas by reflecting privately. 
When introverts want to be alone, it is not, by itself, a sign of depression. It means that they either need to regain their energy from being around people or that they simply want the time to be with their own thoughts. Being with people, even people they like and are comfortable with, can prevent them from their desire to be quietly introspective.

Introverts can focus their attention more readily and for longer periods of time than extroverts, and they aren't easily swayed by other people's opinions. Introverts may not know they're introverted, and sometimes feel weird, different, or awkward. 

**Where Extroverts Get Their Energy**

EXTROverts get their energy when they go out and do social activities. It recharges them.

**Where Introverts Get Their Energy:**
Introverts tend to get their energy from within, so being with people is draining. After a day filled with people or activities, introverts tend to feel exhausted and empty. To recharge their batteries introverts need to be alone reading, daydreaming, painting, or gardening – any solo activity fills them up again. This doesn't mean introverts have to live alone in a cave in the hills or on Walden Pond; they just need quiet time to come back to themselves. The energy source for introverts is from within.
