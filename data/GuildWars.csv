1332303512.0,193,self.GuildWars,r6ab5,A Guide for the Newest of Us,249,56,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/r6ab5/a_guide_for_the_newest_of_us/,"Okay, so, there are a good amount of guides out there, covering the [differences between old and new](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgw/comments/hvrhu/a_newreturning_players_guide_to_guild_wars/), [how to get some quick and easy cash/faction](http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/ql04k/free_zkeys/) and [a quick(smart!) way to 30/50 HoM Points](http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/iu3qw/a_hom_guide_to_3050_aimed_at_beginners/), but nothing to really get you started on the latter.

So I thought I'd help out. What this guide is going to cover:

* How to properly get your Ritualist skills
* Where and how to get your 'final' gear set, in this case, Exotic
* How to get a functional hero group working as soon as possible
* How to farm Jade Quarry so you can get skills/faction ASAP
* A few links to things people haven't mentioned, and things unexplained(and an FAQ of things I was wondering while getting started)
* How do educate yourself from here on out

**Step Zero: Before you Start**

Some baseline things to help you out:

* Unlock your Xunlai Chest. Right now. No, fuck you, right now. Priority 1.

* Buy bags with your money. The only thing that gets priority over bags is skills. You'll get 2 bags, and a belt pouch. You can use a Rune of Holding on both bags to give them more slots, but get both bags before you do that.

*Always carry at least a basic Salvage Kit and Identification Kit on you. Always.

* Identify everything that can be. Often enough they'll get 'improved sale value' which is badass.

* Salvage everything that is a salvage item, or has the ""Extra Salvageable"" identier-thing on it, and stash the supplies in your Xunlai Chest's crafting mats area.

* Sell everything else, except the following: Destroyer Cores, Superb Charr Carvings. They both sell amazingly.

* ALWAYS USE THE WIKI ON MISSIONS. EVERY TIME. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION, CHECK THE WIKI. EVERY TIME.

**Step One: Building your first bar, and Henchmen Priorities**

Okay, so you've made a Ritualist. You've seen [this](http://pvx.wikia.com/wiki/Build:Rt/any_Spirit_Spammer) bar that Blackness pointed out for you, and you weren't entirely sure how to go about getting everything.

First, you need to understand that Unlocking Skills on your account is different than acquiring them on a character. For example, if I was to make an Elementalist right now, I'd be pretty horrible(well, as horrible as one would be at the beginning). But anytime I get an Elementalist Hero, or if I was to make a PvP-only Elementalist? I'd be able to roflstomp things pretty hard. That's because I've unlocked those skills.

However, acquiring skills on your Ritualist is going to take some more work. First off, you won't have access to the skills you need at the start- that's to be expected. So what are some good builds to go along with, while you get the others required?

You should be able to relatively 'start' with these abilities, either by default, through a quick quest, or by buying them from skill trainers:

[*Pain*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Pain): Generic damage spirit. You'll always want this.

[*Bloodsong*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bloodsong): Damage/lifesteal spirit. You'll always want this.

[*Painful Bond*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Painful_Bond): Thing to make your spirits do more damage. You'll always want this, but you'll use it only on big targets, or because you're bored.

[*Boon of Creation*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Boon_of_creation): You'll want this until you get to Eye of the North proper and start making yourself into the State of the Heroes build.

[*Shadowsong*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shadowsong): You'll want this about as long as you want Boon of Creation, maybe even less long, but still good.

So those are your long term, basic 5 that are even in the build he suggests. Awesome! Now, for 3 that are meant to tide you over while you get the rest. Note that these 3 are in descending order of how long you'll want them: First is best, last you'll get rid of first.

[*Spirit Boon Strike*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Spirit_Boon_Strike): Holy potatoes, a way to do consistent damage AND heal your spirits? Awesome! Super useful, I hated giving it up, hell, I was tempted to replace Shadowsong with it(don't do that).

[*Splinter Weapon*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Splinter_Weapon): Cool ability your heroes will be using quite a bit of later on. Great for packs, just remember, it's AOE-moments only!

[*Mighty Was Vorizun*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mighty_Was_Vorizun): Despite being named after a misspelled phone company, a great survivability thing to help on early levels. Splinter Weapon is more overall useful, but if you find yourself in not enough situations to use it, switch it out with this.

Okay! Those should last you while you get everything you need to get.  With all of these, you should be able to get all the way through the Shing Jea Island missions. Grats!

For the record, I'll explain later in the next step about those 3 skills on the build that you can't get yet.

---
**Step Two: Once You're on the Mainland**

Suddenly, the game properly opens up. You should quickly be in [The Marketplace](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Marketplace). Your first priority, is to get to [Kaineng Center](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kaineng_Center). Read that link for it to help you out on *how*. Once you're there, you have a few priorities.

1. Get M.O.X. outside. Go out the Bukdek Byway exit, talk to the big robot, take his book and put it away in your bank. Apparently there are quests in there or something, idunno. Yes, just get him, no he won't be in your final group, however he's a badass buddy to have for beforehand and arguably one of the most blatantly useful heroes.

2. Get the quests for [Nightfall](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Sunspears_in_Cantha) and [Eye of the North](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/I_Feel_the_Earth_Move_Under_Cantha%27s_Feet).

3. Check Michiko there for skills in Kaineng Center. She's near the NorthEast corner of the map.

Now, to update you on what you've probably wondered about up to this point. Those other 3 skills I told you I'd talk about later.

[*Agony*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Agony): Quite frankly, it's BS that more builds don't use this. One of the strongest abilities in the game by far, and goes a long way for fun if only because NUMBERS EVERYWHERE. You can get this quickly at the Eye of the North, after acquiring Gwen.

[*Summon Spirits*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Summon_Spirits): Well, shit. You can't get this till 2/3rds of the way through Factions. Once you do your ""Befriending the Luxons/Kurzicks"" quest(do both), you'll get to get this using faction. GET IT. It's one of the strongest, most useful abilities you have. Changes your quality of life instantly. It's just as amazing as it sounds.

&gt; Re: Summon Spirits...

Thanks [Nefara Molantsu](http://www.reddit.com/user/Nefara) for this suggestion!

Essentially, part of what you'll want to do to get this a bit sooner, is *after your Befriending quest*, you'll want to skip to Step Four temporarily, specifically the PvP part. Do Jade Quarry and change your Imperial Faction to whatever Kurzick/Luxon faction your guild is with(I don't know if all the Reddit guilds match here). Remember, you have a max of around 10k right now. Next, find a [Kurzick Bureaucrat](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kurzick_Bureaucrat) or a [Luxon Scavenger](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Luxon_Scavenger), and donate the points to your guild. It'll build your title up at twice the rate, getting you to Title Rank 1 sooner, so you can buy Summon Spirits.

[*Signet of Spirits*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Signet_of_spirits) The strongest ability a Ritualist ever gets. We usually don't unequip it for anything, including our mother. You can't get this before getting 2/3rds through Factions, about the same place as above. Except you have to capture it. This is done by buying a ""Signet of Capture"" skill from a skill trainer(this is consumed upon acquiring it), then hunting down [this dickhead](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Wagg_Spiritspeak), killing him, and using the capture signet by his Corpse, and selecting the ability. Note, since no one tells you this: There will be a hill you go up when you start getting closer to him, and a boss at the top. SPREAD OUT YOUR TEAM. Else you're gonna get yourself killed, and quick, from massive AOE damage.

To get them, talk to [High Priest Zhang](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/High_Priest_Zhang).  He will give you 50 [Tournament Reward Points](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tournament_Reward_Points), which can then be exchanged by [Tolkano](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tolkano) for a total of 10 Z-Keys.

You can only do this once per account, but it is a great way to get some starting gold.  You could also reduce the number of Z-Keys to 7 and purchase a [Golden Flame of Balthazar](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Golden_Flame_of_Balthazar), which rewards 3000 Balthazar Faction.  With that, and the gold you gained from selling your Z-Keys, you could purchase an [Elite Skill Tome](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tome) to quickly and easily grab that elite you need for your build.

If you plan to sell your Z-Keys, expect them to go for 5.5k-6k each.

* Heroes gain experience from quest rewards if they are in your party when you accept the reward. Before accepting a reward, add low level heroes to your party.

* Stated weapon damage assumes you  have 12 mastery in the attribute regardless of the item req. You do ~9% less damage for every point you are short. (The actual number is the 8th root of two. So, if you think you're fine because you have a req 9 weapon and have 9 in the attribute, keep in mind that your regular attacks are only doing 77.1% of the stated damage. This works in the opposite direction as well, but to a lesser extent. The bonus for exceeding 12 is only 40% as strong as the penalty for not meeting it. As such, having 14 in a weapon attribute will do 107.2% of stated damage. 16 will do 114.9%.

* An enemy would need at least 180 armor in order for a hornbow to outdamage a shortbow/flatbow. You never need a hornbow. Ever. Throw it away.

* Learn your ranges: Adjacent is considered 156 inches. Nearby is considered 240. In the Area is considered 312 inches. Earshot is considered 1,000 inches. Casting range is 1,250 inches, and spirit range is 2,500 inches.

* If you are using a PvP shield, but can't meet the requirement, use the strength shield. It's bugged to give you 9 armor instead of 8, which reduces damage by 1.7%.

* Hitting with an attack actually happens halfway through the animation. Those 1/2 second bow interrupts actually loose the arrow at 1/4 sec.

* Attack speed is important. A 25% increase in attack speed will result in a 33% increase in damage. A 33% will increase output by 49%.

1328341508.0,133,self.GuildWars,pafmz,State of The Heroes Address,177,44,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/pafmz/state_of_the_heroes_address/,"**Preface**

I come to you today with many notable revisions to the previous hero builds I have posted. They have been spurred by several things, among which are: HM armor changes, Ele Buffs, and excel spreadsheets...so many excel spreadsheets. I aim to explain why I chose to use the skills I have chosen, as well as the gear. *It looks as though I won't have time to talk about the gear tonight, so I'll add that in tomorrow.*

**Previous Versions**

The least potent of my three previous versions, Nakedway, has suffered greatly with the ele update. Though the dervs do more damage with the lower armor of foes, the damage sustained is sizeable. It is not nearly as idiot-proof as it once was, and I am removing my endorsement from it. That is not to say it is bad, just that it is not exemplary. 

My previously released Fromway is still completely viable, though you will notice some tweaks to a few of the bars I had in there with my current release.

Blackway was, by its very nature, overkill on the defensive aspect of things. I prefer a team that kills faster while retaining most of the durability. It, too is still completely viable.

[**My Current Hero Team**](http://i.imgur.com/hlR5Y.png)

The first thing you will notice about this team is it includes a bar for the player. This bar is important for the team to function correctly. I have removed the ST shelter rit from play, so more spirit density is required for the healer to function correctly. I am not a ritualist primary, and you do not need to have a ritualist primary for this to work. You must, however, not be a paragon or warrior because they have insufficient energy regeneration \*.

\* If you absolutely must use one of these two professions, substitute Air of Superiority in place of Vampirism. 

**Breaking Down The Player Bar**

Template Code: OwhiAyiMRDWN5D+NVOdNBNJXC

The most powerful Ritualist elite is SoS. Being able to summon 3 level 10 spirits (200 health and 63 armor) for free is incredibly overpowered. It is the basis of any spirit spammer bar, and must be included.

Vampirism is also a phenominal spirit (assuming max rank). It lasts for Two and a half minutes, heals you for 20 with each hit, damages many otherwise invincible foes, and is very durable (280 health and 87 armor).

Pain and Bloodsong (200 health and 63 armor each) were chosen because of their energy cost. There was no room on this bar for energy gaining skills, so we do not want to overtax ourselves.

Painful bond is on the bar if you need a burst of extra damage. It is too expensive to spam, but if you are fighting a troublesome healer or need to take things out more quickly, it is an excellent choice.

Armor of Unfeeling is necessary because, contrary to what you may think, spirits are here for tanking and not for damage. The halving of damage taken is incredibly helpful when fighting eles or dervishes. The anti-critical hit aspect is almost as important. Yes, spirits have pretty solid armor. However, they are of very low level. This means they are subject to a significantly increased chance of being hit by a critical hit. This skill negates that aspect.

Summon Spirits. What use are spirits that you can't take with you? Also: healing. You want your spirits alive. There are very few spells that heal your spirits. This is one of them. I would advise cranking up your faction title to r10+ to realize the benefit.

The last skill, pain inverter, is here because you control the location of a large number of allies via summon spirits. This enables you to intentionally bring these spirits into AoE after casting PI on the cause of said AoE. This will take out most foes in &lt;2 seconds, which is nice because AoE causing foes are good to get rid of quickly.

**Breaking Down The Monk Bar**

Template Code: OwUTAHHHYynBBMPz6TNi6zlQAA

RoJ is a fantastic elite if used on stationary foes (casters). For maximum efficiency, you will need to micro this, but I really wouldn't worry about that for the most part. If its full duration hits a foe, it will do 338 damage, ignoring armor. 

Smite Hex and Smite Condition are both there because, if you're going to take those effects off anyways, you may as well do a bunch of AoE armor ignoring damage while you're doing it. Also, Rit based healers are terribad on hex removal. This rectifies that situation.

Spear of Light has a high damage/energy ratio. As foes rarely just stand there, if the enemy is not casting, you can assume it is attacking. As such, the bonus damage is realized often.

Castigation Signet helps balance out the energy. It functions well for the same reason Spear of Light does.

Wandering Eye and Signet of Clumsiness: Because armor ignoring AoE damage is better than a spear. And, they're cheap so they don't throw off the energy balance.

Res Sig: because you might oops.

**Breaking Down The Panic Bar**

Template Code: OQNEAowj86QDmemumwFY5fXFA

I really wanted a Panic mesmer on the team because of what it can do to shut down a large mob. If you have ever seen it in action in a place like Urgoz, you know how useful and impressive it is. Having a mesmer with the attributes shown in the picture is able to keep a mob panicked 94.7% of the time. Though most of the Domination line of spells are better in PvP than PvE, I am obliged to use them due to the attribute investment.

Mistrust is an obvious choice. It prevents damage to your team by stopping a spell cast at you, and does sizable AoE damage to your enemies.

Unnatural Signet is free and is likely to be AoE considering how many hexes your team will be casting.

Chaos Storm is a beast of a skill. It's very cheap and outputs a ton of damage. The downside is that hero AI will not cast it upon an enemy that isn't wielding a caster weapon. As it turns out, many monsters do not actually wield weapons, so it goes unused. Micro it. You won't regret it.

Power Spike because 126 damage while stopping a caster is hard to beat.

Waste Not, Want Not is there for energy mgmt. Heroes use it fairly well.

Shield of Absorption was thrown into the mix because I couldn't find another Domination line skill that thrilled me, and its effect is so powerful, it certainly doesn't hurt having two copies on a team. Pre-prot with it while pulling (hero team flagged back, behind spirits) and you will see a whole bunch of zeroes hitting you. It's a good feeling.

**Breaking Down The Ineptitude Bar**

Template Code: OQNEAYwj0K9CgAmnREs8Z0EGJAA

Ineptitude is the best PvE Anti-melee skill there is. Period. Prepare to giggle at the Aatxes in UW if you're not used to having it on your bar.

Wandering Eye is cheap and has high damage. Significantly preferred to its counterpart, Clumsiness, which is an energy hog.

Signet Of Clumsiness is here because the price is right and the damage is good.

Drain enchantment assists in energy mgmt., as well as provides a means to get important enchantments off of your enemies. Some monks are tough to kill.

Waste Not, Want Not is back again for more energy mgmt.

Gift of Health is a great healing prayers skill...if it's your only one, or when the other skill(s) don't need to be cast often, which is the cast here. It's a cheap 105 heal that can be used every 7.75 seconds, and it's energy cost is already paid for by the aforementioned skills.

Dwayna's Sorrow: because you have a MM with an 11 minion capacity, and all the minions do is die. Often. Wouldn't it be nice if your whole party was healed for 35 every time that happened? I thought so.

**Breaking Down The Minion Master Bar**

Template Code: OAhjYgFsoSyBbhVBoBKgYMeTVV

The most important skill here is not AotL. It is Death Nova. Minion bombers output so much damage, it's astounding (provided there are corpses). It's like giving your enemies little exploding pinatas.

AotL is here because it can raise a metric shit-ton of minions in one go, provided there are sufficient corpses. It also gets the ball rolling by giving you a minion for free, and increases Death Nova damage by 5. Be warned, hero AI will not renew this enchantment before it expires. If you want it to gain benefit from itself, you must micro it (not imperative, but nice).

Masochism is here because having 11 minions is better than having 10 minions, and 120 damage Death Novas are more fun than 110 damage ones. The health sacrifice is not an issue. You have plenty of healing.

Bone Minions because, when you are making little bombs, quantity is more important that quality.

Putrid Bile because if you're killing a foe, it might as well help you and try to kill its neighbor in the process.

Splinter Weapon and Ancestor's Rage buff the minions and make them actually do some damage while you wait for them to pop.

SoLS because spells are expensive.

**Breaking Down The Healer Bar**

Template Code: OAhiYwh8YtFeTOp5wccWVTu

Xinrae's Weapon counters spikes, heals and does damage to your enemies. It's cheap and has a short recharge. What's not to like?

Spirit Transfer because a heal of 205 is really nice to have. It has a quick recharge and cast time. Energy is not a problem due to soul reaping, and you have 7 spirits in your team to suck health from.

Spirit Light because you don't have to worry about health sacrifice and it heals a lot.

Mend Body And Soul is a quick recharging heal with condition removal.

Protective Was ~~The Koala~~ Kaolai is a nice party-wide heal. Because it's precast, it's a really good AoE damage counter because the healer can often get it off twice in quick succession.

Life for AoE heals and another spirit for PI and Spirit Transfer.

Death Pact Signet because if you die often enough that the side effect is a problem, you need to reroll. It's better to have party members ready to go with health and energy. Also, faster cast time means there's less downtime between heals.

Now I'm sitting over 9,700 characters of the 10,000 character limit so I will have to continue with this in the comments.

I will guide you through this under the assumption you have empty halls. My goal is to get the most done for you without ""grinding."" If your goal is 30 points, do not hassle yourself with a PvP statue.

**Section 1: 10/50**

1. Play through Factions with a [[Ritualist](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ritualist)] and get the [[black moa](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Black_Moa)], [[black widow](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Black_Widow)], and the [[imperial phoenix](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Phoenix_%28pet%29)] along the way. You should use a bar similar to [[this](http://pvx.wikia.com/wiki/Build:Rt/any_Spirit_Spammer)]. 

2. Once you have beaten Factions and acquired these pets, beat EotN. In the [[Central Transfer Chamber](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Central_Transfer_Chamber)], there is a [[challenge mission](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Challenge_mission)] to do. Beat it to obtain a [[Cloth of the Brotherhood](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cloth_of_the_brotherhood)]  and put it on one of your heroes.

*Progress Note: Now you will have 5 statues under your [[Fellowship Monument](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fellowship)], and you will have 5 of 8 possible points. You will have Hero of Cantha and Protector of Cantha in your [Honor Monument] from doing Factions along the way. Your HoM will be at 10/50. A complete beginner who stays on task can expect section 1 to take 25 hours. Someone enlisting the help of a veteran player can expect 15 hours.*

**Section 2: 14/50**

4. Now it is time to beat the other two campaigns, Prophecies and Nightfall. Doing so will contribute 4 more statues to your Honor monument. You will now have 6 statues in the display, which is enough for 3 more points.

5. Now that you have beat the games, you should be relatively comfortable with how to do things. As such, it's time to challenge yourself. Beat them all (except EotN) in [[Hard Mode](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hard_mode)] now. This will have gotten you 4 more statues for your HoM, bringing your total up to 10 and earning you another point.

*Progress note: Now, you will have beaten the games. Congratulations. You're well on your way to getting a satisfactory HoM. Having beaten these, you should have at least 150k left over from loot you've collected and sold. It's time to put that money to use. Someone who was a beginner at the beginning of this guide can expect section 2 to take 75 hours. Someone enlisting the help of a veteran player can expect 50 hours.*

**Section 3: 19/50**

1. Head to [[Kamadan](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kamadan)]. Buy a [[Black Moa Chick](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mini_Moa)]. One can be had for under 60k.

2. Pick either a mini [[Lich](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mini_Lich)]/[[Rurik](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Miniature_Prince_Rurik)]/[[Pig](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Miniature_Pig)]/[[Celestial Rabbit](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Miniature_Celestial_Rabbit)], and buy it. One can be had for under 40k.

3. Now, buy the 18 cheapest minis you can find. 

Fungal Wallow, Hydra, Jade Armor, Jungle Troll, Necrid Horseman, Siege Turtle, Temple Guardian, and Whiptail Devourer are all 1st year common minis and can be had for &lt;2k each.

Aatxe, Fire Imp, Heket Warrior, Juggernaut, Mandragor Imp, Harpy Ranger, Thorn Wolf, and Wind Rider are all 2nd year common minis and can be had for &lt;5k each.

Abyssal, Cave Spider, Cloudtouched Simian, Forest Minotaur, Irukandji, Mursaat, Raptor, and Roaring Ether are all 3rd year common minis and can be had for &lt;10k each.

*Progress note: You will now have 5 points in your [[Devotion](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22Devotion%22)] monument, bringing your total points to 19. Time taken will depend on market availability. Purchases done during peak market times can be made in under an hour.*

**Section 4: Accumulate Money**

Now, you need money. ""What's a good way to earn money?"" you may ask. [[DoA](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Doa)] is a good way to earn money. It's time to put that ritualist to use. [[Frostway](http://pvx.wikia.com/wiki/Build:Team_-_DoA_Frostway)] is a team composition designed to get through DoA in &lt;1:30 in Hard Mode. One run will net you over 50k, and the 1st one will even put another statue in your Honor monument. Do 13 runs. That's &lt;20 hours invested, and you should now have over 650k.

**Section 5: Buy all the things!**
1. You will need to buy 1 oppressor weapon, 3 destroyer weapon, and 1 torment weapon. You should be able to obtain all 5 for around 320k. These will bring your [[Valor](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Valor)] monument up to 5, bringing your total points to 24, and leaving you with over 300k to buy more things.

2. Buy 5 more Cloths of the Brotherhood for 5-6k each and put them on heroes. Now, you still have almost 300k, and 25 points in your HoM.

3. Time to buy some armor. Remember, you do not need the head piece to put an armor set in your HoM. You can buy [[Elite Luxon](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ritualist_Elite_Luxon_armor)] armor for &lt;110k. Jade sells for less than amber, usually, so this is your best option. Craft yourself a set of [[Ancient armor](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ritualist_Ancient_armor)] for &lt;50k. Craft yourself a set of [[Norn Armor*](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ritualist_Norn_armor)] for 50k. 

*20k of the 26k points you need in your Norn title are obtained by turning in the [[Hero's Handbook](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hero%27s_Handbook)] you completed when you did EotN. 3k of the points came from completing 3 of those quests. The remaining 3k should have been completed with bounties during your ventures.

*Progress note: Now, you will have about 100k left and 28/50 in your HoM. Buying the rest of this stuff will take less than an hour in an active market.* 

**Section 6: 30/50**

Now, fill up the rest of your Fellowship monument. You can buy most armor pieces for ~5k. You need 20. You have 100k. It's almost like magic. Congratulations! You just got 30/50 in your HoM in under a week of playtime with no prior experience!",,False,self,t5_2quyl,1337328885.0,,Assassin,True,t3_iu3qw,http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/iu3qw/a_hom_guide_to_3050_aimed_at_beginners/,

Don't have time to farm? Don't feel like it? Well, how in the heck are you supposed to get any money in this game?

Consumables!

More specifically, [BUs](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/BU). Why BUs? They are the most essential consumable to every speed clear so demand is higher and sales are easier.

**What do you need** to make a BU?

* 250g
* 50 feathers
* 50 dust
* 1 skill point

**Where do you acquire these things?** 

Kamadan. 

**Why not farm the materials yourself?**

The only reason you're still reading is you didn't want to farm. Settle down.

**What do the required materials cost?**

* stack of feathers = 9-10k

* stack of dust = ~4k

*After Canthan New Year is over. Dust prices are going to be exceptionally high until the conclusion of this event.* 

So, a stack of each material will craft you 5 BUs. This works out to be a cost of ~2.9k per BU.

**How do I make the money, damnit?**

The beautiful part about BU's is [they sell for 3.5-4k each](http://argos-soft.net/GwEstimator/index.php?search=BU). They cost you ~2.9k to make. That means you are netting 600-1100g per skill point that you have.

**Ahh, there's the catch. I knew there'd be one. Blackness, you son of a bitch, I don't have that many skill points!**

Easily fixable.

[This is a map of the Gate of Madness mission, at the end of Nightfall.](http://i.imgur.com/IV77U.jpg)

If you have done this mission before, you will be familiar with the portals that spawn monsters outside the last room with Shiro and the Lich. If not, they are the purple circles on the lower right part of the map. 

**I sense you laying out a plan. What is it?**

You are going to leave the first portal you come across alive, but destroy the other four (Yes, this involves doing most of the mission. Yes, this takes 10-15 mins.) Then, you are going to stand on the little black mound against the wall, just downhill from the portal. [I put a green dot on the map for you!](http://i.imgur.com/UrSyJ.jpg)

That way, whenever that portal spawns, the monsters run down to you, but you are far enough back that you will not kill the portal. Then, you afk. Your heroes kill the monsters, and you can do other, more important real life things. Because you're standing there, you get exp. More exp means more skill points. More skill points mean more BUs. More BUs mean more money.

**How much money?**

Well, the spawns happen every 30 seconds, like clockwork. Two Titan Abominations spawn, which when killed spawn Pain Titans. Those spawn two Madness Titans each when killed. All of these monsters are level 28 in NM (30 in HM). Let's say you have shitty heroes and can't do HM. That results in your team killing 16 level 28s every minute. Level 28's yield 	232 exp when killed, divided by the number of team members (in this case, probably 8). That's 464 exp per minute. Or, 27,840 exp per hour.

**But wait, there's more!**

Pop a [Scroll of Berserker's Insight](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Scroll_of_Berserker%27s_Insight) for triple the exp! It will never run out because the spawns are every 30 seconds. Now, you're earning 83,520 exp per hour, and you aren't doing a thing.

**Get to the platinum talk already!**

That much exp translates to 5.568 skill points per hour. Remember, those were the limiting factor on BU creation. So, assuming a profit (very conservative estimate) of 540g per skill point, you're earning 3k per hour.

*That's terrible!*

But you aren't actually doing anything, and you don't have to be at your computer. And, it's not botting. It's making money legitimately while afk.

**What's that going to buy me?**

Let's pretend you play Guild Wars 7 hours per day (you probably don't). That means there's 17 hours per day you don't play Guild Wars. That translates into 50k/day of afk money. That's 350k/week, or 1.5 million gold per month--even more if you play less!

**Now, my children, go forth and fill up your Halls of Monuments!**

**Edit:** Side note to those of you wondering how to optimize this.

Hard Mode will net you 32.76% more experience.

Otherwise, consider using a non-full party. 5 decent heroes can keep up NM. 4 Good ones can. 3 Fully optimized ones can.",,False,self,t5_2quyl,True,,Assassin,True,t3_omiuy,http://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/omiuy/so_you_want_to_become_wealthy_in_guild_wars_i_can/,

I'm following-up on this [post](http://redd.it/y9j40), regarding a celebration of the end of the original Guild Wars era. An event was mentioned in the past, but no one has attempted to organise it, so I will try to fill in the gap. (If anyone else prefers to do this instead, I would gladly yield.)

The celebration is for players to gather, exchange stories, show off prized items, give away surplus items for HoM-seekers, etc... At this point, it seems to me that it will be open-ended, and we can further organise if needed.

I'd like to suggest that the event begin at 18:00 (6:00PM) Pacific Standard Time on August 24, six hours before the headstart of Guild Wars 2. (Keep in mind that ArenaNet has announced that the servers may open a few hours early to accommodate the spike of people.) I'm hoping that this gives people enough time to come in and lounge around until the servers open. If this isn't good, please just leave a comment, and I can adjust it.

The main decision we have to make is where to meet. I'd like to propose the following: anybody who has an outpost in mind can nominate one in the comments. In about 24 hours, August 17 09:00 PST, I'll collect all of the nominations and set up a vote. If there are around 5-6 (or less) nominations, then we'll vote using the [Schulze method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) to decide on the location. (It's a type of ranked-voting system; I can give more instructions when it gets to this point.) If there are significantly more, then we will do a round of [Approval Voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) and select the top five most popular candidates. We'll pass those over to the Schulze method to choose the final location.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions about this. I look forward to seeing you guys in game before the launch!

**Update**: A few people are suggesting that the times are a little bit too strange for certain zones. Should we just set a location to meet, and appear at any time (say, within 24 hours) of the GW2 headstart?

In addition, others have brought up a good point that we should consider choosing an outpost that everyone has access to, specifically, any Eye of the North outpost. I'll continue to put down the nominations, but please keep it in mind during the first round of voting. (I'll also make note of it again at that time.)


**Update 2**: This post has an outpost selection follow-up [here](http://redd.it/ydrrj).

I had just discovered that a Reddit based alliance existed, and Zawk (the then alliance leader) was kind enough to let me add a guild to the small and atrophying alliance and see what I could do with it.

[I started small on July 14th, 2011.](http://i.imgur.com/r7vNr.png)

You guys (and gals) joined me and helped me get off the ground. Not 3 weeks after I started that guild, it was full.

Today, the [Narwhal guilds](http://i.imgur.com/wn6oH.jpg) passed the 500 member mark. We sit at 515 members, excluding myself and the original Reddit Guild.

I want to thank you all for the fun times, and for helping me foster a thriving community in the twilight of a great game. It has taken more time and effort than I feel I will be able to exert for much longer. As such, I am withdrawing myself from consideration for the Alliance Leader position in Guild Wars II. I appreciate the fervor many of you showed in wanting me to lead our next alliance, but it is too much.

As always, if you wish to join the Reddit Alliance, shoot me a message on here or submit your name [here](http://gwreddit.lilithstudios.com/).

Thanks again, and happy gaming.
