I have also suffered from depression for a number of years which is where my interest in this field stems from. 2 years ago I was placed on citalopram and stayed on the drug for approximately one year. The drug didn't really work for me and I actually found it a bit to stimulatory for my needs. So my GP prescribed me mirtazapine which was great at first but after about 6-7 months I felt the drug completely and utterly ""poop out"" on me. I felt it made me become utterly apathetic and anhedonic. I decided to withdraw and become drug free but I've never really felt that that the apathy and anhedonia has cleared up.
From my limited understanding and research I believe that the semi-long term use of these anti-depressants has caused some sort of dopamine down-regulation in my brain which happened during the tail end of my treatment with mirtazapine. I believe that this lack of dopamine may be causing my issues with apathy and anhedonia. 

I was just wondering whether there are any drugs available that are tailored to the treatment of apathy and anhedonia. I've researched a few drugs with dopaminergic agonistic action such as bupropion/wellbutrin but I'm a little bit tentative about chatting to my GP about being prescribed them as I understand that agonism of dopamine receptors can lead to psychotic like reactions in some patients. 

basically I believe I've made a lot of scientific assumptions above based on my limited knowledge of neurochemistry and I have a few questions if anyone has a spare moment 

1. Is it possible for long-term use of anti-depressants to cause some sort of reduction in the levels of dopamine in the brain?

2. Is a lack of dopamine thought to be one of the general causes of apathy and anhedonia?

3. Are there any medications known to be particularly useful in the treatment of apathy and anhedonia?

I appreciate the time taken for you to read this and perhaps help me out with my search for information.

It's been a while since I've seen any discussion or articles regarding the use of Ketamine to treat the depressive swing of Bipolar patients, as well as Unipolar depression. The strange characteristic that Ketamine has is that it's mood-lifting abilities were recorded to be within hours or days rather than the month or so that SSRI anti-depressants typically take to kick in. 

Here are the sort of reports I have seen:

[Ketamine lifts mood quickly in bipolar disorder](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/03/us-ketamine-bipolar-idUSTRE6725J820100803)

[Ketamine is magic drug for depression](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7953967/Ketamine-is-magic-drug-for-depression.html)

Now before the discussion gets started, the studies done regarding the mood lifting abilities of Ketamine were achieved with relatively low dosages. The K-Hole and general recreational use of Ketamine are not what I want to discuss, it's merely the mood lifting ability that I am interested in.

It's worth noting that most threads on Reddit about the anti-depressant features of Ketamine are flooded with people talking about the recreational side of the drug, as well as the K-Hole and 'change of perspective' or 'new look on life' that is achieved from it. This doesn't seem to be the source of the anti-depressant effect, and again isn't something I'm interested in. I thought I remembered a thread about a redditor trying to help a friend suffering from Unipolar Depression via. low dosage Ketamine but after spending a while searching I can't seem to find it; which leads me to believe I merely imagined it.

If someone does happen to remember the thread and can find it, a link would be extremely appreciated.

I'm Bipolar Type II and currently take Valproate Acid (Depakote) as treatment, however this doesn't seem to be doing anything in regards to my depression. However I do not have the ability to change my prescription for at least a month or two until I see my main Psychiatrist. In the meantime I am looking at alternative methods to treat my depression.

I am interested in trying low dosage Ketamine to help combat my depression, but unfortunately I do not have access to it directly; I probably have an acquaintance somewhere that could hook me up, but I feel incredibly awkward asking someone I barely speak to, to help me out in such a way. However as it's speculated that it's because Ketamine is an NMDA Receptor Antagonist that it has a mood-lifting effect, alternatively there are a couple of NMDA Antagonists that I can get a hold of.

Laughing Gas and DXM are both NMDA Receptor Antagonists like Ketamine, however I can't find any information on whether they have the same effects as Ketamine regarding Depression. And I don't have enough knowledge of the topics at hand to know if all 3 drugs work in the same way or have the same effects.

---

So my questions are:

Does anyone have experience with Ketamine and depression?

Does anyone have experience with Laughing Gas/DXM and depression?

Does anyone know if the different NMDA antagonists work in the same way, and would achieve the same effect on depression?

I understand that it's tough to get good medical advice in America for free and many people lack the confidence to talk to their doctors/don't know what to ask(everywhere). However; asking medical advice on the internet is a poor idea here's why:
* Not everyone here is qualified to respond to your query (yet some people will think they are)  
* Even if there were qualified people here, it's unlikely they'll be able to give a proper response without knowing your medical history - all you appear to us is a few paragraphs in a post - that's all you are when you post.   
  
**My solution to problem 1 is to have in the sidebar to not seek medical advice here/or to have it made painfully obvious that it's not a good idea to take the advice from here even though we more than likely mean well**  
 
&gt; Problem 2) - People coming here for information about illegal substances.   
  
Now I don't want to come across as anti-drugs (I'm not), and I definitely want people who do want to take substances to be able to do it safely however refer to problem 1 - we're mostly not qualified to talk about it. The thing that annoys me is that this subreddit appears (to me) to cater to those with a scientific interest and what we're discussing isn't science - it's just how to get fucked. You'll have to forgive me for my snobbery.

I was searching through the effects of racetams on alleviating subjective lithium induced cognitive impairment ([link to the relevant listing](http://scholar.qsensei.com/content/4pf27), and [link to the only summary I could find](http://www.dr-bob.org/babble/20050611/msgs/513788.html)) and I happened across an interesting article;

&gt; [Lithium modulates desensitization of the glutamate receptor
subtype GluR3 in Xenopus oocytes](http://papke.med.ufl.edu/reprints/GluR3desens.pdf)


and particularly this snippet;

&gt; Lithium's effects on GluR3 desensitization are distinct from the effects of aniracetam on desensitization. Specifically,
aniracetam, which potentiates wild-type AMPA receptors, is ineffective on the non-desensitizing GluR3(L507Y) mutant,
but has synergistic effects with lithium on wild-type receptors.


If you read further into the paper, you'll see that there exists unique synergism between lithium and aniracetam in enhancing GluR3 response via reduction of desensitization. However, what I am curious about, and offer a open question on, is the ramifications of this synergism. The GluR3 receptor subunit itself is pretty mysterious, considering from what I gather, it's pretty hard to create ligands that differentiate with a high enough affinity to discern the result of modulation over a different subunit. From what I gather from a variety of sources, GluR3 affects/modulates seizures, anxiety, normal sleep patterns, and resting respiration. ([Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18312590))

Taking what is generally accepted about lithium and aniracetam, they both have the following properties:

* disrupts circadian rhythm regulation
* antidepressant
* anxiolytic
* neuroprotective

Source on ampakine traits [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1527-3458.2002.tb00216.x/abstract), for lithium- [neuroprotective source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12701214), [circadian rhythm regulation](http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/117873), I don't think a source is necessary for the rest. Disruption of natural circadian rhythm is generally correlated as being a positive effect on Bipolar Disorder by lithium, in case you were not familiar- and of course, just because the two share the same effects, does not mean they have the same mechanism of action.

Much of this could be considered extrapolation and guesswork- but I've been approved the combination of lithium and aniracetam by my PDOC and I am genuinely curious what underlying effects this might induce. I'm just using it to treat cognitive impairments from lithium, but this particular subunit targeting by aniracetam is pretty damn rare and novel, and the closest things we've got that modulate GluR3 are being researched as new and surprisingly effective ways of treating anxiety- I'm genuinely curious as to the potential of this combination.

This is a long read but I believe it may be of some interest to those who are curious about the properties of serotonin synthesis.

I have BPD II (w/ Ultra Ultra Rapid Cycling) as well as ADHD and a host of other nasty mental conditions, and as such, I am treated with a large daily dose of Lithium to prevent rapid cycling. For those unfamiliar, ultra ultra rapid cycling is the actual clinical term for those who cycle from extreme moods from hour to hour. 

Lithium is the gold standard for preventing these mood swings, and I agree it is effective. However, most anyone on Lithium would agree it tends to have fairly nasty side effects, and the weekly blood tests aren't much fun either. You don't go on Lithium unless you absolutely have to. Being a drug nerd, I sought to study the pharmacology with my neuropsych doc, who is also a researcher in the field of neuroplasticity. She agrees that it is best to be informed of whatever you are imbibing. [Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_pharmacology) a brief rundown of the pharmacological properties of lithium for those unfamiliar.

Okay. Enough preface. [Lithium induces a notable increase in serotonin synthesis](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/178/2/325.short)- a property I believe only a handful of drugs share. Now, supplements like 5-HTP, SAMe, and B vitamins increase serotonin synthesis because they are the elements necessary to actually create serotonin- but Lithium actually increases the *rate* at which the serotonin is synthesized (for sourcing, check the above article). Because 5-HTP, etc. are simply the building blocks, how much they can help has an upper limit defined by how much your body still needs- therefore, you can't take a gram of 5-HTP and expect to cure treatment-resistant depression.

Again, from the above article:
&gt; The calculation indicated that lithium increased the synthesis rate of brain serotonin by about 80%. Moreover, chronic treatment with lithium salts also increased the levels of brain tryptophan by about 70%, suggesting that this could be the mechanism by which lithium stimulates serotonin synthesis.

Okay, so this might be why lithium can help with depression. Why is this so important? Well, since the increase is in both peak brain tryptophan levels and serotonin synthesis, an addition of 5-HTP is much more potent for people on lithium. Combine this with the fact that many people on psychotropic medications may not be taking in a healthy diet necessary to maintain a healthy mood, 5-HTP can be the difference in curing treatment resistant depression.

This combination has one pitfall- combination of 5-HTP and Lithium can induce serotonin syndrome due to excess concentrations of serotonin. However, most regiments for treatment resistant depression run this risk- any combination of two serotonin-affecting agents can potentially induce serotonin syndrome. In individuals with BPD, mania may occur if the Lithium dose is not high enough to prevent a hypermanic state. Therefore, patients seeking this sort of therapy must monitor their mood immediately after initiating treatment and cancel administration of 5-HTP if hypermanic symptoms occur.


This combination is most notable because unlike antidepressants, it does not target specific receptors. The only side effects it can create are ones that stem from the serotonin transporter activity itself- though yes, these may potentially induce side effects such as nausea. Effect on upregulation and downregulation of receptors is unknown- though I would assume there would be some downregulation.

On a personal and unsourced note, I gained approval from my pdoc a number of months ago to try out this combination, and it has really changed my life. I had accepted depression as a part of my life, and while I still have an occasional down day, I finally feel free to conduct my life without the constant fear of a sudden, unexplained drop in mood. I did have hypomania (mild mania) on the first couple days of treatment, but it disappeared fairly quickly and hasn't become a problem since.

**Most notably, since conducting this therapy (400mg of 5-HTP and 600mg of Li), I have a constant, mild euphoria**. It was much stronger at first but it has persisted without fail since initiation of treatment. It is much like the afterglow of a psychedelic or the upswing following prolonged steady SSRI treatment- a subtle sense of fulfillment and a perceptible, almost body-high. It feels natural and is not accompanied with any negative side effects, though my dreams have gotten quite interesting and I have constant closed-eyed visuals/ mild rainbow vision.

I acknowledge that this is from the research of two individuals and a placebo effect may be implicated. Two other close friends with BPD tried it (with doctor approval) and endorse it.

**tl;dr**: Augmentation to a lithium regiment with 5-HTP effectively utilizes the well-established increase in serotonin synthesis and may offer a solution to treatment-resistant depression in individuals with bipolar disorder

1347672147.0,15,self.psychopharmacology,zwnog,Is there any danger to mixing an anticholinergic (e.g. Benadryl or Dramamine) with a nootropic stack containing a choline supplement? (X-Post from /r/nootropics),20,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/psychopharmacology/comments/zwnog/is_there_any_danger_to_mixing_an_anticholinergic/,"Greetings,

I pieced together a few supplements to create a nootropic stack. This cocktail consists of piracetam, citicoline CDP-Choline, and ALCAR (Acetyl-L-carnitine) -- all of which will be slowly introduced into my system.

However, I come to realize that some over-the-counter medications that I sometimes take are anticholinergic, such as Benadryl (for allergies) and Dramamine (for nausea/potential motion sickness). My concern is that a mixture of the two could cause severe issues, namely in the struggle between the choline supplement and the anticholinergic. I have never had an issue with either of the anticholinergics in the past, but I have never actually tried one in conjunction with a choline supplement. I don't plan on taking my stack with an anticholinergic every day, only on the rare occasions I need it.

Is this concern valid? Thanks in advance!

Some of them are researched more than the others, while some have no research at all.

What I want to know is, what possible metabolism can be going on with these amphetamines? If you have a paper to link, that's great, but what I want to hear is some kind of guesstimate. Below is a list of them, with a short description of subjective effects, which may help you to rule out possible metabolic routes.

* para-fluoroamphetamine = ordinary amphetamine like effects such as stimulation, bruxism, etc; unique frisson and euphoria
* meta-fluoroamphetamine = feels a bit like watered down para version, less euphoria
* ortho-fluoroamphetamine = euphoria almost completely lacking, more of a functional stimulation
* ortho-fluoromethamphetamine = VERY long duration of effects, dosage tends to be half of non-meth amphetamines, pure stimulation, euphoria lacking
* para-fluoromethamphetamine = I haven't tried this yet, but I heard that it's very harsh on body and has a horrible crash

What's interesting is, that except para-fluoromethamphetamine, all of these amphetamines have a smooth stimulation curve, which means no crash whatsoever. (At least with sane dosage)

Also, it hurts like a bitch in nose, yet doesn't cause nosebleeds. Fluoroamphetamines hurt more than fluoromethamphetamines. I'm also curious why this happens.

There are some rumors, that fluorine substitution on para position prevents our body to metabolize para-fluoroamphetamine and para-fluoromethamphetamine. Can this be right? What about the others?

Side question: neurotoxicity, but please, back this one with research.

My hope is that in a few years I will have more informed questions to ask providers. What I am hoping for as an end result is a treatment option that might work and the NIH isn't holding hostage. 

 Lately, I have been studying (reading, taking notes, looking things up as I go, etc) a book called The Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology, 8th edition. While I have found it informative, it was published in 2003 and I'd like something more up to date.

 Is this still a relevant title? If not (based on age/edition), what are some titles that might be better suited? Will neuropharm help with my understanding of psychopharm or is it just an adjunct rather than requirement?

Long time lurker here, and I was hoping for some advice on how to pick a school for pharmacology given my career goals.

Some Background:
I have been accepted to a couple schools and am interviewing at a few more for a masters in pharmacology (my credentials probably would have been too weak for PhD from a top 20 university). I currenty work in a neuro lab with a P.I. with several thousand citations and know I want to get my PhD under a similarly reputable P.I. later. I plan to get my master's, possibly work a couple years. and then go back for my PhD from a top institution.  I am most interested in neuropharm. I can see myself doing research in industry or academia, as long as I am interested.

I was accepted to New York Medical College and Thomas Jefferson University and Loyola @Chicago (private schools are the main ones offering masters) Interviewing at U. of Illinois at Chicago. Does anyone have any experience with these schools, industry or academia, that would influence their choice given the above circumstances? I.e. UIC would be better for establishing my research potential for my return for PhD, while TJU would be better for industry related work?

Please source answers when it is possible.

Here's where my research has led me:

&gt;[Ketamine] initially blocks a protein on brain neurons, called the NMDA receptor, to which the chemical messenger glutamate binds. However, it is not known if the drug’s rapid antidepressant effects are a direct result of this blockage or of downstream effects triggered by the blockage

(http://www.nih.gov/news/health/aug2012/nimh-03.htm)

So it seems that blocking NMDA is what helps alleviate depression.

&gt;S-(+)-ketamine has greater affinity than R-(−)-ketamine at phencyclidine binding sites on the NMDA receptor.

(http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/2/59.full)


So this means that s-isomer ketamine blocks NMDA more, and we could conclude that it would be better for treating depression? 

Do any of you know of anything that would contradict this theory? Do any of you think that science may not yet truly know how this all works, and that the r-isomer half of ketamine may also be important?

Before I researched any of this, a guy I talked to on the internet about this said that he thought when he used s-isomer ketamine, he tripped harder but had less antidepressive effects. But that is one person's subjective experience. Also, when you use s-isomer ketamine, it is more potent, so you need less, and maybe you need more of any kind of ketamine in your system for antidepressive efffects, and that could explain why he thought it was less antidepressive?

I can't believe that there is so much faulty/misleading information out there. Alternatively, I'm getting something wrong.

I'm focusing mainly on DAT (dopamine active transporter).
A bunch of sources, including the one that my book cites (1), state that amphetamine reverses the action of DAT, making it pump dopamine out of the cytosol back into the synapse. Most other articles that I found cite that same article and build off of it. I’m not arguing the validity of this claim. However, all the articles regarding this inversion treat it as the primary/only effect of AMPH on DAT. My book makes no mention of the following alternative.
The other mechanism of amphetamine on DAT I found is the transport of DAT from the membrane back into the cytosol (2) which, obviously, means that it can’t reuptake any more dopamine from the synapse, nor can it pump any dopamine from the cytosol out of the neuron. There’s a significant correlation (r = 0.75) between the movement of DAT into the cytosol and the inhibition of dopamine reuptake. There are fewer articles in support of this though one of them (3) offers photographic evidence. 
Both mechanisms together do a better job of explaining amphetamine’s effects on dopamine reuptake than either one individually.

So, am I missing something, or is the information in my textbook incomplete and are most articles on the subject ignoring the other major effect of amphetamine on dopamine?

Sidenote: I’m aware that amphetamine also affects other neurotransmitters in similar ways, but I’m focusing on dopamine partially for the sake of simplicity and partially because the book focuses on it and I’m writing this as a rebuttal to that.

Other examples come to mind: marketing gabapentin and buspirone for GAD, panic, anxiety and depression, thereby shifting focus from benzo-oriented treatment to relatively old drugs (late 1980s for the former and 1986 for the latter), though not as old as the aforementioned. As well as the use of modafinil and adrafinil for the management of fatigue, deficits in concentration and physical energy, supplementing the use of amphetamines and related structures (ie MPH).

The cool thing about agomelatine is that it seems, at least in the limited research done so far (mostly on rats, yeah, but not entirely), to have robust antidepressant actions (including hippocampal neurogenesis, forced-swim test improvement, glutamate release reduction, and BDNF increase, to name a few), with placebo-level side effects, despite a totally different mechanism of action. As opposed to many antidepressants (eg SSRIs), it actually antagonizes 5-HT receptors (mostly 5-HT-2C) while being an agonist at melatonin receptors 1 and 2. Importantly, several studies show that some of these effects are critically influenced by the synergy of both melatonin and 5-HT mechanisms.

Now, I'm wondering if anyone has come across any interesting info/articles on how and/or why this works, whether by indirect modulation of dopamine, paradoxical serotonin effects, or some influence on BDNF. IIRC, it's been established that agomelatine's antidepressant effects are independent of its sleep-health-promoting effects (which are well-supported). There's some limited research into all of these individually, but nothing really cohesive, and few ideas as to this works, or how it interacts with circadian rhythms and the suprachiasmatic nucleus or the pineal. Any ideas on where I could head next, whether with some original research (though I see the odds of getting IRB approval to give people a drug that's yet to even undergo clinical trials as near nil, melatonin itself isn't out of the question. Is it?) or in a review paper? I think it could be interesting to do a study that supplements healthy volunteers with melatonin at night and tracks changes (improvements is my hypothesis) in memory, or if some noninvasive measure could be found neuroplasticity, but how can I extend or implement that?

One difference is often the duration of effect - stimulants last for several hours, whereas exercise only lasts as long as the person is exercising. And exercise raises the heart rate well over 120 BPM, whereas stimulants don't increase the heart rate as much.

I have been searching for some good neuropharm graduate programs and was wondering if anyone here knew of any ""hotspots"" or reputable research centers specifically for neuropharm.  I am most interested in discovering and synthesizing novel compounds that interact with neurotransmitters and/or their receptors.  I am leaning towards programs like UC Irvine that offer both pharmacology and medicinal chemistry for this reason.  I have done a lot of research, but the semantics of pharmacology, pharmaceutical science, medicinal chemistry etc.,have made things difficult, then combined with sifting through for neuro specific pharm research  has not yielded the definitive results I would like when making such an important decision.  I liked the look of UC-Irvine, Emory, Albany Medical college (neuropharm program), and University Maryland Baltimore, because they have many faculty members doing neuropharm specifically, but I feel like I am not searching for this the right way.  I want to have some options for PI's after my experience in multiple labs with PI's leaving, bad relationships with grad students, etc.  so I wasn't as keen on searching for an individual P.I.

I decided to experiment with MXE as my friends did. I knew about the risks of combining MDMA and SSRIs (which is why I have not done so), but in my limited knowledge it did not occur to me that other drugs could interact negatively with SSRIs.

I did two lines of MXE. I felt some effects, but they were mild and nothing compared to my friends' responses to the drug. I felt some distortions in perception and time, and some clumsiness similar to being drunk. I didn't do as much as they did because my one friend remembered that I had mentioned being on an anti-depressant, and was extremely worried that taking too much MXE would give me Serotonin Syndrome. He asked an acquaintance, a neuroscience grad student, whether or not there would be an interaction between MXE and SSRIs, and he said he did not think so.

It has been two days since the experience and I feel markedly more depressed. I have little energy and am irritable. Could this have something to do with the MXE? Did I fuck up?

Hey there,
I just finished reading ""Anatomy of an Epidemic"" by Robert Whitaker after a close friend recommended it to me. The basic premise of the book, for those who haven't heard of it, is that the rise of disabling mental illness in the Western world in the recent past is largely a society-created problem; the misuse and over-prescription of psychiatric medication.

TBH this book reinforced my previously existing opinions of the problem, but I am really wondering if those involved in the business of mental health are aware of the studies he cites and what they think could or should be done about the problem.

I think all of us are affected in some way by this problem; whether its a family member a friend or even just the effect on the population as a whole, this issue is really important for our future.

I felt that over the past year my depression has been getting worse so I discussed my general doctor who recommend trying Viibryd (Lexapro is generally not perscribed above 20mg/day).  He gave me some sample packs and suggested I simply replace Lexapro with 10mg of Viibryd for 7 days and then go to 20 mg.

I immediately when into SSRI withdrawl the day I switched to Viibryd.  I expected this for a few days until my body got used to Viibryd but didn’t expect that severe of symptoms considering that they’re both SSRIs and in the past I haven’t had that many problems switching from one to another.  

SSRI withdrawal symptoms for me have included very frequent brain zaps, tremors, spacing out over and over during the day, irritability, etc.  After 5 days I went up to 20mg of Viibryd in an effort to curb my SSRI withdrawal symptoms.  It helped somewhat, but then the side effects of Viibryd kicked into high gear.  Bad nausea (up to gagging/near vomiting a few times), frequent bowel movements (not diarrhea but close), insomnia, waking up during sleeping, fatigue... the list go on.  

The brain zaps coming off the Lexapro have been particularly bad, especially when walking or standing.   These can be as frequent as 10-15 brain spasms every 5 minutes.  They are at their worst an hour or two before my dose of Viibryd is due.  Once I take the Viibryd they begin to reduce after a few hours.  I’m still experiencing them all day long however.  This is unlike previous switches (Paxil to Celexa and Celexa to Lexapro) where the new SSRI seemed to keep them curbed for the most part.

I’ve been on Viibryd for 9 days, 4 of them at 20mg and I see little in the way of feeling any better.  I’ve lost 9 pounds in 9 days because I can barely eat.  I read several places on the net that the initial side effects of Viibryd can feel like having a stomach flu and this is very accurate for me. I’m tired, sick and just feel terrible.  

I should have researched more on this before switching as IMHO doctors don’t have a clue as to what they’re doing ½ of the time.  I believe the Lexapro should have been tapered down to 15 mg for a week or two and then to 10 mg for a couple of weeks before switching and ramping up the Viibryd.  The SSRI withdrawal combined with the nasty side effects of Viibryd is the worst I’ve ever experienced in 10 years of SSRIs.

It’s much too early to tell if the switch will be worth it.  I’m hoping that Viibryd will provide better relief for my depression.

For anyone thinking of taking Viibryd, you may want to get with a knowledgeable doctor or psychiatrist for the best way to phase this into your life.  If you’re currently on another SSRI I would HIGHLY recommend you work with someone that can help you cross taper correctly (taking smaller amounts of both your current SSRI as well as Viibryd to decrease withdrawl symptoms - HOWEVER be careful as this can cause serotonin syndrome by getting too much serotonin which can be dangerous) or slowly work your way down from the old SSRI before ramping up the Viibryd.  Most general doctors are pretty clueless about withdrawal and side effects of SSRIs in my opinion as they only receive their information from the drug companies who have been very reluctant to admit SSRI withdrawal exists.

My apologies if this is rambling... I can’t even begin to tell if it is or not in my current condition.  The main point is to educate yourself on Viibryd as it seems to be quite a bit different than other SSRIs on the market.


UPDATE:  A day later and I'm feeling a bit better.  I stuck with the Viibryd since I wasn't quite as bad and felt I could continue.  Much less of the brain zaps and numbness, still feeling weird.  For the first 3 hours after my 20mg of Viibryd I was very manic..sweating, talking fast, jittery.  But these went away and I'm dealing.  Hopefully another week and I'll be feeling more myself.

In an effort to understand the cause and mechanism of anxiety disorders I've done a lot of reading.

So far the [PANDAS/PANS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANDAS) hypothesis seems the truest, at least for rapid onset OCD.

[""CCK receptors significantly influence neurotransmission in the brain, regulating anxiety...""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin_B_receptor)

2.Has anyone tried [Proglumide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglumide)?

Benzos like temazepam have a stronger and more intense adverse reaction than benzos like alprazolam; however the adverse reaction to alprazolam is still severe enough that a more optimal solution would be good.

The panic/phobia is to the extent where nitrous oxide is usually required just for the insertion of a cannula, however this is not always a viable option. 

Medications tried: temazepam, diazepam, alprazolam all lead to varying degrees of adverse reaction; oxycodone combined with alprazolam and clonidine was unsuccessful, as was olanzapine, and promethazine.

* limitations in the workplace due to the accepted convention of socialization

* it is unhealthy for my 3 children to have  a parent that is an emotionally nonresponsive

None of this is distressing for *me*, but I see opportunity for a better life. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and he has advised me that there is no standard treatment for this condition and prescribed klonopin for anxiety. If I experience anxiety I'm not able to interpret it, so it seems senseless.

Are there any clinical trials or therapy programs for people living with emotional flatness?

I've been on a number of different medications but this is the first time I've found a med that actually works. My life has improved a shocking amount.
But on it I've been having considerable difficulty attaining orgasm. I have no problem achieving erection but it takes a really long time/a lot of stimulation to make me climax.
I can see why this med can be used off-label for premature ejaculation!
But anyway this is massively affecting my sexual life. Not only does it make it hard for me to climax but it also massively reduces my sensation. This means that I really can't feel much down there. It makes me not perform as well sexually but also demotivates me from carrying on.
The women I've been with become extremely frustrated and start to think that it's a problem with them rather than me.

What I'm asking is, is there anyway to decrease the sexual side effects of sertraline?

I was looking at an adjuncticative medication called buproprion but I understand than in the UK it is only available for smoking cessation.

Does anybody have any advice for me regarding this situation? (at the moment going off sertraline is simple not an option. I think I may be on this stuff for life as long as it keeps working with the same efficacy).

Low SES, chronic neglect as a child, chronically witnessed DV as a child, multiple instances of physical abuse... has the baseline ""dull anger"" (my best description) associated with kids like this...

Previous  diagnosis of ADHD and has been rx'd Adderall IR 10 mg BID by PCP then transitioned to Adderall XR 20 mg qAM. He identifies symptoms of poor concentration/distraction. When he takes the Adderall XR at 0700, he feels ""depressed and woozie"" by 1300. It's knocked out his appetite. He doesn't notice any improvement in concentration, but he doesn't have an appetite. 

In conversation, he's able to recognize his impulsivity... it seems to come in two varieties. The first is reactive anger (when someone does him wrong, etc.) that I conceptualize as being rooted in the chronic neglect/abuse. The second anger tends to get him in trouble with the law... I'm still not clear on whether it's a conduct disorder versus ADHD impulsivity (only a 25-minute consult)... running from the cops, bringing contraband to school...

Finally, we have what he defines as ""depression"" which seems to be a dysphoric mood (though not sad...). It's associated with hopelessness related to his socioeconomic situation. 

He admits to using Xanax several times per month to help him ""relax"" when he's angry. He also uses marijuana on almost a daily basis. 

Now, I've been fooled many times before and I'll be fooled many times in the future. However, he genuinely informed me that he'd stop the marijuana and Xanax if I could decrease his dull anger by 50%. 

So... where would you guys go with this case? I'm leaning towards d/c'ing the Adderall XR (I've had many a kid become angrier on Adderall) and starting low-dose aripiprazole and adding low-dose citalopram after two weeks if needed. Feedback? Other ideas?

In short, My depression worsened, and my primary care physician put me on what he said was a higher dose, and switched me to extended-release venlafaxine. When he mentioned the dose - 150 mg once a day - I was confused, because I was currently taking a total of 225 mg per day, so 150 mg would be a decrease in dose, right? I replied that I was taking 75 mg *three times per day*, and he didn't say anything. I assumed that the total dosing for venlafaxine ER was lower than for regular venlafaxine.

So, I've been taking the ER form for two and a half days, and am worried that I'm going through withdrawal. I have the ""zaps"", light sensitivity, weakness... all the symptoms I associate with venlafaxine withdrawal. Is this real or am I imagining this?

It's working well, and I feel much better in general. However, the side effects that occur in the first few hours after taking it have been an issue. My doctor recommended that I take the dose in the morning in order to avoid insomnia, but I've found that doing so makes me nauseous, overly sensitive to noise, and too tired to be productive at work. I've tried taking the drug in the evening, which minimizes the nausea and misophonia. However, I don't sleep soundly unless I take an Ambien alongside the Lexapro. 

I have a prescription for Klonopin, which my doctor prescribed in tandem with Lexapro for situational anxiety. If I take it at the same time as the Lexapro, it blunts the side effects to some extent. However, I prefer not to take the Klonopin every day because I'm worried about building up a resistance. (I have the same concern about Ambien.)

Is there a way I can time my dosage to minimize the side effects of Lexapro without having to take additional drugs? Alternately, is there something I can ask my doctor about that is more suitable for long-term daily use than Ambien or Klonopin?

I have a group presentation regarding (mostly) the treatment of PTSD as well as antipsychotics. The portion of the presentation that was assigned to me reads: ""Auditory Intensity Paradigm."" I'll be honest, I don't really know what that is. 

Through some research I have found out that serotonergic transmission has been implicated in PTSD and the intensity-dependent auditory evoked potential (IDAEP) has been suggested to be a biological marker of central serotonergic activity. This provides an opportunity to more precisely characterize PTSD patient populations, and possibly predict the response to treatment. 

So, is this accurate/does it make sense?

Could someone try to explain this to me in a way that I won't sound like an idiot as I'm presenting?

Since methylphenidate is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, it means that more of the dopamine will end up in the extracellular synapse, which also means that more of it will be broken down. And then it will take some time for the dopamine molecules to recover (for some reason, I've just taken L-tyrosine supplements, but I'm still not feeling any improvement). 

Maybe it would be a good idea to simply take caffeine for alertness while I'm waiting for my dopamine levels to recover after months and months of Concerta? And might this be one form of tolerance to methylphenidate? (a short term of tolerance).

I would like to ask for some help here: I've been on several anti-depressants over the last years for fatigue, low mood and low drive (Citalopram, Fluoxetine, Reboxetine, Venlafaxine, Bupropion, Modafinil).

Unfortunately I didn't benefit much from these medications; it also turned out that my sleep pattern is slightly distorted (superficial sleep, with shortened REM stage). 

My new doctor suggested me to try out sustained-release Methylphenidate as a mono-medication, since he believes my symptoms fit into the profile of (hypo-active) ADD.

I didn't try out the medication yet: I hope it will improve my low drive and fatigue. 

But I would like also to find something for my low mood - do you have any suggestions? Any medication I can combine smoothly with Methylphenidate (which preferably improves sleep quality and counteracts the often mentioned rebound effect of Methylphenidate)?

My next appointment is in some weeks - so I would be very thankful, if you could share your opinion!

This seems to contradict with a lot of the anecdotal reports I have read on the web.

Pharmacologically, I think there are two main arguments that can be made both in favour and against my doc's opinion.

In support: As SSRIs increase the synaptic concentration of serotonin between nerve cells, and as DMT targets 5HT2A and 5HT2B serotonin receptors, the extra availability of serotonin in conjunction with DMT's already potent effect on serotonin could lead to strong potency.

Against: As use of SSRIs often results in down-regulation of serotonin receptors the DMT could have a less potent effect on the already downregulated receptors (namely 5HT2A and 5HT2B).

First, my fear is the level of dosage that I'm on. Second, is the length of time that I've been on the medication. I would like to say, that I'm not depressed. I'm a mess. Drinking is so horrible, but what could be worse?

Constantly being messed up on the medication that's what.

This is not a finish line. I'm not going to submit this until it's through. I taken excessively large dose of an antipsychotic. Although it is half the maximum dose, it's twice my previous dose which had been ramped up over two years because I was complaining about symptoms that don't exist.

What are some of the real consequences of taking medication? Life is important. Nothing seems important when you're on the medication. I'm afraid it when I get off the medication my life will be over. I'm afraid I've taken the wrong steps towards recovery needless to say with the medication but as well as the decisions that I made while on the medication. So the problem is that you don't view things is important so you let them go when you're on the medication. When you're on the medication you don't need these things. The similarity to drugs is terrifying. It is honestly like I am on a drug at all times.

I've been taking medication for four years. The medication is an antipsychotic. I would like to repeat I'm not depressed.

Why have I been on the medication for so long? Well, I went through a time where I accepted that I was schizophrenic and I accepted the medication.. Then I began to rely on the medication and use the fact that I could think a little bit more clearly by making plans for my future that were impossible to achieve. Now I begin to think of what I've been planning to do which includes irrelevant things to this post, nothing crazy, I think about how sad it makes me that I've been wasting my time trying to do these things. I've actually spent much of my time much too happy or avoiding my real problems, which are mostly social in nature.

I want to say again that I'm not depressed.

I do have insomnia however. I have medication for insomnia. I also seem to have some small level of anxiety, which I also have a different medication for. And of course the large dose of antipsychotics I take every day. With all these drugs in my system I still choose to drink. And with all of these helpers, including the one that I haven't mentioned such as Social Security, I still am completely miserable. Or at the least it would appear that way. But I'm not depressed.

I can't experience pleasure and it's not because I'm schizophrenic. I cannot experience pleasure because of medication. When I get off the medication I don't feel anxiety because I'm schizophrenic. I feel anxiety because I'm having withdrawals from the medication. The kind of problems I have when I'm off the medication are a result of me being on the medication for so long at such high dose. The medication seems to suspend my headspace in a kind of out of control mania which I rely on to avoid my real problems which the medication doesn't solve. I can't confirm that withdrawals are involved with medication I take however I do know that with pharmaceutical drugs nearly every one that is psychotropic has withdrawals and this medication is psychotropic.

took it before going to bed. Was drowsy probably the first 12 hours of my following day. I think I also slept longer than normal the night I took it. Symptoms did not extend into a second day.

was on either 20 or 10 mg of lexapro at the time. 

And was on either 300 or 150 mg of wellbutrin. 

I honestly think I was put on it for a very stupid reason. I had been seeing my doctor who was both a psychologist and psychiatrist to me for over a year. Since my symptoms didn't match his criteria of what depression (or anything) is, he told me to take risperidone. Then I had that effect and he decided I shouldn't take it anymore. One month later he told me I was faking or making up my mental health issues. Why the hell would you give someone an antipsychotic and then a month later tell them that you don't think there's anything chemically wrong with them?

Well anyways, I'm on the long and tedious journey that I have been on for years to see if there is a diagnosis that really makes sense for me. I wonder if my reaction to risperidone will be a small piece of the puzzle of diagnosing myself/getting diagnosed by a healthcare professional.

**And no this is not me asking for medical advice.** I am not going to instantly diagnose myself with any disorder someone writes down. So don't even bring that up.

I could potentially be doing LSD, adderal, drinking, ecstasy, and smoking this weekend. I am also on 100mg of Zoloft daily. Aside from the dangerous potential these drugs themselves have when taken together, (like I say, potentially) what affect will an SSRI have with these combinations of drugs? Is there any solution to get around not taking Zoloft for 3 days? I personally feel it doesnt do much and I should be taken off it, however my psychiatrist says ""why not, just stay on it."" Also, i was thinking that for an SSRI user, in order to help the comedown from mdma/lsd, i should not take the zoloft? any other ways to lighten up the comedown?

This is due, I'm told, to federal regulation of some of Dex's key ingredients. But it's the only drug that helps me live a ""normal"" life in the face of nasty Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and I'll be simply screwed if I can't find a steady supply. Adderall, Ritalin, Provigil, etc don't help me at all. Only the Dex.

My psychopharmacologist is willing to mail, fax, or phone an Rx to a Canadian (or other trustworthy) pharmacy. But while she's heard that it can be done legally, she's never done it herself and thus the task falls on me. I'd rather not break any laws, but I'm willing to accept a certain degree of risk (border seizure?) if I can get my Dex back.

How on Earth do I begin this process? I've been pouring over pharmacy sites for hours, and simply can't tell which ones are legit and which aren't. Can anyone point me in the right direction, or otherwise lend some advice that will help me find what I'm looking for?

[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X11000746](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X11000746)

&gt;Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that is currently used as a smoking cessation aid. Bupropion interferes with monoamine reuptake and is potentially neurotoxic, although this is yet to be confirmed. In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of bupropion using SH-SY5Y human catecholaminergic cells as the in vitro model. Exposure of the cells to bupropion for 24 h reduced their viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of the cells with a toxic concentration of bupropion (100 μg/mL) induced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor alpha (EIF-2α), c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) within 1 h, which later declined to baseline levels. However, bupropion failed to splice X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA. Bupropion caused mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activated caspases 9, 8, and 3 in a time-dependent manner. The reduction in cell viability was significantly inhibited by a caspase 3 inhibitor. Bupropion also induced the mRNA expression of the death receptors DR4 (TRAILR1) and DR5 (TRAILR2). However, bupropion did not increase the level of cellular oxidative stress. **Taken together, our data indicate that bupropion activates caspase 3 through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and activation of JNK, and consequently induces apoptotic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells.**

What does this mean exactly? If one were to take bupropion for over 10 years, what would happen to those cells that bupropion causes to die? Also, what exactly do SH-SY5Y cells do and can the damages that bupropion inflicts upon them be reversed? i.e. can the number of SH-SY5Y cells return to baseline after bupropion has been discontinued?

On another note, bupropion is also a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist and Wikipedia says that chronic use of antagonists causes neuronal death. Does this mean that bupropion can cause brain damage? Would the neurons that bupropion destroy be replaced if bupropion were to be discontinued?

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist)
&gt;Because antagonists often disrupt the normal connectivity between neurons, their long-term, chronic use has been linked to neuronal death and very strong antagonists can be considered to be toxic.",,False,,t5_2qob4,False,,,True,t3_puks9,http://www.reddit.com/r/psychopharmacology/comments/puks9/wellbutrin_concerns/,
