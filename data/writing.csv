1357472599.0,988,self.writing,162364,How I make myself sit down and write every single night,1108,120,168,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/162364/how_i_make_myself_sit_down_and_write_every_single/,"This is my technique for motivating myself to write. I hope it helps you. 

I've always wanted to be a writer but I haven't regularly done what writers do, that is actually sit and write something. I came up with all sorts of excuses (I've had a long day at work, I've got a headache) but they were all bullshit really. 

I was really angry with myself and I couldn't resolve this double standard in my head. If I wanted to be a writer, why couldn't I make myself actually write something? Did I like the idea of being a writer more than the actual process? Was it the rockstar lifestyle a writer leads that was drawing me in rather than the writing itself?

After a lot of thinking about it, I decided fear was the enemy; I was scared everything I wrote would be rubbish. Knowing this was the problem untangled the knot a little because I felt like I finally understood myself, but it still didn't make me write.

Then something hit me - what about my day job? I get up to go to work every single day to do a job that I don't like. I'm never late, I never miss a day and I always put in 100% effort. And that's for a job I hate! If I can put in that kind of effort for something I despise, why can't I do it for something I love? This was what finally cracked the problem for me.

So here's what I did.

I made writing my second job. 

1) I gave myself an interview, which was a sheet of A4 where I wrote why I wanted to be a writer.

2) I set myself working hours (between 21:00-23:00). These could be switched but I had to give myself advanced warning. If it got to 20:30 and I decided I didn't want to write, well that wasn't going to fly. I was going to have to show up to work anyway.

3) I paid myself. For every hour I sat in my chair I gave myself some guilt-free money from my day job wages that I could spend on whatever the hell I wanted. I started off with a £1 / hour rate, but with every five stories written I gave myself a promotion and a 50p wage increase.  Depending on how much you earn you can tailor this to suit your own income.

Since starting this in October I've increased it to £3, so I have written twenty short stories ranging from 2000-7500 words and spent over 100 hours writing. Some stories are good, some are okay and some are awful, but I'm proud of every single one, because they show that I've finally sat down and written something.

To finish, I'd encourage you to really give this a go if you're stuck for motivation. When you feel like you really don't want to sit down and write something, don't worry. It doesn't mean you aren't a writer, it just means you're scared. The more you write the easier it is to manage this feeling, even if you can never quite overcome it. Good luck everyone.

Yes, some of the oldest and most cliched writing advice in the modern world. Why? **Because it's fucking true,** that's why. And new writers ignore it all the time. When you are describing one of your characters, try to imagine whether your prose reads like ambient description of setting and action, or if it reads like [Morgan Freeman doing a voiceover.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOOoPOtckpU) If it's the latter, you have a problem. 

**Ex.** Johnny was a jackass. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Johnny walked past the table of otakus and flipped over the lunch tray at the end with a casual air. He didn't even bother looking over his shoulder as his victim stared after him with mashed potatoes in her lap. **(YES)**

* **Dialogue tags.** One of the most useful and contentious tricks of writing fiction prose, and yet very few beginning writers know how to use these properly. In almost all cases, he said/she said are the only dialogue tags that your fiction needs (if any at all - if your characters are distinct enough, you don't even have to tag dialogue). Dialogue tags are not capitalized - they are an extension of the dialogue that comes before them. If you are continuing dialogue with a break in the middle for a dialogue tag, the previous piece of dialogue should be closed off by punctuation, usually a comma. 

**Ex.** ""How could you do this to me?!"" She sobbed. **(NO)**

**Ex.** ""This is the cruelest thing you have ever done,"" she said. ""And that's saying a lot."" She turned away from him. **(YES)**

* **It's vs. its.** The former is a contraction of ""it is"", the latter is a possessive. 

**Ex.** ""**It's** a boy.""

**Ex.** ""The dog played with **its** bone.""

* **You're vs. your.** Same issue. the former is a contraction of ""you are"", the latter is a possessive.

**Ex.** ""**You're** a coldblooded bastard,"" the writer said to the editor.

**Ex.** ""Hey, don't make the changes if you don't want to. It's **your** book,"" the editor replied. 

* **Names in dialogue.** 

**Example:** 

""Billy, why you be puttin' all those names in your dialogue?"" 

""I don't know Jim, I just don't understand how natural dialogue works.""

Listen to the people speaking around you. People don't usually use the names of others while speaking to them unless they are a) very angry, or b) speaking to another person about someone. 

* **Mixed tense.** There are three major tenses used in writing: past, present, and future. Look them up, learn the difference. 

* **Mixed perspective.** There are two major perspectives utilized in writing: third person (either limited or omniscient), and first person. Second person perspective is also an option, but outside of the very select choose-your-own-adventure genre, second person perspective is generally frowned upon by many editors and is notoriously difficult to pull off. 

* **-ly ending adverbs.** The lazy writer's friend. If you feel the urge to write the following, you have not put enough emotion in the prose itself to depict these feelings: nervously, sadly, calmly, angrily, etc...

**Ex.** ""Quit using those goddamned -ly ending adverbs!"" Ronin said angrily. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Ronin held out a copy of *On Writing* as she stalked towards the fledgling writer. She brandished the book before the amateur's downward-cast eyes, admonishing him for piddling all over his work. *""No more -ly ending adverbs!""* **(YES)**

[props to ohgobwhatisthis for a much better example than I provided]

* **Exposition dumps.** This is where the writer has a shit-ton of information that they need to convey to the reader, but instead of doing it through ambient dialogue, setting, and characterization, they decide to just lump it into a paragraph. See [Basil Exposition.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJR1H5tf5wE&amp;list=PL3315B59A64D820AB&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_536151&amp;src_vid=E-PIidaqCyU)

* **Overuse of passive voice.** As opposed to active voice, which is dynamic and kickass, passive voice often comes across as boring and detaches the reader from the action at hand. Active voice is more forceful, especially when dealing with narrative action. Sometimes passive voice is necessary due to the context of the scene, but in many cases it can be eliminated for the active voice in order to bring more vibrancy to a piece of writing.  

**Ex.** The proposed initiative to limit passive voice was being bitterly opposed by some writers. **(NO)**

**Ex.** Some writers stood in bitter opposition against the initiative to limit passive voice. **(YES)**

* **Lack of conflict.** You have 2,500 words of a guy wanking internally to himself in an inner monologue that you find fascinating and the other 99% of humanity finds mind-numbingly tedious. The best source of internal conflict, which can be poignant if used well, is a strong source of external conflict.

**Ex.** Boring short story – Wife thinks about how dull her life has become. Does nothing about it, but we are forced to listen to how (internally) miserable she is. DULL. 

**Ex.** Cool short story – Wife is abused or neglected by her husband, and as a result makes the impromptu decision to take off in the night and fly to Cambodia. 

* **OVERUSE OF EXCLAMATION!!!!** No, I'm not trying to outlaw exclamation marks, or even all-caps dialogue. Both choices have their place in narrative fiction. But in many cases, an exclamation mark can be suitably removed in exchange for making the entire piece of dialogue stronger, and the all-caps YELLING dialogue can be replaced with the smoother, more stylish italics.

**Ex.** “OH MY GOD!” Christian exclaimed. “THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY FUCKING EXCLAMATION POINTS IN THIS STORY!! [LOUD NOISES!!!] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pdWAcK6Eh8)” **(NO)**

**Ex.** “Oh my God,” Christian said. “I can't believe that you can get emphasis across without exclamation  marks or all-caps dialogue. It's fucking *genius.”* **(YES)**

* **Semicolon abuse**. Somewhere, as we speak, someone is throwing in a semicolon between two sentence fragments because they think it looks cool. Just don't do it kids. Semicolons lead to indiscriminate dashes, and indiscriminate dashes lead to James Joyce. Given his notorious wordcount (or lack thereof) nobody wants that. So don't let it happen to you. Learn how to use irregular punctuation correctly. You have to master the rules before you can break them. 

* **Giving up because somebody said something mean about your writing.** Writing is a tough sport man. People always think of writers as these frilly guys (or gals) hanging out in coffee shops with their laptops and their fluffy cats, pulling awesome out of the ether. But the real truth is that writing is hard and having your work critiqued is even harder. It's like having someone tell you that your baby is ugly. Sometimes people say it with the best of intentions – sometimes people say it just to be an ass to you. The only difference between you and the mother of an ugly baby is that you actually have the chance to make your baby beautiful. So don't throw your baby in a dumpster just because someone said something mean about it that one time. Criticism happens. It's part of writing. It should never define your work.

* **Not starting at all**. Common excuses: I have too much homework, my dog ate my Macbook, it's four degrees shy of comfortable in here, I haven't finished my outline yet, I haven't finished worldbuilding yet, I'm not satisfied, I'm not ready, I can't do it. Suck it up and write. You're never going to be in perfect conditions. Your first drafts are always going to be shitty. Even Stephen King's first drafts are shitty. Just shut up and write. You can always fix it in post. 


So that's it. Keep these things in mind as you write, and your writing should improve in leaps and bounds.

&gt;I guarantee you that no modern story scheme, even plotlessness, will give a reader genuine satisfaction, unless one of those old-fashioned plots is smuggled in somewhere. I don't praise plots as accurate representations of life, but as ways to keep readers reading. When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell the students to make their characters want something right away—even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn't get it out all day long. I thought that was wonderful. The story dealt with issues a lot more important than dental floss, but what kept readers going was anxiety about when the dental floss would finally be removed. Nobody could read that story without fishing around in his mouth with a finger.

For me, this is the money quote: *""I don't praise plots as accurate representations of life, but as ways to keep readers reading.""* You can find the full interview at [*The Paris Review*](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3605/the-art-of-fiction-no-64-kurt-vonnegut).",,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,,,True,t3_19ww7z,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/19ww7z/kurt_vonnegut_on_the_importance_of_plot/,

We all know writing, like everything worth something in life, takes work. It isn't some mystical thing and while some are more naturally talented than others, nothing can take its place. Talent will get you far, but ambition will get you further! 

I decided to make this post as a one stop shop of sorts for people looking to better themselves and their writing. You may not be aware of it, but there are a lot of **free** resources online to help you. This is a self post and as such I get no link karma, I am just hoping to help people help themselves. This list is no where near as extensive as it could be, so please feel free to add what you can in the comments. It's in no real particular order and covers many different types and aspects of writing and language in general (Linguistics anyone? \^\^). Many of these came from reading various blogs on the internet. I was specifically trying to cut that blogspam out and link to the actual source material. Perhaps this could be added to the eventual FAQ for the sub?

Firstly I'd like to promote [The University of Reddit](http://ureddit.com/). It's a redditor spawned and run university with many different courses taught by, you guessed it, redditors! Go check them out! 

Secondly, Brandon Sanderson puts out an excellent podcast called [Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/) (There is a ton in the archives!) as well as some awesome lectures on youtube. You can find reddit posts linking to them [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/rkbct/sandersons_writing_fiction_class/) and [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/mori4/brandon_sandersons_lectures_in_fantasy_writing/) You should really check them out as well.

Still though, I'm thrilled that my name will be attached to a published work long after I'm gone, and that's enough reason to celebrate.

I just want to thank all of those who have answered my stupid and stupider questions over the past few months as I was getting started. This is only the first step! 

Thanks guys! 

**EDIT: Wow! Thanks for all the support! I guess spending so long on this subreddit makes you forget about how the smaller stuff like this is still a big deal in its own way! 

I didn't want to get too pluggy, but many people asked about where and how it got published. My short story is called ""Morrigan the Black"", available through [eFiction](http://www.efictionmag.com/efantasy/). Third story on the December issue. 

There was a post here for a call for submissions for Dark Fantasy just before Halloween. I had the idea of a novel sloshing around in my head, so I thought this would be a good chance to pick out a potential scene and turn it into a short story. I just opened a new document, and bashed out the story, and... well that was it!

I haven't worked on an elevator pitch for this... but Morrigan the Black tells the story of a young mage fleeing the wrath of an angry village mob, intent on lynching her uncle Yarlaith as a heathen and sorcerer of forbidden dark arts.

1338149021.0,397,self.writing,u7nit,The first rule of Write Club. [xpost from r/shutupandwrite],452,55,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/u7nit/the_first_rule_of_write_club_xpost_from/,"This week the writer's block is back. Like most writers, I have a desk. It has a snake-neck lamp, unplugged and never lit. It has a wireless printer still in the box. It has a pack of unopened printer paper, never used. It has a warm forgotten beer, never opened.

I would take a picture of these things, but none of them has anything to do with writing. They are the physical manifestation of everything that writing is not. I have never written at this desk, it is not my place for that. But I have written many things.

**The first rule of Write Club is that no one gives a shit about your desk.** Your desk has nothing to do with your writing. Hemingway wrote in cafes. Stephen King started out at a child's desk that he could barely fit his gangly knees under. Grisham wrote on the subway on steno pads. Chee writes on trains in sleeper cars. Capote wrote in bed. Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote on the top of a refrigerator. 

Try finding pictures of this. With the exception of Capote (that flamboyant bastard) you won't. That's because these people were too busy writing to have their pictures taken. 

**The second rule of Write Club is that you don't spend more time talking about writing than you spend writing.** Of course writers are going to talk about writing, it's inevitable. It's such a lonely job, we are all just solitary creatures of expression howling for some form of validation. But every minute you spend talking about writing is a minute you are spending not writing. And some day - maybe today, maybe one day soon, maybe years from now - you are going to die.  So now is the moment you ask: do you want to be remembered as someone who talked about his unfinished novel a lot, or do you want to be remembered as a writer?

**The third rule of Write Club is that if you stop, go limp, tap out, and/or give up, based on criticism or laziness or the general inability to effectively manage your lifespan, the writing is over.** You can call yourself a writer if you sit around talking about notes and outlines and drinking and reading and musing, but writers do one thing: write. All the time. Short stories. Screenplays. Blogs. Articles. Stageplays. Novels. Writing prompts. Novellas. Books. No matter how shitty your writing is, if you are writing, then you are a writer. If you are not writing, then you are not. 

**The fourth rule of Write Club is that there are only two guys to a story: you against yourself.**

**The fifth rule of Write Club: one story at a time.** Finish it, beat it into submission or have your ass kicked by it, but do not start another story until your story is done. 

**Sixth rule of Write Club: Your tools don't matter.** Pens, pencils, typewriters, cats, writing books, influential novels, highlighters, napkins, index cards, binders, notebooks, Macbooks, laptops, desktops, iPads, iPhones, none of it is worth a flying blue fuck if you're not actively writing on it. 

**Seventh rule: Submissions will go on as long as they have to.** You can work on something for three hours or three years. But do not stop until you are finished with it, do not stop revising it until it is done, and do not stop sending it out (revised) until it is published. See the Fifth rule. 

**Eighth rule of Write Club** - If this is your first night at Write Club, you *have* to write.

Well, I'd like to experiment with this idea and see what you all think. Now, I am not saying to actually write the complete novel in one sitting, but in a way I also am. Let me show you what the writing process would look like, so you can see what I mean.

-Sit down and write chapter by chapter the book as fast as you can. You must write it in one sitting, so the book won't be very long. Maybe 20 pages, each chapter being about a page long. 

-Rest for two days. two hours. doesn't matter, just rest. 

-Next time you write, add to each of the chapters that you wrote. You could add a scene to each one. Try to draw out the things that don't make sense. Choose the part of the chapter you want to show more closely.

-Repeat as many times as you want, but you would basically have a novel ""finished"" although it is a short one from the beginning. 

-Eventually it will be too tiresome to go through the whole thing for too long, but by that point you'll be ready to add scenes that fill the gaps and make it (more) complete or delete scenes that don't do anything for the story.

Everyone always says that just finishing a draft is the most important part... Well, what if we could get it done in a day?

I'm not expecting this to be a groundbreaking post, but I would like anyone who'd like to discuss feel free. It might very well be the dumbest idea... But, well it might be just a little dumb. Have you tried anything similar?

You can read a flawed sentence 100 times without ever noticing that an article is missing or a preposition has snuck in where it doesn't belong. You know what the sentence is supposed to be, so you don't see what the sentence *actually is.*


Here's my technique for catching this stuff: make your computer read it to you aloud. While a human reader naturally leaps ahead to what you meant to say, a computer will only see what you actually wrote. And when you're listening, you hear typos quite clearly that are invisible to you on the page.


I also find that the dorky computer voice takes away all the intonation that exists in my head. This helps me to tell whether a sentence carries as much emotional weight as I think it does. When it's still a good sentence in the soulless robot-voice, I know I'm sitting on gold.

* How a character got there. Selective Omission of Detail is your friend, your reader isn't going to care what transpired from one scene to another, or even how much time passed. You can just start it up. I call this the ""blocking trap."" Somebody walks through the door, across the room and says, ""hey."" Leave it out. Scant exposition can be helpful, start in the middle of a scene, aka *in media res*.

* Names, histories, and descriptions of people's appearance. Not always crucial. Not everybody has to have a haircut. Also, not everybody needs a name, they can remain ""the pigeon guy"" for the duration of their 1-page appearance. Conversely, they can be ""Bruce."" Conversely again, they can have elaborate histories told in summary condensed. Look at *Catch-22* for innumerable incidental characters with carefully crafted histories that make their backstory serve as story-story.

* Adverbs. Yes, you've heard this before, but people can just say things, they don't have to do so ""flatly"" or ""tentatively"", especially if it is apparent by the language itself, you know? Also, I try to leave out any dialog tags whenever I can get away with it and it is apparent who is speaking.

* No need for instant subtext. I've learned not to be afraid of ""on the nose"" writing for early drafts, you can have characters waving their arms around and shouting ""THIS IS WHAT I AM THINKING RIGHT NOW."" When you revise you will know (and not need to remember) at least one thing--what they are thinking right now.

* Omission of Character Growth. We didn't have to see Wesley being trained by the Dread Pirate Roberts to understand how he got good at fencing. We simply had to understand he spent a number of years on a pirate ship being mentored (I'm speaking of the film, not the book, *Princess Bride*). Similar to selective omission of detail, but on a larger scale.

* Telling vs. Showing. Deciding to just ""tell it out"" instead of dramatizing in scene can actually be an effective tool. Vonnegut would talk about things Kilgore Trout wrote that would be next-to-impossible to *actually write out* because they are so outlandish. Instead, the *notion* of the event is plenty to drive the point home. You also get good use of this in *A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,* told anecdotes that are themselves self-contradictory enigmas.

It seems that many people in this subreddit as well organizations such as NaNoWriMo are encouraging this and I am not sure why.  As a composer, this confounds me and I would like to know how you feel about it. ",412,85,300,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15xahd/i_have_noticed_that_many_beginning_writers_are/,"I'll preface this by saying I often draw parallels to music because I have been a musician for my entire life. I have only been a writer for a short period of time. 

No composition teacher would recommend that a beginning composer write a symphony. The idea is laughable to say the least. A symphony is something that is considered almost sacred, the level of craftsmanship, talent, dedication, and discipline required to write one—let alone one of any merit—is unprecedented. A beginning composer first works on technical exercises and then writes short pieces with limited instrumentation. Over time, as their craftsmanship and personal voice develop, they begin composing more technically impressive and expansive works. Why is it not the same for writing? 

Why are writers encouraged to set themselves up for disappointment by beginning their journeys with a novel they will most likely not complete—or will most likely be of poor quality? Flash fiction, letters, writing prompts, short stories, why are these not the tools of a developing writer?  Sure, you can artificially complete a large scale work by forcing yourself to write an absurd amount of words everyday. But if those words are riddled with redundant and idiotic prose, why bother? This is frustrating because these authors then feel the need to flood the market with their first effort, obscuring the visibility of accomplished writers using the same means. The ease of self publishing necessitates self control from the writers. 

A story no matter how original, is only interesting if it is told in an interesting way. Why is there a focus on quantity over quality in the world of writers? This is certainly not true for painters or composers, it is only writers who encourage their beginners to start with the most expansive of all forms. I would not be surprised to see a young novelist's narrative voice change from the beginning to the end of a book, it happens in composition quite often. I would also not be surprised if they never finished it at all. I have done some research and have found that many of my favorite authors began as journalist and short story writers. This did not surprise me at all. Why then isn't this the norm? 

In conclusion I feel that seeing an idea from its conception to its completion is very important for a young artist, and that novels are not a practical way of meeting doing this. I also do not feel that daily word counts should be emphasized. I instead feel that emphasis should be placed on the quality of the prose and time spent working. Thank you for enduring my rant.

Wow.,376,53,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1fpz1e/i_sat_down_to_write_last_night_for_the_first_time/,"I'm in my early thirties, and I have not attempted to write a book in about ten years. However, I started to get the 'itch' again a few months ago. So I bought a small notepad to carry around, and wrote down ideas as inspiration took me throughout the day. But last night was the first night I actually attempted to construct a narrative.

What a difference 10 years can make!

I feel as though young me was trying to direct mannequins on a stage. My characters and plots were more copies of other things I had read than they were my personal creations. They were hollow, and how they would/should feel in any situation was alien to me. But now they are as familiar friends.  The process is more real to me now--more achievable. My genre is fantasy, but the goal of finishing the book no longer feels like fantasy, but instead is very real.

What has changed? It will sound cliche, but in the past ten years I have learned to love, learned to cry, and learned to laugh. And more importantly, (because I am a writer), I have learned why these emotions define your humanity.

In this time I have lived in four different states, spent time immersed in other cultures two continents away. I have made friends, lost contact with them, moved, and made new friends--and then discovered the joy of contacting old friends again. People close to me have died. I have seen a new generation being born in nieces and nephews.

I have made good decisions, (and more importantly as a writer) I have made *bad* decisions. I have watched others make the same choices, and asked them why they chose what they did.

I have watched. I have observed. They sound like passive actions, but they are not! To watch one must actively choose to travel to new environments and expose yourself to what you do not know.  To truly observe you must become comfortable enough in that environment to ask questions of people, and listen to their answers--because until you do your observations will be one-sided and unconfirmed.

Thus if you are young and frustrated because you want to be a writer, but you seem unable to write, I made this post to offer you some advice:

Do not be discouraged! I would argue you will learn more about humanity (and thus be better able to write about it, and write *for* it) in the third decade of your life than you did in the first two. Writing takes practice, but knowing what you're writing about takes exposure.

So don't stress if you cannot write. Go out and immerse yourself in humanity! Put yourself in new places, and new situations, and observe this process we call the human condition.

I'll get to the $198,000 in just a second.

Have you ever considered helping a local charity by writing grant applications for them? If not, I hope you will, because donating grantwriting services is a wonderful way to meet good people and help your community while building your craft.  In my experience nonprofits are DESPERATE for grantwriting services.

OK, here's the part about today's payday.  I live way out in the sticks, in a rural southern county of about 15,000 people, and as a sideline to my freelance and self-publishing work I write grant applications for free for local nonprofits and government agencies.  In the five years I've been doing this I've helped these organizations get over $750,000 in funding, including $350,000 worth of personal protective gear for our local volunteer fire department through FEMA's ""Assistance to Firefighters Grant"" program, a $210,000 fire engine through the same program, two Dodge Chargers for the Sheriff's office through our state highway department (not to militarize them, but to replace cruisers that were fully depreciated and legitimately unsafe), and various smaller government and corporate grants for other groups.

And then this afternoon my phone rang and it was my state's US senator's office calling to tell me that FEMA was going to award the fire department I work with another $198,000 for a new tanker truck on an application I wrote…a tanker they badly need because only about 15% of our county has hydrant service.  

I can't even tell you how happy I am right now.

And look: this is totally something you can do. Grantwriting is basic storytelling -- your character has a compelling need and you're trying to present it in the way your audience wants to hear it.  ""Here's what's wrong; here's how you could help us make it right.""

I mentioned donating your services, but here's a thought.  No, you won't get paid in cash for the services you donate, but once you have a few successes under your belt you can market your services outside your immediate area -- services for which you WILL get paid.  

You'll also get certain intangible benefits from helping out locally.  For instance, my state issues special EMS license plates, and as an honorary member of the fire department, I get one.  It generates an impenetrable web of mojo that's proof against all speeding tickets.  And think about your fire department: these are the people who are going to come and pull you out of your burning bed.  Wouldn't it be nice if they'd hurry just a little more, en route?  And what about those kids at the Boys &amp; Girls club who'll have a clean, safe place to hang out in, in part because you pried some money out of Wal-Mart?

I started writing a fantasy novel in 2009. The reasons aren't as important as the lessons learned along the way, which were many, and hard-won. I wanted to share them with the community here, in case they helped someone else who may be struggling at one or more of the same phases of their first work.


Here we go! 



They say you should write every day. I didn't. I couldn't; Two kids and full time job. So I did what I could: four hours every weekend. That's it. I finished two drafts this way, so don't beat yourself up about time. Do what you can.

I sometimes spent my entire four hours mulling over the story, without writing a single word. So don't measure your progress in word count. Do what feels right.

I went to the same Starbucks for every session, sat in the same place, and drank the same drink (Grande Peppermint Mocha). Before long, my brain was in writer mode before I got out of the car. The location itself doesn't matter, but consistency can be a huge help.

I listened to film scores while writing. Loudly. I imagine visually, and this helped me. If you do better with silence, then write to silence. No way is right for everyone.

I used a full-screen word processor (Bean, then WriteRoom for mac). A zen workspace is conducive to production. But maybe you thrive in chaos. Try one, and stick with what works.

My novel started as a single flash, the tiniest fracture of a scene. Sometimes big things DO have small beginnings, Michael Fassbender. You don't need a chapter-long starting point in your head.

I had no outline when I began. I developed it as I went along. I bought a blank book and filled it with sketches, notes and diagrams. It's nearly full now. Helped immensely.

They say you need to be widely read or an avid reader in order to write. I am neither. I cannot finish most books, because they fail to hold my interest. This is not to say I don't read at all, but I prefer the movies to most books. This does not hinder my ability to write prose or develop novel structure and pacing. Don't beat yourself up about your reading.

Here are some ""rules"" I came to adhere to:

1. Rule of Threes: Simply put, throw out your first two concepts at least, if not the first three or four. Not the concept for the book, but for names, places, events, plot points, etc. Most early ideas suck. This goes well with rule #2. 

2. Murder Your Darlings: A famous rule. My novel greatly improved with the removal of certain characters, events, and things I truly loved.

3. Garbage in/Garbage out: I am convinced now that the best ideas for every level of story come from the subconscious; this devilish, deep and completely uncontrollable source of imagination. I found I could harness it by feeding it massive amounts of story (movies, books, audio, whatever), and it would produce more good ideas at a higher rate, according to how much I fed it. For instance, I went to the theater three times on Thursday, and watched a movie in between at home, read a few chapters of a novel before bed, etc.

4. The three-hundredth time is the charm: Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite. I say I am on my third draft, but the reality is that some chapters are on their THIRTIETH. Some on only their second or third. Take as much time as it takes to get it right, and don't stress that it's not right yet, which leads to my next rule:

5. It's not done until it's done: Every time I would become discouraged with the story (which was about every other day), I would remind myself: ""It's not done yet."" Reserve judgement for the published book. Until then, shut your pie-hole and rewrite.

Some other insights, which I struggle to categorize:

- Power through the first draft, leaving an incoherent mess in your wake.

The hardest thing I had to learn to do was stop going back to edit as I went. Here's the thing though: it's more important to finish. If you finish your first draft, you will have accomplished more than 90% of aspiring authors just by doing so. My first draft made ZERO sense. Character names changed halfway through, the plot randomly switched, and no one else could have made sense of it. All because I refused to go back and change anything, so I would make a change to the story and keep on truckin'! But I finished.

- Exercise your creative hemisphere.

I found that I could blast writer's block by changing my approach to the story. For instance, to help me develop my main character, who was flat, I mentally treated him as a supporting character for a while, which freed me to create more overt and wild personality elements, which made him far more interesting. I did the same with supporting characters, treating them as if they were the protagonist. This allowed me to explore their motivations and perspectives.

When the plot dried up, instead of considering an event to move things along, I would diagram each character's beat-by-beat arc through the story, in parallel. This often resulted in me realizing that character ""B"" was at a point where they would do ""X"", which moved everyone else along too. This also helped me to see some characters who needed to be taken out, or sometimes added.

- Stop attending workshops, reading writing magazines, and perusing agents.

These things, while well-meaning, distract and derail you from writing the actual story, which all you should be focused on. Leave all that for the finish line.

Finally, the single most important lesson I've learned can be summed up in two words:


                                  Don't. Stop.

Even if the novel never sells, the next one may. Or the next. The key is not giving yourself one go at it, and determining your fate from a single work. The goal is developing a lifestyle of story-crafting, and a love for the craft of writing. To look forward to the work, not the results.

Blue Xs are 500+ words a day.

Sad Faces are 0 words to less than 500.

And complete, my novel's first draft has 71000 words.

The series was written as six books, but Orbit combined two in each volume.

I've published in just about every way that you can. Originally I released The Crown Conspiracy through a small press (Aspirations Media Inc), and later self-published when they didn't have money to print the second book. When my sales hit 2,000 a month, I decided to try for a traditional contract and was picked up in just seventeen days.  My self-publsihing sales eventually grew to just under 12,000 books a month, and I sold 70,000 from April 2010 - August 2011. I'm also selling internationally (eleven languages so far) including Czech, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch, and Turkish.  I also have a few subsisary rights sold for audio and bookclub versions.

Between my self-publishing income, US advance, and foreign sales, I've made enough to not only become a fulltime writer, but my wife (who had supported me for years) was able to quit her job  a year ago and she now helps me with editing and marketing.  Between the two of us we keep pretty up to date on the changes in the publishing industry, and I know about what to look out for in ""standard contracts"" offered by big-six publishers.

Those are all Russian-sounding names, and those are all real names, but then plausibility shatters. There was not a single child named Evsey from 1960s. Likewise, no one names their child Mikal, in Russia we have Mikhail, which is derived from the same source, and while Dimitra is used as a devotional name in women monasteries, it isn't used in secular world at all.

**TL;DR**: if you want to add a little bit of plausibility to your Russian characters, hit me up.

Here's how it went down.",348,58,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1fnfem/i_set_out_to_write_edit_and_publish_a_book_in/,"**TL;DR**: I set out to write, edit, and publish a book in three months. Instead, it took me 90 days. Editing is hard. Marketing is harder.

In April of 2012 I decided I would try to write a book in 3 months. I knew it was ambitious but I wanted to do it that way because I knew from experience that I lose interest in every project after a few months. In fact, I have a few half written drafts lying around the house and this time around I didn’t want my effort to end up in that pile. So, I did what a lot of people recommend - don’t edit while you write. My plan was to write for 2 months at ~1000/day, and edit/format in the next month. It didn’t quite turn out that way, obviously, since it is June of 2013, but about 300 days after I said I would finish, I’m finally done. I actually took only about 3 months to do all of it, it just wasn’t in one continuous span. But, I kept track of a number of stats while I wrote and hopefully my experience will be useful or inspirational to someone else on Reddit. 

**The Plug**

The book is called [The Natural Victim](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D1CPHF2). It is a classic mystery in the same vein as Agatha Christie and Margaret Allingham. It is set in the late 90s on the Ohio State Campus. You can read the blurb and get it from Amazon. It’s free till Friday (June 7th, 2013).


**The pretty pictures**
 
[Number of words over time](http://i.imgur.com/m3PdeWY.png) - You see where my first draft ends (after that steep climb), and then the slow increase till about the fourth edit when the word count starts to slowly decline again. This may vary for you. Many people write a lot and then cut. I found myself not writing enough and having to add stuff.

[Change in length over time](http://i.imgur.com/8E0hWa8.png) - During my first draft, I was consistently writing 1000 words/day and then it dropped when editing started. The bump in the middle was during my third edit (fourth draft) I believe, when I realized I really needed to have more words when setting a scene instead of jumping in immediately.

[Breakdown of time spent by draft](http://i.imgur.com/bnuDjZT.png) - The single largest chunk of time was spent on the first draft. But when compared to overall time spent, that first draft only took about 37% of the total time I spent on the book.


**Writing**

My goal was to write ~1000/day for 60 days. I hit the words/day goal pretty consistently as you can see from the figures, but I ended up writing only for 30 days. I found that I hadn’t planned out my story all that well. The plot was good but it didn’t have enough meat on it to make it to 60,000 words. I took that as a sign that it was time to start editing and after taking a break of a week or two from the end of the first draft, I went back to it. 

**Editing**

It took me six edits (two of them are consolidated in the pie chart) to get everything done and that’s not including the two edits from my editor. I could probably do with 5 next time and spread it out the following way - 

1st edit (second draft): General readthrough identifying any major loopholes and or problem areas. The editing consisted of moving large parts of the story around (like moving an entire chapter to the front of the book because I didn’t want to surprise the reader with crucial parts of the story late in the narrative). I also corrected anything easy that caught my eye like typos but I wasn’t looking for those.

2nd edit (third draft): Scene by scene. I focused on the scenes especially the dialogue keeping in mind the following - Does it sound natural or contrived? Does the dialogue fit the character? And does everyone in the scene get to say something (otherwise ask yourself if they need to be there?)

3rd edit (fourth draft): Line by line. Fix things big and small along the way. I think the hardest part was taking out flowery over-the-top sentences that made me sound like Marquez in my head. 

Editor interlude

4th edit (fifth draft): Taking my editor’s comments into account.

Another Editor interlude. This time with emphasis on the proofreading aspect. At this point you don’t want to start making major changes to your book unless you find something seriously wrong.

5th edit: Final proofread.

**Formatting for the Kindle**

Formatting is not overly complicated IF you find the right guide for your combination of tools. I wrote my document on a variety of editors - started with Word, moved to Emacs Org mode, and then to Google Docs when it came to send it to the Editor. For the formatting, I moved everything back to Word, and followed one of the tutorials online on how to get it together. It took a couple of days but it isn’t hard if you are computer savvy. The hardest part is finding the right set of instructions since there have been minor changes to the format over time.

**Marketing**

Author and Redditor /u/MichealJSullivan had an excellent post a while back on [Dos and Don'ts for getting reviews for your book](http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1aqkjq/dos_and_donts_or_getting_reviews_for_your_book/), and getting reviews is most of that marketing battle. I haven’t followed any of it yet, but you should since he is a published author and he knows what he is talking about. Remember to start marketing 2 or 3 months before you book is due to be released because most bloggers/review sites have their schedules full and trying to line up a few guest posts late in the game is not going to happen. I’m regretting not doing this earlier but I’ll keep it mind for my next book.

**Lessons Learned**

* Editing takes time. I can’t believe I thought I could get away with 1/3rd of the time for editing. 2/3rd is a better estimate. I know writers, blogs and posters say this all the time but I’ll repeat it again - editing takes time. If you had asked me before I started, I would never have guessed it would take me 5+ rounds of edits and a couple of proofreading sessions (and that’s in addition to a couple of editing passes by my editor).
* Writing and editing are the two biggest parts of the book but there are other things to do as well - Finding a cover or a designer, finding an editor, figuring out formatting stuff all take some time. Thankfully, you only have to muck through this once or twice before you can settle on a good combination. But that first time around it can get frustrating when all you want to do is to get the damn book done!
* Fillers, segues, and transitions - One of the hardest parts of the book was all the little bits that connect the various scenes in the narratives together. You know that part between when the people stop talking and book shifts to the new scene. After my first draft, I found I had repeated some variation of “After they said their goodbyes, the walked over to &lt;insert next location&gt;,” every single time. My best advice is to get a few good books in your genre and see how the authors do it.

That’s all folks. I hope this is useful to someone. I have been blogging about writing the book on my [website](http://writebywriting.wordpress.com) and I will be updating it with how it does in Amazon.

It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.”

I just wanted to share my experience with this, especially if anyone is on the fence like I was about hand-editing their novel.

Over the weekend, I decided to print out my work-in-progress, [get a red pen, and go to town on it.](http://i.imgur.com/d3QZ62f.png) 

I've probably accomplished more this one weekend than I have in the last month or two. It allows me to really *read* it like it's a book, make annotations, and see things from a different point of view. I can write all my notes in the margins (as shown in the above pic), make notes when I think something needs more exposition, cross out words, and so forth.

At first I was pretty skeptical about this. I figured, hey, I have track changes in MS Word, which does *basically* the same thing, right?

But I was completely wrong. This has been arguably the best thing I've done since I started writing. I can flip through pages, make any note to myself, and really *see* the novel as a whole, and see how it works. I've even written down ideas of how to move it along in places it stagnates, and how to pace it out better in areas that need more ""fleshing out.""

It's also been helpful for seeing words I would normally gloss over in a Word document. I see redundancies, wrong tenses, and typos that Word doesn't catch. (say, using ""forces"" instead of ""forced."") I've also seen how often I'll repeat certain words and phrases (shrugged, nodded, sighed, etc).

Anyway, does anyone else have a similar experience? This has been so immensely helpful that I wanted to tell other people, haha.

Writing is a business like painting is a business. Sure, you can listen to someone who's sold paintings, and they can tell you what you should paint and what colors you should use to sell more paintings or to get into the most prestigious galleries, but you're missing the point if that's what you're after.

Writing is first and foremost an expression of creativity. Sure, it would be great to make money writing stories, and all of us want that, but it's not going to happen if you listen to these assholes and sacrifice your voice. There are a lot of extremely successful writers out there who would get universally panned by the ""experts"" on this board. 

Here's your number one rules, tip, guide, whatever you want to call it:

Don't listen to anyone. Write what you want, and what you love. When you do decide to share your writing with r/writing take their advice with a grain of salt, and don't make getting published your goal (and don't offer that kind of advice), your goal should be to write an amazing story that's every bit as good as you know you are. 

Remember that you started writing because you know you can spot good writing, and maybe you can't write on that level yet, and it can be frustrating, but you have good taste and that's all you need. If you can spot good writing and then look at your own and say, ""well, I know what's good and this isn't it, what's wrong with me?"" The answer's that there's nothing wrong with you. It will come to you, just keep practicing, writing, and doing what you love. Once you look at your writing and you know it's good - because you have good taste - then you'll be able to get published. Don't skip steps by reading ""how to get published"" tips and tutorials, or listening to these guys tell you that your voice or style are all wrong; it won't work. Write until you know what you're writing is good, and always be honest to your own writing style. Just keep practicing and it will come, and you'll be a great writer.

**Edit**: I know that writing is a form of communication, but story telling, especially fiction is an art. I majored in English, so I realize how difficult language becomes when the professor goes out of their way to use inaccessible vocabulary - effectively defeating the purpose. To me writing is a process where you translate your imagination into language, language into words, and then a reader takes those words, converts them to language, and then translates them into their own imagination. It's a wondrous and daunting process, and it's an art.

Got most of my publicity advice from r/writing (thank you!), so I made a list of what might've helped me so far.",306,56,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1cy1mp/my_ebook_hit_1550_downloads_in_its_first_week_got/,"Hey, r/writing – just wanted to share a comprehensive list of the things that helped me get to 1550 (including the advice I got from Reddit). I’m nowhere near a bestseller, but I’d love to share what I can. If you have any questions about any of the strategies, I’d be happy to answer!
 
For my e-book, [Red](http://www.redthenovel.com) is an energy-enhanced otherworld and follows a little girl whose mother was executed by the systematic society she lives in.  The novel is her fight to break down that system and seek revenge on her mother’s killer. Currently, I have a few reviews, but readers seem more open to *experimental* scifi/fantasy than I'd previously thought. Red hit #1 in Hot New Releases in its genre at its peak. [Proof: http://i.imgur.com/CES0PIY.png?1]
 
So – here we go:
 
1.         Short Stories – Write a short story that gives people a taste of the world you created. (Might be fantasy based, but I think it's good advice to let everyone sample your world before asking them to dive in).
2.     Specific Category – Make sure you choose 2 categories that are absolutely relevant. A good tip would be to act like a reader and see if you would stumble upon your own book by manually going to Amazon, clicking on Kindle ebooks, and then relevant genres.
3.        Comics – Create a one-page comic of your novel. This appeals to visual crowds and feeds like Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest where it’s easy to share and gives people a visual taste of your work.
4.        Facebook Page – Pretty basic, but I use this as a personal home page for all other sites.
5.        Newsletter – Emails accrued from your blog made into weekly newsletters.
6.        SF Signal and SmartGirlsScifi – Guest posts lead to tweets and RT’s.
7.        KDP Select – Prime members download for free, also authors in KDP seem to be promoted more.
8.        Free Downloads – 24-hour period boosted ranking.
9.       YouTube Collabs – (With singers that have a relevant following. Not much of a point in collaborating with people whose audience would hate your book's genre).
10.       YouTube Videos – Pranks and commercials for fun and to give the world a sense of a more playful side. Also, always hoping for a viral video.
11.       Twitter – #Constant updates and #hashtagging brought in #sales.
12.       Google Hangout – Invited early readers to talk about ideas for the sequel.
13.       Goodreads – Connected to my Twitter and gave me 1K followers in a day.
14.       Reddit – R/writing for advice and psychological support (haha).
15.       LinkedIn – Posted in relevant boards.
16.       Create a Game – Brought my book to life with a game called Red War (700+ registered).
17.       Wattpad – Not a noticeable return yet, but definitely staying with it.
18.       Sneak Peeks – Downloadable and free on Amazon/Smashwords.
19.       Book Cover – Didn’t come cheap but I made sure I liked it 500%.
20.       Advance Copies – Specifically to bloggers to spread the word.
21.       Friends &amp; Family Emails – Excited word-of-mouth was a huge boost.
 
 
* Would also love any additional ideas for spreading the word!

What is inspiration? No one seems to know. But they do know what inspiration does. Inspiration makes you jot down ideas on napkins. Inspiration wakes you up at 3am and forces your hands on the keyboard. Inspiration makes you crazy, makes you work, makes you, somehow, into a writer.

The problem with inspiration is that it's a good story, and worse, a good story told to people who are predisposed to love a good story. There's something romantic, dramatic, *sexy* about pounding out a novella fueled only by caffeine and determination through endless sleep-deprived nights. There's hardly anything interesting at all about constructing a novel slowly, over the course of weeks, months, even years, and having small, quiet realizations about characters or scenes or the right place to put a word.

Inspiration is a story we want to come true, a story that we want to happen to us. And like any good story, it is, ultimately, fake.

For a while I've been wondering why Hemingway's quote, ""write drunk, edit sober"" has achieved the godlike status it has in so many writing communities. Today, I finally made the connection: like anything else, ""writing drunk"" is appealing because it invites us to change our mental state into something different.

And changing our mental state is where, according to legend, *inspiration* will happen.

It's a myth that won't die, helped along every time a well-known creative person admits to somehow altering their mental state, even if that alteration is completely unrelated to what they produce. We go through our daily lives, waiting for Inspiration to strike us at any moment, and eventually we have the realization that we're Doing It Wrong; inspiration doesn't lie in the mind of the sober! We must get drunk, get high, go 48 hours without sleeping, or some other quasi-religious ritual to get in touch with our inner creative self.

The reason for this, best I can tell, is that *we* don't want to be writers. We want some heretofore undiscovered part of ourselves, our Inner Writer, our Muse, our Creative Spirit, to be a writer, and for the rest of our conscious mind to reap the rewards.

And even if that were possible, would it be satisfying to know that some part of yourself that you don't associate with the rest of your identity is responsible for your success? Or maybe you're not happy with that identity, and you're hoping that some new part of yourself that's ""always been there"" is just going to pop out and take over. Good luck with that.

The point is, this kind of bullshit is mentally blocking. It makes us do stupid things, think stupid things. I'm a massive skeptic about writing and the creative process and even I've stayed up late with a blank Word document somehow expecting something to happen because I'm overtired, or buzzed, or what have you.

What's worse about this is that inspiration isn't fake, but in hoping that it will somehow leap to the forefront of our minds and take the wheel, we miss out on it. You have to actually *start* something for inspiration to happen. Inspiration is that moment when your mind recombines two or more ideas in a unique and meaningful way, and that can only happen if you are *already thinking*. And yes, you may think better during a certain time of day, or with certain music playing, or in a specific place, or whatever. But the point is that you aren't just sitting there waiting to be inspired during those times; you are already puzzling your way towards an idea when creativity happens.

The point is, *you* want to be a writer. Not some magical Idea Fairy that lives in your head, *you*. So start acting like it, and stop acting like there's some writerly part of you that needs unlocking first. Because while that may be a good story, I think actually managing to achieve your dreams, even if it's through things as humdrum as hard work and practice, is much more narratively satisfying.

But there are also at least as many reasons I won’t.

(For example: He had nothing in the way of a like God-concept, and at that point maybe even less than nothing in terms of interest in the whole thing; he treated prayer like setting an over-temp according to a box’s direction. Thinking of it as talking to the ceiling was somehow preferable to imagining talking to Nothing. And he found it embarrassing to get down on his knees in his underwear, and like the other guys in the room he always pretended his sneakers were like way under the bed and he had to stay down there a while to find them and get them out, when he prayed, but he did it. — David Foster Wallace, *Infinite Jest*)

Here, then, in no particular order, are five reasons I will:

**1. You can sustain a long sentence**

I like long sentences that sing. I always have. It’s become cliche these days to talk about “simplicity in writing” and “clarity is king” and so forth — and it’s incontestably true that clarity is the principle thing: you must make yourself understood. But in delicate hands, long sentences are the opposite of unclear: they are the very acme of clarity. Here’s an example:

“If it made any real sense — and it doesn’t even begin to — I think I might be inclined to dedicate this account, for whatever it’s worth, especially if it’s the least bit ribald in parts, to the memory of my late, ribald stepfather, Robert Agadganian, Jr.” — J.D. Salinger, *De Daumier Smith’s Blue Period*

A writer who can sustain a long sentence is a writer who thinks clearly.

**2. You’ve given me something to fret over**

You’ve established a series of obstacles that in reason interest readers, and you’ve doled that information out gradually, feeding it to readers step-by-step, in a way that keeps us hungry for more. The obstacles your characters encounter are not inconsequential or meaningless obstacles — i.e. your lead character’s biggest conflict is not what color she should paint her nails — but you’ve instead asked yourself: are my characters’ values important enough for readers to fret over?

**3. Your plot shows your inexhaustible imagination**

Plot — true plot — is difficult. It’s plausible but unpredictable. It presents a sequence of events that progresses logically and builds toward a climax. Note that: your plot should build. It can build slowly, as in Anna Kerenina, or quickly, as in Raiders of the Lost Ark. This means, among other things, that your plot culminates in a climax. Climax is the point at which your plot brings together all the major elements of your story and then explodes. Good plots are not action alone. They are an integration of action and ideas. Good plots do not just raise questions. They raise questions and answer them, which in turn raises more questions which are in turn answered, and so on. That is partially what I mean when I say that plot is “a sequence of events that progresses logically yet unpredictably.” Good plots, through a process of satisfying your curiosity and then piquing it more, keep you wondering. They hook you and reel you in. “Good plots stem from characters under adversity,” wrote Crawford Killian.

**4. Your story is about something**

This means you’ve woven meaning into your story. (This, incidentally, is one of the many links between literature and [philosophy](http://journalpulp.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/what-is-philosophy/).) That meaning can be purely historical, like *Gone With the Wind,* or it can be abstract, like *Bladerunner.* It can be a basic love story with a road plot, like *Wild at Heart,* or a love story with a horror plot, like *House of Leaves.* It is, in any case, a story about something — a story that appeals to things real within the body of the human experience, or “the human heart,” to use Faulkner’s beautiful phrase.

**5. Your characters are believable AND remarkable**

Readers like reading about exceptional people. We’re fascinated by antagonists like Hannibal Lecter and Mr. Frost, who are infernal but formidable, wicked but outstanding.

Readers are equally or more fascinated by protagonists like Sherlock Holmes or Ellen Ripley, who are rarified but entirely human.

Yet it’s difficult to create believable characters like this.

Part of the trick is to develop a storyline (i.e. plot) that can showcase your characters’ virtues and vices. (It is in this sense that I refer to plot as a vehicle.)

Another part of the trick is to be able to show your characters’ motivation. In a real sense, the process of creating memorable characters is nothing more — or less — than showing what motivates them. This means that you know your characters inside and out, every bit as much as you know, for example, the human heart.",Discussion,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,disc,,True,t3_1d24do,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1d24do/five_reasons_ill_keep_reading_your_story/,

Introduce nuances that affect other characters, give them time to oppose it, express their views about it in dialogue or thought, then have the stakes upped at the last second in a way that may surprise a reader, forcing the character's hand.  This way both sides in the conflict can express the pros and cons of their decision before it happens which makes the possibilities spelled out so the reader can compare it to how it unfolds directly afterwards.

**32 Rules of Writing**

1: Avoid pleonasms. A pleonasm is a word or phrase which can be removed from a sentence without changing its meaning. For example, in “Hunting Down The Pleonasm”, ‘down’ is pleonastic. Cut it and the meaning of the sentence does not alter. Many words are used pleonastically: ‘just’, ‘that’ and ‘actually’ are three frequently-seen culprits (I actually just know that he’s the killer can be trimmed to I know he’s the killer), and phrases like ‘more or less’ and ‘in any shape or form’ are redundant.

2: Use oblique dialogue. Try to generate conflict at all times in your writing. Attempt the following experiment at home or work: spend the day refusing to answer your family and colleagues’ questions directly. Did you generate conflict? I bet you did. Apply that principle to your writing and your characters will respond likewise.

3: Use strong verbs in preference to adverbs. I won’t say avoid adverbs, period, because about once every fifty pages they’re okay! What’s not okay is to use an adverb as an excuse for failing to find the correct verb. To ‘walk slowly’ is much less effective than to ‘plod’ or ‘trudge’. To ‘connect strongly’ is much less effective than to ‘forge a connection’.

4: Cut adjectives where possible. See rule 3 (for ‘verb’ read ‘noun’).

5: Pairs of adjectives are exponentially worse than single adjectives. The ‘big, old’ man walked slowly towards the ‘tall, beautiful’ girl. When I read a sentence like that, I’m hoping he dies before he arrives at his destination. Mind you, that’s probably a cue for a ‘noisy, white’ ambulance to arrive. Wailingly, perhaps!

6: Keep speeches short. Any speech of more than three sentences should be broken up. Force your character to do something. Make him take note of his surroundings. Ground the reader. Create a sense of place.

7: If you find you’ve said the same thing more than once, choose the best and cut the rest. Frequently, I see the same idea presented several ways. It’s as if the writer is saying, “The first couple of images might not work, but the third one should do it. If not, maybe all three together will swing it.” The writer is repeating himself. Like this. This is a subtle form of pleonasm.

8: Show, don’t tell. Much vaunted advice, yet rarely heeded. An example: expressing emotion indirectly. Is your preferred reader intelligent? Yes? Then treat them accordingly. Tears were streaming down Lila’s face. She was very sad. Can the second sentence be inferred from the first? In context, let’s hope so. So cut it. If you want to engage your readers, don’t explain everything to them. Show them what’s happening and allow their intelligence to do the rest. And there’s a bonus to this approach. Because movies, of necessity, show rather than tell, this approach to your writing will help when it’s time to begin work on the screenplay adaptation of your novel!

9: Describe the environment in ways that are pertinent to the story. And try to make such descriptions active. Instead of describing a book lying on a table, have your psycho-killer protagonist pick it up, glance at it and move it to the arm of the sofa. He needs something to do to break up those long speeches, right?

10: Don’t be cute. In the above example, your protagonist should not be named Si Coe.

11: Avoid sounding ‘writerly’. Better to dirty up your prose. When you sound like a writer, your voice has crept in and authorial intrusion is always unwelcome. In the best writing, the author is invisible.

12: Fix your Point Of View (POV). Make it clear whose head you’re in as early as possible. And stay there for the duration of the scene. Unless you’re already a highly successful published novelist, in which case you can do what you like. The reality is that although most readers aren’t necessarily clued up on the finer points of POV, they know what’s confusing and what isn’t.

13: Don’t confuse the reader. If you write something you think might be unclear, it is. Big time. Change it or cut it.

14: Use ‘said’ to carry dialogue. Sid Fleischman calls ‘said’, “the invisible word.” 

15: Whilst it’s good to assume your reader is intelligent, never assume they’re psychic.

16: Start scenes late and leave them early.

17: When writing a novel, start with your characters in action. Fill in any necessary backstory as you go along.

18: Give your characters clear goals. Always. Every scene. And provide obstacles to those goals. Always. Every scene. If the POV character in a scene does not have a goal, provide one or cut the scene. If there is no obstacle, add one or cut the scene.

19: Don’t allow characters who are sexually attracted to one another the opportunity to get into bed unless at least one of them has a jealous partner.

20: Torture your protagonist. It’s not enough for him to be stuck up a tree. You must throw rocks at him while he figures out how to get down.

21: Use all five senses in your descriptions. Smell and touch are too often neglected.

22: Vary your sentence lengths. I tend to write short, and it’s amazing what a difference combing a couple of sentences can make.

23: Don’t allow your fictional characters to speak in sentences. Unless you want them to sound fictional.

24: Cut out filtering devices, wherever possible. ‘He felt’, ‘he thought’, ‘he observed’ are all filters. They distance the reader from the character.

25: Avoid unnecessary repetition of tense. For example: I’d gone to the hospital. They’d kept me waiting for hours. Eventually, I’d seen a doctor. Usually, the first sentence is sufficient to establish tense. I’d gone to the hospital. They kept me waiting for hours. Eventually, I saw a doctor.

26: When you finish your book, pinpoint the weakest scene and cut it. If necessary, replace it with a sentence or paragraph.

27: Don’t plant information. How is Donald, your son? I’m quite sure Donald’s father doesn’t need reminding who Donald is. Their relationship is mentioned purely to provide the reader with information.

28: If an opinion expressed through dialogue makes your POV character look like a jerk, allow him to think it rather than say it. He’ll express the same opinion, but seem like a lot less of a jerk.

29: Characters who smile and grin a lot come across as deranged fools. Sighing and shrugging are also actions to avoid. Eliminating smiles, sighs and shrugs is almost always an improvement. Smiling sadly is a capital offence.

30: Pronouns are big trouble for such little words. The most useful piece of information I ever encountered on the little blighters was this: pronouns refer to the nearest matching noun backwards. For example: John took the knife out of its sheath and stabbed Paul with it. Well, that’s good news for Paul. If you travel backwards from ‘it’, you’ll see that John has stabbed Paul with the sheath! Observing this rule leads to much clearer writing.

31: Spot the moment of maximum tension and hold it for as long as possible. Or as John D. MacDonald put it: “Freeze the action and shoot him later.”

32: If something works, forget about the rule that says it shouldn’t.

1350475685.0,226,self.writing,11mjnp,"I wrote, edited, and finished my first novel. Here are some things I learned that nobody prepared me for.",313,87,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/11mjnp/i_wrote_edited_and_finished_my_first_novel_here/,"I finished and self-gasp-published my novel recently. It was the first full-length novel I have ever written and probably bears many markings of such a new venture. There are no reviews. There is no party. It is just floating out there by itself right now. I feel like I spent a year writing a message, invested it into a cracked bottle, and threw it into the ocean where I watched it instantly disappear with a bloop. “Oh shit,” that lyrical version of me is thinking as the wind trickles down the beach and a rain starts, churning with workman-like sapience to scrub another paltry existence from the earth. “That was not time well spent.”

It goes without saying that completing a novel is an accomplishment. Even if it is an unblessed turd with prose so jarring one can feel the mechanisms of a molecular revolt stirring in their brain, a novel is a profound work of creativity. Finishing one is like paying off a heavy debt, maybe for completing your first home or maybe just for that laser-disc set the salesman sold you on. Doesn’t matter. It’s a strong, relieving feeling. But such debts are not paid easily.

One of the reasons I’m writing this is to simply express my experiences when it comes to finishing a book and trying to follow the craft as a profession. I read many biographical stories from authors, and many tips, and many guidelines and all that. I disregard most of them, but I enjoy reading their opinions and journeys all the same. What I’ve noticed, though, is that a lot of those terse, go-get-‘em helpings never really told me much about the process itself.

For example, nobody ever told me that I’d stumble over my words when I tried to tell a coworker I was writing a book. The ability of the craft to so willingly dress and undress before critique, to me, is very self-evident. Nobody takes writers seriously because of it. The written word is cheap and talking about it is even cheaper. As it turned out, I was not the only person in my then-workplace to be writing their own book. And I cringed like a tortured frog as these fellow word-sponges squeezed their delusional salts all over me. Oh my god, I thought as they told me about their Harry Potter-inspired tales, we’re all the same. Nobody told me extreme cynicism would seed itself from there and send its endless roots sprawling into the soil, a tiny farce of a tree bobbing above like some arboreal iceberg. I turned to cheesy dark, gothy thoughts like, “From outer space, all the earth is really known for are two large, flowery flashes blooming in the Pacific and a few tiny men scuttling about a nearby rock.” Terrible.

So, people would nod their heads at my fancying myself a writer, and then ask about my updated resume. Alright. Message received.

Nobody told me about the stress of crossing the finishing line. Nobody said I’d begin to worry about the physical state of the manuscript itself. Back it up on USB, through e-mails, save it repeatedly and on multiple files! I caught thieves staking out my place of stay at the time and, in turn, started hiding my laptop before going to bed and when leaving for work. I started to worry endlessly that someone would steal my work. I have no idea how writers of old dealt with this when they really did have actual, physical copies as their sole source. I was darkly humored when, a short while ago, I read about how Hemingway was fearful he would lose his manuscripts that were stored in a Cuban vault. Nobody ever told me a damn thing about fears like that. And as my book neared completion I also began to worry that I would die. Death sharpens itself on the dangers of passing moments. It is practically nonexistent when your life is great and stunningly gripping when that semi merges into your lane as you sip hot coffee. Every keystroke became a turn of the whetstone for that grim specter’s blade. I can’t die now, I thought, not when I’m this close! It just seems too obvious for me to die now, I would think as another airplane rumbled over my room. It just had to happen. Thankfully, the past me survived to now. 

But nobody told me about other stresses, either. More realistic ones like the fact the book being worked on is quite likely to be so bad that the ashes of some great, ancestral author are going to crawl out of their urn and hurl themselves into the nearest waters to be vaporized. I visited a garbage dump for a field trip as a kid (yup) and it’s pretty obvious how awful everything smelled. But what was curious was that the people who worked there didn’t notice the rank, rancid aroma that was so thick and sticky it armored their very skin. Likewise, I had stared at my own words so long they lost total meaning. I could no longer tell what in their world was good or bad. I stood over my novel like a trembling surgeon, unsure of where to cut or how. And do surgeons dream of screwing up? Because I started to dream of one-star reviews and universal panning of my awful novel. I started to dream of a dying dream. Failure is the natural order of things, after all. A person sucks at the start of everything. It is a suffocating reality. Everybody begins below the ice and has to claw their way out and, for me, it was getting difficult to ignore the chills.

Nobody told me the marketplace is a vicious monster with a sweet tooth. I have written under many pseudonyms, but I have found hard living with most of them. Novel ideas go by unread, my hardest efforts die off alone and unseen. When I visit the graveyard of great stories, and there are so many unread on the market (seriously), I wince because cackling above their tombs are the trite gods of erotica and cheap pulp. And I shake my fist at those deities with their unedited ways, textureless filler, shameless self-plugging and the list of offenses goes on. But I submit to them all the same, prostrating myself before their sticky temple like a drunkard, slain by the bottle, washing himself across church steps. None of these cheery blogs and I’m-here-for-you guides said anything about turning literary tricks to make a buck. The (very minor) monetary success of my own drivel was about as comforting as being paid in hard coins shot out of a cannon...

I was intimidated by my last book and didn't think I'd be able to emulate the same creativity once more. I heavily considered putting writing aside for a while, just as a mind break. But I refused. I had an idea in my head that just had to be put to words. But this one, unlike my fifteen other books, had to be a novel. Thirteen months passed and I found myself in March of 2013. I had tons of pages of notes and quotes and a very basic outline. I knew the ending since 2011 because it was an ending I always wanted to execute, I just needed the perfect plot and I made it happen. 

In March of 2013, I had 8,000 words done. I was devastated. I started browsing reddit, practically knowing that I would not go back to the disappointment of an attempt for a very long while. Then I found /r/writing and I saw a post called ""this is what finishing a novel looks like"" and my first thought was ""oh yeah.. My novel.."" I didn't really put it aside for any time. I took almost daily notes on my phone when I was out and jotted down anything I learned when I was at home... But it no longer felt like a novel. It felt like a research paper. So I clicked the link and it was of a man who had a few calendar sheets with color-coded X's on them. Each color represented a certain range of his word count for that day. The very next day I wrote 726 words, and I got right back into the writing groove I grew up with. And here we are, a little less than four months later, with a completed novel at a tad under 90,000 words with an average word count of 749 words per day. 

Thank you /r/writing for teaching me so much that not only got me to start writing my novel again, but teaching me what to do in the process (such as always using said, hardly using adverbs, and so forth.) this advice has practically saved this realistic drama thriller of a novel from being a 300-page cheese fest. 

I thank you all and am very proud to say that even though I have a very long way to go to get this novel anywhere near worth publishing, I'm ready for the journey and I'll be pushing through it all. But for now, after so much work, I'll be putting The Man in Red on break, so I can go back and tear it a new one with a trusty red pen. 

Thank you Reddit. For once being the reason that I distracted myself from my novel, to becoming the reason I finished it at all.

EDIT: I meant rarely use adverbs, not never. 


EDIT: The Man in Red revolves around Ryan Belutro, a very wealthy family man. He has been faced with the seemingly impossible challenge of unemployment. And while his son is striving to become a better person, he must hide the family's transition from wealth and comfort to poverty and anxiety. In the process, Mr. Belutro pushes all boundaries aside and does whatever it takes to make sure that his family never finds out that they became poor at all. Knowing of the dangers in the long journey, Mr.  Belutro strives to prepare his son, Alex, for adulthood in the likely case that something happens to him.

1366678973.0,221,self.writing,1cwjmh,I'm a novice who attempted a trilogy - this is what I learned,266,45,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1cwjmh/im_a_novice_who_attempted_a_trilogy_this_is_what/,"I started writing in October of 2012 with little more than a plot premise and a few general themes I knew I wanted to include.  Because my strength is world-building, I've now written three books at a total of approximately 180,000 words.  

Before writing, I did not consider my narration style, other than I knew I was in the third-person.  I somehow defaulted into a detached, third-person voice where the only descriptions are of the literal actions occurring, and the narrator follows one character very closely.  

By half-way through the second book, it felt like I was only writing dialogue.  I didn't know how else to convey the thoughts, emotions, etc. that really give a character depth.  I decided to just keep going and finish the story.

The second lesson was that it's incredibly hard to world-build as you go along - while still making story arcs that are compelling and sensible.  A lot of characters pop-in from nowhere, while if they were planned beforehand, I would have foreshadowed more events.  

Now that I'm done, I'm ripping apart much of the story and inserting all these pieces I've since come up with and writing paragraph summations of the entire flow of the story.  I don't know yet how successful this strategy will be.  

Narrator - ehhh, still not sure what to do.  Part of me wants to change the narrator to one that is more in the main character's head, or at least provides some context.  I think I'll probably decide against that, because damn, between that and the plot, I'm pretty much rewriting the entire series.  

So I guess my advice to any novice attempting to write a series as his or her first novel is to spend at least a few weeks or a month building out the storyline and living in your novel.  And after a few chapters in, make sure you like the narrator...

So, I started with the last page, edited that page and then moved up. Not only does it take you out of the story (since everything's backwards with little reference), it also makes you search out references in your story. When you start reading the end to a long string of dialogue or a pronoun heavy passage, you'll find yourself making sure you referenced it at the beginning.

Six decades -worth of the damned stuff wheezed from every nook, cranny, and pore of the place. I spent three full days caked in dust, sweat and snot, but by god, I cleaned that shit to glass.

All except for one screen over one window in the one bathroom in the house. I knew I wanted a reminder, and something about the primordial function of the bathroom invited me to put it there. That is: I took a can of compressed air—the kind you use on your computer's private bits—and held the tip very close to the dark skin of dust it had gathered over the last half century. And I wrote, by blasting out a thin line of the ghastly stuff, three words, as big as I could make them. 

You Are Dying

Just about every day, at first, I saw it and read it. Most days, several times. After a while, I only noticed it once in a while. Then it was rarely, only during the most emphatic of shits. But it was always there. It's still there. And I know those words are there, always, on the window, and somewhere in the dusty corners of my mind. 

You Are Dying

This is a true story. And it's by no means the end of where I drew the line with self-flagellating fuel for my goals. (In fact, as I type this, I sit in a yellow room coated with 63 3x5 cards taped to the walls and ceiling, all of which excoriate my lesser selves for some of their bigger demons.) Because that's what works for me. I'm not interested in getting famous, or making art or any of that slippery shit. Because I'm not running toward my goals. I'm running away from death.

You Are Dying

is the mantra. It's my creed, my partner, my reminder. Everyone dies, they say. But you know who doesn't? You know who gets to live for fucking ever?

Us. Storytellers. Artists. Craftsmen. Inventors. Builders. Actors, musicians, carpenters. Writers. Your body is dying. But your dreams? Your dreams are only atrophying. They're only decaying. They're there. They're real. And they're yours. And they're all you have against the black gulf of endlessness that chases you from the cradle and into the grave. 

You Are Dying

Get it through your head. Make a reminder. Get a fucking tattoo. Do what it takes. Because your job is to point out the things in life that make it worth living. And that's your job until you die.",,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,,Author,True,t3_x1kpe,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/x1kpe/alright_thats_it_you_are_dying/,

Even right now, as I write this post, I have such negative feelings. And yet I do this because writing isn't just a hobby or a passion for me; it's the only thing that I know how to do, and even then I don't feel like I'm good enough to write on a Post-It, never mind writing a poem or a novel.

I have so much to say, and writing is the only way I can cone close to getting my point across. I'm not mute or hearing impaired, but sometimes I feel like it. When I go on message boards and post (including here at Reddit), I worry that I'm going to anger people or make them laugh at me. When I write a poem, I worry that it won't be good enough for me or whoever's reading it. I completed a manuscript for a novel last year, and as much as I want an agent, I worry that my query letters won't interest them, and all my work will go down the drain. So, my shame and embarrassment are compounded by my worry. I don't know how else to explain it.

I want to write and share what I write without my numerous hang-ups. But I don't know if it's possible. Last night, I read an article lamenting the state of American poetry. I felt like the author was talking about me, and that was just hard to take. And whenever I update my Facebook or Twitter status, I feel so stupid and worthless. I can't seem to come up with anything clever or cute or even anything that won't prompt one of my friends to dump me right then and there.

2. Include only things relevant to plot or character development
3. Keep an eye on -ly words, replace 500 -ly words with 5 words that mean the same thing and it makes 2500 words
   with more detail than the one
4. Keep dialog as sparse as possible
5. Don’t get bogged down in description
6. Remember to develop characters without shoving it in the reader’s face, development should hardly be noticed
7. Sentence fragments are okay. Really. Use them for emphasis. It’s kinda their deal.
8. DON’T WORRY ABOUT WORD COUNT. FORGET WORD COUNT, WRITE WHAT YOU PLANNED TO WRITE, FILL IN EXTRANEOUS DETAILS
   WITH EDITING
9. This is a rough draft. It’s going to sound horrible. It’ll probably be sub-par. This is the hardest part.

**EDIT**

Thanks for all the kind notes. A lot of people want to know the story, so here it is. Nothing too wacky:

The magazine is [L'Allure des Mots](http://www.lalluredesmots.com/), an online/print out of Miami. I dug up this old story (which was written several years ago) and decided it was high time I get published, so I put together an excel spreadsheet, Googled around for literary magazines accepting submissions, and set about submitting my story five times per day. I included both online and print ""magazines"" in my search.

I think I lasted about 2-3 weeks before being accepted for publication. I was accepted by several outlets, but L'Allure des Mots had the strong print presence, so I went with them. The editor sent me back a nice note complimenting one of the lines in my story (which is ""The Failures,"" by Daniel Kenitz, i.e., me. [You can read it online](http://issuu.com/lalluredesmots/docs/issue_11_for_web/85?e=2872606/4240940)) and said they'd be happy to publish me for their fall issue. The issue just came online and should be in print later, as I understand it.

I'm currently working on my next short story...and a novel. I would love to get published in the likes of, say, The Paris Review one day. But I realized that I needed something on my fiction resume, and I'm happy to have L'Allure des Mots on it.

I suppose I should start by saying that I would rather have my testicles nailed to a sinking ship than read one more page of this reeking drivel. Where to even begin? Understandably, this novel (I hesitate to use the word, for that would imply that there was a shred of originality or novelty contained within its pages) is meant to be a satirical look at the world of superheroes and the mythos that grew up around them in the last half century, poking at well established tropes for a laugh. However, in reality, we only see the lackluster adolescent mind of the writer slapped haphazardly across the pages. I found myself asking, why? What happened to this fellow that made him so keen to abuse his nascent readership? Was he bitten by a superhero enthusiast as a child, thereby instilling a burning need to alienate any such persons by writing farces such as this? The characters are so far beyond derivative as to insult derivatives by association. One-dimensionality and predictability abounds, and I found myself already knowing what would happen next, and then slapping myself for bothering to read on to find out. I'm not waxing hyperbolic on this subject. I literally dealt myself several injuring blows as penance for reading Black Dog, such was the grievous nature of the transgression. Would that I could undo the damage to my literary sensibilities by whipping myself raw with a barbed scourge or throwing myself upon a sword, in a heartbeat I would mortify my flesh and scour my soul if only it would remove the stain that Black Dog has left on my very being. 

tl;dr This book sucked the sweat off a dead man's balls.

It isn't necessary. 

There are a lot of small press magazines, and anthologies, both online and print, who pay real money for your writing, and get you much more valuable exposure than you get from a non-paying market, especially a new, small one without a lot of big name writers or editors involved. 

If you have aspirations to be a writer, and to some day get paid to write, make that some day today. Don't submit to non-paying markets. Demand the compensation you deserve. 

I'm happy to answer any questions about getting started writing. I recently had a story accepted in a pro-paying anthology, I know some pro writers and editors personally, I go to writing conventions and workshops regularly. 

I'm not an industry expert, but that's the point. I just started really working at this a few years ago, and I'm making real progress without wasting my time writing for ""exposure.""

Maybe you'll get some inspiration from it, or just pity my poor life-choices that have lead me to becoming the man I am today! Feel free to share your own tales of wealth and woe or ask questions or whatever.

**Self-publishing saved my life.**

Back in December 2011 I was in a bad place. I hadn't had a full-time job since 2008, getting by on temping and freelance copywriting, only there hadn't been much work coming my way. I was broke, couch surfing, and hadn't had even the promise of real work in months.

You know how they say that you should treat a job hunt like a job? Yeah, that works for a while, but after the first few years you get discouraged. Then depressed.

So I found myself with little more than a laptop, an impending sense of doom, and copious amounts of free-time.

**I have always considered myself a writer**

Now, I've always been a storyteller. Even when I was just a little shaver, even before I could read, I was filling up spiral notebooks with stickman comic books and giving them to my grandparents. As soon as I learned to read I became a literary addict, binging on as many books as I could get my grubby little hands on. In class I'd ignore whatever the teachers were blathering on about and read something hidden under the lip of my desk. When assigned reading I'd get through it in the first day. I still binge; I think I got through the last Harry Potter book in a single sitting.

I don't read as much anymore. And by 2011, I wasn't writing much, either. Life skimming the poverty line has this way of wearing away at your most interesting edges. I still thought of myself as ""a writer"", but truth was I hadn't written anything substantial in years.

Never tried to get published, either. Oh, I thought about it. Researched it. Bought Writer's Digest guides, read How To's on the business by Stephen King and Ray Bradbury and Orson Scott Card. Never did so much as send a query, though. Maybe it was a fear of success. Or a fear of failure. It seems an alien mindset to me, now, but all I know is that it was some d*mn unprofessional attitude or another that held me back, kept me working [crap] jobs to make other people rich.

If I was smart, I woulda started self-publishing in 2009, but that's the lethargy that comes with depression.

**Might as well write somethin'**

So I found myself in late 2011 with a lot of free time, impending doom, and not a lot else. I can't say exactly what spurred me to start writing again, but it's a good thing; I was rapidly burning through my social circle's hospitality, and was faced with an upcoming Chicago winter.

I wrote a short psychological thriller about the end of the word and sent it off to some magazine. A milestone. My first ever submission anywhere.

It was rejected. I had expected that. What I hadn't expected was that my rejection was a personal one, calling it an ""Almost"". 

Spirits lifted, I thought about sending it off to the next market on my list, when I remembered that self-publishing thing. Why not, right?

I spent some time researching it, then sent the story off to Amazon, Smashwords, and Barnes &amp; Noble. I hastened and wrote a few other stories, publishing four that first month.

I made $10. And I was doing everything wrong. 

My covers were terrible, my titles were vague and uninformative, my pricing was 99 cents. I could write, but I had no clue about the business of writing.

**Gotta learn the trade**

I did some more research, wrote some more stories, and put some thought into branding. Month two? $250.

That was $250 more than I'd earned in a long time.

As time went by, I kept writing, kept researching, kept honing my skills with covers and blurbs and titles. I stopped wasting so much time on twitter and facebook trying to promote myself, and instead focused on producing content. I've got the website, but that's about all the active marketing I bother with, beyond sending out a twitter announcement and mailing list email when I publish something new.

By June 2012 I was making a thousand dollars a month.

That may not sound like a lot as someone's sole source of income, but it was a hell of a lot to me, and it's entirely through my efforts. Sure, Amazon and BN and Kobo and iTunes get their cut, but I'm not working for anyone else. Nobody else is making as much offa my word-sweat as I am.

And that's incredibly liberating.

**Where I'm At**

So I've been plateaued at around a thousand a month since then and I can't seem to climb any higher for whatever reason, but I'm doing something that I love. That's it. That's the job. Eventually I'll break this wall I keep hitting and start making more. Some story will take off, or my mailing list will grow to the point where I have more consistent sales, or I'll just have an inventory where the individual sales trickles add up to more.

I want to remind you that writing is not a competition. 

Writing is an expression. Nothing more. Nothing less. 

You don't have to worry about your writing being good or bad or in between. You don't have to compare yourself to other writers. You don't have to be upset at yourself for not writing as much as you want. You don't even have to write. It is not a competition.

Sure, you can express something of value and sell it and make money. That does not make it a competition. The market is not saturated. There is room enough for everyone. The first Harry Potter book still sells. The Bible still sells. Chicken Soup for the Soul still sells. If these mega-blockbusters can still sell, there is room enough for you. 

And at the end of the day, writing is about communicating something of value, be that an entertaining story or an enlightening story; a how-to guide or a how-not-to biography; a blog post or a status update. They're all valid forms of expression.

Stop competing. Start trying to give value to the lives of your readers.

***

Write 500 words a day, no more, no less. Or 2000. Or don’t bother with word counts, that’s all bollocks, write for two hours a day. Or four. Plan every chapter meticulously, but don’t plan anything at all because it’s got to be spontaneous. You must write in the morning, it’s the most creative time of the day, studies have proved it. Except for the evening, the magic only happens after midnight, everyone knows that.

Why can’t we just write? Why do we have all of this advice out here, why bother to construct complex methodologies and individual rituals?

That all this advice is contradictory does not mean it is not of use. More critically, it does not mean that some are right and some are wrong. They all serve to provide possible *solutions* to the *problems* of writing. We can spend so much time picking through writerly advice, sharing top ten lists, debating one set of techniques over another, that we can lose sight of the problems they are trying to solve. And if you haven’t properly considered the problem, you can’t find the solution to fit it.

It’s important to return to first principles every once in a while; to remember just what it is that makes writing so difficult. Some of the bigger ones just in the drafting stage include:

*Fear of the blank page at the start of the day  
*Exhaustion, disillusionment, and losing momentum part way through a project  
*Idea not fully realised, and insufficiently complex to sustain a novel  
*Characters and world insufficiently developed  
*Lapsing into cliche  

You shouldn’t be writing in a particular way because Hemingway tells you to. Writing methods are not rituals to be followed in the hope that the Gods will be favourable to you. They are practical solutions to difficult problems, not secret techniques that will magically make you a great writer.

It’s useful to see how others have approached these problems, but if you obsess too much over deciding on one approach over another, you are like a man hesitating between a bucket of water and a bucket of sand when his kitchen is on fire. Both will work, one might even be marginally better than the other depending on circumstance, but the important thing is to get on with it before the whole house burns down.

Identify problems, improvise solutions, and accept there is no “right” answer to writing. There is only what works.

I have also just completed the first draft of a manuscript I intend to seek a publisher for. In the coming weeks, I'm going to have to make up my mind if I intend to take a standard publishing industry approach, or take a go online and in the self publishing realm.  

I was thinking it might be helpful (to the community and myself) to expand this into a focused conversation on 'what to do next'. I do not claim to be an expert, but I have been practicing my craft for over 15 years, and have been carefully researching how I could eventually make the move from hobbyist to professional.  

I'm in the process of creating a very large to do list, for both research and actual work that needs to be done. Since there are seemingly more than a few of us in the community who are at this point right now, perhaps we could try working on one together? 

Tell us about what's on your to do list! I will keep a record of what we come up with on my [blog.](http://mogonzo.blogspot.com) 

I've broken mine down into categories to start: 

Publishing industry research &amp; work

1. Write draft query letter
2. Write draft back book cover
3. Write draft “what qualifies me to write this book” 
4. Write draft “why will this book sell &amp; what does this book compete with”
5. Find the names of 10 large agencies seeking submissions in my genre
6. Research each of the agencies 
7. Find the contact information for 3 major publishers and 3 minor publishers 
8. Research each of the publishers
9. Create list of all possible networking contacts in publishing field 
10. Write 5-10 page synopsis of book. 

Promotional work

1. Create Social media accounts, generate good &amp; appropriate content for each platform: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr
2. Create a blog on a topic of which you can speak well
3. Build social networking contacts  


Self publishing research 

1. Research kickstarter
2. Research indiegogo
3. Research costs of self publishing
4. Research self publishing on amazon
5. Research &amp; price possible graphic designers
6. Research &amp; price possible editors 

Actual Manuscript work

1. Print off paper copy for initial editing
2. Mark where foreshadowing is required or can be placed
3. Mark where more description is required
4. Re-create character diagrams based on what the characters do and say in what you have written

Time Breakdown (in minimums) 

* 2 hours each day on editing
* 1 hour each day creating content for social networking accounts + networking
* 30 mins each day writing blog pieces
* 30 mins each day researching agents &amp; publishing houses
* 30 mins each day working on other to do list items 

** /u/craftyodyseus has made an excellent point about how much time is being spent on promotional work vs. actual editing. I'm updating the time requirements from this insight.  
** /u/Stevehops has also pointed out that many agencies are looking for a 5-10 page synopsis of your book these days, and I have upated the 'publishing industry research &amp; work' list accordingly

As it stands, the story is at 132k, well over the 75k mark I set at the beginning. There are a few bits that I'll need to expand upon in the first revision though, so I think it will end up around 150k.

From Wikipedia:
&gt;The New York Times wrote in 1926 of Hemingway's first novel, ""No amount of analysis can convey the quality of The Sun Also Rises. It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame."" The Sun Also Rises is written in spare, tight prose that influenced countless crime and pulp fiction novels and made Hemingway famous.

1354998287.0,169,self.writing,14iftb,3 sketch comedy tips that all writers could use,208,39,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/14iftb/3_sketch_comedy_tips_that_all_writers_could_use/,"The single best thing I’ve done to improve my writing was learning how to write sketch comedy.

Sketch comedy is the guerilla warfare version of storytelling. In sketch, you don’t have 50,000 words to tell a story. Or an hour. Or half an hour. You have to tell an entire story – beginning, transition, climax, and end – on a stage and in under 5 minutes. Ready? Go!

Given such insane constraints, sketch writers need to do three things that all writers should do:


**1. Get to the point**

The first thing that your sketch needs to do is establish the who, what, and where quickly. How quickly? The first 4 lines of dialogue. It’s called the four-line setup.

This is an excerpt from my sketch “[3 Strikes You’re Out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=PL79dksDNe4)“.

*Steve*
Whoo! Way to to Thome! Ya! Send those Northside pricks packin! Buck up kiddo, the Sox are winnin’, you should be happy.

*Brett*
(Unenthusiastically)
Oh, yeah…Nice hit Thome.

*Steve*
Yeah! That a kid! Hey, you Northside pricks, pack your shit and go back to Wrigley you Old Style drinkin’ yuppies. Man, can you believe these guys still play in that shitty stadium of theirs? That place don’t even got a jumbo-tron.

*Brett*
Dad, there’s nothing wrong with Wrigley Field.


Who: A White Sox fanatic of a father &amp; his apathetic son.

What: The son is not enjoying the game despite the father wanting him to. At the end, the son contradicts the father’s beliefs. If you watch the video, in two more lines comes the turning point.

Where: A baseball game (Thome is a White Sox player, so if you catch that, you know it’s a game between the White Sox and the Cubs in Chicago.)

**2. This is the day**

The sketch has to tell a story that is significant in the lives of its characters. The late Mary Scruggs would always tell us, “This is the day!” This is the day that these characters grow in some way. So make the plot significant. Is this the day where the husband and wife realize they’re meant to be together forever? That they’re not? That the husband is actually a woman with a hormone disorder? Why is this day significant to them? Heighten the conflict that goes along with such a momentus day; that’s what keeps an audience’s attention. The characters will end in a different place than where they started from at the beginning of the story.

**3. Character wants and subtext**

Characters can, and should be complex. Establish what your characters want. That gives them motivation to move forward, and therefore move your story forward. When we know what a character wants, we can get behind them and hope for their success, or hope that they fail. It gets the audience involved. If we don’t know what the characters want, the scenes will become stiff and lose the audience.

Knowing what your characters want also drives subtext to their actions. Dave may really want to eat the cookie that Jane has in her hand. To get it, he may hit on her or make a pass in some way. His actions come across to her as romantic, but we know that he only wants that cookie. Right there we have conflict, a relationship, and we want to know what happens next.

**3.5. (Bonus) The knockout**

A sketch or a story will really stick with you if it has a good button or knockout ending. What can happen at the end of the story that catches your audience by surprise? In sketch, it’s often a final one-liner before the blackout. The most obvious example from a movie is the ending of “The Sixth Sense.” The knockout at the end is what people remember most about it.

1328285168.0,165,self.writing,p9d63,"/r/writing, reddit and moderation: call for mods, witch hunts and why violentacrez was added as a moderator.",247,82,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/p9d63/rwriting_reddit_and_moderation_call_for_mods/,"So, some background. I have spent the last week or so in front of a computer, but haven't had the time to log on to reddit. I just worked until about 4am programming trying to catch up on work for my job. Last weekend, I took a trip to Ohio to play music at a convention.

None of this excuses the fact that /r/writing needed moderation that I wasn't around for. 

So, in the interest of the community, violentacrez sent me a mail offering to help deal with people's issues. Also, he pointed me to the thread complaining about wanting to mod /r/writing, so in the short time I had, I took the following actions:

* Added violentacrez so he could help out with moderation duties
* Added karlgraves so he could help steer the community; he seemed like he had some good ideas, and was upset enough to start his own community.

So imagine my shock when apparently this isn't enough, and oh by the way I've somehow encouraged child rapeabusesodomy by picking a guy who (while creepy) has never done or posted or encouraged anything illegal to my knowledge. What he *has*, though, is experience moderating several large subreddits, including /r/funny, which, to my knowledge, has not degenerated into a lawless hellhole full of horrible people. /r/WTF, /r/Art, /r/news, and /r/entertainment are also his. So he was added to take care of spam and other user requests because I have been temporarily swamped. I don't see how his name is somehow synonymous with rape. However, I do know enough that if his name *does* inspire that kind of association with people, that's all that matters. So he's gone.

So that's all that happened. violentacrez never banned anyone from /r/writing. The ban list is completely empty. He was not here to change the subreddit. He is not here as a ""fuck you,"" he was here to get your spam out of the spam filter and help facilitate karlgraves in the new community.

What also happened was a fucking witch hunt. I love reddit, but its dark side to any large internet website is that soon as someone gets mad about a perceived slight, everything is off the table, the people responsible need to be run out of town and/or located personally and beaten to death. Think about this: yeah, maybe you don't like VA; maybe you don't like seeing his name on the sidebar. That's fair. But what negative impact did it *really* have on the community? Tons and tons of posts about violentacrez. Thread after thread arguing about whether violentacrez is a rapist or just a pedophile. Lots of wasted space in /r/writing not spent talking about **actually writing!** These kind of completely insane witch hunts do nobody any good.

Not to mention that just about *no one* noticed that I added karlgraves. Or some kind of conspiracy-level rant about how the placement of VA over karl is somehow significant. (Hint: It wasn't.)

**TL; DR: VIOLENTACREZ WAS JUST HERE TO HELP WITH SPAM; HE'S BEEN REMOVED AT THE COMMUNITY'S REQUEST.**

Now, can we talk about writing?

I love books (I mod /r/books) and I love writing. I'm very passionate about both, and I hope to find the time to be a writer in the near future. I have a lot of friends who are aspiring authors. This is why I started /r/writing. I want this community to be a place where writers can come and discuss their craft. Part of this discussion is discussing things you've actually written, and I try to keep the rules about self-submissions a lot more lax in this subreddit.

But like any subreddit these days, it requires moderation. I am definitely going to need help in moderating this subreddit, and hopefully from someone who has some more ideas about how to make this community better.

A mod is someone that deals with the day-to-day trivialities of a subreddit: fishing spam out of the spam filter. Removing blogspam or offtopic posts. Helping other subcommunities (see sidebar ---&gt;) be seen. Helping people do things like writing contests or promote third party sites that mesh with /r/writing.

What a mod is *not* is the best writer. A mod is not the person with the most knowledge about writing. A mod is not the person who has the most works published. A moderator is someone that helps a reddit community; and this is an entirely different beast than writing itself. No one expects the moderators at /r/funny to be the funniest people or to have submitted the funniest submissions or comments. Making throwaway_writer a mod doesn't help improve the subreddit because they're successful, it would help only if they had ideas for moderation (maybe they do!).
 
So let's choose some people to help moderate. I can see that a lot of people say they want more out of this community than just a plain old mod, but so far I've only seen vague notions of how to improve this reddit, and that is no better than *my* job of simply responding to user requests and dealing with spam. 

Let's see some concrete proposals out there. Upvote on what proposals for improvement you think are best, and give those people the power they need to do it. 

Addendum on mod actions: I haven't permanently de-modded karlgraves, and in fact I think he'd be a great addition to the mod team. I simply wanted to put the slate clean so we can talk about this in a constructive manner rather than having 17 threads on the matter. karlgraves, can you please outline plans you'd make for /r/writing? ~~Also, throwaway_writer, I'd be glad to consider, but despite not even having messaged me or #writing in the last couple weeks, he threw a fit about VA being made mod over him.~~ edit: Apparently this post of t_w's was a joke and I missed it.

",196,33,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/xfugh/i_wrote_100_short_stories_in_100_days_and_posted/,"Hey there! Anyone remember me? 7 months ago (I am a super lurker) I [posted to reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/nf4d3/ive_written_a_short_story_every_day_for_75_days/) about a little project I was doing. 100 short stories in 100 days. One story had to be written and published on my blog by midnight every night. On day 75 I got a huge influx of visitors from reddit, as well as tons of advice and constructive criticism, all of which was very appreciated.     

Anyway, my friends and family kept saying nice things, so I said ""to hell with it!"" and decided to self-publish the best ones, to see if there was any interest in a collection of flash fiction. I chose the 50 or so best stories out of 100. My best friend did the cover and some inset art, and formatted the manuscript for me. I did my best to edit as much as I could, re-arranged the stories, and completely destroyed all of the formatting (I'm sorry!). It was sent off, and I waited for 3 weeks. One week ago, five hardcover copies of my book arrived in the mail from lulu.com, and yesterday the e-book version appeared on Amazon. And I am so excited!

I know it's relatively easy to self-publish nowadays, but having a physical copy of a book with one's name on it feels pretty darn good. It's so real, especially with the ISBN on the back. I've been taking it around and showing it off everywhere, and the reactions are amazing. I even ended up giving my first book reading to a group of strangers at a bar a couple of days ago, and that was crazy! 

I have no idea whether I can or will make a career out of being a writer, but for the time being I'm thoroughly enjoying the whole process. That's why I decided to come back and post an update here, because the reactions to my little project were fairly positive the first time. I guess it's more the endurance aspect of the project, the discipline, that gets people interested. I admit drawing inspiration from things like NaNoWriMo. I initially wanted to last 365 days, but quickly decided that was fairly unreasonable, at least at this stage in my 'career'.

Now, I checked the submission guidelines, and it seems okay to put a couple of links down here if it's not completely obvious that I'm shamelessly self-promoting. I should probably say what the book is called first, though:

**""I Don't Think The Moon Is Real""**

It contains 54 flash fiction stories of all shapes and sizes. The largest is about 6000 words, the shortest is 4 words (with apologies to Hemingway), and the average is about 800 words. The hardcover version is 206 pages. There should be something for everyone in here. There's romance, science fiction, fantasy, drama, action, horror, just about every genre under the sun. All different styles too! I was really trying to flex my writing muscles, to get out of my comfort zone.

At the end of the day, I hope there is at least a single story in there that makes someone go ""wow, that was amazing! What a great story!"" Even if that person hates the rest of them, I'll call it a success if there is a single story that makes them want to remember it, and tell their friends, a story that makes them feel.

This is getting long, so I'll cut to the chase: ""I Don't Think The Moon Is Real"" is currently on Amazon for your Kindle or other e-reader! 

Here's the link: [I Don't Think The Moon Is Real](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008QUHH84/ref=cm_sw_su_dp)

If you do want to download it and read and stuff, and you like it, I'd love a positive review! If you want to spend money on it that'd be fantastic, and if you really want to spend money on it, the hardcover is available from lulu.com for about $25, depending on your local currency.

Every sentence has to be perfectly placed, every word purposefully used. We agonize over it at times, but as I experience my own journey from wannabe to writer, I’ve realized that bad writing is still writing…and bad writing can be fixed.

Am I saying that it’s okay to write poorly? Not necessarily. As we grow as writers our skills will grow. If your skills aren’t growing…if you’re always producing bad writing…then something is amiss. I’ve know wannabe writers who have atrocious grammar and are doing nothing to remedy that. Here’s the funny thing though – if they keep pushing out material, they’ll eventually get published, and if their editor is really bored or really good, it may even be a good book.

But that’s not the type of writer you should emulate. Emulate the writers who have gotten better over the years, but never underestimate the catharsis of bad writing, by which I mean that sometimes it’s okay to just get the first draft on paper.

Remember the way you were taught to sketch in grade school art classes? First you build a geometrical framework, then you slowly start filling in details, while erasing needless lines. Few artists would ever imagine they could sell just their frameworks, though I dare say a few have made careers out of it. A first draft is like that framework (so is an outline before the draft).

If your first draft hits your major plot points (if you’re a plotter), shows the proper character progression, encompasses your premise and theme, and moves the story from point “A” to point “Z” (or point “A” to point “Gizquark” if your a surreliast author), then its done is job.

Don’t spend your time agonizing over sentence structure, metaphors, word-choice, and the like during a first draft. At the same time, don’t purposefully write poor first drafts out of laziness. If you have it in you to write a decent first draft without hindering your flow of getting the story on the page, then do it, but if you find yourself after a gut-wrenching hour with only three perfectly crafted sentences on the page, then step back and allow yourself to just write poorly.

Trust me, you can fix it later, and you’ll be a happier writer in the end.

TL;DR - Sometimes you have to suck it up and write a piss-poor first draft in order to get the story out. You can always go back and make it perfect later.

**Question:** I’m shockingly lazy and find it hard to get motivated to sit in front of that computer and write. Help me!

**Neil Gaiman's Response:** Why? You being lazy and unmotivated and not writing allows another writer, who does sit down and write, to get published in your place. Magazines and publishers only have so many pages, so many annual publishing spots. You’re letting someone else who wants to do the work get published. Surely that’s a good thing…?

Then I got married. But it turned out that each time my wife traveled (and sometimes she would be gone for 2 whole months), I could write again. So I rejoiced. 

She recently went out on another 8 week trip. I decided to write a book that had been festering inside me for way too long. When I opened Word, I had to open Reddit and the next thing I knew I was goofing off. But I snapped out of it, closed Reddit and started furiously typing out anything that came to my mind. After the first paragraph, I reviewed it, and realized it was utter crap. **But** I was off to the races. I wrote a couple of pages and rewarded myself with some more Reddit. So on and so forth. 

The mind is a fickle beast. Like flowing water, it likes to find its own equilibrium. But you need to dam and divert the flow. Once you enter the ""zone"", you will find it easier to write. I found that lighting incense, frankincense to be precise, actually worked ([there is science behind this](http://health.msn.com/health-topics/depression/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100205390)). I wrote on weekends at a local coffeeshop and found myself to be pretty productive there, even though I was people watching more. But, it turns out that having a low level of ambient noise actually fuels your creativity. [More science](http://lifehacker.com/5890924/coffee-shop-buzz-is-good-for-your-creativity)! I noticed a critical point on how I slacked off - when I switched from keyboard to mouse! When I am writing, it's purely a keyboard thing. But the moment I grab the mouse, my brain would say, 'Good job, dude! Let's chill a bit!' and that would be that. Many times when I needed to find a definition or a synonym for a word, this would result in me clicking the search box in dictionary.com or wherever and after I found what I was looking for, I was already dreaming of Reddit. I fixed this by not using the mouse when I had to find word definitions. Alt+Tab to get the browser. Ctrl+T to open a new tab. Ctrl+K to get to the search box. Type ""define:xxxx"" to get the meaning. Alt+Tab to get back to Word. This way my keyboard never relinquished control to the evil mouse!

During weekdays, I knew I had to keep writing or else my writing window would close up. So I'd come home and first thing open Word. That would guilt me into writing again. Not only did I get a book done, I also wrote a short story right after that. I am a very lazy person and if I can do it, you can do it too. Hope this helps someone.

1364310368.0,153,self.writing,1b1lnq,"In praise of slowness (500 words a day, or less)",173,20,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1b1lnq/in_praise_of_slowness_500_words_a_day_or_less/,"This post ([3000 words a day vs 1000 words a day](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1b03ew/is_it_better_to_churn_out_3000_bad_words_a_day_or/)) got me thinking about the speed of writing a first draft.

What seems almost indisputable is that you must maintain forward momentum. Endless tinkering, editing and rewriting in the middle of the first draft leads to certain stagnancy and, most likely, an abandoned manuscript. But chucking down whatever comes into your head for thousands of words at a time can be equally problematic. 

Each to their own, of course. I just worry sometimes, when I read of people talking about writing thousands of words a day, that those of you who write a few hundred or even a few dozen each day might feel like you're doing something wrong. 

So I'd like to sing the praises of slowness, if you'll permit me. By slowness, I mean around 500 words a day, or even less. 

**Slowness is sustainable**   

Even on tough days, when you are tired, harassed, pressed for time, you should be able to find a few hundred words. The same is not true for a few thousand. Slowness lets you meet your targets 7 days a week without exhausting yourself. 

**Slowness gives you time to think, to be immersed in the book**

If you did 3000 words a day, you'd have most of a first draft written in a month. To me, that doesn't seem long enough to have a novel gestating in your mind. You've got to live with a novel-in-progress for a long time, let it steep inside your head, to get to the deeper places that give sustenance to good writing. 

This touches again on the idea of a 'good' 1000 words vs a 'bad' 3000 words.  For me, a 'good' piece of first draft writing for me is not perfect – editing is inevitable. What it means is it is, roughly, the right idea in the right place in the book; in need of polishing, but fundamentally well placed, the beginnings of something really good. 'Bad' first draft writing either needs to be cut or almost entirely rewritten. It's a bit better than not having written anything at all, but not by much.

You don't necessarily get to a good idea by writing the first thing that comes to mind and moving straight on. Often, you need to think of dozens of different possibilities for each sentence that you write before coming up with something that is beginning to be good. If you always write without thinking, at a furious speed, you may just be skimming along the surface of your thoughts, never achieving depth. 

**Slowness means that you approach problems...well, slowly** 

You that fluttery feeling of terror when you're coming up to a scene, a thousand words ahead, that you don't know how to write? Going slow gives you time to figure out what to do. Often, a scene that I have no idea how to write on Monday goes miraculously smoothly on Friday. Because I've been thinking about it all week, because I haven't smashed into it at 3000 words a day, I've had time to solve the problems before I get there.  

**Slowness is not that slow** 

500 words a day doesn't sound like much. But that's 3500 words a week. That's 14000 words a month. That's two mid sized novels a year. Not bad for just 500 words a day, eh? 

**Source, and disclaimer**

FWIW I'm a soon to be published first time author (trad publishing) and an occasional teacher on a university writing program. This either makes me someone who might know what he's talking about, or a lottery winning hack and mercenary of a decadent vampire establishment. Your mileage may vary.  

All this is just, like, my opinion, dude? All writers vary in their practice (see comments below). This is what works for me. It might work for you. 

**TL:DR Forward momentum is critical. Speed not necessarily so. Remember Hemingway: “Never mistake motion for action.”**

I don't even think I'm a quarter of the way to the finish line (it's a long story...probably a two book endeavor) but I hope that I can keep going.  

Some things I've noticed:  

1.) The more I write, the easier it becomes to sit down every day and do it. I've started feeling bad about myself if I haven't put in around 1000 words for that day (and that has happened plenty of times). I actually keep an excel spreadsheet (something that I discovered here). It helps me feel more accomplished about the work I've done, and gives me some useful statistics.

2.) It's okay if it's crap. Hanging around on this subreddit has taught me that my writing doesn't have to be top-notch the first time around.  All that I'm doing on the first pass is uncovering the story. Right now, my characters are cardboard cutouts, my environment is a poor excuse for a set, and my dialogue is lacking in any originality whatsoever, but THAT'S OKAY. It's ALLOWED to be bad (the first time through). Just knowing that took a lot of the pressure off and, because of that, made writing so much less stressful for me. All that I'm responsible for right now is making sure that the skeleton is there so that after the first draft is done, it can support everything else that I will need to add on.  

3.) Just because I have a plan for how I want things to turn out, that doesn't mean I should be locked into it. Having a general direction is often a good idea, but sometimes the story seems to have a mind of its own. Having some flexibility with my plot is really important, because forcing a specific plot on my story is like trying to change the course of a river. Yeah it works, but I might lose a lot of the inherent beauty as I try to make it work.  

4.) I try not to have too many expectations. That isn't to say I don't sometimes have confidence in my writing -confidence (and a touch of arrogance) can certainly be beneficial, but if I can help it I try not to imagine becoming famous from this book. In all reality, that's probably not going to happen. Frankly, this writing is probably going to be more of a practice novel rather than something worth publishing. Keeping my expectations realistic, and myself grounded in reality has actually pushed my creativity and productivity. Note: Results may vary.

5.) Damn it, HAVE FUN. Writing is one of the coolest things in the world. I know that writing can be hard, incredibly frustrating, and sometimes I feel like I would rather read Twilight cover to cover than write another page in my own book. When I really sit back and think about it though, I realize that I am literally creating something out of nothing. Without those 30,000 words I'm putting down, without the thousands more that need to come, my characters, my *world* would not exist. And in that same vein, I am the one creating it. If I want my character to be fat, then by God, he will be fat. If I want him to have a mole the size of a quarter that sprouting little hairs...then that exists. HOW FREAKING COOL IS THAT. I guess what I'm trying to say here is that yeah, writing is one of the hardest, most daunting things I've ever done, but with that, I'm giving life and form to things that were once lifeless and formless. That's the stuff that gives me chills.

All in all, 30,000 words is not a heck of a lot, but it's a start. Frequenting this subreddit has helped me chug along, and I hope that I can continue to do that. 30,000 words is a small victory for me, but it's still a victory and I wanted to share it. Thank you for all your insights, inspirational quotes, and suggested readings, even though they weren't always directed at me specifically.

1342514009.0,150,self.writing,woyk7,My first two weeks as a published author,171,21,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/woyk7/my_first_two_weeks_as_a_published_author/,"I posted here a couple of months ago about my ten year journey to getting my novel published with a major international publisher, HarperCollins. I thought I would follow up with a post about the first weeks since Release Day.

Even though July 1 was the actual release date, my novel hit bookstore shelves up to a week earlier, much to the delight of family members scattered around the country. Amazon and iBookstore, however, while taking preorders, did not allow downloads of the book until the designated day.

The period immediately preceding the release was taken up with liasing with my publicist about the upcoming events and the two week book tour that they were sending me on. Local events were my responsibility, and this required visits to the book stores in question, making sure they had stock, sending out invitations, getting the vibe happening on Twitter and my Facebook author page.

Because I live in a rural area I was able to launch in several nearby towns and cities. Each was well attended, and I was pleasantly surprised by those who came, and also by those who stayed away who I thought would be there. (That’s another story: Not everybody will wish you well).

I embarked on a journey by plane and hire car that took me across three states, from June 28 to July 16. I have been in so many beautiful book stores in that time, met so many wonderful advocates of the book. I have been told by a very prim lady that my book title, Rotten Gods, is immoral, and that she would not buy it for that reason. I have been complimented, flattered, and ignored. I have learned to hand sell by engaging with a reader in a store and talking to them about those universal topics—books and reading.

The most marvellous experience of all was being told by readers, particularly ones that I have never met, that they loved my book. One sent a handwritten note to my publisher, that I was able to photograph and paste on my Facebook page.  Others wrote reviews in newspapers and online. Others made phone calls, emails and social media posts. To have engaged with another human being, one on one, is the most special thing of all. I know I’m privileged, but I worked damn hard for it too.

This, after all, is what I dreamed of all those years ago.

*(Source: reddit.com/r/writing comment feeds)*

**1.** Don’t worry about publishers, only write as much as you need in order to tell the story.

**2.** Publishers prefer a first novel to be somewhere between 80,000 and 120,000 words, better shoot for around 100k, anything less will be too short.

**3.** No one likes purple prose. Do your best to describe the surroundings through dialogue.

**4.** Don’t write so much dialogue, no one wants to read a movie script. Use more prose to describe the setting.

**5.** When writing dialogue limit yourself to ‘he said’ and ‘she said’, and use them sparingly.

**6.** Expand on the text between lines of dialogue to give your characters life, don’t just say ‘he said/she said’.

**7.** Limiting use of the word ‘was’ will make your story flow better.

**8.** You’re using phrases like ‘he/she’, ‘he had/she had’, ‘he moved/she moved’, etc. too often. It makes it seem like the reader is viewing instead of participating, replace them with ‘the’ and ‘was’.

**9.** If you find a plot hole stuff it full of spray cheese.

**10.** Plot holes can help you develop ideas for sequels, save them for later.

**11.** If you happen to attempt a protagonist of the opposite sex just write a strong hermaphrodite, and choose the gender later.

**12.** Don’t start passages with the weather...

**13.** ...unless you can do it well.

**14.** The most important thing in writing is to be prolific, even if you’re penning garbage.

**15.** If you get writer’s block just keep writing, you can throw away hours of work later, at least you’ll know what not to do.

**16.** If you’re serious don’t write by hand, it’s too slow, and being a hipster doesn't put food on the table.

**17.** Don’t self-publish, self-publishing companies generally do a bad job.

**18.** You’re going to get rejected, big box publishers are dying and they can’t afford to take on first time authors. You’ll have to self-publish.

**19.** Your first draft is going to read worse than *Fifty Shades of Grey*, a smut novel that conspiracy theorists believe was written by a drunk five year old on Microsoft Notepad, deal with it, you probably won’t get published anyway.

**20.** Don’t get discouraged!

Normally, I couldn't care less, but there was some great discussion about disputed 'rules' for new writers in the comments. OP didn't like the disagreement and so deleted the post.

I'd like to continue the discussion about well-intended but dangerous rules for writers.

Here's the original post and a few comments from the original thread to get you started (don't worry OP, you can remain anonymous):

------------------------------------

I've learned a lot in school for journalism about writing in general, but here's the shit that works:

1. Never write a sentence with more than 30 words. ( according to a little birdie, only 5% of people who read a sentence with more than 30 words will understand what the sentence meant. Shorter sentences will reach more people. Never, not one word over 30, count them if you have to. Try and not worry about this during writing and clean it up during editing.
 
2. When finished writing anything underline all of the verbs. Next analyze each verb, best with a thesaurus, and make sure you're using the right one.
 
3. Use adjectives sparingly, and when you're finished writing underline them all and do the same thing you did with the verbs. Over-thinking the verbs and adjectives while you write can clog you up, that's what editing is for.
 
4. I'm going to say it anyway; active writing is very important. If you don't know what that is I suggest you google that shit.
 
5. Don't think of grammar as a strict set of rules, but rather a set of tools.
 
6. When you're finished writing anything, anything at all, read it out loud.
 
7. Know all of the parts of whatever the hell it is that you're writing. Break it down into small pieces.

8. And if you didn't already know this shit now you do. And remember kids: write drunk, edit soberish.

------------------------------------

So guys, what do you think is potentially dangerous advice for new and improving writers to take to heart?

What do you think of OP's advice?

1322299721.0,148,self.writing,mpram,The big Kindle store experiment - my first attempts to make a living through writing,172,24,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/mpram/the_big_kindle_store_experiment_my_first_attempts/,"Folk might remember a thread posted by [throwaway_writer](http://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway_writer) a few weeks back, where he claimed to have hit one grand worth of Kindle store sales in a single day. He showed us his sales sheets (which were awesome) but refused to reveal his publishing name or any of his titles, which meant that we couldn't really see how he marketed his work, his cover design, his blurb style...

So, I decided to throw caution to the wind, take all of his advice at face value, and [create a solid body of work on the Kindle store](http://www.amazon.com/Christopher-Ruz-Hayes-Kossmann/e/B005IHVH20/) - the difference being, I wouldn't stay anonymous. This way, if things work, I can show people why, and if they don't work, you can all see where I went wrong.

Throwaway's main advice to me was:
1) Sell short stories for 99c, and collections for $2.99. Also, organise collections along genre lines, so people know what they're getting. I did that, which gave me ten solid short stories and three collections ([Past the Borders](http://www.amazon.com/Past-the-Borders-ebook/dp/B004S2LGGS/) for scifi, [The King &amp; Other Stories](http://www.amazon.com/King-Other-Stories-ebook/dp/B005HW4CNM/) for contemporary fic, and [Nothing Too Dangerous](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Too-Dangerous-ebook/dp/B0067LH036/) for weird fic/horror).

2) Design covers that are crisp, clear, and instantly communicate genre and theme. I *think* I did that - I'm no graphic artist, but I think I hacked together [the best stuff I could](http://www.amazon.com/Poirot-and-the-Doctor-ebook/dp/B00681DKMK/) using just CC licensed photography, my friends, and photoshop.

3) Inside each book/story, provide a link back to just one or two primary books, which will drive those few leading books further up the charts, keeping them visible. I did that, choosing [They Trade in Eyes](http://www.amazon.com/They-Trade-In-Eyes-ebook/dp/B0067SN36M/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_4) and [The King](http://www.amazon.com/The-King-ebook/dp/B0067RJM4A/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1) as my leaders. So far, it doesn't seem to have worked, but I'll see where it goes in time.

People already seem to be responding pretty well to the change - for example, one of my favourite shorts, [The Last Broadcast](http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Broadcast-ebook/dp/B00690943O/) was up at #50 in anthologies today, despite me not having listed it in Anthologies... (I must have fucked up somewhere). All my best stories are up now, and I'm working on two more in the hope of being able to publish one new short story a fortnight.

Basically, it's my dream that every single one of us here should be able to make a living doing what we love, but we can't do that if we all keep our secrets to ourselves. So, whether things get better, get worse, or just sink in to mediocrity, I'll keep r/writing updated. I'm the guinea pig. If one style of cover works better than another, I'll tell you. If a certain set of keywords improves or damages sales, I'll tell you. In the mean time, if you see a shitty cover, tell me and I'll change it. A bad or boring blurb? Tell me, I'll change it, and we'll see if sales go up or down.

a) Someone asked about female POV, which I completely understand and really appreciate since many writers have a tendency to fuck that up. But when you only ask about female characters it kind of implies that women are inherently gendered while men are the default (and therefore don't need to be discussed). I just thought I'd see how people respond to the idea of discussing male gender norms in literature.

b) I am a woman writing a male protagonist. If I've noticed male authors writing female POV clumsily, whose to say I'm not doing the same thing? I'd appreciate some insight on writing male POV.

Disclaimer- since this is reddit, I feel I should make it clear that this isn't an anti-feminist MRA troll post at all.

EDIT: Love the comments, agree with a lot of them. It is important to write people, not gender. But I have actually been called out on writing heterosexual men awkwardly in the past.

The first story I wrote after the break was completely unsatisfying, both in writing and reading. I did everything I was supposed to, including taking a month off before diving into editing, but still felt pretty strongly that it was awful. I submitted it all but knowing it would be shot down so I could at least start collecting rejection slips. 

Tonight I received word that the magazine would not only be taking it, but also paying me the top amount they award for short fiction. Their website says nothing about length and payment amount being related, so I am hoping the decision is based on their opinion of the story instead. The story took waaay too long to write, so the $200 breaks down to about $3.50 an hour, but I'm way more excited about being published in a legit magazine anyway. I won't go as far as to say the money isn't important to me, but it's certainly the smaller of the two factors contributing to my excitement, something I never would have thought I'd say. [Here is a link to the magazine if anyone is interested in submitting and/or subscribing](http://www.raglitmag.com/). 

My point is not to brag (OK, maybe a little, it's late and all my friends are asleep) but to say that, no matter what the negative thoughts running around in your head say, **finish what you are working on**. When you're done, **submit that bitch**. I spent a lot of time after turning my story in fretting that it was so bad I'd end up on some sort of blacklist, and honestly still don't think it's that great of a story, but I'm having a far better night than I would have if I decided not to click the Send key a few months ago.

*Writing a novel is like working on foreign policy. There are problems to be solved. It’s not all inspirational.* James M. Cain

This is a dangerous thing to say. Perhaps my hubris will come back to haunt me. But I don’t believe in writer’s block.

Or, if not a full atheist of the condition, I am at least a skeptical agnostic of the God of Blocks. I can only speak for myself, and I am a writer of reasonably straightforward narrative prose. 

But I think it is mostly used by aspiring writers who don’t actually want to write. It’s a good excuse to throw oneself onto a sofa, flamboyantly crying “I’m blocked, I’m blocked!”. 

When you are starting out, you’ll do anything to live the life of the writer, and if you can achieve this without actually writing then so much the better. Writing is hard, time consuming, and often boring. It takes years to get any good, years more to write anything worth publishing. The temptation to get out of this hard work by attending spoken word events, writers groups, literary festivals and above all by convincing yourself that you are blocked is very strong.

There are things which can stop a writer writing, but they are not writer’s block as it is traditionally imagined – the complete failure of creativity, the inability to think of a single thing to write. They fall into three broad categories: fear, exhaustion, and catastrophe.

**Fear**

This is the most problematic, at first. The petrifying fear of the blank page, the blinking cursor. The terror of writing the wrong thing, of writing something unpardonably, embarrassingly bad. In truth, this never entirely goes away, but the seasoned writer develops strategies to deal with it.

Write every day and set up habits, so that you may numb fear with routine. Plan thoroughly and read widely, so that you know where you’re going and why you’re going there. Above all, give yourself permission to write badly. The paralysis of fear weakens when one discovers how much work is done in editing and redrafting, how much of the first draft is revised and discarded.

When you begin, you will write terribly. This does not matter. Later on, you’ll still write terribly. This matters even less. You get better at writing by writing. You advance your project by writing. Write your 20 or 200 or 2000 words for the day. Write them terribly. You will always advance by writing something, no matter how bad it is and no matter how slight your progress. Every day that you don’t write, you grow weaker. That is what you should fear. Be afraid of not writing. Never be afraid of writing.

**Exhaustion**

To write, one needs time and space, and the mental, physical, and nervous energy to make use of this time and space. If any of these things are lacking, writing can be difficult, or even impossible.

But the problem is not on the page. What needs to be done is to restructure the life so that more resource can be directed towards the writing. Sometimes these changes are minor. Get up an hour earlier. Drink less. Eat better. Get some exercise. Sometimes they are moderate to major. Go part time at work, move to a less expensive city, leave your failing relationship, take a sledgehammer to your wireless router or TV.

Sometimes you can make the changes in a week, sometimes it takes years to get to a position where you have enough resource to write. But if you’re consistently too tired to write, something needs to be done about it. Not enough of your time and energy are free to throw at the writing. Solve your problems off the page, then you can get to solving them on the page.

**Catastrophe**

Very rarely, the writer may be halted by catastrophe. This is not a catastrophe in the personal, physical, or romantic sense. This falls under exhaustion, for personal difficulties, severe illness or relationship disasters are powerful sappers of time and energy that will put you out of the game for a while. By catastrophe, I mean a catastrophe on the page.

This can’t be a garden variety difficult chapter, or a character who stubbornly refuses to come into view, or a cluster of malformed, hopelessly clumsy sentences that you can’t seem to fix. These can all be written around or edited later on. We’re talking about a serious stylistic, structural, or thematic problem that simply cannot be written through. You’re several tens of thousands of words in, and think that you’ve made a fundamental error in the planning and execution of the book.

You’re allowed to take a few weeks off in this case, so long as you spend it planning and reading, taking action. Maybe you have to chuck your draft out and start again. Maybe a retreat, replanning and rewriting of a few chapters will give you something that intensive redrafting may salvage. But the process is the same. Act, work, and keep at it. Don’t stare at the blank page and wish that you were dead. Do something.

When you’re writing a novel, there’s just so much *stuff* to get to. Forgetting all ideas of stylistic brilliance, thematic significance, six figure advances and lifetime legacies. Just putting together a novel requires a lot of work, and not all of it will be very inspiring. There will be 70,000 words or more in your book. Surely you can find a few dozen or a few hundred of them today, in temporary, wobbly first draft form?

Surely there is something that can be done?

I've been the sole producer / publisher / editor of a literary magazine for about a year now. I've accepted about 40 pieces out of the 300-odd submissions, most of which include more than one work.

I do my best to write at least a few paragraphs for every rejection -- my longest rejection letter clocked in at close to 1,000 words. I take this really seriously. I'll point out spelling errors (more common to see the type that wouldn't be picked up by a spellcheck, like ""it was is"" instead of ""it was his""), beautiful nuggets, and fatal flaws.

I end up writing some pretty similar things, though.

There are a lot of submissions that are otherwise great, but are ruined by the same problem: the writer does not trust their own writing. They are afraid, I think, that they did not write their concept well enough to impact the reader in whatever way they intended, and so they essentially tell the reader what to feel. This might take the form of a paragraph-long description of a Carveresque quiet interpersonal calamity, written so well that I feel like I might start pouring sweat, which is topped off / ruined with a line like, ""their relationship was never quite the same after."" 

I KNOW that ""show, don't tell"" is a cliche, but I still see SO many writers telling and not showing, or showing and THEN telling, which is more frustrating -- it's like seeing a beautiful bird in a cage instead of getting to feel like you are that bird.

So, writers, please, trust your writing, trust your poems, trust that you've gotten into something magical, and let your words speak for themselves.",,False,,t5_2qh2n,1340491764.0,,,True,t3_vhrap,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vhrap/advice_to_writers_of_short_fiction_and_poetry/,

I decided to stop listening to the naysayers and embark on a career in the literary field. I sent out a mass of resumes over the holidays to various companies but most never replied. Most of my past experience is in menial warehouse work and customer service.

I finally got a reply from a transcription and self-publishing company and an interview scheduled for January 17th. I was so nervous that I was fighting off nausea the whole time. The tension was mounted in my neck and caused muscle spasms the whole time. They asked me many questions I had no idea how to answer, my stammering must have been painful to watch. Afterwards I was sure I had bombed the interview and destroyed my chance.

The next day I received and email. My heart sank as I read the first paragraph stating that they could not offer me the position for which I had applied. Then I read the next few lines and my jaw dropped. The email stated that my interviewer was so impressed with me that they were offering me a part-time temp to hire position to see if I could develop the required skills in order to earn the full-time position.

I was so shocked and ecstatic that I had to wait until the following day until I could gather my thoughts to form a reply. Of course I accepted and was informed that they are even foregoing the usual second interview.

It's a small step but it's finally a step on a path I actually want to be on.

I would humbly describe it as literary fiction.  The aesthetic goal for the feeling of the book was(/is) a mashup between Murakami and the movie [Waking Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk2DeTet98o), with [Mr. Projectile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=TxNuHk7c_Xo#t=92s) doing the soundtrack (if there were a soundtrack to a book).   During the 3 years that it took to write, I traveled very frequently, so I tried to incorporate different settings into the mood and feel of the scenes (for instance, the scene where the character is riding in an ambulance was inspired by my trip to the emergency room in the middle of the night in Osaka).  The last line was actually finished in a temple in Kyoto, Japan.

If you're interested in reading but for some are unable to get it from the Kindle Store, then shoot this account a PM and I'll send you a copy via email.  Also, feel free to share it with family, friends, enemies (?), etc.

It's a very personal story, so I hope it means as much to you as it does to me.   So again, thanks for helping me!  I couldn't have finished it without encouragement from [/r/writing](/r/writing) :)

1323786074.0,134,self.writing,nazvk,Self-publishing and why hating it is counterproductive,169,35,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/nazvk/selfpublishing_and_why_hating_it_is/,"Self-publishing is the future. Traditional publishers are going to morph into pure marketing firms and play a smaller role as their percentage of the royalties drops. Fairly soon, there won't *be* traditionally published authors, not in the same sense of the phrase. Authors will hire *them*, not the other way around.

And why should any author, especially skilled ones, choose 17.5% royalties over 70% royalties?

There were quite a few people in that other thread judging all self-published work as crap, but there's virtually no reason for skilled authors to go the traditional route, either.

""Sifting through the crap to find gems"" is not your problem. It is Amazon's problem, and the problem of each distributor. They need to improve their site layouts and update their search algorithms. Have you noticed that even Amazon is terrible for browsing books? That will change. The system is already substantially self-regulating, as readers vote with their money... and it will become more effective as time goes on. Concerns over whether the market is 'flooded with indie dreck' are pointless. Nobody will ever see the 217,000,000th book that sits at the bottom of the lists, because it's terrible. It won't affect a single thing.

You know what the problem really is among authors who espouse negativity instead of trying to boost the community along?

Our metrics don't matter.

* Word count doesn't matter anymore. It's a relic of traditional publishing. Readers don't care how long a story is as long as the meat is all there and the ideas are complete - in fact, in many cases, *they'll never know how many words your book was.*

* Writing skill doesn't matter nearly as much as writers want it to. The keys are effective communication and entertainment (varying by genre of course). Readers in general don't really care if a work lacks good diction and good prose (re: Twilight) and they don't even care about overusing adverbs (re: Harry Potter). The dreck you hate at the top of the lists is there because readers know exactly what they're buying - and the dreck delivered it.

* People need more material now. They want a dozen good books by their chosen author, not one gigantic perfect one (because readers lack the ability to assess good writing). Self-publishing allows authors to produce much faster than traditional publishing and make a living now rather than five years down the line - and the works can still be fantastic if you're any good.

* The age of ideas is back in a whole new way. The world is more open, more full of honed ideas, more hurried, and humans are adjusting to a new way of absorbing books and the ideas therein. Internet-using readers are looking for a larger space of ideas than traditional publishing can provide. Those same 'gatekeepers' that 'judge' works to save us all from 'dreck' also eliminate most radical ideas. Authors are free to be as creative as they want with self-publishing.

* Life is moving faster. A relevant book needs to be published *now*, downloaded *now*, read *now* - not distributed two years down a pipeline. Self-published authors can have a book available for sale immediately.

And if you can't see the benefits of these things, you're just shooting yourself in the foot.

Let me put it to you this way: are you trying to make a living writing? What does a living constitute? $5k a month -&gt; $60k a year? Any self-published author worth a damn can make $5k a month and live his dream. Going full-time with self-pub will allow them to produce more, produce what they want, and to build their skills. As a culture, we're going to have more and better authors than ever before. Every single category, no matter how obscure, will have fantastic authors dedicated just to that genre.

Be one of those people. Don't pray for some ridiculous fat cat in a top hat and monocle to 'approve' your life's work. *Get it out there now* and cut out the negativity and complaining. Self-publishing is an opportunity - TAKE IT!


edit: Oh lord, I'm one of those people adding an OP edit. A few people seem angry at 'evangelists' espousing self-publishing as the one true path. It's not the only path, but it is incredibly viable, and there's no risk.

This is what I had from last night. I can't still complete one of the several projects I'm working on, so this is all I can do, for now:


Recently things have become stagnant. Days and nights blend together in a sporadic cycle, like flies circling a corpse. I’m just waiting for the move. I can’t write. Sure, I can string words together and put them on a page, but without glue to keep them together they fall apart at the seams. Usually these words call out to me through the ether; requesting me to invoke their names and give them form. Now all I hear is silence. 


I’ve deluded myself into thinking external factors can force the tales to be weaved, for stories to be fashioned. Do I think new software or an audio recorder; a digital notepad or an extra drink will help me write? Not anymore. I know what I need, simple motivation. A fear of failure is certainly another obstacle in my path, but the fact is that I need to sit down and write. Write like my life is on the line, because it most certainly is. My livelihood anyway.

It also may just be the fact that I’m running out of rage. My writing has always stemmed from dissatisfaction. I can’t seem to care anymore. The wars, the economic crisis; the ham-handed politicians that spout more garbage than a sewer main. I can go on and on about the state of affairs, but a hundred others have done so. Whining gets us nowhere. I can’t say I’m even angry enough to write about all that even if I felt like it. My words would be impotent and frail.

I’m moving from a big city to a small town next month. New job, new friends, new home. A new life. Less distractions and more focus. More empty bottles and full ashtrays and more trashcans filled to the brim with discarded notes. That’s what I see in my future. These things are all tools. They are all weapons that I use against my greatest enemy, myself. At the end of the day all I can do is sit down to a blinking cursor and let the melodious chorus of key-clacks lead me on my way. To sift through the bullshit and find that voice, the one that echoes in my mind and has gotten softer every day.  It’s time to break the dam and let my thoughts rage like a torrent, otherwise I fear I will be consumed by them.


**EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful, supportive, and creative replies ITT. I ended up hunkering down and developing one of my short stories that may very well turn into a novella, maybe something bigger. You guys were right, it's all still there.

(I have recently started rewriting something though, and it's going fine so far, but it's still early days.)

The reason for this post is to ""defend"" this approach I'm taking. I know ""write a lot"" and ""don't worry too much about a perfect first draft"" are common suggestions, but I still see people argue that they prefer to write only when they're inspired, or that the volume of words written per day is a vanity metric.

Maybe those things are true. I'd just like to offer some of the benefits of getting the word count done no matter what, even if most of the words end up being some lame conversation I just know won't make it into the story.

And so, here's why I started this habit, and why I continue it:

1. **Inspiration kicks in at strange times**. I've taken hours to write 1200 words, then some great idea will smack me in the face and I'll write the final 300 words in 5 minutes and be amped up to write for the next day. In an instant, despair can become the very thing that makes it all worthwhile.

2. **You can only ever write in the present moment**. If I don't write today, I figure, how can I be sure that I'll write tomorrow? When tomorrow arrives, it'll just become another ""today"". Writing in the present moment is the only thing I really have control over.

3. **No matter what, it'll suck**. Even the ""best"" part of my first drafts end of sucking in ways I can't even imagine while writing them, and taking longer to write something might make it suck less, but not enough to avoid tearing it to shreds. You'll just be tearing something a little nicer to shreds.

4. **A finished draft is easier to mould**. I haven't even begun to revise most of my stuff, but so many of the issues with the story and the character and the writing become blatantly obvious when you're looking at it as a whole. This is impossible to do effectively amidst the writing process.

5. **Your bad habits become obvious**. I write protagonists that are too passive, have characters shrug so much that they're surely developing problems with their shoulders, and info-dump through dialogue. There's a lot of other things I do poorly, and since I experience these in volume, every day, I can see (most of) them.

6. **There's nothing else I can do**. I'm not a professional writer, but being a writer is what I most closely identify with. As a result, I ask myself, ""What other choice do I have?"" I can either write, or not write. But if I don't write, then I'm not a writer. I think a lot of resistance stems from assuming there's an option.

7. **It's a fulfilling, every day achievement**. Even if my day sucks for a myriad of other reasons, I still have my writing. The writing in itself might be difficult, but each time Scrivener ticks over to the 1500 word mark of my daily target, a warmth spreads through my body, and I am victorious.

###

That's just some food for thought though. It's definitely not *the* way to approach writing. It's just how I do it, and I think it helps. :)

(Also, I'd argue that the consistency is more valuable than the specific target. 300 words per day for a year is more valuable than 2,000 words a day for a month. ""High volume"" is definitely relative to the individual. But I think it's a good idea for the daily word count to have some element of a struggle.)",Advice,False,,t5_2qh2n,1358077404.0,adv,,True,t3_16hl5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16hl5u/the_value_of_consistent_highvolume_writing/,

For my blog this week I decided to offer some suggestions on breaking into the Game Industry, and thought I'd share it here. Hopefully it helps!

Edit: Apparently I'm an idiot and did that wrong. Above is a link to my blog post. 

Edit 2: Here's an except (With a nod to Zero Punctuation). 

This is an ongoing blog about game culture, development and a primer for an introduction to the professional gaming world . We’re Boximals Studios – a video game studio in Vancouver, passionate about making games, the industry, and blogging about it!  Last Week was the second in a three part series with hints and tips on how to break into the Video Game Industry. 

This week’s blog is the third in a three part series detailing tips and tricks on how to break into the Video Game Industry. Today we’re going to focus on writing and, as with last week, we’ll look at skills and education needed to apply for a permanent job in the industry, as well as what is needed to work on your own projects.

So you want to write video games.

Part of me wants to just say “Don’t” and go for lunch early, but that’d be irresponsible and unhelpful. I’ve tried to highlight how difficult it can be to break into the industry, but here’s the real wall. In fact, realistically, there are only two ways to do it.

1. Be a published author or have had a script produced for some form of entertainment media (Web series, TV, Film, etc) and pitch yourself based on that.

2. Create your own projects. and use that as a way of gaining experience.

Most posted game writing jobs require at least two-three years minimum of experience working in the game industry as a writer. It’s a pretty massive Catch-22, but I can offer some ways to help.

A few days ago we began a little sub and started talking about how an amazing community like this *could* be a powerful tool for those looking to self-publish. 

Here's the ideals guiding our group:

1. We believe that we're stronger together.

2. We will help each other achieve our goals.

3. We believe that when one person succeeds the whole group is helped. 

4. We believe reddit writers deserve to make enough through self-publishing to afford a car wash now and then.

Based on these ideals we're going to try and begin a sort of ""imprint"" for self published, reddit member authored books. The idea is that anybody looking for help self publishing can get help from members of the group, recieve an imprint related to their genre, and benefit from increased downloads by members of the group. 

If willing to participate, writers can have a little blurb about their book placed in the book of another reddit writer in the same imprint. All they have to do is let another reddit writer have a little blurb in the back of theirs. 

The benefit there is that, obviously, there's more connections to your own work as you connect to other's. With the entire group downloading your published work, you expect higher rankings to kick-start your sales. With new books getting higher rankings (and which include a blurb about your own book) you also expect *your own* sales to increase.

Make sense? 

We haven't worked it all out yet, not by a long shot, so the sub is private for now - BUT - we want help. If you're interested in being involved in this project, (from design to logistics to layout to editing or just providing positive input, or maybe taking a leadership role as we organize) please comment below and I'll add you.

Don't write in your cover letter that you published in the East Buttfuck Review, or whatever. Unless you published in the New Yorker, The Paris Review, or another *major* publication, it just makes you sound desperate.  If you have been published in the entire canon of Buttfuck Journals, simply say, ""My Work has appeared in numerous small-press literary journals"" or something like that...

Don't submit genre fiction to a literary journal. I may love science fiction and apocalyptic adventure stories, but I'm not going to publish them here...

Don't be sexist or racist, and if your characters are sexist and/or racist, make sure I know that you (the author) hates them. 
***edit: As I noted in a comment below, I am not saying this because I think such stories are inherently immoral, or even bad. Rather, I am trying to inform you that they will never get published in a literary journal. Literary journal staffs, as I'm sure most of you know, are usually 75% female and 100% liberal.***

If you're going to write with highly stylized prose, it better be fucking brilliant--like *fucking briiiiiiiiliant.* Otherwise, I wont make it past the second sentence.

Funny fonts will make me hate you.

For the love of god, do not leave the name of the journal blank on your cover letter, and then write it in later by hand.

You are permitted, at most, 3 adjectives in a sentence (and even this is overly generous).

Please DO tell me if you actually work as a writer, or have been to (or are currently enrolled in) an MFA.   This will at least let me know that you have some conception of what type of writing a literary journal publishes.

Please don't make me read dialogue that consists of nothing but small talk, interspersed with loaded looks and glances. Passages like this will always make me want to vomit:

&gt;""How are you,"" I asked, looking her up and down, letting her know with my eyes that my feelings for her lingered.
&gt;""Fine,"" she replied, coyly smirking, licking her lips just to drive me crazy. ""And you?""

&gt; ""I've also been fine."" But really I hadn't. Really, I needed her.

**Note: this is not taken from an actual piece. This is much less inane than what I actually had to read**

Anyone who thinks that there are just *TONS* of great writers out there, but that most will never be discovered because evil editors only publish the trite, dumbed-down bullshit that will fly off bookstore shelves clearly has no idea just how much more trite and dumbed-down the bullshit that doesn't get published is...

If you cannot resist pedantry in your cover letter, how am I to trust that you will resist it in your writing?

Do not wait until the 5th page to get to the good part; I will never reach it.

Do not make your protagonist a deplorable human being; do not assume that just because your protagonist is based on you that she is not deplorable.

If you put a quote on your cover letter from a friend or old professor (or whoever) about how good your writing is, I will promptly assume the opposite of this quote is true.

Really, all I want is a well written story with an intriguing beginning, a developing middle, and ending that makes me say, ""Okay, I see why the author wrote this story.

Here's what I've learned so far.,139,20,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17qkpl/i_received_my_first_royalty_check_heres_what_ive/,"I got my first royalty payment of $7.83 from my party game book, The Movie Murder Mystery Party. It's not much, but it's a start! I used Lulu to publish the eBook version to the Nook and iBookstore and CreateSpace for the paperback version. I wanted to celebrate and share what I've learned so far about self-publishing. For reference, I have three books out now. The other two are Uncovering Oklahoma's 2013 Date Idea Book (just released a week ago) and Lessa's Unbound Dilemmas at the Library. 

- It's easier and faster to publish eBooks directly with Nook and the iBookstore than with Lulu. It would take about a week before the party game book appeared on each store when I used Lulu. Directly with the stores it was less than 24 hours.
- The iBookstore store is the only place you need an ISBN for an eBook. 
- On third-parties, skip them. For my date idea book and Unbound, I bought an ISBN to publish directly with the iBookstore. Although I won't get any payments until I reach $150 versus $5 with Lulu, but I will receive more. (Lulu takes a cut.) 
- The cheapest site I've found for an ISBN is $9 through ePubBud. The only catch is ePubBud is listend as the publisher with the broker, but you can list yourself as the publisher everywhere else. In other words, on iTunes for the Date Idea Book, Uncovering Oklahoma is listed as the publisher. 
- You don't get any payments if someone buys your book directly from Lulu if you set it for 0.99. However, I haven't had any one buy any of my eBooks from them. 
- Other than the iBookstore, you cannot set your eBook to be published on a future date. 
- The eBook version of The Movie Murder Mystery Party has sold more copies than the paperback version, which is surprising since the paperback version was designed so people can cut out the characters and clues for the game. The lesson: have an eBook version of your book.
- Publishing books with a bleed on CreateSpace is a pain. I ended up just reformatting my date idea book without any image bleeds. I'm happy with the print quality of all of my books with them. 
- Knowing the right person really does help. I am friends with a girl who works the front desk of a news station. I gave her a copy of my date idea book this afternoon about about an hour later, a producer from the station called me. I have my first interview next Friday.
- As for publishing on Google Play, the interface is not user friendly, especially compared to the Kindle and Nook services.

The purpose of this post is to thank you. You guys are some of the most astute creative minds I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Unlike most everywhere else on the Internet, you actually know what you're talking about. None of what little I have accomplished would have been possible without you. I just wanted to let you know that the advice and feedback you give have effects more far-reaching than you probably appreciate. Thanks for that.

EDIT: The extent and abundance of support has been overwhelming. You are what makes r/writing, and indeed Reddit, the place that it is. I cannot thank you guys enough. 

To those that have downloaded my book as well, thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you like what you read, if you think other people might like it as well, and if you want to help out, talk about Bump on your Facebook walls or Twitter feeds or other subreddits. Publicity for this book is entirely by word-of-mouth, and right now I have no mouths on my side to spread the word.

If you don't like what you read, I'm sorry I wasted your time but hopefully you were able to take away some lesson about what not to do with your own writing. I'm always willing to be chewed out via email, if you feel so inclined.

For everyone else, you can talk to me here for as long as this thread stays on the main page, or you can reach me via any of the methods under the ""Contact"" tab of my website. I will respond, I promise.

I'm working on another blurb as we speak and hopefully that will be more to your guys' liking. Look for it to be posted on the official site and Smashwords in the next few hours. Everybody's points about the blurb were monumentally helpful, and it's an issue I never would have considered without your help. Thanks for the input. Also, I've changed the book's presence on Facebook. Rather than asking you to ""friend"" my author page, which in hindsight is creepier than I intended, I've created a fan page for the book itself, so if you feel so inclined, all you have to do is ""Like"". I'm hoping this will be a more efficient way of getting the word out without requiring quite so much of a commitment from readers.

It’s easy to set a scene that a reader is familiar with. But a new world, or galaxy, filled with strange sentient life? That’s an awful lot of information to throw at a reader. It was an awful lot of information for you as the writer to come up with, too. It’s a big accomplishment, without doubt. But all that effort means nothing if there’s no story to tell within it.

But what constitutes a setting? Most people answer with ‘the time and place a story takes place in’. So one answer could be Victorian Paris. Another could be in an arm of a distant galaxy. But the place isn’t the only thing that creates the setting. The general populace creates it too, and their cultures. Languages. All those things that go into your worldbuilding, before you even decide who the protagonist is. 

Which is the problem, right there. To write about the struggle between two cultures isn’t a story. Broad stroke generalizations about the deep-set hatred between dwarves and elves is setting, even if you have one dwarven and one elven character that are forced to team up. It shouldn’t be a situation where you throw two characters together and they espouse for page after page about why their point of view is correct. Or go into the nuances of the conflict every time they open their mouths. 

What is your central conflict?

Ask yourself that every time you start a scene. The central conflict IS the hatred between the insectoid Klicklaks and the hated avian Flutters? Then how does that play out? If your piece sounds like a history lesson given by Ben Stein, then you’re providing the reader with setting again. Conflicts are personal. Each character has one, and each character has at least one person that embodies those things they hate. Characters need to act (have agency), and for that action to mean something, it must be opposed (Newton’s laws are even applicable to writing! Who knew!). Who is the opposing force? Ideas are not opposing forces! Ideas create the opposing forces, getting into the minds and guiding the actions of the antagonists. Your character may hate the concept of wanton abuse of natural resources, but without someone to struggle against, what makes him any different than a blogger sitting on a recliner sipping tea while they type out a scathing rebuke on their iPad? And that rebuke is nothing more than setting- creating the environment in which the conflict exists (Here is the situation, and here is the counter argument against it). It’s this small difference that causes confusion, and ends up creating genre writing that is nothing more than elaborate setting. 

Be aware of your characters, of their individual conflicts, and what constitutes conflict for them. If it’s an action they perform, it’s story. If it’s the reason behind the situation that prompts the action, it’s setting. Keep your work focused on story. While actions require setting to have meaning, setting itself is not the story.

First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, “Oh man, you must publish my story, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, set it aside for a week or two and work on something else. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Rework it. Do an extremely thorough **self-edit** or proofread. Get someone to **beta read** it (preferably someone who is not your mother) for a subjective second opinion. **Revise it some more.** Cut the fat. Expand parts that are sparse, but keep in mind – especially if you are submitting a short story – that it is important to keep your work as tight as possible. There is only so much room in any given magazine and you are competing ferociously for it. If a first reader finds typos and grammatical errors in the first page of your story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of, it will let you know the general tone and style of the stories the editors pick, so you will be more likely to get a positive response by sending a story along the same lines. 

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter, but there is a fine line. Having a sense of humor is okay, coming across as a smart-aleck assclown will not endear you to your first reader. 

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point, but the opposite. If your main character says “fuck” every other word and is generally a bad-tempered *Catcher in the Rye* knockoff, the first reader is probably going to roll their eyes and move on. 

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, it better not be there by the time you get ready to send it in for publication, because if there is, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, triple-spaced, every other word in bold, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you. 

* **Impressions are important.** If you make a good impression or get published in a magazine, any further submissions may be flagged for a higher priority of consideration than others in the slush pile. This is a very good thing for you. If, on the other hand, you make an ass of yourself by not following any of the rules above, the first readers will remember you, and not in a loving way. Don’t let that happen to you.  

* **Don’t send simultaneous submissions.** Granted, *some magazines don’t mind this,* and will make a point to say so in their submission guidelines. If there is no mention of “simultaneous submissions allowed” in the guidelines, do not submit to multiple magazines at the same time. Simple as that. Wait for a rejection letter before sending your work out to someone else. Nothing makes an editor shake their fist at the heavens more than to go through the cut rounds, pick a story they really like, only to see that that story has already been accepted elsewhere. It’s bad form. Don’t do it.

* **Consider the person on the other side of your submission.** They are usually unpaid, tired, eyesore, hungry, thirsty, and in dire need of a stiff drink. They are in the literary business because they love good writing, the same as you do. They are not the blackhat gatekeepers who are sabotaging your efforts at traditional publication. They are just doing their jobs, which is to make sure that they get the very best stories for the publication they’re working at. They have pride in their work, and they want you to have pride in yours too.

Thank You! for all your contributions. 

Please continue, and I will make a list for easy reference

To help give advice to future writers of this subreddit, 

please list things you wish they would avoid (bonus: add why). 

**For example:**

* Are there famous writers that use techniques you find unsavory, and what are they? 

* Are you a fantasy reader who keeps seeing things being ripped off from Tolkien, if so what are they? 

* Are you annoyed by seeing Shakespeare monologues in modern literature, if so give an example and why it doesn't work. 

* Do you see something that nonfiction writers keep doing wrong, if so why do you think that's the reason?

and so on. 

**If you could tell future writers what to avoid, what should they avoid and why?**

. . .

. . .

-Here's a list of submitted concerns from redditors in this thread. 

-These are not my own views, but a paraphrase of those taken from the ones posted. 

**--[Things to Avoid:]--**

* Creating Elongated or Unrecognizable Fantasy Names (ex: *Riddle Master Trilogy* by Patricia A. McKillip)

* Medium Confusion--Focuses on Imagery, Action, and Structure, rather than Story or Emotional Depth.

* Repetition of Character Traits and Thoughts (ex: *Splinter Cell series* by David Michaels)

* Overuse of Epithets or Referring to Characters through Descriptive Phrases. 

* Anachronisms and Chronological Inconsistency

* Attempting to Force Character Traits--like Wit--without actually creating it (ex: Dan Brown)

* Cliche Scenes--Protagonists who Kill for the First Time, then Puke

* Focusing too much on Scene, Object, or Detail Description

* Using Dreams or Prophecies to Forward the Story

* Overuse and Repetition of a Particular Phrase 

* Avoiding Character Depth for a Particular Character you put in the Story, because of Ability to

* Treating the Audience as if they're of Below Average Intellect--Too Much Explanation

* Use of Standard Tropes, and Not Enough Creativity or Originality 

* Use of an Impossible Unexpected Situation or Deus Ex Machina without Reasonable Connection

* Cliche Description Scene using a Character looking into a Mirror

* Creating Logical Fallacy with Obvious Problems that Characters seem to ignore (Ex: Lost)

* Repetition of a Plot Sequence (Ex: *The Sword of Shannara* by Terry Brooks)

* Incomprehensible or Hard to Read ""Authentic"" Dialect/Dialogue (Ex: *Their Eyes Were Watching God* by Zora Neale Hurston)

* Characterization and Descriptions that are Too Forced--into Dialogue or Narration usually

* Unnecessary Sexual Description or the Sexualization of Characters

* Cliche Names that are Obviously meant to be Metaphorical or Representations for Something else

* Unable to Keep Dialogue Focused and Realistic (Ex: *Wired* by Douglas E Richards)

* Dialogue is strictly used to Advance the Plot 

* Use of Rhetorical Statements in Relation to the Plot 

* Referring to Futuristic Technology or Anything with a Cheesy or an Unbelievable Pseudonym 

* Referring to an Object or Something whose existence wasn't previously established

* Trivializing personal difficulties or serious handicaps without reason to

* Have an Antagonist explain his motives or intentions to another character 

* Creating Characters that are Flat and have either no or unbelievable Motivations 

* The use of the word ""you"" in narration and never filter out unnecessary words 

* Referencing other books for moral lessons or emotional emphasis (Ex: *In One Person* by John Irving)

* Elongated sentence structure and use of unnecessary obscure words 

* Focusing too much on visual details, rather than trusting the reader to fill in the blanks

* Using a vocabulary that is unrelated to the time period of the setting 

* Unnecessary objective depictions of character actions--attempt to add in more detail without necessity 

* Using the epilogue chapter for resolution 

* Flat Characters that could be described as being ""perfect"" or have flaws that are unrealistic 

* Repetition of short sentences to create tension or drama 

* Creating information dumps in dialogue ",,False,,t5_2qh2n,1375112836.0,,,True,t3_1e1r7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1e1r7y/as_both_readers_and_writers_what_are_common/,

1338576170.0,121,self.writing,ufzqw,Ten Things Indie Authors Can Do to Sell More Books by Me,148,27,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ufzqw/ten_things_indie_authors_can_do_to_sell_more/,"1)	**Acquire new distributors**

a.	Amazon—you must be on Amazon. Only sign up for Kindle Select if you have 5+ titles or if your books are in a series.

b.	Barnes &amp; Noble—B&amp;N sells much fewer indie titles, but it isn’t hard to format an EPUB so there is no reason not to distribute with them.

c.	Apple—#3 ebook seller. Tougher to format for and less reward, but the tagging features make it easy to drive traffic to your book (see 2.c).

d.	Smashwords—the aggregator distributor. They take a royalty for only one action. Not worth it to use them to distribute to the above markets. But they are worth it to distribute to their other partners.


2)	**Optimize your sales pages**

a.	Description—How many times have you rewritten your description? Have you tried split testing it? Try new things with your description and use book sales or NovelRank.com to track the ranking to see how it does over time. 

b.	Cover—Reinvest money you’ve earned on a new cover. Call it a new edition and you’ll have an excuse to launch it all over again.

c.	Tags—Look at the best 10 books in your category and steal all their tags. Comb through the keyword list and pick out the best ones. Use those tags.

d.	Price point—Higher price points now rank higher for equivalent sales volume of lower priced titles. That means you might want to raise the price of your book to rank higher. High ranks tend to rise you up in search/category listings, which promotes sales.


3)	**Connect with your readers**

a.	Newsletter—this is a critical one, in my opinion. If you’re not doing this, you’re missing out on a huge portion of what internet marketing is. Try to collect the email address of every reader you have. Put a link in your backmatter, put a sign-up form in your sidebar, and put a link in your email signature. Get everyone signed up and keep them posted on new releases, events in your career, etc. The power of this cannot be overstated. 

b.	Social Media—more important today than it was yesterday, that’s how fast things are changing. A big part of digital sales is about having a platform. Social media is the absolute best platform building tool we have. Optimize your profile and sign up everywhere. Use them all.  

c.	Video—Record yourself talking about what is important to you. People you meet will watch and perhaps subscribe to your Youtube channel. The numbers when you start don’t really matter. You can be happy that you’ve got the confidence to do it. Most people don’t.

d.	Podcast—you can host your own radio show online. But beyond that, you can talk about your genre and readers of your genre will find you, and if they like you, they’ll check out your books. Your podcast can act like a rally flag for your readers.


4)	**Connect with book reviewers**

a.	Find book reviewers—stick to reviewers that review in your genre, and ones that have traffic and engagement on their site. Go for the big wins.

b.	Refine your pitch—ask friends to review your pitch, rewrite it even if you don’t think it needs it, and make sure to edit it with fresh eyes before sending it out.

c.	Maintain relationships—don’t drop off the face of the Earth after your review is placed. Send the occasional email or find the reviewer on social sites and connect there. Maintain that relationship and they’ll review all your future books too. 


5)	**Connect with writers with the success you want**

a.	Email—this is still the preferred contact method for most authors I’ve met. Always approach with a value proposition. Have something interesting or unique to say, have a tip for them, or whatever your unique value is. If you do this, it will take from being a bum asking for change to a potential business partner.

b.	Social media—once you are a fan, you are no longer a peer; or at least it is hard to make that transition (I call it the fan zone). So approach from a peer perspective and keep the gushing to a minimum. You are a professional.

c.	Phone—this is the old school way to reach someone. That said, nothing can compete with the phone’s ability to cut through all the noise and to give you a direct line with somebody you want to talk to. 


6)	**Connect with ebook podcasters**

a.	KindleChronicles—my personal favorite, Len is a great guy and his podcast converts.

b.	Selfpublishingpodcast.com—brand new podcast on the scene and the guys seem to be in the phase where they talk about themselves a lot. This is how most podcasts start, so I expect that to change when the audience grows larger.

c.	Ishouldbewriting—this podcast has been around for a while and it hasn’t really broken out. It seems to have a decent audience and is worth pursuing.


7)	**Guest post for reading blogs**

a.	You should already know about guest posting, so I won’t rehash that here. Just want to say: if you’re a fiction author, do not guest post for writing blogs. Guest post for reader blogs. Blogs that talk about your genre specifically are the best. 


8)	**Join reading communities**

a.	KindleBoards.com—the biggest and best of the ereading forums. You should have a presence here.

b.	NookBoards.com—another great ereading board, though not as popular as KindleBoards. Still a great place to meet readers.

c.	MobileRead.com—the smallest and most nerdy of the ereading boards. Sci-fi / fantasy authors should be happier here.


9)	 **Write and distribute a press release**

a.	Angle—press releases are for newspapers and now popular blogs to write an article about you and your book. You need to find a strong angle to approach your story from that will interest the press.

b.	Media kit—Description, tagline, 3 – 5 cover shots in sizes 68x90 up to 600x800, and any multimedia you’ve produced to go with it.

c.	Find the key people you need to send release to – Use Google or http://everyonewhosanyone.com/

d.	Write the press release—Don’t attach your media kit. Either link to the downloads on your site or simply state if the reviewer is interested you can follow up with ebook and media kit. If you are doing a print run or POD, offering a print book is a great way to make a new friend in the press. 

e.	Send to targeted people


10)	 **Start a new book**

But today while at B&amp;N picking up a book for my husband, I wandered over to the bestseller's wall and grabbed 50 Shades of Grey. My husband walks over and I hand him the book in disgust that THAT is what everyone is going crazy over. He reads/skims a few pages then puts it back down, sighs, then turns to me and puts his hands on my shoulders and leans down to be eye level with me and I'm pretty much like ""O.O Um. Problem?"" And he says the most amazing sentence along with those gestures that I felt so utterly uplifted from my slump: ""CatsSitOnEverything, you HAVE to finish your book."" 

I know that if it never gets published, if it never makes a sell, I will always have my number one fan right there beside me, able to look at a bestseller and still place my creation above it.

I used to write a lot of short stories when I was younger (ages 10-17) but haven't done anything since (I am now 21).  

I've had no formal training aside from a creative writing class in high school, if that even counts.  I am a junior in college as a music major, but have recently took up a minor in history and am now reading a lot, both analytical writings as well as literature.

Basically, if I were to test the waters as far as to see what I can do with this aspiration, what's the best way to start, and the best way to learn?  Thanks in advance.

You've never heard of me, so here are some little tidbits about my ongoing career as indie author and mischief-maker:

* I run [Red Iris Books](http://redirisbooks.com/), a micropublishing company.

* I have sold 30k+ books under one pen name this year.

* I have written and published thirteen titles under that pseudonym in the last eighteen months, seven of which are full length novels.

* I mostly write about werewolves, demons, and sword fights.

* I design all of my own covers.

* One horse-sized duck.

I am all about making Amazon's marketplace do the heavy lifting when it comes to sales, with minimal social media effort (I am a hermit). I am also a genre fiction dork, cover snob, and book writing machine.

And even if he chucks the books in the trash, I think the entire experience was awesome for the both of us.  I bought his collection of short stories a while ago and really liked his fiction and made it a point to tell him that I want to see more fiction from him and that particular book of fiction was one of the deciding factors that pushed me over the brink on publishing.  

I asked him if he'd allow me to give him some copies of my books and he more than graciously accepted and asked me to sign them for him.  

I thought for a while that this situation might be weird, or he might find the entire thing creepy, but I've been on the other side of the table and I know how much it means to me when people bring me their work I've inspired and I assumed he'd feel the same way.  

He was the most gracious and enthusiastic guy in the world about it.  And, like I said, even if he doesn't read the books and tosses them right in the wastebasket before he even got home, I think it was still helpful for the both of us to have some bit of encouragement.

I think sometimes a positive, encouraging word from a stranger is worth more than anything.

1. apply law to pop culture, a la [Law and the Multiverse](http://lawandthemultiverse.com/), and

2. provide guidance to content creators like you lovely people who want to know what might happen to your characters in any given legal scenario.

As far as the content of the novel, it's a [post-apocalyptic story](http://www.amazon.com/After-Fires-Went-Post-Apocalyptic-ebook/dp/B00B8INFAK/) that's 540 pages, set in the near-wilds of northern Canada. My reviews so far have been positive, but there haven't been many yet, so it remains to be seen if the book is actually good enough to justify its current ranking.

Here's a list of what I did, and please feel free to ask me about any of it:

1. KDP Select (allows Prime members to read for free and that apparently boosts rankings considerably)

2. Keywords - specifically targeted ""post-apocalyptic""

3. eBook and Paperback - released a day apart

4. Categories - I chose Science Fiction Adventure and Science Fiction Dystopian as my two KDP categories, and Science Fiction Adventure and Action &amp; Adventure for paperback. 

5. Mailing list / Facebook / Twitter - resulted in a few sales

6. Reviews - Managed to have two five star reviews, one on .com and one on .ca

7. SF Signal - I have a Free Fiction post where I mentioned the novel

8. Goodreads giveaway - not sure if any entries converted to sales

9. reddit - plugging away :)

10. Amazon Meet Our Authors - mentioned the book in the appropriate forums

11. Presentation - I think I got lucky with the cover and blurb, that they seem to be piquing interest.

12. Sample - I think the sample seems to be working for potential readers

13. Kindleboards - I have a link to the book in my signature

14(ish). I didn't do this, but Amazon has apparently been sending out e-mails this week promoting my book because it had good sales over the weekend. 

There are definitely things I wanted to do but didn't have a chance to, like send out advance copies, or... well, maybe that's all I feel like I missed out on.

But I've realized something important. All published authors, no matter how bad their work might be, or how heinously lazy their editor was - all these people have cultivated a talent that we all need to take notice of.

Perseverance. 

Despite how poorly we might say the finished work was, one thing all these authors knew how to do was persevere. They sat down at their desks every day and decided to tell a story. That, at least, is something I can respect and desire to emulate. Because perseverance is a talent. It isn't cultivated by laziness or by waiting for inspiration to strike. It is cultivated by hard work. In my experience, the more you write, the more you persevere, the more you will desire to write and to continue writing. It's a vicious circle of the best type. 

See, for every Stephanie Meyers out there, there's a Neil Gaiman or a Haruki Murakami or a George R.R. Martin.

I've had to cut some of it to fit so read the entire thing at http://joeducie.net/2013/07/11/time-management-tricks-for-the-time-impaired-writer-part-one/

Utilising these tips allowed me to write five novels since May of 2012, two of which are published, a third which won the [Hot Key Books Young Writers Prize](http://www.guardian.co.uk/childrens-books-site/2013/apr/16/guardian-hot-key-books-young-writers-prize) at the London Book Fair (due September 5th), and a fourth which should be released October. So let’s get underway with Part One!

.


**Preparation is Key**

Success doesn’t favour the talented or even the lucky. Get that nonsense out of your head and focus on the key disciplines of the successful writer. Namely: preparation!

Thinking you’re going to be the next ‘overnight’ success and at the top of the NYT Bestseller list come Christmas is a fine thing to think. But it’s a thought full of hope and smoke, you know? I guarantee you that anyone who actually does make that list doesn’t consider it dumb luck or any amount of raw talent. I read a quote once, I forget where and to who it’s attributed, but it read along the lines of this: *We compare our own lives to everyone else’s highlight reel*. True, no?

What I’m getting at is we’re exposed to these overnight successes—books from first-time authors that sell a million+ copies in the first year, rocketing the author to superstardom and fame. But what we don’t see are the years of hard work the author spent in obscurity, learning the craft of storytelling and actually producing word slush. Sure there are outliers in any industry, but for the most part success comes from discipline, hard work, and time management.

Being prepared to undertake such stringent management of your goals, being prepared to suffer the discipline of carving out chunks of precious, precious amber writing time, is the only sure path on the road to success. You will wade in the river Failure at times, you will want to take shortcuts that end up costing more time in the long run, and you’ll want to be lazy. But wouldn’t you rather be successful?

Oh, and I’m not defining success here as the NYT Bestseller lists. Sure, that’s a measure, but not a fair one. Success here is a completed novel, thus propelling you beyond 99% of people who consider themselves writers. Small steps that begin with proper, prepared time management!

.


**Trick #1: The Life Log – Or How I Learned to Embrace the Spreadsheet**

How are you with Microsoft Excel? Passing knowledge? Hard to avoid the program, really, and you shouldn’t—Excel has become my number one tool for time management. If you’re a little fuzzy on how to use Excel, here’s a bunch of free online courses.

A few months ago I wrote a post about keeping a [writing log](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/11la0h/on_keeping_a_writing_log_and_hitting_a_daily_word/). I’m writing a follow-up post to that soon on how I expanded the initial spreadsheet to capture data such as time spent writing, words p/hour, average words p/month, and so on. I still stand by that writing log. Monitoring my productivity showed me just how simple the writing process could be—if you’re prepared for it. Here’s a screenshot of my writing log now:

[Image](http://joeducie.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/writing-log-screen-shot-2013-07-11-at-2-07-04-pm.png)

Note: my spreadsheet uses the Australian financial year, July to June, to work out averages and what not. So it’s not looking too flash so far this year because it’s only been keeping track of the last 11 days. And at the beginning of July I started a new job, which meant a few days in the red. Back on form now!

But anyway: monitoring productivity. For example, I know it took me only 75 hours to write the first draft of Broken Quill, which came out at 72,000 words. Just over three days, you say? Yep. I know – I monitored. Those 75 hours were spread over 46 days, and as you can tell, I averaged a little over a 1,000 words an hour and wrote for just over an hour and a half a day. A month and a half isn’t too shabby for a novel-length first draft. Then came rewrites and edits, of course, but with the bones of a story on the page, a finished skeleton, the rest is easy. Well, not so much easy as… less hard.

Since using a writing log I’ve expanded the idea into other areas of my life. Most notably: finances. I keep a similar log monitoring my income/expenses. With a fortnightly salary, this is fairly straightforward. If you’re on writer’s money, which is to say irregular and often disappointing, then it can be a little harder to monitor, as monthly income can vary. Use an average or find out from your publisher (easy for those using KDP), what to expect royalty-wise. Again, this is being prepared—the key tenet of time management.

Keeping a log makes sure I know where and when, precisely, my income comes from, and where it’s going, on every day of the month or year. Which leads me to my next trick…

.


**Trick# 2: Automate, Automate, and Automate**

If you’ve sat down and spreadsheet’ed your income/expenses, then the next step is to anticipate and actively eliminate the time and some of the worry involved in keeping your finances in order, thus freeing you from stress and affording you time to write. Use your online banking to automatically transfer funds to an account to cover monthly costs such as phone, internet, and rent. Bills that are unavoidable but usually the same amount every month.

You set up a transfer from your cash account, say on the 1st of every month, for the bills and transfer the full amount into whatever account (and you should have a specified one) the relevant organisations direct debit. You know how much to spend, what’s left, and can rest easy knowing that everything is paid on time, always, and that you only have to spend a few minutes every month ensuring those companies are charging you correctly. Being prepared like this removes stress, the nagging feeling of not having enough funds to pay the bills, and leaves you with extra time to write.

Moreover, set and anticipate future expenses. One of the bills that used to take me by surprise was the car registration every six months. Usually about $300 for my particular vehicle. I always had a vague idea that six months was nearly up and then, sure enough, bam! $300 please pay in 21 days, Mr. Ducie.

I grew tired of such expensive surprises. So for the last few registrations, I’ve automated $50 a month into a ‘future expenses’ online account. An account where I specifically transfer a portion of my monthly income to paying bills I do not expect to see for months or even a year. Some examples of the transfers I’ve got scheduled every month:

Emergency Fund: $150 p/month x 12 months = $1800 (everyone should build an emergency fund).

Car Rego: $50 x 6 months = $300

Insurance: $70 p/month x 12 months = $840 (this one is particularly good and let’s me pay the year’s insurance bill all in one hit. Bonus: most insurance companies offer a discount for paying annually instead of by the month)

So as you can see, the funds are there, money set aside from my income over an entire year for an expense that I knew was on its merry way. Sure I’m still spending $300 when the time comes, but this way I’m certain I’ll have the money, all my dollars and cents are accounted for and put to work, so when I pay the bill I do so feeling in control and (slightly less) resentful.

If you can afford it, the real trick would be to save double what was needed, that way you’re always a year ahead on anticipated or expected expenses. Think about it – a whole year without the stress of those bills that seem so far away and yet always arrive too soon.

Although this has very little to do with actual writing – indeed, next to nothing – your mood and desire to write will be impacted for the better by automation.

.


**Trick #3: Carve Out a Slice of Writing Pie**

Okay, so we’ve looked briefly at relieving financial stress in your day—an overview, which we’ll explore more in future posts—now let’s go writing-specific for this last trick of Part One!

You have 24 hours in your day. We all do.

How many of those hours do you spend writing? How many should you spend writing?

If you look my writing log spreadsheet again, you’ll see chunks of red, yellow, and green. The column turns green if I write 2000+ words on any given day, yellow on days between 1000 – 2000, and red for anything under 1000 words. I consider writing a responsibility, a proper job, and one where I must perform. Less than a 1000 words to me is not performing in my role (your average in two hours may be more or less, to each their own) and I know once I get underway I can write on average 2000 words in 2 hours. Find your average, which if you’re keeping a writing log will be rather easy, and set traffic-light coded progress markers.

So of my pie cut into 24 slices, two of those slices are dedicated to writing. Preferably two in a row, as I get more done in one solid block than over say four half-hour sessions spaced throughout the day. Not to say you shouldn’t use a free half-hour. Indeed, that’s kind of the point.

Some quick calculations:

24 hours a day:

Work: 8 hours (average work day)

Travel time: 1 hour (varies, of course)

Writing: 2 hours

Sleep: 7 hours

Current total = 18 hours

That still leaves you 6 hours in the day for any other tasks. Kids to school and back home if you have them, meals, cleaning, laundry, bit of TV of an evening or a pint at the pub. You won’t be wasting time paying bills, will you, because they’re all automated now. Again, preparation and carving your pie into adequate and fair slices for the given task will increase productivity, guaranteed.




Now can you think of any others ways to automate your lifestyle? Increase productivity? What do you do to manage time? I’d love to hear from you in the comments or an email.

1344661521.0,111,self.writing,y1b17,A bunch of little writing tips I've picked up from various places,138,27,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/y1b17/a_bunch_of_little_writing_tips_ive_picked_up_from/,"**1.** The more you can give up control about what you write, the more genuine your writing will be.

**2.** Making room in your life to write generates even more room for writing.

**3.** Read outside your interests. There are over a million books published every year—and that doesn’t count stories just posted on the Internet. Pick up a New York Times bestseller that looks somewhat interesting, and stick with it. Read mysteries? Try a sword-and-sorcery fantasy. Read some literary SF, or non-fiction history about a period that interests you. Almost everything you read will contribute something to your writing and make you a more well-rounded author.

**4.** Write outside your interests; challenge yourself. If you write the same thing over and over, you’ll fall into a rut. Some of the most successful books merge genres, or bring something interesting from one field into another. After reading something outside your normal scope, try writing something related: a murder mystery, or a romance, or a travelogue.

**5.** Ask yourself: what does this character want? Many examples of amateur fiction have the problem of a main character thrust into a plot. A narrative is more engaging when the reader knows that the main character wants something and wants him to get it (or doesn’t want him to get it!). “Here’s a neat character and then WHOA something happens to him” has the potential to lose the reader quickly, unless the “WHOA something happens” is something really bad and the main character needs to escape, in which case it had better happen FAST. Don’t spend two chapters setting up the main character’s life and then take him away from it. We should know within the first page of a short story, or the first chapter of a novel, what the main character wants. If we don’t, then we’d better be engaged for other reasons.

**6.** Write a thousand words every day. If you are going to get better at writing, you need to write. The world is not going to hand you time to write: you need to wrestle with your life and rip an hour from it, or a half hour, every day.

**7.** Eliminate many of your adverbs, especially in dialogue tags. While they are useful in moderation, they’re certainly one of those things that lends itself to overuse. Authors sometimes use them as shortcuts to push the character’s attitude at the reader, when you should be able to get the attitude just from the dialogue or from the actions. So it comes off as the author saying, “I’m not sure this came across, but just in case, have an adverb.”

**8.** Find a ‘writing buddy’ whose passion and interest matches yours. You may not have a lot of control over this one, but keep putting your writing out there in public. Respond to people and take note of the ones who offer you good feedback. And visit posts other people make showcasing their writing. If they ask for critique, give them critique on a level you’d like to get.

**9.** You don't want the opinion of another writer - writers are competitors. If you are a writer, delcare yourself the best writer and be done with it.

**10.** Proofread your finished manuscript backwards, sentence by sentence, because then you pay attention less to the context and story and more to the structure and grammar of that single sentence. Too often you get wrapped up in the plot and your brain will fill in the gaps where there are errors. If you are reading it backwards then you are forcing your brain to pay attention.

**11.** Write what you know. How do you make that which is your everyday into the stuff of literature? Listen to your heart. Ask your heart, Is it true? And if it is, let it be.

**12.**  What isn’t said is as important as what is said. In many classic short stories, the real action occurs in the silences. Try to keep all the good stuff off the page.

**13.** Writing should be something that flows naturally - metaphors, similes, figurative language, anything, should form along with the story and not be dropped in haphazardly.

**14.** What's your character good at, what's he comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?

**15.** Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle - seriously, endings are hard. Get yours working up front.

**16.** No work is ever wasted. If it's not working, let go and move on - it'll come back around to be useful later.",,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,,,True,t3_y1b17,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/y1b17/a_bunch_of_little_writing_tips_ive_picked_up_from/,

Despite the often torturous moments writing can cause us, it can also be incredibly joyful. It may be laborious, but it is a labor of love first and foremost. And I'd rather play with characters, even uncooperative ones, than have a boring, depressing job.

Rule #2: DON'T BE AFRAID
For me, the hardest rule. Don't be afraid to try things, and don't be afraid to fail. Just write...something that's easier if you're less worried about the outcome.

Rule #3: WRITE FOR ME
and 3a) Avoid the word ""should""
This doesn't mean totally disregard constructive criticism or your audience. It just means that first and foremost, you need to like what you're writing, otherwise it's unlikely anyone else will. It also means you'll probably write a lot more and have a lot more moments of fun (see rule #1!) as opposed to writing feeling like a job - even if it IS your job. For example, no more saying ""I SHOULD write a family drama next because it's my usual genre and I need to add to my portfolio, but I really want to write sci fi."" Just write the sci fi - it's still writing practice, and since it's calling out to you, you'll probably have an easier time of it. On an even more practical note, if you have notes to address, and you think ""I SHOULD start with this scene because xyz, but I really want to start my rewrite by working on this other scene"" work on the 2nd one! 

Anyway, these are my rules and I've been trying to stick to them. When the evil doubt and writers' block try to seep in, the rules have been a tool to fight them. I hope they help you guys too (or inspire you to your own writing rules)!

I'm serving as fiction editor for a bimonthly paper out of New Jersey that recently started publishing fiction. Both the publisher and I feel like this is a part of newspaper tradition that has sadly been forgotten. My own road to being a published author began in papers, so we both believe in this outlet. Good reader base, and the work will (or should) appear online, so you can show it off nationwide.

And did I mention this is a PAYING outlet? The publisher has set aside a nice (frankly, more than he can afford) budget to pay fiction authors. And I can personally attest to getting paid for work in the Signal. I wouldn't be posting this otherwise.

EDIT: Upon request, added a section on rights below.

Anyway, just wanted to post a big SEND US STORIES invite and our guidelines. Here they are:

**THE RIVERSIDE SIGNAL FICTION GUIDELINES**

**WHO WE ARE**

The Riverside Signal is a small, fiercely independent community newspaper published in central New Jersey. We’re not corporate owned, we’re not corporate driven, we just want to create a great product. But we’re not simply devoted to the spirit of what a community newspaper can and should be, we’re also devoted to what newspapers USED to be – publishers of great fiction.

Some of the greatest works of literature of all time first appeared in newspapers and magazines. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin was serialized by the National Era before becoming one of the most important novels in American history. Frank Herbert’s legendary Dune was first published in Analog. And almost the entirety of Charles Dickens’ work first appeared in newspapers. Among many, many others.

We want to bring back that tradition.

The Riverside Signal serves 10,000 readers along the Jersey Shore. Visit www.riversidesignal.com for more information.

**WHAT WE WANT**

We want good fiction. We have a particular leaning towards smart science fiction that tickles our Twilight Zone sweet spot, but ultimately we are open to all genres and all approaches. What we want is quality. DON’T send us your attempt at the next Twilight or Fifty Shades of Grey or The Da Vinci Code. DO send us your attempt at Slaughterhouse-Five or Blood Meridian or Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  

Previously published work is OKAY.

Previously unpublished work is OKAY.

We’re not worried about first rights or anything of the sort, we’re worried about high quality material.

*EDIT*
**RIGHTS**

We are seeking one-time, non-exclusive print (and likely digital) rights. No anthology rights requested, no reprint rights requested. People are free to do whatever they like with their story. Sell it again (and again and again), post it on their website, skywrite it, and feel free to do all of that even while it's in the paper. All we're doing is paying for the right to print it in the paper, once.

*EDIT*

**LENGTH**

Ideal length is 2,000 to 5,000 words. 

Works under 2,000 are welcome, but take note that works under 1,000 words begin to be too short for our needs. 

Works over 5,000 words will be considered, but the work will have to be EXCEPTIONAL to be considered. We withhold the right to serialize lengthier works. If a decision is made to serialize lengthier works, the Signal will work with the author to select an appropriate place to split the story.

Works over 20,000 words, please don’t bother.

**ILLUSTRATIONS**

The Signal reserves the right to hire an illustrator to create images to accompany your story, when appropriate and desired. Images are not guaranteed to accompany every story. Images submitted by authors may be (and likely will be) ignored.

We do not currently publish illustrated fiction. Please do not submit it.

**COMPENSATION**

The Signal pays 3 cents per word or $150 per story , whichever is smaller.

Serialized stories will be paid as if each installment is a separate story, i.e. 3 cents per word or $150 each edition .

**HOW TO SUBMIT**

Email stories to fiction@riversidesignal.com.

Please send stories as ATTACHMENTS, not in the body of the email.

Rich Text Format (.rtf) is preferred. Microsoft Word (.doc) is acceptable, as is Plain Text (.txt). Please do not submit .docx, PDFs, Kindle format, or anything other than .rtf. .doc, or .txt.

Please allow 2 to 8 weeks for a response, depending on our volume. We will provide a personalized response when possible, but understand that it will be form letters when we are busy.

Please DO NOT write to inquire about the status of your story. We will not respond. It may even bump you further down in the queue. So please refrain. You will hear from us when we’ve reviewed your story.

**MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS**

Is your story currently submitted to another publication? That’s okay. We don’t care. Just make sure THEY don’t care, too.

**WITHDRAWAL POLICY**

After you submit a story, please don’t withdraw it. That can become a problem for us. If extenuating circumstances arise, drop us a polite note. We’ll work with you if we can. (If we’ve laid out your story, we can’t.) We reserve the right to block submissions from authors who do not respect this policy.

If you withdraw your story because you want to improve it, don’t bother submitting it again. We want your best right out of the gate. Don’t send us improve copies unless we specifically request it. Attempts to work around this policy will get you blocked from submissions.

**CONTACT**

If you have any questions, please write fiction@riversidesignal.com.

Please DO NOT inquire about the status of your story. We will not respond. It may even bump you further down in the queue. Please refrain. You will hear from us when we’ve reviewed your story.

Please DO NOT inquire about whether you should or should not submit your story. If you have doubts, don’t submit. When you have no doubt this story is worth our attention and that it is as free from errors as you can make it, THEN submit.

Otherwise, reach out to us.

Thank you.

1325009847.0,110,self.writing,nshlo,I made a spreadsheet that may help anyone trying to get into publishing on Amazon.,123,13,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/nshlo/i_made_a_spreadsheet_that_may_help_anyone_trying/,"Since [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/m2ejo/broke_1000_in_one_day_for_the_first_time/) and the subsequent follow ups about making a lot of money selling Kindle Books in different categories, I decided to make a spreadsheet of every category in Amazon, and how many titles there are in each.

My thought process is that adding titles to categories with lower than average amounts of titles will statistically give the author a greater chance of sales. 

Since you guys helped me out when I was writing, editing, and publishing [my book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Loki-Variation-ebook/dp/B006HSX3EY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325009551&amp;sr=8-1) (shameless plug, reduced price!) I figured I would share my spreadsheet so anyone who wants to can see which categories they have a higher chance of selling in.

Obviously, the exact numbers change daily as more authors add titles to each category. This isn't meant to be precise. It's more of an idea of which categories need more titles, and will probably become obsolete in a few months.

Hope this helps, and let me know if there are any questions about the spreadsheet or if I can help in formatting or anything!

It kills me that the writing forum here is filled with the same few posts and the actual writing either gets pushed aside or pigeonholed into a much less active subreddit where it is less likely to get the attention it deserves.

I'm not saying we have to go full Nazi and make this a strict writing-only forum, we should of course still have the fun threads/articles pop up occasionally but lately it seems all anyone ever posts is (and perhaps this is cynical of me) self-promoting how-to-write blog posts, and no actual writing. 

I know I could just leave if I don't like the things around here, but the community is *great*, and we all know it.

These 'Writer's Top 10' lists and posts with writing tips and tricks that every writer should conform to if they want to churn out as much quality writing as they possibly can.


 The fact that these lists exist isn't a problem at all. How widespread they are is. Everywhere I look I see them popping up and they all share the same advice over and over again to the point where a lot of fledgling writers (myself included) could begin to wonder 'am I doing this wrong?'


'Write at the same time every day'


'Write for the same amount of time every day'


'Plan. Plan. Plan.'


I think all of these rules are a terrible infliction on the writing craft. Especially the last two. If I felt forced to sit at a desk for 2 hours and not enjoy myself I'd soon hate what I'm doing and I do not want that to happen. With planning, it definitely has its uses. I'm in no way arguing that, but it is by no means necessary. In fact, I advocate not planning. and here's why:

 As I write my book I’m also reading it for the first time. Each time I finish a sentence and begin another I’m excited about where my story is going because I honestly don’t know. I find myself thinking ‘Oh shit, really? What’s gonna happen now?’ and I’m genuinely as excited writing it as I want my future readers to be (if any exist). I think that’s the most important thing, the only universal writing tip there is: Love what you’re writing.

That's what I've been calling organic writing. Writing how much you want, when you want and I guess more importantly without structure at all. I think it really helps preserve my love for it and I don't want that to die. 

Another thing about these lists is I think they stifle actual discussion of the craft. the more I see these lists posted the less I see people talking about the other, more important aspects of writing. For example, the different motivations behind doing it, different techniques for writing certain things and discussions on plot and why certain things are lazy/genuinely interesting.

I realise the content on /r/writing has been pretty great recently but this is just something I really wanted to discuss.

Whether we spoke directly or you posted something in the past, the information you provided was priceless.

[I'm One!](http://www.amazon.com/Im-One-ebook/dp/B00A6JXELW) is now available on KDP, and [Createspace](https://www.createspace.com/4046066)! It celebrates all of the fun things one-year-olds do. It would make for a fun bedtime read with your toddler. It's free today (11/16). If you pick up a copy, I'd love to hear some feedback.

Because I found it difficult at times to find answers to questions about children's books, here is some info of my own I can pass along:

* Design your book with both print and digital formats in mind. I chose an 8.5"" x 8.5"" layout for the print book, but eReader screens are not square. I had to be cognizant of where content lied on the page. I kept margins of 6""x 8"" overlayed on my workspace in order to remind me of how things will look when cropped on Kindle. I went through 10 pages of the book before realizing this, and reformatting for the 6:8 ratio was a pain.
* With a children's book, you will likely upload your book to Createspace as a PDF. Because of this, it is not recommended to allow CS to automatically generate your KDP version. It will royally F it up. Upload your own KDP-ready file.
* See jakecaramel's [comment](http://ww.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/owyzu/childrens_ebooks_formatting_question/c3ktap6) about KDP image formatting. This was the simplest and most effective template I found. Other templates would produce strange characters throughout the book or space things out oddly. His template was clean and perfect. Also, the recommendation to have images at 600x800 pixels seems to work well with all of the devices I tested it on.
* Use KDP's mobi creator. Make a zip file containing the HTML and images, then upload it to KDP. It's free and easy. I found little need to buy a third party mobi creator.

I don't have many answers for the marketing portion yet, but we'll see how these first few weeks go. I'll be happy to answer any other questions about hurdles I've encountered during the creative process.

1322769060.0,110,self.writing,mwht8,My girlfriend of 7 years and I recently split up. We owned a house together. I wrote this while spending a night there while it's up for sale. I'd also been up for 2 days straight and working through some personal stuff.,140,30,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/mwht8/my_girlfriend_of_7_years_and_i_recently_split_up/,"It’s a cold night. I hear the soft crunching noises of my boots as I walk through the freshly fallen snow and up the steps. My key unlocks the door. I go inside, but I am not home.

Life is strange. Most of us don’t really live in our lives, we live in our future lives. It could be in a dream, a financial plan, a child’s future, a partner, tonight’s dinner. Our perspective is towards the future, not the present. We live in the foreshadowed footprints of our future selves. It’s not wrong. Maybe it’s just part of who we are. Maybe it’s supposed to be this way.

But there are also those who live in the past. Stuck in a moment, frozen in time, securing a seat in our memories forever. It’s a place, a person, an event that evokes that feeling of nostalgia. It’s a powerful thing. It can take the smallest memory and warp it into a life changing event. It can leave a man chasing a ghost for the rest of his life. Searching for something that never existed. Searching for a figment of his own imagination.

In reality, even those who are stuck in the past are still living in the future. They still search for a way each day to rekindle their past and bring it back. Their actions are based on a belief that their future can hold what their past did, if they can just find their way back.

It’s quiet now. There are no sounds from the kitchen, the living room, her office. No sounds of idle television. No more clangs of dirty kitchen dishes or cell phone chimes. The sounds of the piano are gone, as are the sounds of her voice. The house is an empty shell. The ghost of a past life. A place where memories were born and will stay in my mind forever. Nostalgia.

I stand in the doorway to our bedroom. The bed remains, as does the furniture. Everything is as it was. I can see her lying there, I can almost touch her. I can hear her laughter, see the way she breathes when she sleeps, the way she wakes up and looks at me, sleepy eyed, as I crawl into bed with her. It’s all so real. 

But, in a matter of moments she is gone. The bed is empty and cold. My ears ring with silence. I don’t go in, I stand in the hall and look through the doorways like a window into a memory. I’m an outsider, peering into a slice of a life that once was, not invited to go in, but allowed to stand outside and watch. Every doorway, a window to a different memory.

She’s sick so I rub her back. She’s can’t sleep so I scratch her head softly. I’m sick and she cares for me. I kiss her gently on the lips as we both lay down together. This was my present, which I lived for many years, but only now that it has become my past can I see it. I was still living in my past then. A past filled with good memories and great feelings. I ignored my present and, when looking to the future, could only think of ways to rekindle those past feelings and memories. I was looking for a way back.

But that’s the reason nostalgia is so powerful. Memories like these can’t be doubted. There is no uncertainty in your mind. There is no attempting to make them happen, or hoping they will, because they already have. You already know how it made you feel, how it was. Nostalgia gets its power through it’s certainty. We look to the future with an air of worry, hope, praying things will work out the way we want them to. We look to the past with certainty and acceptance. We already know the result. The past is safe and secure.

Your future is not your past. Your present is your past and your present is your future. The present is all we have. It’s the only life we have that’s real. We can look back into a time that we think we once lived, and we can look forward to a future that we think we’ll live. But the only life you can ever live is right now. Look around you. Take in what you see, the people, the sounds, the smells. This is your life. It’s not ten years ago. It’s not ten minutes from now. It’s now. This life will be your past and your future. But you don’t get to live in either of those. There is no path in life.  Live in the present, but realize that everything you do and say will become both your past and your future. 

It’s been hours now. The sun rises over the horizon and shines through the bedroom windows. I walk downstairs. My feet are no longer carried throughout the house by the same motivation. Before, I moved about under the thought that I would find her, or a piece of her in something small, but that's gone now. The floor feels colder than usual. I take my final turn in the centre of the living room. I’m sure I’ll be back, but it won’t be the same. I take in this final moment of a frozen life. My frozen life.

I slide my key in the door and turn to leave. A flood of memories washes over me from the last six years. My realization is bitter. It’s only when I’m faced with leaving something behind that I can see it for what it is. My present is in my past’s nostalgia, and my future, a conglomeration of handpicked moments from years gone by. 

I can see things for what they are now. I can see the present.

It has kept me really productive and organized with the novel I'm attempting to write. This is because the system of the program is based on separation. You can create a chapter, then separate that chapter into smaller scenes. This style helps me feel like I'm making progress, scene by scene. 

You can also create pages for characters and items, and create bios for them to refer to later. One specific instance that I remember using this was when I forgot the description of a sword that my protaganist used. Opened the item tab, found the sword, and bam, the description is right there. 

It's a versatile little thing. It even gives you specific wordcounts, and give you planner based on how much writing you're doing. But the program is as complicated or as simple as you want it to be. 

That's about it. I hope some of you find this as helpful as I did. Did I mention it's free? :D",Advice,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,adv,Author,True,t3_15j4oc,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15j4oc/ive_been_using_ywriter5_and_it_has_really_helped/,

1340403757.0,105,self.writing,vggxc,You Can Do It!,121,16,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vggxc/you_can_do_it/,"I'll be honest: I only started reading the rules for this subReddit to make sure that I could promote my book without irritating everyone. Then, I came across one point that made me stop and think:

- *Straight promotion posts are great for the poster, but not the community. Change that for us.*

That struck a chord with me. There are a lot of things I've learned that I wish someone had told me, so I figured I'd share. I'm sure these are all tried-and-true methods for many folks here, but hopefully, someone will benefit from them.

1. **Writing doesn't have to be linear.** One of my worst habits was forcing myself to write like I read: From beginning to end. Sure, I'd jot down ideas I had for later scenes, but I wouldn't flesh them out until I got around to writing that part of the story. It took me forever to let myself jump around in my work, but when I finally did, I realized that the entire process was *much* easier. I could write little pieces as they came to me, and then it was just a process of editing them together.

2. **You will never write anything bad.** You might, on occasion, write things bad*ly*, but there's no such thing as a bad piece of a story... just one that doesn't fit. When you find something in your story that isn't working out - and you will - don't delete it! Instead, keep a separate file of those misplaced snippets, and come back to them when you're stumped. You won't always find gold there, but occasionally you'll surprise yourself.

3. **Tell the story, then write it down.** One of my biggest problems has always been telling people - out loud - about whatever it was I had been writing... sometimes before I've even written it. While this can be a problem if you never get around to the writing portion, it can also be a great tool if you use it right. I started carrying a pocket tape recorder (and later on, an iPhone app) which I turned on any time I started talking about my ideas. It also worked wonders for when I couldn't write something down immediately, like if I was out walking or grocery shopping (Also, if you use a voice-recorder app on your phone, you can pretend you're talking to someone, and people won't stare at you as much.)

4. **You're more than a writer!** I started drawing because I love telling stories, and I started writing because I can't draw to save my life. Fortunately, programs like Photoshop make it easy to throw things together and edit them ad infinitum, which means that even the worst artist can come up with something decent. As long as you're willing to learn - and you can keep yourself from getting frustrated - you can actually do a lot more than write. (In my case, I designed both the cover and the website for my novel.) Sure, writing the story is the most important part, but it's often the garnish that makes the meal look truly complete.

5. **Find a friend.** This, I have to say, was the most important part of the process for me. If you can find someone willing to read your work as you write it, you'll not only have a critic, you'll have an audience, as well. Let me say from experience, there's nothing more motivating (at least for me) than having someone say ""I loved the latest chapter! When can I read the next one?""

6. **Put yourself out there.** Not everyone will like your work. Some people with *hate it with a fiery passion*, and they'll make you feel pretty damned terrible... but some people will think your story is the best thing they've ever read. The thing is, you won't be able to reach those folks if you're afraid of rejection.

So *write what you feel like writing*, in whatever order you need to. *Don't throw any ideas away*, even if they seem absolutely terrible. *Tell the story,* and it will write itself, especially if you can *tell it to a friend*. As a writer, you're creative by default, so *learn new skills*, and challenge yourself with them. Then, when you're ready, *offer your work to anyone who's interested*.

My take on this is that he already thinks he can sell it.  I should know more in a week and will post a further update when I do.

Here's a link to [paper](http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/semantics/ConsequencesErudite.pdf).

I thought his experiments were pretty brilliant, and it's good to know that there's some empirical data behind our style choices, right?

He conducted 5 experiments on Stanford undergrads, to find out what kind of impression big words can leave on a reader. 

For the sake of those of you that hate reading science research, I’ll go over 3 of em*.

*Not in their original order

 

**Experiment 1**

Oppenheimer found some poor rube’s application essay for grad school. He took it, and swapped out some words with more difficult words from the Microsoft Office thesaurus. 71 Stanfordites read the original, and read a thesaurus-ized version. Then Oppenheimer asked them if they thought the essay-writers should get in to Stanford.

Not surprising, most of the Stanfordites thought that the most complex essay-writer shouldn’t be admitted. The big words made the writer seem dumber.

But, as Oppenheimer notes, we can’t draw too many conclusions from that. The word-swapping was done by thesaurus, so it could have produced awkward-sounding sentences that leave a bad impression. Sure enough, look at intro that the thesaurus-bot produced:

“I desire to go to Graduate School so that I can learn to recognize literature satisfactorily. I want to investigate the characfter and connotation of the literary and its antecedents.”

Blech. Kid, you lost me at “satisfactorily.” I also don’t think anyone would apply to Stanford with a paragraph like that. Oppenheimer agrees, it sounds a little written-by-a-robot.

That’s why he also did…

**Experiment 3**

In this one he followed the opposite procedure. He had his thesaurus mangle some grad-student’s dissertation abstracts, to swap out easier words for more complex ones.

Think “satisfactorily” -&gt; “well.”

Since these altered texts would also sound a little written-by-robot, you might think the students would find them a little dim and awkward. Not so.

Most of the 35 undergrad readers loved the simplified versions. They rated the essays that had easier words as more clear, and the writers more intelligent.

Even after controlling for robotic word-switching, readers preferred smaller words.

One more bias Oppenheimer wants us to watch out for, though. Maybe these Stanford readers were savvy enough to know all the tricks that other students would use to sound smart, so they were on guard against them. They might know that if they see the word “satisfactorily” (seriously what an ugly word), some guy is trying to snow them.

To get rid of this bias, Oppenheimer conducted…

**Experiment 2**

This one was ingenious. Instead of using a computer to swap around words in the same essay, he found two different versions of the same source material. How do you do that in an unbiased way? Translations!

He found two different versions of a passage by Descartes, one of them wordy, the other a little simpler. 35 Stanford undergrads read both versions. Also, Oppenheimer told half of them who the original author was, while the other half thought it was “anonymous.”

And guess what – the students liked the simple version again. Even if the students knew the author was Descartes, they still thought that whoever wrote the wordy passage was a little dumb.  Wow!



There’s nothing sweeter than having a Princeton scientist agree with you. Strunk and White has always been my writing bible, and they’ll be the first to tell you: keep it simple!

So next time you’re tempted to reach for the thesaurus, remember the impression that wordiness makes. You won’t sound any smarter!

I'm currently editing my first novel and one of the main things wrong with my current manuscript is the sheer level of exposition in it. It has elements of fantasy in it and I'd like to know what you all do to build worlds without pages upon pages explaining the intricacies of the world you imagine. 

Right now, I reveal a lot through dialogue between characters but it still comes across as huge bricks of information. Any tips on other ways to reveal things like back-stories and nuances of created worlds?

They are an interesting group because they are all left completely blind by the loss of a support system in the world they live in, and I'm using that as a device for increasing the anxiety of the scene in which he murders them.

So, even if the character effectively lives for only 2 pages of narrative, do I bother naming him? There's a lot of action and a lot of people in it that go more or less unnamed so referring to 'him's and 'her's is a little confusing. It would be nice to just introduce him shortly as the leader, have them bumble for a bit, get attacked, then end him. Would this be frustrating to a reader?

I'm now a published author.  

I first posted about r/writing about how [first drafts always suck](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/h7ala/a_note_to_new_writers_first_drafts_always_suck/).  Next, I got some great feedback when my [cover](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ix43i/almost_there_just_got_the_concept_sketches_for_my/) was being designed.  And finally, I told you how I got [PAID](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/m1ygl/dont_give_up_i_got_the_advance_check_for_my_novel/).

And now finally, I'm happy to share the blurb: 

*An irreverent, scotch-swilling, skirt-chasing smartass, US Army Ranger Jake McPherson is more at home on the battlefield than stuck in his FOB. A brutal ambush in Iraq that threatens to wipe out his unit forces Jake to admit he possesses mental and physical powers most humans – including him – can only dream about.*

*Using his powers to save his unit exposes Jake to the Chosen. An ageless order of evil dedicated to spreading chaos to create a world they can rule, the Chosen track Jake home to Texas, where a beautiful warrior – a Servant of the Light – saves Jake from their ruthless assassins.*

*Reluctantly joining the ancient struggle, Jake masters his powers through the Servants’ bygone ways of combat. With modern weapons useless in a war between timeless adversaries, Jake has no choice but to rely on hand-to-hand combat, swords, and his wits.*

*Jake must lead the Servants into battle from the across the US and back to Iraq, where the Servants learn the Chosen have claimed a weapon of unspeakable power ... a weapon only Jake and the Servants of the Light can stop from destroying the world as we know it.* 

As of right now, my book is only available as an eBook.  The publisher is still finalizing the layout of the print book.  It is available on [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Servants-of-the-Light-ebook/dp/B006JTBZXM/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_1), [Nook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/servants-of-the-light-kris-alexander/1107786674?ean=9781618180025), and [iBooks](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/servants-of-the-light/id484328958?mt=11)

I'm happy to answer any questions, but I've already anticipated a few.  

Did I have an agent?  No.  I shopped the book around for a while, and I was getting some responses.  But, the responses all went something like ""this is good but too hard to categorize"" or ""if this were YA it might be easier to sell.""  I always got the feeling I was dealing with idiots who didn't know why anything sold.  They were chasing the next ""Twilight"" which wasn't me.  Then I realized that the old publishing model was changing quickly, and I wanted to be on the cutting edge, not the legacy past.  

A [friend](http://www.toccon.com/toc2011/profile/102677) of mine was starting his own imprint.  He was going to try and carve a niche in the market focusing mostly on eBooks while bypassing trying to something in ""big box"" stores.  He wanted to know if I'd consider going through him.  Borders was slowly dying in the background so I was in.

My publisher's ideas were simple.  We would have more control and flexibility just doing it ourselves.  We'd look to maximize revenue to the author and cut out as much middlemen as possible.  And trust me the traditional legacy publishing industry is filled with middlemen looking for a cut.  

He did the developmental edit.  He hired a copy editor and a cover artist.  I retained a lot of control.  I got to work directly with the cover artist knit-picking on the details.  There were some hiccups and setbacks in the whole process, but I felt pretty good about it.  Plus, it beat piling up rejection notices from people I wasn't sure I could trust.

Did I miss out on anything important by going this route?  Maybe.  I still like the idea of wandering into a bookstore and seeing my book on a shelf.  That's still possible with what we're doing, but it will come later.  But having a book on shelves is no guarantee of sales.  I also could have gotten a bigger advance if I had been able to go through a traditional publishers.  But, the terms with my publishers are more generous than the legacy contracts.  I get less up front but more throughout.  

So what's next?  We're finalizing the print version.  After the holidays, I'm going to have a book party in Monterey CA that NORCAL r/writers are invited to attend.  And I'm going to try to book myself some readings.  I'm open to suggestions on where to do this on the West Coast.  I'm also looking for some conventions to attend, etc.

Anyway, fire away your questions and thanks for all the support.

tl;dr I published a book that you should buy.  Now.

He also took questions from the crowd, and I found his answer to a rather broad question about structure really solid. It's helped me out in how I'm thinking about structuring my first novel, so I thought I'd post it here in case it helps someone else.

---

**I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to deal with structure? How do you deal with it?**

""You’re talking about writing a novel, right? I think it’s kind of like...do you know [Kurt Schwitters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schwitters), the artist? He was an experimental artist in the 1940s who made these very strange cut up collages and so on and very strange abstract paintings. And I was just seeing an exhibition of his, and one of the things that is really noticeable is he is known for these wild collages, and then interspersing these are these really beautiful, very formally traditional oil paintings, portraits, and landscapes and so on.

And this is that old—I mean it’s a bit of a cliché--but the old thing about knowing the rules and being able to obey them before you can break them. Now I think that that is quite useful in terms of structure for novels because one of the things that stops people writing is kind of this panic at the scale of the thing, you know? So I would say, I would encourage anyone that’s writing a novel to be as out there as they possibly can. But as a way of getting yourself kick-started, why not go completely traditional?

Think three-act structure, you know. Think rising action at the beginning of the journey and then some sort of cliff-hanger at the end of act one. Continuing up to the end of act two, followed by a big crisis at the end of act three, followed by a little dénouement. Think 30,000 words, 40,000 words, 30,000 words, so what’s that, around 100,000 words. Divide that up into 5,000 word chapters so you’re going 6/8/6. I realise this sounds incredibly sort of drab, and kind of mechanical. But my feeling is that the more you can kind of formalise and bureaucratise those aspects of things. It actually paradoxically liberates you creatively because you don’t need to worry about that stuff.

If you front load that stuff, plant all that out in advance and you know the rough outline of each chapter in advance, then when you come to each day’s writing, you’re able to go off in all kinds of directions because you know what you have to do in that day. You have to walk this character from this point to this point and you can do that in the strangest way possible. Whereas if you’re looking at a blank piece of paper and saying where do you I go from here you get kind of frozen.
The unwritten novel has a basilisk’s stare, and so I would say do it behind your own back by just formally structuring it in that traditional way. And then when you have confidence and you’ve gained confidence in that, you can play more odder games with it. But it’s really not a bad way to get started.""",Advice,False,,t5_2qh2n,1375873237.0,advice,,True,t3_1jvjd7,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jvjd7/china_miéville_on_novel_structure_for_beginners/,

1351284755.0,93,self.writing,1255wr,I used to teach Kung Fu...,117,24,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1255wr/i_used_to_teach_kung_fu/,"Before I moved to Virginia in 2010, I used to teach a martial arts class. I started taking kung fu at a small-town studio when I was 13, and began teaching about 10 years later.

There's a lesson that all beginners have to learn during their first couple of weeks: Your mind always gives up before your body does. New students always make a big show of grunting and collapsing to the ground during pushups after they get a little tired. But I know better; I've been doing this gig for twenty years. I know that they can do more. 

So, why do they give up? Instead of giving me their all, why do new students give me 80% and feel like that's good enough?  Because that last 20% is *hard*. Your muscles are tired and sore. You're sweating and out of breath. Pushing that last 20% out of your system is uncomfortable as hell.

People don't like to be uncomfortable. At 80% they feel like they've made a reasonable effort, and they just want the pressure to stop. But an 80% effort won't make you great. If you strengthen your will, you can push yourself so much further than that.

""You can be content with mediocrity,"" I tell my students. ""But I won't be. Do five more pushups."" 

Some complain, some get angry and resentful. But without fail, when they put their face to the floor, all of them can do five more. Their brain gave up before their bodies did. The students who realize the truth in that lesson, and really begin to push themselves--those are the students that flourish. Everyone else fades away. Perhaps they get a new girlfriend, or a new hobby that they can pick up or put down whenever the mood strikes them. Something where 80% is good enough.

That's a lesson I try to carry with me in everything I do: that if you really push when life is uncomfortable, you can achieve so much more than if you are content to coast along at 80%.

It's so easy to let life get in the way of writing. There's always one more meal to cook, one more school project to help the kids with, or one more hour to work because I have one more bill to pay. I'm already giving my 80%.

It's hard to get up off the couch and go write when I'm working 50 hour weeks at my day job. It's hard to revisit the long-buried emotional traumas of my past and use them to try to breathe life into my characters. It's hard to carve out time away from my family so that I can spend that time and love on people who only exist in my imagination. It would be so much easier to watch one more episode of Dr. Who, or play one more game of Farmville, or to go to bed early and get a decent night's sleep.

Well, some people might be content with mediocrity. But I am not.

Hello writers of Reddit,  
  
I've created a new subreddit, /r/fictionworkshop, where I'll be hosting a summer course in fiction writing. This is different than the current writing subreddits in that it will be a structured creative writing course with assigned readings, weekly short exercises, and workshopped stories.  
   
I'm hoping for a class size of 4-12 and the course length will be as many weeks as there are participants. Obviously this is not a college-credit course and I make no claims of affiliation to any schools. You will receive a grade, but this reflects more on your commitment to the course and your subsequent development of writing and critical analysis skills.
  
I hope this takes off because I feel that Reddit, with its 24/7 discussion-based infrastructure, is the perfect forum for a workshop.  
  
I'm hoping to find people who will commit to the full length of the course (naturally it's fine if you have to miss a week or so), and who will bring a sense of discovery and generosity to their peers' work.   
   
I'll be hosting under the username REDDITWRITINGCLASS in the aforementioned /r/fictionworkshop but please address all questions here or to redditwritingclass@gmail.com. Members of the workshop will receive posting privileges as they are accepted.   
    
If you're interested in signing up please send me a brief clip of your writing (no more than 500 words) to redditwritingclass@gmail.com.  
   
I'm looking forward to speaking with you and I hope this experiment is successful!     
  
PS the syllabus is currently unfinished because I don't know how many writers will be in the class and what style of writing they will bring, but it does give an overview of the structure and expectations of the course. It can be accessed in the introductory post of the subreddit.

I'm a long-time reddit lurker and I want to ask you for some feedback regarding my pet project.

Quabel is a small project of me and two friends, which we started about more than a year ago during university. We were disappointed by using text editors, google docs and office suites (MS- and Libre Office) all day long which had these tiny, uncomfortable edges that made us cringe everytime we used them. This prompted us to think about a text editor we would like to use for creating and sharing text from all our devices. 

In comes Quabel, our pet projekt. Some of you may even notice the reference to ""Babel"", the infamous ancient city. With Quabel, you:

* have **the same writing experience on all your devices**. Mac, Windows and Linux don't make a difference as long as you use a current webbrowser.
* **set writings goals and track your progress** towards reaching them.
* can easily share your writings with others in a pretty fashion (we think this is nicer than Google docs!)
* can import and export in all common document formats
* make use of several other features which have been implemented in a very heartfelt and nice way [keyboard sounds, autosaving your writings, night mode, etc.] :) 


Right now, we have implemented all of these features and want to continue in making Quabel accessible more platforms, most importantly mobile devices. 

But for us it is very important to get some feedback from a community of people who really care about their writings, and this is why we are directly addressing r/writing with this post. We hope to gather feedback which helps us to further improve Quabel for our target audience.


If you have followed through with this post up to this point, I want to thank you a lot for your attention. You may now continue and have a look at [Quabel.com](https://quabel.com).

This is infuriating to new writers, I get it, but it's usually the best answer. Here's why.


Imagine you’re walking through a neighborhood and you see a kid sitting on a stoop, hand on his forehead, sweating profusely, looking like he’s making a life and death decision.

“What’s wrong, kid?” you ask.

“I’m trying to decide if I should play with dolls or go play tag,” he says. “What do you think?”

“I have no idea. Just do what you feel like.”

To your surprise, your sensible answer makes the kid so anxious he immediately vomits. 

“But what if I play the wrong thing?” he asks, between heaves. “What if I have the physiology to be an NFL running back, but I never play tag, never realize how fast I am? On the other hand, maybe I could have become a famous fashion designer but  I never know because I never played with dolls!” 
 
This gives you pause. It’s a good point. Playing is how kids develop the basic skills they're going to use the rest of their lives. Tag develops a totally different skill set than dolls. Depending on what they do later in life, how they play could enrich their lives or be a waste of time. Meanwhile, this kid is still vomiting, and you’re worried a cop will come by and you’ll end up on the sex offender list, somehow. 

On the other hand, play should be fun, not stressful. A kid playing anything but what they want seems to defeat the purpose. Why? Because **one of the major functions of playing is for kids to discover what they do and do not enjoy. Play is as much a process of discovery as a means of practice.** A kid doing anything but what they feel like cripples the process of discovery. The fashion designer playing tag will never be a waste of time because they discovered something about themselves. And you never know, maybe they’ll incorporate the experience of tag in a design one day.

Smiling, you try to lay a comforting hand on the kid, but he’s begun rolling around and is head to toe covered in vomit. Whatever.

“Just go play,” you say.

“Fuck you,” the kid says. You suspect, but can't prove, that he started shitting himself. “That’s the bullshit answer everyone gives and it’s not helpful.”

This is what happens on /r/writing, over and over. People are asking questions that can only be answered by engaging in a process of discovery, i.e., sitting down and writing. That doesn’t mean questions about writing shouldn’t be asked. For example, if the kid was crazy about tag, he could ask “I’d like to improve my sprint. What’s the best diet?” That would lead to a concrete discussion. Even if there isn’t an exactly right or wrong answer, I could give an opinion that’s not just tied to my personal preferences and is therefore helpful to a stranger.

A handy clue to whether a question is good or a bad is that bad questions lead to answer backed by unquantifiable or unrepeatable experiences that aren’t necessarily applicable to strangers. In other words, two reasonable people could have the same amount of experience and expertise and give two contradictory answers.  For example, 


**Bad Question:** “Should I outline on a computer or with notecards?” 

**Answer:** I don’t fucking know. I like outlining on a computer. My friend uses notecards. My other friend writes in his journal. We all like our method equally.


**Good question:** “What’s the best software for outlining on a computer?” 

**Answer:** Everyone I know who’s used Scrivener loves it.

**Bad Question:** “How much world building should I do in military sci fi?” 

**Answer:** I don’t know fucking know. I hate any world building. I know a ton of people who could read books of just world building.


**Good Question:** “I’m writing military sci fi but I want to know more about the military. Any recommendations on sources?” 

**Answer:** Me recommending a source. Someone might even disagree with me and we could have a discussion. That’s cool. Our discussion would be helpful to a stranger. 


So how do you figure out the bad questions? Write something with the question in mind. Show it to other people. Ask them pointed questions. Consider their answers. Read it yourself. Decide if you like it or not. Move on. In other words, just write.

I've been writing freelance for nearly a decade and a half, usually for the pen-and-paper game industry. I had my first two novels published last year: [Blackbirds](http://www.amazon.com/Blackbirds-Chuck-Wendig/dp/0857662309/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344012569&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=blackbirds), in which a girl can see how people are going to die just by touching them, and [Double Dead](http://www.amazon.com/Double-Dead-Tomes-Chuck-Wendig/dp/1907992413/ref=pd_sim_b_1), in which a cranky-ass vampire wakes up in the middle of the zombie apocalypse only to learn that his food source has gone, erm, rotten. 

I'm also the author of pulpy 1930s two-fisted action tale, [Dinocalypse Now](http://www.amazon.com/Dinocalypse-Now-Chuck-Wendig/dp/1613170033/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344012646&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dinocalypse+now), which features a cabal of heroes (including a kilted professorial ape) battling a plague of time-traveling psychic dinosaurs. 

Somehow, I stumbled face first into a novel career, as I've got a metric orifice-load of novels coming out in the future: [Mockingbird](http://www.amazon.com/Mockingbird-Chuck-Wendig/dp/0857662333/ref=pd_sim_b_2), The Cormorant, The Blue Blazes, Gods &amp; Monsters: Unclean Spirits, Beyond Dinocalypse, Dinocalypse Forever, and The Heartland Trilogy. All traditionally-published.

I'm *also* a self-published author. My [writing books](http://www.amazon.com/Chuck-Wendig/e/B003P9JZ0O/ref=la_B003P9JZ0O_rf_p_n_feature_browse-b_2?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_82%3AB003P9JZ0O%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A618073011&amp;bbn=283155&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344013078&amp;rnid=618072011) are self-published, and I've also self-published some fiction, including an upcoming novel that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter called [Bait Dog](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/terribleminds/bait-dog-an-atlanta-burns-novel-by-chuck-wendig).

With writing partner Lance Weiler I co-wrote the short film [Pandemic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_N8VThLK-M), and we also wrote the digital narrative [Collapsus](http://collapsus.com/), which was nominated for a digital Emmy.

Anyways, while playing with my series bible in Wikidpad (very cool offline wiki tool), I on a whim put together a timeline for the protagonist of my current novel. 

I realized as I did it that I'd gotten a better grasp of the flow of the story, especially for this particular character, than I had doing a general outline.

So I started doing individual outlines for each character, framing events from their POV. I have to say, this has given me a clearer, more intimate view than I've achieved with any other method of outlining. 

Anyone else do something similar, or have any other outlining tricks they'd like to share?",,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,,bio2,True,t3_tji9r,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/tji9r/started_using_a_new_outlining_trickthought_it_was/,

1375904331.0,92,self.writing,1jwkkf,"I'm working on a scifi/fantasy novel and am being mentored by a published author. I emailed him today regarding writier's block, and he gave me some good advice.",106,14,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jwkkf/im_working_on_a_scififantasy_novel_and_am_being/,"1) Writer's block can crop up when the writers is trying to force something that's illogical. Have you ever been reading and a character does something totally out of character for them with no build-up? Not only is that bad writing, but that author probably struggled through some massive writer's block to write that. If this is your brand of writer's block, try going back to where it started getting difficult and delete everything after that point. Save it as a different file (I usually add v2, v3, etc.) and pick it back up, but this time, intentionally take it in a different direction.


2) Characters who exist in a void, who haven't come from anywhere, have nowhere to go. A lot of young writers get the idea for a plot, plug in the characters dictated by that plot and dive right in. Not to undermine your enthusiasm, but there's a bit more to it than that. Ever heard the phrase ""The child is father to the man""? This builds off of what I said in my first point. If you have a character who almost drowned as a kid, he's going to be afraid of the water. That's obvious. But how does he deal with his fear. How have his parents, siblings, friends, teachers, enemies helped or hindered him in dealing with his fear. One character trait has a lifetime of experience behind it. Take your time to get to know your characters. Write down some character biography. If your story is in third person, which I prefer for longer fiction, try writing a chapter from one of your character's POVs. How does it change the story? Does it change it? If the answer is no, then that character isn't really an individual, but a plot device, and his voice is the narrative voice. Try creating real-life voices for them. Walk their walks. Eat their favorite food. Etc. Spend about an hour (and time yourself, character building can get out of control) for each character.


3) World building. This is a fantasy/scifi world where science is more advanced and magic may or may not exist. Not only do your characters need to be real, your world does too. You should think of building a world like building a house. First the floor. What's a word that can sum up your world and/or your society. Think broad terms. Once you have that, you need your four pillars: time, space, magic and technology. The first two are pretty straight-forward, but for magic and technology, you should not only have what exists, but the limits. Once you have your pillars, put a roof on it. This is what's applying pressure to your world, otherwise known as the underlying conflict of your plot. Once you have that, build your walls, which are the relationships between the four pillars. We can actually get together and talk about this in more detail because, unfortunately, I don't have my notes with me right now. This is a technique I learned at a workshop this summer about writing video games. But the key is to know the world as well as you know your characters. Even if your story takes place in the ""real world,"" you need to know your settings, your neighborhoods, your buildings, your rooms. Again, spend no more than an hour on this kind of thing.


4) Don't be afraid to suck. I mean, suck bad. Like, write the worst thing ever committed to paper. You know why you shouldn't be afraid to suck? Think about the first time you tried to walk. If you're lucky, you fell on your butt. If you're unlucky, you face-planted onto concrete. But then you kept trying and eventually you got better. Writing is a talent, but it's also a skill. Keep writing, and you'll get better, and it will get easier.


5) Set a small, daily writing goal. I used to write in four-hour 20-page blocks once every 4-6 weeks. I did this because I operated under the fallacious assumption that you needed to write a whole story or a whole chapter in one sitting. The problem with these marathon sessions is that they're exhausting. After you run a marathon, do you go back out the next day? While I've never run a marathon, I know people who have, and they've told me that the next day, they can barely move. Same with writing. What I do these days is aim for 3 pages a day. That's double-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman. I don't stop in the middle of paragraphs or sentences. Sometimes, there's a natural pausing point at 2, 2 and a half, or even after 4 pages. People underestimate increments. If you wrote a single page, that's about 200-300 words, a day, at the end of the year, you'd have a novel. I'd say start with a page and a half a day. Include your character and world building in your daily goals.

It's long and I'm sorry but it really struck true with me.

I raised the price to $7.99 figuring that people would be more likely to download a free book that was a bit pricier. 

Since I only sold 1 copy on Barnes and Noble (no idea why), I dropped it to comply with the Kindle Select terms and put it up for a 1-day promotion (free). 

I don't know if this is a good thing or not, but I figure the exposure can't hurt. 

I'm currently ranked #2 in Humor/Essays and 499 in all free books on Amazon, so my hope is that the people who might not have bought it will download it just because it's highly ranked and free.

That should add me to new categories. You've seen ""People who bought XXXXX also bought YYYYY"", right? Well, I figured that there would be new books in that list and there are. 

I don't know if I'm shooting myself in the foot by doing this and the downloads today are going to come at the expense of *paid* sales later, but I guess we'll see.

I'd like to read some good prose.

Denis Johnson amazes me. I had trouble deciding what to post...Jesus' Son is full of heartbreaking passages, Fiskadoro has some great, visceral imagery. In the end I chose this bit from Already Dead: A California Gothic because it shows how he uses such beautifully vivid language even in a sort of silly scene of two stoned dudes hanging out:


They'd smoked too much. The stuff was almost immeasurably potent--uncured, half-dried, bitter. Meadows suddenly understood what it would be like to turn into his own tongue. Was he lying prone or draggling down from above? Only a breathtaking surrender of his soul kept him floating upward and pressed against the capsized ground. Any slight failure of this abject unwilled movement and he'd plummet into the sky.

He'd be thinking something and realize that this flotsam had been plying his mind untended for perhaps many minutes before cresting into view. He did not consist of his thoughts, did not even produce them, was just the nameless fact they drifted through.

In a while--a half hour or a thousand hours--Nelson roused him, stirring around in Clarence's own pack and putting on his blue enameled kettle for coffee and upending the canteen above the pot until it gurgled dry.

Nelson dumped in the ground coffee at the boil, let it steep a minute away from the fire, then looped his belt through the kettle's handle and, with shocking deftness and equilibrium, stood up and slung the brew in circles, driving the grounds to the kettle's floor.

""You've got moves to surprise a person, haven't you?""

""I was raised to this land. I can live off dirt. I can rope a tree, hunt the mugwump, all of that."" He poured coffee for the both of them into Clarence's one big cup.

1360068968.0,92,self.writing,17xhub,How do you keep dark subject matter in fiction from becoming oppressive?,103,11,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17xhub/how_do_you_keep_dark_subject_matter_in_fiction/,"The novel I'm completing right now is very dark, along the lines of *V for Vendetta* and *1984*. There is torture, the death of children, executions, riots, nuclear holocaust, secret police, and all kinds of really nasty sociopolitical commentary, which I've been trying to counterbalance by a running theme of hope with some motifs to uplift the rest of the narrative (and also some gallows humor).

So I guess my question to Redditors is this: when you're working with very depressing, very dark material, how do you make sure that you are not either prosthelytizing or depressing the hell out of your reader? 

How much death and danger can you put your characters in the face of without stressing the reader to the point that they cannot finish the story for fear of what will happen?

EDIT: I think the thing I'm most afraid of with my book is the ""children taboo"". In Western culture it's pretty frowned upon to depict harm to children in the media, and it is definitely a running theme in my novel: parents murdered in front of their children, child soldiers, war orphans starving to death, children killed in nuclear attack, that kind of thing. I wanted a theme of the book to be how war affects children and how that violence reverberates across generations. I know a lot of people, especially parents, who claim that they can't stand to see children get hurt, even fictionally.

1335623776.0,88,self.writing,swst9,Submitting material for feedback? Please follow these guidelines,95,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/swst9/submitting_material_for_feedback_please_follow/,"**Step 1: Create a helpful title**

- Use appropriate tags. At a minimum, please use the tags [critique] and [genre] at the beginning of the title. At the end, please include the word count. Use additional tags you believe will help others in deciding whether or not to spend time critiquing your work. For example, if you are a beginner, you may include a [beginner] tag. Use of such tags gives everyone an idea of what to expect going into the critique.

- Provide the title or proposed title.

- Consider stating the intention of the project.

Example 1: [critique] [fantasy] Writing Exercise - The Magical Mushrooms of the Dark Forest - 2800 words

Example 2: [critique] [article] [beginner] Alternative Medical Uses for Tampons - 700 words

Example 3: [critique] [true crime] Short story for publication - Death of a Brony - 1600 words

**Step 2: The author statement**

- Include a blurb about yourself. Tell us a bit about your background, your publishing history, or your education. The more we know about you, the better a reader can target their critique. Even if they presented the same material, I would not provide the same critique for a student and a professional author.

- Tell us what kind of critique you're after. Do you need a proofreader, someone to tell you their general impression, or input on the plot? Each will result in different feedback, so it's important that you let us know what you want from the start.

- Let us know your intentions for the work. If you're going for publication, your needs are different than someone writing a paper for school.

**Step 3: The writing sample**

- In the body of the Reddit post, include a sample of at least 500 words (include the entire story if it is shorter). The reason behind this is that 500 words is enough to tell the reader if they will enjoy the story enough to invest their time in a thorough critique. It also gives your readers a good idea of your writing style. There are many styles of writing, and not everyone likes every style.

- The writing sample should be indicative of the entire work. It makes no difference if it comes from the beginning, middle, or end.

- If your story or excerpt is short enough to post in Reddit in its entirety, feel free to post it. If not, you are welcome to post a link to the full story or excerpt. Google docs is most popular, but feel free to post a link leading elsewhere.

**General Guidelines**

- Only post your material. If your friends or family members truly want a critique, they are welcome to post it themselves.

- Complete the story and attempt to edit the material yourself before posting. In truth, most work that is started is never completed. Please do not waste everyone's time by asking for help on a project you may never complete. If you just cannot complete a work before asking for help, complete and edit as much as possible.

- Do not post an idea for a story for critique. Virtually any story imaginable, no matter how inane, can be told in a compelling way.

- Consider posting in another sub. While /r/writing is the largest writing subreddit, Reddit offers more intimate groups. Consider posting in /r/writersgroup, /r/write, or /r/LitWorkshop.

- Critiques are give and take. If you would like a critique of your work, please assist others by critiquing their work. 

- Do not take offense to any response. If you ask for a critique, you will occasionally receive feedback that you find insulting, lacking merit, or just plain wrong. Feel free to ask for clarification, but do not take offense, and do not become combative. No matter how harsh a critique may seem, a review from the public will hurt much more. If someone crosses the line from harsh to blatantly abusive, hit the report button, and the moderators will handle it appropriately.",Announcement,False,,t5_2qh2n,True,Career,,True,t3_swst9,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/swst9/submitting_material_for_feedback_please_follow/,moderator

I'm A.M. (Anna) Harte, the author of zombie love collection Hungry For You and the recently release science fantasy novel Above Ground (I'm currently running a month blog tour to celebrate the release of the latter).

I'm also the editor-in-chief of 1889 Labs, a Canadian-based indie publisher. We have particular expertise in taking webfiction (online serialised stories) and turning them into novels; our motto is to bring the best of web-based fiction to the wider reading public.

As you may have guessed, I love the online fiction community. I used to be a very active Web Fiction Guide editor and I also contribute to the fridayflash community now and then. I was the managing editor of Ergofiction ezine (which promoted online fiction) and currently co-host the Webfiction World podcast.

In my day job, I work in the magazine production dept of a financial publisher. I live in London, a city not half as foggy as some seem to think.

You’re welcome to ask me anything about writing, editing, self/indie publishing, books, online book marketing, speculative fiction, chocolate, and whatever crosses your mind. I'm happy to chat :-)

So does anyone else have similiar problems?

Edit: I feel comfortable enough now to talk about the idea a bit(though I do like the actual conversation about writing this kind of material though, but I feel i should provide some meat since others have shared a bit about some of their own)

The story idea: It is about a young man who is refused by the selective school he had chosen as his future career, and devoted 2 years of his life to just pass the hard entrance exams, and then he is rejected for some very silly reasons and personal opinions of the interviewers..and a sum of things in his personal life happen and push him over the edge.

The story follows his dark path towards attending this school even though he isn't a student there and then systematicly abducting those who got in and the teachers, involves a lot of torture and killing and most likely will be very graphic about it.

Edit 2: Thank you for everyone who chipped in with their thoughts on this, you've assured me it is nonsense to censor oneself and that if you have a idea you feel strongly about you should write it. :)",,False,,t5_2qh2n,1340302165.0,,,True,t3_vdmef,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vdmef/as_a_writer_do_you_have_ideas_that_are_too/,

Tonight I realised that this is a fucking amazing idea. There are so many top jokes, and fun characters, and exciting plot twists, and I just can't wait until it's finished and everyone can read it and it's just out, out of my fucking mind, so I won't seem so mad to everyone all the time!

1340723784.0,85,self.writing,vmrs9,Self-Publishing? Find an Editor,97,12,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vmrs9/selfpublishing_find_an_editor/,"http://oseh-writer.com/2012/06/26/self-publishing-find-an-editor/ (better format)

So far this morning I’ve seen two articles and a Reddit conversation about the need for editors in the self-publishing world. It’s become obvious to most that self-publishing is not going away. With every novice writer wanting to be the next Amanda Hocking, we can actually expect a larger influx of self-published works in the next few years – and there’s nothing wrong with that. The e-publishing world has changed the game, but it’s also in danger of becoming the bargain bin of literature if authors don’t step up their game and realize the need for editors.

As a reader, I’ve experienced the frustration myself. In the past month I’ve purchased four highly-rated self-published books on my Kindle. Each of them had nearly a hundred reviews, most of them glowing about how great the story was and how they couldn’t put it down. In all but one case, the books were barely better than first drafts. The only exception was The Third Scroll by Dana Marton, and though it was more fleshed out than the others, it still read like a spruced up outline rather than a fully realized novel.

It’s not just grammatical errors that I’m talking about. Each of these books, and others I’ve purchased in the past, have great premises. The stories and characters are intriguing, at least in the beginning. Pretty quickly, however, it all begins to fall apart. All of the characters end up talking the same, the authors explain everything out in detail for the reader instead of trusting us to pick up on clues, and the worlds lose their luster.

As a writer, I get it. When I finish a first draft, I’m so excited that the story is “done.” I’m ready to shout it from the mountain tops. However, calling a story done after an initial draft is a misnomer. All the writer has done at this point is put the story on paper. The real work is in the editing process.

Currently it seems as if most editing among self-published authors focuses on grammatical errors, not that they catch all of those as well. There is so much more that goes into editing though. Do the characters logically grow and change? Is your voice consistent? Does the world feel lived in? What is your theme?

Humans have this weird attraction to first impressions, and for the writer, the crafting process and first draft are that first impression. We fall in love with how the characters and stories look in our heads, and often times we’re unable to see the work they need on the page. Because of our own bias toward our own work, no writer should ever be his own final editor.

If you are a self-published author, or have a desire to be one, the most important piece of advice that you’ll ever receive is to hire an editor. The second most important piece of advice is to listen to that editor. You don’t have to listen to everything. If you feel really strongly about a certain item, then keep it in there, but remember, it’s all on you if that’s the thing your readers end up hating.

Editors don’t have the ulterior motive that writers have. They’re not trying to protect their own egos or save their darlings. Editors are paid to make a story better. As such, most writers need to learn to stop acting like teenage girls when getting critiqued. As a writer, you have to be mature and objective toward your work if you have any desire to sell it.

I understand that many new authors cannot afford an editor. The next best thing is to try and find someone to do it for free, or at very least for a free copy of the book once it’s published. If you go this route, be careful of yes men. If someone says they’ll edit your work, and they come back with nothing but a glowing review, move on and find someone else. Every good editor, and reader for that matter, will have something constructive to say.

**TL;DR** - Authors are biased toward their own work. If you're self-publishing, hire an editor and listen to him.",,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,,,True,t3_vmrs9,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vmrs9/selfpublishing_find_an_editor/,

Just wanted to share it with all of you: 


**FOURTEEN PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE APPETIZERS**

**by Yoni Brenner**


1. Top thick slices of country bread with fresh goat cheese. Sprinkle with herbs and bake until crusty; serve to everyone but Jeff.

2. Vegetarian friends? Try veggie rumaki: wrap a strip of imitation bacon around a water chestnut, spear with a toothpick, and broil—but instead of imitation bacon use real bacon, and instead of a water chestnut use veal.

3. Steal Cheryl’s famous potato-salad recipe. When Cheryl asks, “Why did you steal my recipe?,” say, “I don’t know, Cheryl, why did you break my heart?” Then laugh so she knows you’re just kidding.

4. Blend fresh crabmeat with diced avocado, scallions, and a dollop of mayonnaise for a canapé topping so delicious that it will take your guests a full minute to realize that they’re eating it off dog biscuits. Once they catch on, act mortified and stammer that you must have “mixed up the boxes,” until everyone calms down. Then start crying because the biscuits remind you that today marks exactly eight weeks since you had to put down Buster, and you just miss him so much.

5. Tell Marissa that you appreciate her concern, but in the two years since Cheryl broke off the engagement you’ve grown up a lot, and you’re really in a much healthier place now. Then say, “Speaking of fiancés, how’s Peter’s alcoholism?” (Note: This is not technically an appetizer.)

6. For a taste of the U.K., fry up mini-servings of fish-and-chips. Take it to the next level by wrapping them in small pieces of newspaper, which, oddly enough, all seem to be printed with unfavorable reviews of Jeff ’s novel.

7. Have you ever noticed how sun-dried tomatoes and top-grade peyote look exactly the same? Not a suggestion, really. Just saying.

8. Another one for the vegetarians. If they think they like tofu, wait until they sample your delicious mock tofu—all you need is chicken fat, puréed pork loin, and five cups of piping-hot tallow. Cheryl will never know the difference.

9. Tempura makes great finger food, and the batter locks the flavor of just about anything in a savory, opaque crust. Impress your friends with creative choices, from squash blossoms to mislaid car keys to the two-carat engagement ring that Cheryl gave back to you after she “reassessed things.” Surprise!

10. Guests getting antsy? Head them off with a big bowl of steamed mussels. No one can resist mussels, not even emotionally stunted ex-fiancées and their new poorly-received-novelist boyfriends. Besides, disappearing into the kitchen will give you a chance to collect your thoughts and also to go slash Jeff ’s tires.

11. Homemade sugared almonds make the perfect sendoff, sure to please all your guests, even the ones who would be bludgeoning you with a tire iron if Peter weren’t standing between you. Good old Peter. He may not be the brightest or the handsomest person, but he’s very large.

12. As the party disperses, your guests might seem a little ungrateful, calling you an obsessive sociopath or pelting you with sugared almonds. Don’t worry, it’s probably the peyote talking. Just stand on the porch as their cars pull out, your eyes brimming with tears, and shout, “You know, I try, I really do . . .”

13. Add, “My dog died! He died! And he’s never coming back!”

14. Hepatitis! (Note: This is not technically an appetizer.)

Anyway, a short flash fiction piece I wrote is going to open an anthology about being bitten by werewolves/vampires/zombies etc! 

I have been trying for so, so long to get an agent to represent two novels I've written.  I recently (like at the beginning of May- see [""Short Story Writing Month""](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/gxzgh/may_is_national_short_story_month_anyone_want_to/) on Reddit!) decided to go the other route and try to get some short stories in print.  I was prepared for a long slog.  A long, long slog.  But!  

Anyway, the downside is I'm doing it for free.  At this point I don't care; I just want to be in print, and have a credit on my resume.  I'm seeing if I can get an author's copy of the book at least, and maybe a discount on other copies.  We'll see.  

So, r/writing, thanks for being there for me when times were bad.  I thought I'd share when times are finally good.  I'll keep you posted.  In the mean time, [if you want to have a stab at it, go for it!](https://sites.google.com/a/wickedeastpress.com/wicked-east-press/open-submissions)  (It's the ""Once Bitten, Never Die"" anthology.)

Many thanks to [pawnstorm](http://www.reddit.com/user/pawnstorm) for organizing the short story writing boards in May- it really gave me the kick in the pants I needed to get going.

1330772616.0,79,self.writing,qfsvp,I never describe my character's physical appearances. Is that a bad thing?,94,15,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/qfsvp/i_never_describe_my_characters_physical/,"When I'm reading a novel and I see an early paragraph that's set aside to describe a main character as they enter the door, I always skim over that shit unless it hooks me.

Throughout the rest of the book, I build a picture of that character in my own mind using their posture, actions and dialogue patterns. I once read a novel where by the end, I'd have this perfect image of a tall, sturdy brunette woman with shoulder-length hair and solid green eyes. Reading it and noticing the early descriptions, turns out she was short, long-haired and blonde with blue eyes. So whoops. The image that stuck in my head produced more emotion, because every time I replaced the author's character, I felt less of a connection and less impact. I just couldn't picture that combination of physical characteristics with her personality.

And since I wind up writing what I know, and I know that *I* ignore the shit out of descriptions because they don't usually matter to the plot, I never write a single description of any character. I write in their posture, sometimes their build, (""The overseer who looked like he wrestled bears in his spare time said,""), the way they speak and maybe toss in their fashion sense and basically tell the reader, ""Fuck you. Make your own fucking characters. I'm tired of that describing shit.""

ADDED: I can see how the small, single-sentence descriptions sprinkled like salt throughout the book is used to dodge that idea of a block of description in the first chapter, but I find that even if you read and pay attention to those, it's more useful than the wall-o-text, but still ineffective, as the reader tends to forget individual sentences in an ocean of writing.

I really like reading this sub-reddit, but there has been a part about it bugging me. Quite a bit of you guys started talking about how writing in first person is dead, and that most writers should focus on writing in third person limited as it is a better way to write.

First off, I completely disagree with that claim. Writing in the first person, in my opinion, is just as alive and kicking in the writing world than it has ever been.

Secondly, I accually prefer writing in the first person. When writing in the third person, especially third person limited, I feel that it has way to many limitations and you can't really do much else but say, the character did this, the character did that, the character died and his best friend cried out in the rain promising vengence apon the killer. (You get my point.) In the first peron, you can do that and do alot more when it comes to character development. With first person, you can get into the character's head; you can be the character's thoughts and feelings. You can BE the character, and influence what the character does, what the character feels.

Third, I believe that there is no better way to write when it comes to point of view for a story.

1371822274.0,78,self.writing,1gskj1,I uploaded my first novel to Amazon a week ago. This is a detailed postmortem.,86,8,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1gskj1/i_uploaded_my_first_novel_to_amazon_a_week_ago/,"Hi, /r/writing! Some of you may know me already. I comment here fairly often and have submitted some well-received articles such as [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1a2bbb/original_ideas_considered_harmful/), [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/13cbtm/my_personal_view_of_showing_vs_telling/) and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/11523b/a_guide_to_character_construction/). As the title says, I just self-published my first full-length novel, and I thought you might be interested in hearing my honest assessment of the experience. 

Here's the [obligatory link to my book, The Reintegrators](http://www.amazon.com/The-Reintegrators-ebook/dp/B00DD0UQCG). It's a YA science fiction/fantasy story about a young man searching through parallel worlds for a cure for his father's illness, and getting his mind scrambled along the way. The usual assortment of blurb/sample/etc. is available there if you're interested. Now, on to the story.

The book started one day when I was bored driving, and had a random idea for a method people could use to travel between alternate universes in a plausible way (I mean, it's not at all *actually* plausible, but it seemed more interesting to me than the whole ""hey we found a magic door"" thing). I had been wanting to write a book for a while, so I started brainstorming more, trying to see if I could build a story around that initial seed. The way I conceived of it, traveling between universes was a skill that must be learned, so I decided I wanted some of the action to take place in a school, and for there to be an antagonist who was a former student, as well as an older ""mentor"" character who would help drive the plot in some way. 

That was about the state of the ideas I had kicking around my head when I stumbled on the [snowflake method](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/) a week later. This was enormously beneficial as it gave me a framework which happened to fit my personality--put simply, I'm a control freak who loves to outline. I don't begrudge anyone who prefers to free-write, but there's just no way I could ever finish a book by the seat of my pants like that. I like feeling confident that my story is going somewhere, and I like knowing how much I have left to finish (whenever I didn't feel like writing on a particular day, I would always repeat to myself ""eleven more chapters to go, just eleven more, do this one, then there'll be ten..."").

In the case of the Reintegrators, I started doing my chapter outlines in Word, then switched to Excel when the interweaving of simultaneous plot lines required two-dimensions to keep track of (if you read the book maybe you'll get a better sense of what this means, but suffice to say it gets complicated, hopefully in a good way). I didn't initially write detailed outlines for what happened within the chapters, although I did do some “just in time” pre-summaries for scenes which were giving me trouble (it wasn't until much later when I read [2k to 10k](http://www.amazon.com/2k-10k-Writing-Faster-ebook/dp/B009NKXAWS) that I realized I should be doing this for every scene). I also wrote out little 1-2 paragraph descriptions for each major and minor character, as well as 1-2 pages of notes for each alternate world they visit. All told, it took around six weeks to finish all of the pre-production.

Then came the writing. I used Word again (I've tried Scrivener since, but I don't like it--Word is just too comfy for me). For the most part I was very productive—on days when I wrote, I would bang out 1500-3000 words, and walk away feeling like I was well on the way to the great American novel. Of course, in reality I had no clue at all what I was doing, but at least as a result I avoided the self-consciousness that plagues so many budding writers. One thing I'll say about finishing that 90k-word first draft: typing the words ""THE END"" was one of the most satisfying rushes I've ever felt in my life. Nothing else in my writing ""career"" has ever come close, especially not the final publication of this book, which is just one long nerve-wracking nightmare. After that, I was anxious to get started editing, so I took my manuscript to Kinkos and had it printed in a giant binder, bought a set of nice Pilot red pens, and went to work.

And that's where my troubles began. Even though I had been revising each chapter as I went along, what I saw on the pages in front of me was often excruciatingly terrible. And worse, even though I knew it was bad, I had no idea how to fix it. I would circle whole pages in red pen, go back on the computer and re-write them--and they'd be just as awful as before. But still, I persevered. After two months of revising, I had increased my word count to 100k, and put the book aside with the idea that I would give it one more coat of polish before submitting it for publication.

Several things happened around that time. I found a little book called [The Craft of Writing Science Fiction That Sells](http://www.amazon.com/Craft-Writing-Science-Fiction-ebook/dp/B006MAZPEI), which was like discovering the Rosetta Stone after spending years trying to decipher Hieroglyphics on my own. I started frequenting /r/writing, and found out that in fact there were at least two or three other people in the world also writing novels, and most of them were way better at it than me. I submitted some other stories I had written for critiques, and got duly ripped apart. But somehow it felt amazing. Yes, it sucked to find out that I sucked. But really, it was just confirming what I knew already, deep down. And for the first time I was actually being given the tools to critically evaluate myself, to stop editing in circles and say ""yes, I know this sentence is better than that one, and I'm confident in that decision.""

Time passed. I wrote and published a novella and some short stories. I became a craft-book junkie and spent way too much time on reddit, critiquing others and learning a lot in the process (it stings to point out a flaw in someone’s writing and then realize you’ve been doing exactly the same thing in your own work forever). Eventually, I went back to put the final coat of polish on the Reintegrators, and was stunned to realize just how much my writing had changed. On the bad side, there was no way I could just quickly edit that mess and then submit it to agents like I had planned. But at least now I knew what had to be done. The first quarter of the book had to be chopped up and cut down to get things moving. I changed the main character drastically, giving him more motivation and making him more of an active player in the plot. I cut tons of material from existing scenes: extraneous words, stupid asides and weird ideas that didn’t contribute anything to the final plot. All told, I removed 20k words to bring the final count down to 80k. I did all of this with two Word documents in split-screen mode, reading the old manuscript on one side and writing a fresh one on the other. Then, I went through it all again, really polishing this time, until what I was left with was essentially the second draft of a brand new novel.

That process took around 3 months. On the plus side, I was left with something far superior to what I had before, and I was pretty close to my goal of the book being publishable. Some of the chapters had survived mostly intact from the first draft (hey, they weren't ALL bad), and were essentially done at that point. But there was also a lot of brand-new material that was added even after the initial re-write, and that stuff probably wasn't quite good enough to show the public yet. The problem was that I was pretty goddamn sick of the book by then, and really just wanted it off my back so I could move on to other things.

I researched agents, spent an *incredibly* long time crafting a letter, and sent out some queries. They all came back as form rejections, so I sent out some more. More form rejections. At this point I was distracted (in a good way) working on another fantasy novel (to be finished this year I hope), so I was taking my time, continuing to tweak my messaging as I sent more letters. But no matter what I did, all I got back was forms. I never did succeed in receiving an actual personalized response from anyone.

Looking back, I’ll probably never know exactly what the problem was. If I had to do it again, I would try to attend conferences and meet agents in person before querying them, as I believe that would have given me a huge advantage. Probably my opening pages could have been tweaked, as could my query letter (hint: if you can't imagine the blurb in your query on the back of your published book without getting embarrassed, it's not very good). But even if none of that were true, and I had everything going for me, let's face it: getting published is fucking difficult. Oh well.

In any case, after going through a fair number of agents and small-presses, I decided I had had enough. A couple people have asked me why I gave up so easily, instead of continuing until I had queried every single agent and publisher in the industry. But I guess the idea of leaving the book in limbo for years on the very small chance someone would pick it up just didn't appeal to me. At least if I get it out there now, I stand a chance of someone hearing about my work, instead of being just another anonymous entry in the slush pile. It's not as if I've given up on my goal to be traditionally published--it just won't be with this book. But I think I have at least a few more left in me.

Of course, self-publishing is a choice that comes with risks. I have a bad feeling that if this book flops, I'll be doing irreparable damage to any hope I had of a future career. Hence why I'm so nervous, and why I'm sitting here, writing a 2000-word postmortem instead of sleeping.

But anyway, back to the story. After I decided to self-publish, I sent out around seven samples of my opening chapter to various editors, and eventually decided that I liked [R.J. Locksley](http://rjlocksley.blogspot.com/) the most. She ended up giving a lot of useful feedback about the book of course (in addition to the line corrections), but overall her impression was very positive, which certainly helped lift my spirits after all those harsh rejections. For the cover, I searched around for a designer whose work looked the most professional and striking, and settled on [Damonza](http://damonza.com/). I personally love the cover I ended up with, even though I probably screwed up its salability by demanding he make it exactly the way I always envisioned it, instead of just letting him do his thing. Unfortunately, I have somewhat particular tastes in covers which don't necessarily align with what is in fashion at the moment. This is the downside to self-publishing--you're free to make your own success, but also to shoot yourself in the foot. 

And then, after one more three-week-long final proofread/polish, the book was ready. I was already familiar with intricacies of dealing with Amazon, although there were some new twists as always, in particular figuring out print formatting for the first time (I wrote up a little log my experiences with that [here](http://metanautics.net/2013/05/15/adventures-in-book-layout/)). So I filled out the forms, clicked the mouse, and just like that, it was done. After all this waiting, it feels peculiarly sudden. Maybe a little empty. On one hand, completing the process I've described here is a major accomplishment, and yet in another way it’s not. If things had gone differently and I had been accepted for publication, I could have said, ""no matter what else happens, I did that."" But anyone can upload anything to Amazon. Whether what I did is worthwhile or not will depend on what the readers think, or even whether or not I can get any readers at all.

So, I guess I'll start promoting the book as best I can and see what happens. Thanks to everyone here who critiqued me and set me straight over the years, and those of you who posted your problems and questions, which forced me to examine my own flaws even as I gave advice. And for the four of you that actually read this far, thank you for your attention and good luck with your writing.

It began as a short story assignment for a creative writing class, but I kept working on it after that assignment was finished. My original concept was a re-telling of Milton's Paradise Lost, but as I started to plan it out, it took off in its own direction. It eventually developed into a war story about the rebellion against an all-powerful Big Brother-ish organization called ANGELS. I worked on it sporadically, but perhaps a year later I had a completed manuscript of some 60,000 words.

It then sat on my computer, untouched, for another year. Simply put, I didn't think it was any good, and given that I was busy with college and work, I didn't give it much more thought. 

One day I was browsing Craigslist, and came across a call for submissions from a publisher called Malachite Quills. So, what the hell, I dusted off that old story and sent them a sample.

They accepted it, and said they wanted the full manuscript. I went through the whole editing process, and they were very easy to work with, even though it was all done online. Eventually it was listed on Amazon and Barnesandnoble.com as an ebook. Somehow it still didn't really seem real.

A few weeks ago I got an email that they were planning to release a paperback edition of the book. It just recently went up on Amazon, and there's a copy on its way to me. NOW it seems real. I will soon have a physical copy of a book that I wrote, with my name on the cover. 

[The book](http://www.amazon.com/Theyre-Watching-Over-Eric-Henn/dp/1623750172/ref=tmm_pap_title_0)

So, what's my point? Well, I have a few.

First and foremost: OH MY GOD MY BOOK IS OUT IN PAPERBACK!

Second: You never know who's going to accept that thing that you thought was garbage. I know I was anything but confident about They're Watching Over You, but here we are.

Dear Smashwords Authors, Publishers and Literary Agents,

This email is being sent to all authors, publishers and agents who have published erotica at Smashwords. We will also post this message to Site Updates and the Press Room.

According to our records, you pubish _ erotica-categorized title(s) out of _title(s) now live in the Smashwords system. This message may or may not pertain to you. 

Today we are modifying our Terms of Service to clarify our policies regarding erotic fiction that contains bestiality, rape and incest. If you write in any of these categories, please carefully read the instructions below and remove such content from Smashwords. If you don’t write in these categories, you can disregard this message.

PayPal is requiring Smashwords to immediately begin removing the above-mentioned categories of books. Please review your title(s) and proactively remove and archive such works if you are affected. 

I apologize for the short notice, and I’m especially sorry for any financial or emotional hardship this may cause the authors and publishers affected by this change. 

As you may have heard, in the last couple weeks PayPal began aggressively enforcing a prohibition against online retailers selling certain types of ""obscene"" content. 

On Saturday, February 18, PayPal’s enforcement division contacted Smashwords with an ultimatum. As with the other ebook retailers affected by this enforcement, PayPal gave us only a few days to achieve compliance otherwise they threatened to deactivate our PayPal services. I've had multiple conversations with PayPal 
over the last several days to better understand their requirements. Their team has been helpful, forthcoming and supportive of the Smashwords mission. I appreciate their willingness to engage in dialogue. Although they have tried their best to delineate their policies, gray areas remain.

Their hot buttons are bestiality, rape-for-titillation, incest and underage erotica. 


The underage erotica is not a problem for us. We already have some of the industry’s strictest policies prohibiting underage characters (we don’t even allow non-participating minors to appear in erotica), and our vetting team is always on the lookout for ""barely legal"" content where supposed adults are placed in underage situations.

The other three areas of bestiality, rape and incest were less well-defined in our Terms of Service (https://www.smashwords.com/about/tos) before today. I’ll 
tackle these one-by-one below, and I'll provide you a summary of the changes that will go into effect immediately.

*Incest:* Until now, we didn’t have a policy prohibiting incest between consenting adults, or its non-biological variation commonly known as ""Pseudo-incest."" Neither did our retailer partners. We’ve noticed asurge of PI books over the last few months, and many of them have ""Daddy"" in the title. I wouldn't be surprised if the surge in ""Daddy"" titles prompted PayPal to pursue this purge (I don't know). PI usually explores sexual relations between consenting adult stepchildren 
with their step parents, or between step-siblings. Effectively immediately, we no longer allow incest of any variety in erotica.

Like many writers, censorship of any form greatly concerns me. It is with some reluctance that I have made the decision to prohibit incest-themed erotica at Smashwords. Regardless of your opinion on incest, it’s a slippery slope when we allow others to control what we think and write. Fiction is fantasy. It’s not real. It unfolds in our imagination. I’ve always believed fiction writers and readers should have the freedom to explore diverse topics and situations in the privacy of their own mind. From an imagination perspective, erotica is little different from a literary novel that puts us inside the mind of farm animals 
(1984), or a thriller novel that puts us inside the mind of a terrorist, or a horror novel that puts us inside the mind of an axe-murderer or their victim. All fiction takes us somewhere. We read fiction to be moved, and to feel. Sometimes we want to feel touched, moved, or disturbed. A reader should have the right to feel moved however they desire to be moved.

Incest, however, carries thorny baggage. The legality of incest is murky. It creates a potential legal liability for Smashwords as our business and our books become more present in more jurisdictions around the world. Anything that threatens 
Smashwords directly threatens our ability to serve the greater interests of all Smashwords authors, publishers, retailers and customers who rely upon us as the world’s leading distributor of indie ebooks. The business considerations compel me to not fall on the sword for incest. I realize this is an imperfect decision. 
The slippery slope is dangerous, but I believe this imperfect decision is in the best interest of the community we serve.

*Bestiality:* Until now, we didn’t have a stated policy regarding bestiality. 
I like animals. Call me old fashioned or hypocritical (I’m not a vegetarian), but I don’t want to be a party to anyone enjoying animals for sexual gratification, for the same reason we’ve never allowed pedophilia books. I don’t want to publish it, sell it, or distribute it. The TOS is now modified to reflect this. Note this does not apply to shape-shifters common in paranormal romance provided the were-creature characters are getting it on in their human form. Sorry I need 
to clarify it that way, but we don’t want to see bestiality erotica masquerading as paranormal romance. 

*Rape:* Although our Terms of Service prohibits books that advocate violence against others, we did not specifically identify rape. This was an oversight on our part. Now we have clarified the policy. We do not want books that contain rape for the purpose of titillation. At Smashwords, rape has no longer has a place in erotica. It has no place anywhere else if the purpose is to titillate. 

Non-consensual BDSM - or any other form of non-consensual violence against another person - is prohibited. 

*NEXT STEPS:* If you have titles at Smashwords that are now expressly forbidden, 
by the end of day Monday (Feb 27), please click to your Dashboard at https://www.smashwords.com/dashboard 
and click UNPUBLISH then click ARCHIVE. This will also cause our automated systems 
to remove the titles from retail distribution.

Amazon: http://amzn.to/10EYxBS
iTunes:   http://bit.ly/X43f5X 

You can preview the first few chapters on amazon - Critique away.

When I started the book I was hungry for any information about process, any words from someone who had done it and lived to tell the tale. Here are mine:

**The publishing process**
The book began as posts on a messageboard. (Soulstrut.com) Someone started a thread called ‘Have you ever been in a porno?’ – I was up late, avoiding my thesis deadline and this was a perfect distraction from the writing I was meant to be doing. 

No I have not been in a porno, but I did work in a chain of porn stores back in ’99 so I wrote a few  short anecdotes. The thread exploded. 

People were messaging me asking to hear more descriptive accounts of the brief scenes I had described, so after posting  more and more I started a blog. 

The blog lasted a year or so – I worked on longer versions of the posts and had around 18 short anecdotes in total. The blog did well based on word-of-mouth from the Soulstrut forum and I enjoyed seeing the little traffic spikes as new messageboards would discover my little stories.

Then one of the Soulstrut members approached me via private message saying he was looking to set up a small independent artist collective and that if I could weave my anecdotes into an actual story – he would publish them. 

Chris Portugal is better known as Thes One – Rapper, DJ, Producer and founding member of hiphop group People Under The Stairs. Receiving the news from a dude who’s music I owned was crazy to say the least – I was down to do this but had absolutely no clue how.

Thes put me in touch with his friend Justin, a real-life editor (I was intimidated and impressed) and I was tasked with providing 3 pages on all the major characters plus 20 on myself.

It was then that I realised just how much work was going to be involved in stripping back those anecdotes, establishing a voice and writing an actual book rather than a few short scenes.

I wrote the character descriptions in one night – I had lived and worked with these people years ago, my mind had well-formed ready-to-go so all I had to do was jot them down. I procrastinated for days when it came to writing about myself.

**My character description method:**
I described each character physically, then to further create a picture in Justin’s mind I chose a well known figure and drew comparisons. For example: I described one co-worker as looking like a young Clint Eastwood. This shortcut approach saved a lot of words. 

I also described the music each character listened to as I felt this added another layer to the complete picture. This assigning of musical themes ended up becoming a major theme throughout the finished work and I have had many people comment that it is one of the things they like best about the book. 

**Lesson 1: Go with your gut**
Using music as a way to describe a character (or scene) just felt right to me and this translated naturally rather than feeling forced. Justin recognised that I felt comfortable doing this and encouraged me to continue.

I was still coming up with excuses not to write about myself and even sent through a barrage of alternate opening chapter ideas in the hope that Justin would become distracted.

No such luck.

By forcing me to revisit the time when I was a broken hearted, drug addled porn clerk – to look at myself as a character, Justin and Thes taught me what I think was the biggest lesson: 

**Lesson 2: Write what you know – don’t fake it.**
I cringe when I think of some of the fake crap I sent through before realising that the real good work is the honest stuff – those words that come when you detatch your ego and just fuckin write the truth. It was hard because I still did not consider myself a writer – deep down I was some guy who was faking it and was terrified that someone would ask to see my writers credentials.

Then Justin suddenly left due to a family illness and the whole project looked shaky. I just plugged away, writing more and more draft versions of more and more scenes, I was lost in the story not knowing which way was the right way nor if what I was producing was any good at all.

The lesson I learned during this time is the old one we have all heard a thousand times, but damn it – it’s so true: 

**Lesson 4: Just. Write.**
Just write – keep going, keep going, keep going. Put pen to paper and just write. We ended up cutting 30 000 words from the manuscript. Thirty thousand words. Thats a shit-ton. But those 30000 words didn’t die, they were where new ideas were tested, bad ideas were exposed and where little nuggets hid. Just Keep Writing.

To cut a very long story short, I ended up editing with one of my best friends – he is the kind of guy who could just say “chapter two’s crap man” and it was like music to my ears. 

**Lesson 5: Embrace negative feedback.**
I would send pages to friends and hear things like “It was great” or “I really liked it”. What the hell can you do with that? I was aching for someone to tell me it sucked and why. When Wiel did, it was like a weight had been lifted – his negative feedback provided a scaffolding on which to build.

**Lesson 6: Read your words aloud.**
GOLD advice originally from Thes but taken to a whole new level by Wiel and I when we read the thing like a script. If anything you have written is clunky or awkward – it will stand out when you read aloud. 

Plus reading dialogue back and forth with a friend is fun especially when that dialogue includes the type of conversations that happens in porn stores. 

So I had all these pages and Wiel and I had whittled a pretty good story out of them but it still didn't feel ready. By now we had all these parts, these scenes, these moments – and we knew the narrative path, we knew the end, but it just needed tightening up.

**My Lego brick method:** I considered each of these chapters/scenes/moments as a Lego brick. I literally wrote the name of each on a separate piece of paper and started reordering them on the floor in my living-room. When I found a promising new build I would open the laptop, copy/pasta and see what came out.
 
All good and well, but it was still a jumbled mess of pages. Enter Tom Williams.

**Lesson 7: You need a real editor.**
Grammar, punctuation, formatting. They’re kind of important. The writer writes, the editor edits. The state of the manuscript I foisted upon poor Tom... ouch. But he weaved his magic and turned my endless chains of words separated by commas into actual sentences. 

What he delivered back was an actual book. You need a real editor.

 
This has turned into a novel itself, I will cut it short here and write more if anyone finds this of any value. And shit, if you made it this far, you deserve something so i’ll send a free copy of the eBook to the first 5 people who reply. 
Unless your reply is “I don’t want an ebook” then you won’t get one.

Sometimes a name can be chosen through trial and error--a syllable here, a syllable there, until something seems to click.

What about all the other times? There are random name generators online which may useful for throwaway characters, but what if you want a name that's a bit more meaningful, or otherwise has a certain sound or feel to it?

Here's what I do: download a database of names and sort/filter the data until I find what I'm looking for.

First name database: http://www.lexique.org/public/Prenoms100.zip (linked from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/362202/is-there-a-free-or-low-cost-database-of-first-and-last-names).

Last name database (based on the US census, so not as useful for stories taking place elsewhere): http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/names.zip (linked from http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html).

The latter file comes as .csv and .xls (Excel), the former is tab-delimited text. Both of them can easily be imported into the spreadsheet program of your choice, including Google Docs.

Once you have the data in the spreadsheet, use the ""Filter"" command to filter the data to your liking. For example, lets say I'm looking for a Welsh first name for a male character. In Google Docs, I select Data -&gt; Filter, then click the arrow in cell C1 (language). I click ""Clear"", then type ""welsh"" in the search box, then click ""Select all,"" followed by OK. Then I filter column B (""genre"") and select only male names. From here, I can filter or sort by starting letter, syllable, or frequency of use in a similar way until I find a name I like.

Filtering in Excel works approximately the same way, except that in my opinion the interface is a little bit easier to use, because you can select pre-defined operators (equals, does not equal, begins with, contains, etc.).

1375755479.0,71,self.writing,1js8tc,Five Easy Steps to Writing Kickass Heroes,119,48,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1js8tc/five_easy_steps_to_writing_kickass_heroes/,"**1. The Chosen One.** People like to read stories where the hero is born special, just like them. The most effective way to demonstrate that a character is special is to refer to local legend. A lot of really important people in history got their start in prophecy, like Napoleon and Abraham Lincoln. Remember the fantasy movie *The Matrix*? The main character’s name was Neo. That’s “One” spelled backwards. It’s not a coincidence. 

**2. Let the plot dictate the backstory.** Let’s face it, backstory is boring. That’s why it’s backstory and not frontstory. Backstory is for fixing plot holes. For example, late in the game, the hero of your book steals a tank. How does he know how to drive a tank? Well, it just so happens that his father was a tank driver. (Oh my god, that’s crazy! I know!) Then later when the hero discovers some Sanskrit tablet, it turns out he reads Sanskrit because his grandmother was the most famous archeologist in the world, and she taught him to read every language from Greek to Roman to Spanish, or whatever. Boom. Backstory.

**3. Tragedy builds character.** We all know that adversity is the great teacher. What doesn’t kill you, makes you smarter. It’s a fact. This is why old people are really wise. Yoda was 900 years old, and he was so smart he could read minds. It works like this: you get cancer; you learn about the meaning of life. You shoot your buddy in a hunting accident; you learn about friendship. Your spouse dies in a terrorist attack; you learn everything about international politics and firearms. Dead spouses and dead children make characters really great. If at all possible, combine the two. For example, “Jack lost his pregnant wife in an elevator fire.” That tells us everything we need to know about Jack. Why is he relentless and angry and crazy good at kicking people? His wife got cooked like a turkey in an elevator shaft.

**4. Love at first sight.** Everybody likes a good love story, and they’re easy to add to almost any plot. Don’t overthink it, though. Nobody wants to read about the slow budding of feelings that occurs when two people reveal their inner-most hopes and fears while sharing the mundane pleasures of daily life over the course of weeks and months and years. Ambien alert. All you need is two really good-looking people. Nobody knows why anybody falls in love, so don’t bother trying to explain it.

**5. Revenge is the only motive.** Real world motives don’t work well in fiction. A real world motive is something like, “John goes to work because he doesn’t want to eat Panera dumpster bread.” Well, hurray for John. Revenge is the best motive because it’s something everyone has experience with. We all have enemies. Most of us have a room in our home dedicated to pinned up maps and highlighted articles and creepy charcoal drawings of eyes and photographs taken with a telephoto lens. Revenge is also a simple motive to maintain. No matter what happens to our hero, there’s no reevaluation of priorities. He’s never like, “Oh, it’s such a pretty day. Look at those joggers; look at those ducks. I really should stop chasing my father’s killer, and just take some time to focus on me. Maybe try hot yoga.” Catharsis requires a bloodbath. It’s like therapy. Read *Othello.*",,False,,t5_2qh2n,False,,,True,t3_1js8tc,http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1js8tc/five_easy_steps_to_writing_kickass_heroes/,

What I write isn't good enough. It reads horribly on paper, despite sounding amazing in my head. I overcomplicate and undercomplicate and use too much or too little detail for important or unimportant story details. It's never good enough. 

I know the plot. I know what the core of the story is, but I can't flesh it out. Every time I do I write 1-2 chapters and realize it's unoriginal in every way. Every idea I have is from somewhere else, connected somehow. I know someone once said that no idea is original, but how you write it is, but I can't see it that way. I just cant.

How do you make writing fun? How do you maintain confidence enough to come back time and time again? For me, it's boring and confidence-destroying. I WANT to write. I am full of ideas but every time it's the same.

It's almost as if I'm more happy living with the fantasy that I can write an incredible novel than actually trying to write the novel and later discovering that my fantasy could never happen because I'm not good enough as a writer to tackle a project this large.  

The book I'm writing about is almost about everything.  It's about love, vulnerability, and raw humanity.  The goal is basically bring all the truths that we tacitly know about ourselves to the surface, and to express our humanity in such a pure form that it will demolish readers with its truthness.  

So now you see the colossal task I'm giving myself, and how incredibly pretentious the project is.  I'm 14,000 words in it so far but now I'm at a point where I think I can't dig deeper into humanity.  Not because there's nothing left to bring to light, but because I'm afraid that what I bring to the surface will not be the truth.  And instead be a bunch of bullshit about 'here's the way I see it'.

*Moon Sweet Moon*

**Entry 1 :**

The orbiting command module engaged its primary engines like a bottle rocket with an all too short fuse. Champagne corks popped, drinks were poured and music blared in the homes of all who watched the heavens.

""Houston, we have a problem"". Neal Armstrong's voice cracked over mission control's central P.A. system.

""Mr. Aldrin, Mr. Armstrong. We are doing everything we can to correct the issue.""

Sweat fogged the inside of Neal's helmet. Buzz stood like a statue, foot resting on the ladder of the lunar lander as they watched the command module leave the Moon's orbit without them.

""Houston ... we're open to suggestions. Houston?""

The transmitter in Neal's helmet sat silent. Buzz could hear a defined ringing in his ears as he stood looking at the earth above. The sound of silence, stress, and a man without option trying to create a plan B.

""Neal. Buddy. Have you ever read 'The Swiss Family Robinson'?"" Buzz said from his perch on the landing module.

**Entry 2 :**

Neal stood, unmoving. Waiting for Buzz to continue.

""'The Swiss Family Robinson' its about a family that survived a shipwreck and had to start a new life on an island paradise. Granted, I only flipped through it when I was a kid.""

""Buzz, we are on the moon with a few days of oxygen and food. It'd take NASA months, maybe years to get us down. I hardly think -""

A sharp static from the in helmet communicator cuts his dialogue

""Yeah, this is Mission Control ... First off I just want to thank the two of you for everything you've done for our country. We appreciate your sacrifice and ... hey ... if you want we could put you in contact with anyone you'd like to talk to. I think we can even get The Beatles in here.""

""Hey, Neal. That's not such a bad -""

""Buzz, The Beatles won't get us back to earth. We've got some time. I don't want to get comfortable with the idea of death just yet.""

""Fine, what do YOU want to do Neal?""

Neal's eyes shut. Let's a sigh only Atlas could relate to. Everything disappears for a moment. Just a man with his thoughts.

""Yeah, mission control. Give us a few minutes. Neal's having a stroke, or working out a charlie horse or something.""

**Entry 3 :**

""Neal, Neal, Neeeeeeal""

Neal's eyes opened. His vision blurred by the sweat dripping from the inside of his helmet. Buzz lightly tapped on the glass with his gloved finger.

""Buzz. Sometimes you have to leave a man with his thoughts.""

""I know, its just. Mission Control said they might be able to get The Rolling Stones to play a show for us tomm -""

""Fuck the Rolling Stones""

""Neal, NASA is going to have to censor that. They specifically requested we censor our dialogue so we can ... What was that again mission control?""

""We would prefer it if you avoided swearing while on mic as a means to preserve your image for future generations. No one wants an FCC fine if this is broadcast, you know?""

Neal stepped away from the lunar lander, toward the setting earth. Its light reflected on the cosmic sand at his booted feet. Neal always loved the beach, from his days spent at the neighborhood swimming hole. Long drives to the Pacific Ocean with family. Tears dripped and collected in his suit as he glanced at the spec of marble and brown that marked Santa Monica, California.

""Neal. NEAL. What are we going to do?""

""I'm going for a walk Buzz. I'm going. for. a. walk.""

**Entry 4 :**

Even through the vacuum of space, Neal could hear the crunch of lunar soil under his thick boots. Every step, historic. Every move, the first of its type by man. Every word uttered will be transcribed and memorized by children the world over for generations.

Even a death caused by folly will be considered heroic, legendary, epic.

""Hey Neal! Mission control was wondering if we'd like stuff to be named after us in tandem?""

""What?""

""Tandem. Like 'Neal Armstrong &amp; Buzz Aldrin High School'.""

""I think there are more important things to worry about, Buzz.""

Buzz's helmet transmitter crackles on like a mosquito stuck in a screen door.

""We'll have to get back to you on that Houston""

""Copy that. I've talked it over with the head of the Houston school board, and they can have a fountain in place by the end of the week. If you'd like, we can even have you two record a message for the kids. You know, something inspirational.""

""Hey Neal! You hear that? We're going to get a fountain!""

Neal sighed, and began the slow plod back to the lunar lander. Through his sweat, and tears he realized he hadn't re hydrated in hours.

""Mission control! Neal's coming back! I think he's excited about the fountain! Neal!""

Buzz waved at Neal with the enthusiasm of a child watching an approaching ice cream truck.

""Mission control, give me a break down on our supplies.""

""Neal, I'm glad you're back with us. We've got requests from The President, an agent from Hollywood and a half dozen make a wish kids for a meeting. We can -""

""Forget it.""

Neal shuts off his helmet transmitter as he nears the lunar lander.

""Buzz, we need to talk.""

**Entry 5 :**

Buzz shuts the door of the lunar lander behind them. A hiss fills the minivan sized chamber as oxygen pumps into its every crevice. Neal removes his helmet like a boxer at a round break. With his now glove less hand he wipes the condensation from the inside of his visor.

""Buzz, from the looks of it we have enough oxygen for three days of non strenuous activity. Enough food and water for two. Maybe more if we ration. The batteries on this bag of bolts should last until the end of the week.""

""Neal, what are you getting at?""

""We are going to die Buzz. We'll die as heroes sure, but we are going to die.""

""But our memories will live on ... ?""

Buzz gives an optimistic smile as he bites into a freeze dried ice cream.

""I'm just saying Neal, our life insurance will keep our families provided for. We'll be remembered forever as the first people to step on the moon and hey, we might get a private Beatles and Rolling Stones super concert!""

Buzz and Neal sit in silence for a moment.

""I wonder if we can get them to form up a super group? Oh man that'd be awesome! Imagine it Neal, we single handedly end the British Rock feud!""

Buzz finishes his ice cream.

""Neal? What should we call the super group Neal? The Rolling Beatles? The Beatle Stones? Beatle the Rolling?""

Buzz's pleas fall on def ears as Neal scribbles on a notepad. Each scratch and mark left with the focus of Moses atop Sinai. The thunder of his pen roars through the silence.

""Buzz, I think I have a plan.""

**Entry 6 :**

The NASA Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas sat as quiet as the Moon's surface. The temperature dropped a half degree. Not a breath was released. Goosebumps formed.

""Houston, this is Neal.""

""Copy that. We heard you have a plan?""

Neal glanced at his note pad like a high school student with eyes on a test he'd barely studied for. Each pause and breath was punctuated by a combination of the heavens and his slight chattering teeth.

""Well, we have enough food to last a few days. Oxygen to last slightly longer. The lunar lander has enough fuel to break the moon's gravitational pull, but without the command module there's no chance we'll make it back to earth before we suffocate.""

""So you're proposing ...""

""Luna 15. It flies overhead in two hours.""

**Entry 7 :**

During the space race of the 1960's, cold war enemies the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. occasionally found themselves allies in humanity's quest to explore the heavens. Sharing bits of data, tips, and flight plans as a means to help, or at least not inconvenience each others quest for knowledge.

Still, a race is a race and The U.S.S.R. tried to sneak across the finish line with a space probe launched days prior to Apollo 11's mission to the heavens. Luna 15, as it was called had a scheduled touch down date lining up precisely with Apollo 11's exit from the lunar surface.

""Luna 15! The Soviet Space Probe?""

""Exactly. Houston, we have the flight plan and enough fuel to -""

""Neal, what are you suggesting?""

Neal glanced out the lunar lander's triangular window. The great blue marble sunk below the horizon in front of him. The American Flag stood proudly planted. Unmoving. Buzz sat in the corner of the module, drafting a bucket list for his remaining days of consciousness.

""Buzz, do you know how to tie a lasso?""

**Entry 8 :**

""Neal, Buzz I think we're going to have to call Russia over this. They aren't going to be happy about a couple Yankees hijacking their space probe.""

""Houston, its scheduled for a return flight to Earth. If we can just, I don't know 'hitch a ride' it might save our lives. Hell, I'm okay with splitting the soil and moon rocks with them.""

Buzz looks up from his bucket list.

""You can split your moon rocks with them.""

""God damnit Buzz. Shut up and put your suit on.""

It's a part-time thing, and I like it that way. Driving to my class last night, the Boston bombing was on my mind, of course, along with the question of: How do you tell people that art is important after something like this? 

The week after 9/11, I had to walk into a creative writing classroom and tell a bunch of young people that -- even in a world where people could go to work in biz casual and a hour later be facing the choice to jump or burn -- art matters. Creativity matters. Trying to make the world more beautiful with the products of our hearts matters. It was a hard sell, even for me. But twelve years ago, I said basically the same thing I did last night. 

Here is what writing can give you, even if you never make a dime from it: In order to write well, you must force yourself to see people not as puppets tied hand and foot to the wheel of fortune, or sinners trapped in mortal skinsuits and waiting patiently for death and Paradise, but as human beings making choices, which lead to consequences and other choices, which lead to consequences and other choices, and so on and so on, unto the moment of their death. Thereby, you -- as a writer -- must force yourself to see everyone, from yourself to your Dutch uncle to the worst villain you can name, as someone with the capacity to choose. Someone rounded. Someone with desires. Someone with dreams. Someone who has people who love them, and wish the best for them, and who hope they do well and don't die in pain and despair. 

Whoever it was who put a pressure cooker full of nails, ball bearings and explosives in a trashcan in Boston, set a timer and then walked away couldn't see those things. They made their own choice: to see anyone who disagrees with them as flat and worthless, so that human beings became nothing more to them than paper targets. Being a writer -- thinking like a writer, experiencing life and relationships like a writer -- can insulate you from that kind of simplistic thinking. It can help you see that even if you don't agree with someone's choices, they came to those choices the same way you came to yours: which is, of course, with the tools they have, and the best way they know how.

It's easy to throw around the word ""evil"" at a time like this, but that's something thinking like a writer insulates you from, too. If they're worth a fuck, writers don't believe in ""evil,"" because they know ""He did it because he was evil!"" is telling, not showing, the original sin of writing.

I've been self-published in the past, and have signed two traditional contracts with the big-six for a total of 5 books.  I see the benefits an downsides of each route. Having this book rejected means I can now shift over to what I've wanted to be for some time ""a hybrid author"" that does both self-publishing and traditional at the same time. 

My last released book came out January 2012, and my next traditional book won't hit the street until Aug 2013.  That's 19 months with no new books on the market.  But now I can put out *Antithesis*  and cut that time between books significantly.  I would have liked to have it hit the streets for Christmas, but I'm deep into my current WIP so I'll probably shoot for mid January.  That means I'll cut down the ""time since last book own to 12 months and have some time to build up more of a readership for the August release of my next traditional work.

Recently I've had a few cases of this, but I will simply put the worst one.

The Church of Lamenting Spark is a society of religious zealots. Their ruling class is known as the Aristo. One of the main characters of the novel is forced to accompany the villain to a ball held for the Aristo. Whenever they have a ball it is always paired with a series of executions. In the center of the dance floor a set of guillotines are erected, in the middle of which a band, made up of the condemned, plays. Every hour one of the condemned, the one who the crowd thought was playing the worst, is executed. The ball traditionally ends when the dance floor it too covered in blood to continue to dance, and any of the band left alive at that point will have their execution postponed to the next ball. 

Edit: I realized the description is a lot less creepy than the actual scene. I left out a few details such as the Aristo all being horribly inbred genetic freaks and other such things.

If the latter, how will I know when it is a good time to start? 

I greatly appreciate any feedback!
