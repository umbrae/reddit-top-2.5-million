1372186651.0,452,self.atheismrebooted,1h1zoh,A Complete Summary of Recent /r/atheism Events,658,206,351,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h1zoh/a_complete_summary_of_recent_ratheism_events/,"###Part 1

1. /u/skeen originally created /r/atheism about 5 years ago. His [policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/y0spz/a_reminder_the_philosophy_of_ratheism/) was to essentially let the subreddit run itself without any interference.
2. /r/atheism eventually grew to be a default subreddit, after which /u/skeen added /u/tuber as a mod to take care of some minimal moderation duties, such as removing posts from the spam filter.
3. /u/tuber later added another mod, /u/jij
4. Recently, a [thread was made](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1ej2ul/requesting_removal_of_uskeen_from_ratheism/) in /r/redditrequest by /u/NotAMethAddict to have /u/skeen removed for inactivity. It was denied because the requestor was not a moderator of /r/atheism, but somebody messaged /u/jij about the request.
5. /u/jij then [submitted a request](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/) to /r/redditrequest and because /u/skeen hadn't logged into his account recently, the request was granted and /u/skeen was removed, making /u/tuber the top mod.
6. Almost immediately after that happened, [a policy change](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fldpw/mod_post_new_moderation_policy/) was made where images were no longer allowed to be directly linked. This was quite big for two reasons. Firstly, images made up the vast majority of content on /r/atheism. Secondly, it was a change that went against /u/skeen's original policy.
7. There was a large revolt against /u/jij by many people who were unhappy with the changes or who were unhappy with the way he had seemingly usurped control of the subreddit to make them.
8. /u/skeen logged back into his account and made it clear that he [wanted the subreddit back](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/). He claimed that he was active but browsed reddit with a different account.
9. The subreddit became divided between those who were against the changes and the removal of /u/skeen and those who liked the changes and agreed with /u/jij.
10. Many of the circlejerk and anti-/r/atheism subreddits got involved, resulting in lots of mocking, downvote-wars and insults being thrown around. They tried to frame the /u/skeen supporters as immature teenagers who wanted their ""may-mays"" (memes) and their karma back.
11. In order to try to placate some of the users, /u/jij created a [voting thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/) in which people could comment to accept or reject the changes. The majority voted to reject the changes and put the subreddit back to the way it was, with many also calling for /u/jij to resign as a moderator and give /u/skeen the subreddit back. /u/jij is still analyzing the results of the poll, the preliminary results of which [can be found here](http://atheism.xp3.biz/statistics.php).
12. /u/jij created a page on /r/atheism explaining [why he requested skeen](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g3mb8/full_disclosure_of_skeens_removal/) to be removed and why he made the changes he did, apologizing for not being transparent with the community or getting its input first.

###Part 2

13. Meanwhile, /u/tuber instated a large number of new moderators, many of whom are also moderators in /r/TheoryOfReddit and /r/AdviceAnimals, both well known for their anti-/r/atheism stances, as well as various meta-reddits and circlejerk subreddits.
14. Suddenly all threads complaining about the changes or the moderators, questioning it or really even mentioning it were deleted, as were many comments.
15. /u/tuber created /r/AtheismPolicy for people to voice their concerns instead, but most of the mods never responded to anything in it.
16. /u/syncretic2, one of the new mods, created a [PSA thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g4b53/psa_a_small_group_of_users_3040_are_currently/) in /r/atheism explaining that there were 40-50 users camping the [/new](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/new) queue and down-voting content. He also played down the importance of /u/jij's poll, saying that it wasn't necessarily going to lead to any changes.
17. Several users have now unsubscribed from /r/atheism and are moving to [/r/atheismrebooted](/r/atheismrebooted) and various other satellite subreddits.
18. Many people continued down-voting new content in /r/atheism and posting content about censorship and freedom of speech as a form of protest
19. /u/tuber was made a mod of /r/circlejerk and posted a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1g6mnj/mission_accomplished/) there showing /r/atheism going up in flames. This caused a lot of outrage.
20. The new /r/atheism mods hid the downvote button in an attempt to stop new content from being down-voted.
21. New /r/atheism mod, /u/airmandan posted an [official statement](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g98v0/policy_setting_a_positive_direction_for_the/) in which he coined several new phrases that are now being made fun of, such as ""*Stop. Think. Atheism.*"" He explained in [/r/SubredditDrama](/r/SubredditDrama) that it was [a joke](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1g9rt2/the_gift_that_keeps_on_giving_ratheism_mods_post/caid7ns).
22. [/r/atheismrebooted](/r/atheismrebooted) was temporarily taken over and defaced by [/r/circlejerk](/r/circlejerk). It has now returned to normal, minus most of the previous mods.
23. /u/tuber posted [an official apology](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1gauwa/an_apology_to_the_users_of_ratheism/) to /r/atheism, which was not received well by the users, most of whom were still calling for him and /u/jij to step down.
24. /r/atheism started adding some Knights of New (trusted members of the /r/atheism community) as mods. Some refused.

###Part 3

25. After speaking out against the new /r/atheism, /u/TheFacebookGod recanted and became a new mod. There was a [thread about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1gkpdl/apparently_anyone_can_be_bought/calh817) in /r/atheismrebooted and [in his own subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/askthelord/comments/1gjui1/why_are_you_listed_as_a_mod_in_ratheism/), /r/AskTheLord.
26. A new [weekly feedback thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1glum0/weekly_feedback_thread_1) was posted in /r/atheism. One of the biggest changes that was promised was new flair, more community mods, and linking to more smaller atheist communities. The thread was placed in ""*Contest mode*"", in which comments are listed in a random order and replies are not shown by default. As with most of their other threads, the community feedback was generally very negative.
27. /u/TheFacebookGod removed himself (or was removed?) as a moderator and leaked a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/lSuhfH9.png?) of part of the /r/atheism mod-chat. He [vowed to release](http://www.reddit.com/r/askthelord/comments/1gnw3w/i_am_god_for_some_reason_i_was_made_a_moderator/) another image each day.
28. Despite mostly negative feedback from the feedback thread, the /r/atheism mods added user flair.
29. /u/TheFacebookGod posted [a full album](http://www.reddit.com/r/askthelord/comments/1grlyt/ratheism_leaks_full_album/) of all of the leaked mod-chat screenshots, [provoking anger from the mods](http://imgur.com/a/TyfwW).
30. /u/TheFacebookGod also [offered to pay](http://i.imgur.com/C4PEcrD.jpg) for the top-mod position of /r/atheism
31. Meanwhile, all mentions of /r/AtheismPolicy are removed from the /r/atheism sidebar and wiki, and users are instead [directed to an IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/#atheism)
32. /u/TheFacebookGod is [reported as a spammer](http://reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/1gr58w/overview_for_thefacebookgod/) to /r/reportthespammers.
33. /r/AtheismPolicy is [made private](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h09fk/ratheismpolicy_is_a_private_sub_now/).
34. /r/AtheismRebooted sponsors [ads](http://reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h19be/thanks_to_uwaotter_for_sponsoring_the/) on /r/atheism
35. [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) announces a new subreddit, /r/atheismmobile, which is being seeded with images by /u/AtheismModBot.

So this is my request to you: please vote. Upvote what you like, downvote what you think isn't appropriate. The only way we can counter vote manipulation is to participate.

However, given the tensions I would like to appeal to the community to leave alone other subs engaged in drama with us. I can't demand it. I can't order it. I'm just asking. If we can stay on the side of angels and weather this storm, it'll give us ammunition to go to the admins and point out that we're not part of the problem.

1371819892.0,267,self.atheismrebooted,1gsijt,"Nine months ago syncretic used the results of a poll to fundamentally change a default forever, today syncretic says polling can't be trusted",446,179,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1gsijt/nine_months_ago_syncretic_used_the_results_of_a/,"Let me take you back nine months ago. Back then, /r/Bestof was a vibrant, active community that had a lot of content. Granted I was a lurker, but I enjoyed it none the less. Today, I barely ever notice a link hitting front page. Today, there are now as many new posts per day (according to stattit.com) on /r/bestof as there are on /r/tall. /r/tall is more than 20X smaller. 

http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_submissions_avg_1d/

I'll save you some time digging, /r/bestof is ranked 467th, in a community with 2.8 million people.

So what the fuck happened, you ask? Well syncretic and his band of ToR pseudo-intellectuals happened. Without much warning or pretex, a poll was buried at the bottom of a mod post, that made NO mention of a poll in the title (which would have alerted more people that were against the change to take a look). 

The results (that I remember to the best of my knowledge) was something along the lines of 40% wanted to remove default posts, 25%ish were against, and about 35% were neither for nor against. 

So what happened? Did they say ""well, we're not going to do anything yet because that was just feedback."" No. The change was made almost immediately, as in the very next day. 

What syncretic had to say about his reasoning why the change was made:

&gt;The majority who did care wanted to ban the defaults, and so did all the active mods. Therefore, we banned defaults. It's as simple as that.

http://i.imgur.com/z5aRCrO.png

I was pretty damn pissed. Not only was the poll not mentioned in the post title, but the poll didn't even garner a majority. Let's face it, if you're going to make huge, fundamental changes to the subreddit I think more than 40% support is warranted. Syncretic and the other mods obviously disagreed. 

One user made this astute comment:

&gt;The issue that caused this to come about was the perceived reduction in quality by the old school bestof redditors.

&gt;The solution the moderators decided on was that was put in place was to create /r/defaultgems and make it opt-in for everyone to see default reddit posts. The problem here is that it calls for action by the people who did not have a problem in the first place, and the result is a disappointing uptake of /r/defaultgems.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/zqx7m/announcement_its_time_for_another_poll_this_one/c66z4r8

I'm guessing people are starting to notice some parallels between what happened then and what is happening now. Specifically, ""The issue that caused this to come about was the perceived reduction in quality by the old school bestof redditors."" In our case, most of the new mods on /r/atheism left the subreddit YEARS ago, and are now coming back with their warped vision of how to 'fix' things.

The second parallel evident here is how they chose to deal with dissenters. Instead of implementing real compromise (such as allowing default posts some times during the week), they were instead relegated into a spinoff subreddit called '/r/defaultgems' (which has been a big failure as far as I'm concerned). And finally, the third parallel is that for at least a couple weeks a 'mega-thread' was created to help temper people's anger (much like how the feedback mega thread operates on /r/atheism now). 

There was a lot of blow back. A lot of people were very unhappy, as evidenced by threads like this one: http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/11uh52/meta_i_generally_feel_this_subreddit_is_less/?sort=controversial

(I suggest skimming through this thread at least. A good amount of our complaints and points of contention are very similar)

One thing I want to make very clear. No compromise was ever made. The mods conceded NOTHING. No ""default weekends"" (as was even suggested at the time by some of the mods in order to seem like they were taking our outrage into consideration). Nothing. They created /r/defaultgems, linked it from bestof, and basically called it a day. This was after months of debate. 

A few things I want to make clear and why I believe this is important and relevant to our situation now:

1) I know at least a couple of the mods involved in the /r/bestof change are now our mods, most significantly, syncretic

2) Unlike today, the mods did not disparage the results of the poll. In fact, it was very much used to justify their changes. 

3) They proposed a lot of 'compromises' but never went through with them. Right now our mods are doing the same thing, in fact, some of the compromises sound very familiar. 

4) The change did not permanently come into effect until about a month or so after they made the change. This is very important, because in doing so they were able to ensure most of the dissenters had bailed. In fact, in some of the leaked screenshots, moderators suggest waiting a month until the whole thing blows over is the best approach.

(Note: When I say 'permanently' I don't mean to say that the change was ever at any time reverted over the course of the month, it wasn't. It's just that they didn't officially declare victory until about a month later, by that time any dissent had completely lost steam)

5) Syncretic does not care about free speech. He doesn't care about what you want. The guy said so himself in the leaked mod posts. 

http://imgur.com/Rr6xZdS

Compare what syncretic said then to what he's saying now:

Bestof poll: http://i.imgur.com/z5aRCrO.png
Atheism poll: http://i.imgur.com/w4jZ6Bw.png

You notice how in the first image he uses the poll as justification for changes, and in the second he seems to completely mistrust the results? Why? The answer is very clear and very telling, the results of the first poll fit with what syncretic wanted, the second one didn't. That's the critical division between the two. 

The people we're dealing with are liars, hypocrites and elitists. They don't care what you want. They'll twist anything and everything to make fit into what they want.

But yeah...just remember to upvote all the stuff you find interesting/humorous/worthwhile, or heck...upvote every post if you want. The quickest way to get more subscribers is to get some of our posts on the front page. 

We can get halfway there, a few posts have hit a 500 vote threshold (adjusted total between up and downvotes), which really is not too bad considering we only have about 5000 subscribers thus far. 

So, don't be afraid, upvote posts where you can, and feel free to hangout in /new/ and give some votes to those as well. Every little bit will help us grow, here's a graph showing how far we've come so far and the trend is rising:

According to the traffic stats Jij posted, at around 9:00PM July 16, 2013 there were 2,172,652 subscribers to /r/atheism.  As of 9:00PM July 17, 2013 there are 2,170,224 subscribers.  So congratulations to Jij, Tuber and the other mods. I doubt that in your wildest dreams you ever thought you would be this successful.  I hear that Joel Osteen from the Lakewood Church near me is throwing a party in your honor. Give yourselves a pat on the back for a job well done.

My gut feeling is that it can't quite be dismissed that easily.

I've been a reader of /r/atheism for many years.  And my memory is terrible.  Can anyone remember (or look up) how long it took for /r/atheism to grow?  Going off my terrible recollection I can vaguely recall when we had less then 5k readers there.  It took maybe a year or so to break the 10k mark, I think.  I think it took almost all of  the 3 or 4  years after that to hit the 100,000 user mark?  Maybe?  Then it shot up like crazy to the two million that are there now, all due to being a default sub (again.)

I think hitting 5k in less than a month is a great start, IMO.  I don't think it can be dismissed as easily as some people would like to think.

As a Knight of /new in /r/atheism I interacted with the community frequently and I'm always pleased when I see a name I recognize from before.

Now, on the outside looking in they seem patently ridiculous, mostly because they are.  How do you break through the wall of superstition the religious have built around their minds and restore their ability to think and reason?  Is it a change an outsider can effect?  Or does the change have to be organic?  I wish I knew.

So, you might be a Christian if... 

10- You vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other religions, but feel outraged when someone denies the existence of your god.

9- You feel insulted and ""dehumanized"" when scientists say that people evolved from lesser life forms, but you have no problem with the Biblical claim that we were created from dirt

8- You laugh at polytheists, but you have no problem believing in a Trinity god

7- Your face turns purple when you hear of the ""atrocities"" attributed to Allah, but you don't even flinch when hearing about how God/Jehovah slaughtered all the babies of Egypt in ""Exodus"" and ordered the elimination of entire ethnic groups in ""Joshua"" -- including women, children, and trees!

6- You laugh at Hindu beliefs that deify humans, and Greek claims about gods sleeping with women, but you have no problem believing that the Holy Spirit impregnated Mary, who then gave birth to a man-god who got killed, came back to life and then ascended into the sky.

5- You are willing to spend your life looking for little loop-holes in the scientifically established age of the Earth (4.55 billion years), but you find nothing wrong with believing dates recorded by pre-historic tribesmen sitting in their tents and guessing that the Earth is a couple of generations old.

4- You believe that the entire population of this planet with the exception of those who share your beliefs -- though excluding those in all rival sects -- will spend Eternity in an infinite Hell of Suffering. And yet you consider your religion the most ""tolerant"" and ""loving"".

3- While modern science, history, geology, biology, and physics have failed to convince you otherwise, some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in ""tongues"" may be all the evidence you need to prove Christianity.

2- You define 0.01% as a ""high success rate"" when it comes to answered prayers. You consider that to be evidence that prayer works. And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply the will of God.

1- You actually know a lot less than many Atheists and Agnostics do about the Bible, Christianity, and church history -- but still call yourself a Christian ",,False,self,t5_2xguz,False,,,True,t3_1k2rup,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1k2rup/you_might_be_a_christian_if/,

Dear Rachael,
     It has come to my attention that you'll be studying cosmetology next year at MCCC. I would like to congratulate you on furthering your education and turning from the path you were on last year.
     I must tell you that you have begun to become very vain. Last Sunday instead of focusing on my lesson you were doing your make up and playing with your hair, I feel that you missed the point in my lesson. I would discourage you from continuing cosmetology as it would further your problem with vanity, I will say the same thing I did when you were looking to become a psychologist, a good Christian woman's place is in support of her husband.
     I know it's hard for some of you teen girls to see this but when you stop fighting it you'll see that it's where God wants women to be.
-Pastor (name omitted for privacy)
tl;dr My pastor told me not to become a cosmetologist and now I'm really upset and need encouragement

Edit: Thank you all so much, I've decided that once I've got my license of Cosmetology I'm going to use it to put myself through school and become the best psychologist in the country. And if I ever need encouragement I know I can come to a whole community of loving Redditors",,False,self,t5_2xguz,1371564412.0,,ca,True,t3_1gk7rf,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1gk7rf/my_pastor_just_emailed_me_about_my_vanity_problem/,

Here jij details his idea of what is good atheism and bad. He states that the ""cheap"" content doesnt affect him and ""when"" he was religious it was the more thought out arguments that really ""made him turn a corner"". This is his vision for /r/atheism to make it more what he thinks is ""the way"" it should be to ""educate"" people. This completely ignores the rest of people who may have been engaged by the other content and interested by it, rather than having to go and read long thought out arguments.

He is so self involved to think that funny pics/quote/memes that have been shown to be more effective at reaching larger audiences, just to grab attention and then suck people in to have more interest ASWELL as continuing to entertain the rest of the atheist crowd. 

/r/atheism drew in atheists looking for a giggle, for something funny, a community that was interested in talking about whatever they chose to share ammoungst themselves to enlighten and entertain. There were funny things aswell as enlightening things to see and read. And it was good. IF you had more interest or wanted some more detailed theological discussions on the matter of logic between atheism and religion there were places for you like /r/trueatheism . BUT this wasnt good enough for this dictator of right and wrong, he had to fuck with a community to change it to his ""vision"". The audacity of this short sighted arrogant fool to attempt to change a communtiy which he has only shown to be NOT his community. He is an extremist on the fringes that doesnt understand the group as a whole and just wants to change things to make himself more comfortable. This bares a striking simalarity with religious extremists trying to rule over their entire group and not giving a shit about everyone within it. He is a fucking dictator and needs to be over thrown.

I have spent the last year going to that subreddit to help me cope with a fundamentalist family. The memes, the articles, and most importantly the community have been a huge help. Now every time I go there, I find yet another dumbass thing they have done to ruin the subreddit.  Instead of being lifted by the community, all I see are a bunch of idgits hosting a donkey barbeque. Most everything that made the subreddit a success has been eaten by the tone deaf  mod zombies. 

That's enough about the negative tho. It is such a relief to see the normal /r/atheism  here on /r/atheismrebooted. I have a nephew in the process of deconverting. He loves the memes and I will make sure that he finds this group. Thank you for restoring our subreddit !!

1370533082.0,132,self.atheismrebooted,1fsnhh,Just sent this message to the mods of reddit.com,227,95,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1fsnhh/just_sent_this_message_to_the_mods_of_redditcom/,"Greetings.

I'm writing to the mods of reddit.com because the current mods of /r/atheism has started restricting the freedom of speech that has long been enjoyed by the subreddit. Specifically they have started banning macro images on the subreddit and only allow serious posts. They fail to realize that there already was a subreddit exclusively for serious discussion called /r/TrueAtheism.

/r/atheism used to be a place where atheists could vent the frustrations that build up from everyday encounters with religious people. Many atheists live in religion heavy communites and have no one else to talk to. /r/atheism was the perfect place for them to come and vent with like-minded people and have a few laughs together about the silliness of some of the religious people in our lives.

The mods think that ""karma whoring"" image macros aren't worthwhile to atheistic discussions, but they are wrong. Image macros and ""cheap laughs"" is how we reach out to new people. /r/atheism has helped many people who where in the process of losing their religion to overcome the depressing feelings that comes with that and helped them feel good about themselves again.

If the mods are allowed to continue their dictatorial control and censorship of /r/atheism then future redditors who are in the process of losing their religion will be met by a sterile subreddit that only contains boring discussions and articles. Not the welcoming and hearty community that I have personally come to know and love. It isn't like there's no place for serious discussion, because as I've already said we have /r/TrueAtheism for that.

Please! I -like many other atheist redditors- am pleading to the moderators of reddit.com to liberate /r/atheism from censorship and restore free speech and fun to our beloved subreddit.

With sincere and humble pleading,

1371032189.0,136,self.atheismrebooted,1g6rg3,The State of /u/jij's /r/atheism,268,132,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1g6rg3/the_state_of_ujijs_ratheism/,"/u/jij keeps trying to assure us all that everything will be handled maturely soon, but all I keep hearing is the tired repetition of ""Please hold, your concerns are very important to us and we will be with you shortly. Thank you."" His intentions are irrelevant; he's clearly done a poor job of moderating /r/atheism.

Content with inexcusably low vote ratings sits comfortably on the front page of /r/atheism because there is nothing left to drive competition with the content restrictions currently in place being enforced by the new, massive moderating team. There is seriously one on the front page at the moment with a vote aggregate of *0*. If /u/jij is genuinely trying to improve /r/atheism, then he has done a terrible job.  Under his watch, a relatively happy, uniform subreddit with over 2 million subscribers has seen schism the likes of which few could ever have predicted. It's not about images being good or bad anymore. It's about a sheer willingness to ignore the masses to enforce a vision, regardless of the results.

Quietly building up a mass of enforcers to address with force a swath of legitimate (if repetitious) complaints and questions is the act of a tyrant. Looking for popular support with a poll and then retreating behind rules identifying the moderators of a subreddit as its only policy-driving users is cowardice. Claiming he ""hasn't had time"" to address the discrepancies and enact changes to restore balance while rule changes are openly discussed a full week later is a lie. Dethroning the only person who would do anything about it is mutiny.

If /u/jij really cares at all about improving things at /r/atheism, he will put things back how they were, step down as a moderator, and make an open suggestion to the users and mods regarding his ideas for how to enact change. Perhaps he will even forgive the admittedly underhanded, desperate tactics of people whose shelter from a storm of hate is currently being ruled over by a tyrannical coward of a lying mutineer. His actions thusfar suggest to me that this is not the case, however. 

Though some signs would seem to suggest otherwise, /r/atheism is, shockingly, a dying subreddit. It now has *17* mods policing it for the very rules choking the content out of it. The sidebar rules now include:

""Images must be submitted in self-posts. Alternatively, keep in mind dedicated image subreddits (e.g. /r/AdviceAtheists).""

and

""No meta posts, please submit these in /r/AtheismPolicy [temporary rule].""

Which, given the mods' supporters' commentary, come across more like:

""Images must be submitted in self-posts. We know this means it will be virtually impossible for image content to reach any degree of visibility, but frankly that's exactly the point. Remember, any images should be submitted to the image subreddits (e.g. /r/AdviceAtheists) instead of here so we don't have to see it, karma whores.""

and

""No meta posts asking for a real discussion about the changes we're making; please submit these in /r/AtheismPolicy [temporary rule until this blows over and we can quietly make banning metaposts critical of the moderatorship a permanent rule].""

**Do not post to /r/AtheismPolicy looking for answers.** Your concerns will **not** be honestly addressed and there is no genuine discussion to be had there. A bit of searching over its current top page reveals essentially no effort to engage the concerned dissenters at all. It's a complaint black hole to keep /r/atheism tidy. The only replies from its *11* moderators are /u/jij running the weakest interference / spin campaign I've seen in a long time.

Some highlights of this campaign include:

**/u/jij admits he *still* hasn't done the final tally for the vote that went landslide against his policies because he was too busy recruiting mods to shut up the complaints against him:**

/u/Diran: ""Where are the results from the vote?""

/u/jij: ""Unfortunately I haven't had time to finish it yet... mostly due to the troubles that necessitated adding more moderators to help out. I will finish it, as I promised that.""

Source: http://www.reddit.com/r/AtheismPolicy/comments/1g4jlr/the_mods_have_no_intention_to_listening_to/

**/u/jij on /u/skeen and how things are going:**

/u/jij: ""Skeen and the others are welcome to their opinions, they'll do what they want and we'll do our best to improve and build.""

**/u/jij admits to only one ""overly negative"" comment and voices his opinion of what the moderatorship is currently like and will be like in the future**

/u/jij:
""I said one overly negative thing once, I'm human. I can't speak for the other [new moderators]' personal opinions, but tuber is keeping them in line and their experience with mod tools was highly needed currently. Long term I'd like to re-evaluate and add more knights of new and /r/atheism regulars.""

**/u/jij defuses things by being on both sides of the argument***

/u/jij:
""...I like memes, but I didn't like how they dominated the sub....""

Source: http://www.reddit.com/r/AtheismPolicy/comments/1g5mca/open_letter_to_the_new_mods_we_demand_answers/

**/u/jij on the mass bannings following the new moderators being added:**

/u/jij: ""mod-team got a little aggressive. I un-banned anyone I saw that they banned for hostile comments. However, calling for vote brigading will still get you banned as it breaks reddit's rules... that much has always been the case.""

Source: http://www.reddit.com/r/AtheismPolicy/comments/1g448e/new_atheism_policy_widespread_censorship/

To /u/jij: If you don't like all the negative press, then prove us wrong. Hit the reset button on the rules and moderators, step down without digging this hole any deeper, and collaborate with us instead of ruling over us. If you do not, you only show that your need to control /r/atheism outweighs your desire to make improvements to it in the wake of the massive damage your actions are directly responsible for already. You've had plenty of time for considerations and to make things right, but instead you spent that time defending your case and rallying allies to your cause.

You've dug in far enough. Prove yourself respectable and rational by recognizing your failures as a leader and acting accordingly or prove yourself an egomaniac and hit the self-destruct on /r/atheism by announcing the permanence of the changes, already. Either way, /r/atheismrebooted is waiting.",,False,self,t5_2xguz,False,,,True,t3_1g6rg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1g6rg3/the_state_of_ujijs_ratheism/,

1375712856.0,121,self.atheismrebooted,1jqor0,My christian mother dragged me to Church this past Sunday. I took notes.,154,33,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1jqor0/my_christian_mother_dragged_me_to_church_this/,"My mom is the only one in my family who regularly attends church and believes in Christianity. In the past few months she has become frustrated with her regular church's mannerisms (unprecedented acts like begging for money and shaming their members - what religious institution could do such a thing?). It was recently her birthday as well, and she asked that the family accompany her to a new Church. We couldn't refuse; she will not accept the idea that her sons are able to think for themselves.

Fortunately and unfortunately, we went on baptism day, where most of the service was composed of small testimonies from community members who would be baptized by the pastor in a small, above ground, inflatable pool in front of the stage. Here are the thoughts I collected and noted. Story in regular font, my own thoughts in italics:

• A frail woman struggled to walk across the stage. She was guided and helped along by two of her friends, and she still required a cane to walk upright. She explained that she was raped as a child, was diagnosed with brain cancer, and, as a pedestrian, was hit by a drunk driver - this resulted in her frail body and trouble walking. She explained that she believed in and prayed to God all of her life but now she feels as though she needed forgiveness. Her baptism was met with heavy applause. ---  *Why does a ""omnipotent"" and ""benevolent"" God continue to get the benefit of the doubt, even in an awful story like this?*

•The next person who walked across stage didn't have a terribly special story, but at the end of his testimony, he said ""I am in good hands because God cares for his children"" --- *[Well, uh, yeah.](http://i.imgur.com/NsK0zph.jpg)*

• Next a man walked across stage and in his testimony shared that he believed that his life was saved in a drunk driving accident simply because God had plans for him --- *Try telling that to the families of the 10,000 people killed in drunk driving accidents each year in the United States*

•When the next person walked across stage, she didn't have a very interesting story to tell. What shocked me was when she said she wanted to be baptized by this specific pastor because ""he speaks directly to God. I feel so much closer to the lord when I'm with Chris [the pastor]!"" --- *Oh, good. So if we assume she's correct, then we're saying that God loves some people more than others. Nice.*

• The next person to walk across the stage was a high-school age boy whose testimony explained a 6 day battle he had with the flu. He claimed that his medicine didn't work, but after 6 days, he was healed thanks to the grace of God. --- *Hey, flu patients of the world: I guess God plays favorites! Keep praying, though, God will heal you!*

What bothered me the most about all of this is that most of these people didn't ever question why they were put in such horrible positions in the first place. If I were a woman who had been raped, hit by a car, and diagnosed with cancer, I don't think I'd be the one doing the apologizing. It was literally painful listening to people imply that God never deserves to be questioned.

1372189965.0,106,self.atheismrebooted,1h249t,Advertising on r/a sub - my thoughts,176,70,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h249t/advertising_on_ra_sub_my_thoughts/,"I wanted to share my thoughts with the sub on the ad that I sponsored over on r/a sub and provide some more information on the process as well.  I also want to thank everyone for their support of the ad and I appreciate the messages of support.  I will not have time to reply to all of you individually, but please accept this as a blanket thanks.

1.  The intent of the ad was to provide a readily visible link to the members of r/a to find, view, sample, and if they want, subscribe to atheismrebooted.  I found my way over here from messaging in the r/a sub before the bots/mods starting removing all posts/comments with links to atheismrebooted.  I wanted to provide a link to the users in r/a that may have been absent or missed the links.  If those users come to this sub, like the content and moderation, then they may subscribe.  

2.  Why an ad?  When the bots/mods started removing content linking to this sub it was clear that they (1) Would suppress any/all dissent and discussion of how r/a should be moderated, regardless of tone, (2) The mods were not interested in even providing a way for those that didn't like the changes to find another home outside of the subs they already moderated, and (3) In order to provide a link to the users in r/a to this sub the only method that couldn't be suppress by the mods was an ad.

3.  Methodology.  Setting up an ad is surprisingly simple.  Click the link at the bottom of the page, create the ad (title and link) and submit.  Set a target sub as part of the submission, pick your dates and pay.  Ads are a lottery system on Reddit and the allocation to your ad is based on how many ads are targeted to the same spot and the amount of money spent by other advertisers.  For example, if 2 people target /r/a and each spend the same amount, the ads will each get 50% of the views.  If 3 people spend 100 for 3 days, and one person spends 300 for 3 days, then the more expensive ad will get 50% of the traffic, and the other ads will each get ~16% of the ads.

4. Going Forward.  These are my thoughts and opinions, and I'm nothing more than a fellow redditor in the sub.  I think the most effective use of ads will be positive messages about the value this new sub adds.  I also think that coordinating to some extent so that our ads aren't bidding against each other will allow us to stretch our volunteer ad dollars farther.  For example, if we setup ads so that we have one ad running each day for the next 3 weeks that would take 700 dollars.  If we start running multiple ads at the same time it will cost more, and based on the lottery system create diminishing returns on total amount of page views with our ads.  My guess is the attention this has gathered may attract other advertisers, which will make our ad dollars less effective.  I would nominate /u/NukeThePope to help lead this, I believe he was already looking at some coordination in this vein in another thread.

Cheers
