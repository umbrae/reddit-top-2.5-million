I suppose I'm just disappointed every time I click on to /r/music and see the same indie standards, classic rock and ""what's your favourite cover song"" posts. Spolier: It's Johnny Cash's version of 'Hurt'.
  
Reddit prides itself on being the 'front page of the internet'. /r/movies is, for the most part, about new movies. /r/soccer is about games of soccer that have recently happened. You could post your favourite scene from Fight Club. You could post your favourite goal from the 2002 World Cup. But the community has collectively decided that while those things are ok, the new stuff is the most important.  
  
This is where /r/music totally falls over. In the last week it has popped up on my front page with Bon Iver's 'Skinny Love' and The Postal Service's 'Such Great Heights', indie standards from 2008 and 2003 respectively.  
  
Meanwhile, on the internet:

And hey, posting music videos isn't actually a bad thing, but how about a little less 'First Day Of My Life' (and man, I love Bright Eyes) and a little more like Rick Alverson's [stunning video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=7iljkaDZvyw) for Night Bed's 'Even If We Try', or the Garth Jennings directing Guitar Wolf's [cover of 'Summertime Blues'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLTJAZu70zo&amp;feature=related) for Adam Buxton's Bug TV show.

I've posted a few things here before, and been redirected to the user who beat me by about 4 minutes (fair enough) only to watch their post of the new Spiritualized album or Thee Oh Sees album stream die with 3 upvotes, while the 55th repost of 'Maps' sits at the top again. It's frustrating. But hey, at least I can look forward to seeing them on the frontpage in 2016.

**Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?**

*by Marilyn Manson*

http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624

It is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books, movies, games or music to inspire cold-blooded murder. The day that Cain bashed his brother Abel's brains in, the only motivation he needed was his own human disposition to violence. Whether you interpret the Bible as literature or as the final word of whatever God may be, Christianity has given us an image of death and sexuality that we have based our culture around. A half-naked dead man hangs in most homes and around our necks, and we have just taken that for granted all our lives. Is it a symbol of hope or hopelessness? The world's most famous murder-suicide was also the birth of the death icon -- the blueprint for celebrity. Unfortunately, for all of their inspiring morality, nowhere in the Gospels is intelligence praised as a virtue.

A lot of people forget or never realize that I started my band as a criticism of these very issues of despair and hypocrisy. The name Marilyn Manson has never celebrated the sad fact that America puts killers on the cover of Time magazine, giving them as much notoriety as our favorite movie stars. From Jesse James to Charles Manson, the media, since their inception, have turned criminals into folk heroes. They just created two new ones when they plastered those dipshits Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris' pictures on the front of every newspaper. Don't be surprised if every kid who gets pushed around has two new idols.


We applaud the creation of a bomb whose sole purpose is to destroy all of mankind, and we grow up watching our president's brains splattered all over Texas. Times have not become more violent. They have just become more televised. Does anyone think the Civil War was the least bit civil? If television had existed, you could be sure they would have been there to cover it, or maybe even participate in it, like their violent car chase of Princess Di. Disgusting vultures looking for corpses, exploiting, fucking, filming and serving it up for our hungry appetites in a gluttonous display of endless human stupidity.


When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you'll hit someone who's guilty. We're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them. I think it's terrible when anyone dies, especially if it is someone you know and love. But what is more offensive is that when these tragedies happen, most people don't really care any more than they would about the season finale of Friends or The Real World. I was dumbfounded as I watched the media snake right in, not missing a teardrop, interviewing the parents of dead children, televising the funerals. Then came the witch hunt.


Man's greatest fear is chaos. It was unthinkable that these kids did not have a simple black-and-white reason for their actions. And so a scapegoat was needed. I remember hearing the initial reports from Littleton, that Harris and Klebold were wearing makeup and were dressed like Marilyn Manson, whom they obviously must worship, since they were dressed in black. Of course, speculation snowballed into making me the poster boy for everything that is bad in the world. These two idiots weren't wearing makeup, and they weren't dressed like me or like goths. Since Middle America has not heard of the music they did listen to (KMFDM and Rammstein, among others), the media picked something they thought was similar.


Responsible journalists have reported with less publicity that Harris and Klebold were not Marilyn Manson fans -- that they even disliked my music. Even if they were fans, that gives them no excuse, nor does it mean that music is to blame. Did we look for James Huberty's inspiration when he gunned down people at McDonald's? What did Timothy McVeigh like to watch? What about David Koresh, Jim Jones? Do you think entertainment inspired Kip Kinkel, or should we blame the fact that his father bought him the guns he used in the Springfield, Oregon, murders? What inspires Bill Clinton to blow people up in Kosovo? Was it something that Monica Lewinsky said to him? Isn't killing just killing, regardless if it's in Vietnam or Jonesboro, Arkansas? Why do we justify one, just because it seems to be for the right reasons? Should there ever be a right reason? If a kid is old enough to drive a car or buy a gun, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager, should someone else be blamed because he isn't as enlightened as an eighteen-year-old?


America loves to find an icon to hang its guilt on. But, admittedly, I have assumed the role of Antichrist; I am the Nineties voice of individuality, and people tend to associate anyone who looks and behaves differently with illegal or immoral activity. Deep down, most adults hate people who go against the grain. It's comical that people are naive enough to have forgotten Elvis, Jim Morrison and Ozzy so quickly. All of them were subjected to the same age-old arguments, scrutiny and prejudice. I wrote a song called ""Lunchbox,"" and some journalists have interpreted it as a song about guns. Ironically, the song is about being picked on and fighting back with my Kiss lunch box, which I used as a weapon on the playground. In 1979, metal lunch boxes were banned because they were considered dangerous weapons in the hands of delinquents. I also wrote a song called ""Get Your Gunn."" The title is spelled with two n's because the song was a reaction to the murder of Dr. David Gunn, who was killed in Florida by pro-life activists while I was living there. That was the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being ""pro-life.""


The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying. Right now, everyone is thinking of how they can prevent things like Littleton. How do you prevent AIDS, world war, depression, car crashes? We live in a free country, but with that freedom there is a burden of personal responsibility. Rather than teaching a child what is moral and immoral, right and wrong, we first and foremost can establish what the laws that govern us are. You can always escape hell by not believing in it, but you cannot escape death and you cannot escape prison.


It is no wonder that kids are growing up more cynical; they have a lot of information in front of them. They can see that they are living in a world that's made of bullshit. In the past, there was always the idea that you could turn and run and start something better. But now America has become one big mall, and because of the Internet and all of the technology we have, there's nowhere to run. People are the same everywhere. Sometimes music, movies and books are the only things that let us feel like someone else feels like we do. I've always tried to let people know it's OK, or better, if you don't fit into the program. Use your imagination -- if some geek from Ohio can become something, why can't anyone else with the willpower and creativity?


I chose not to jump into the media frenzy and defend myself, though I was begged to be on every single TV show in existence. I didn't want to contribute to these fame-seeking journalists and opportunists looking to fill their churches or to get elected because of their self-righteous finger-pointing. They want to blame entertainment? Isn't religion the first real entertainment? People dress up in costumes, sing songs and dedicate themselves in eternal fandom. Everyone will agree that nothing was more entertaining than Clinton shooting off his prick and then his bombs in true political form. And the news -- that's obvious. So is entertainment to blame? I'd like media commentators to ask themselves, because their coverage of the event was some of the most gruesome entertainment any of us have seen.


I think that the National Rifle Association is far too powerful to take on, so most people choose Doom, The Basketball Diaries or yours truly. This kind of controversy does not help me sell records or tickets, and I wouldn't want it to. I'm a controversial artist, one who dares to have an opinion and bothers to create music and videos that challenge people's ideas in a world that is watered-down and hollow. In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us. So don't expect the end of the world to come one day out of the blue -- it's been happening every day for a long time.

Words cannot describe the feeling going through me at that moment. When he showed me that Dave commented I literally ran into the corner of the room in the fetal position. I wish I was exaggerating. I called my brother Jake and we literally just yelled at each other in excitement for a good half hour.

Our total number of listens on Soundcloud went from being in the hundreds to the TENS OF THOUSANDS. We're currently sitting on 55,000 total listens.

A view you may have never seen.,6602,4408,1141,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1bb22w/a_guide_to_the_red_hot_chili_peppers_1983present/,"I feel like too many people these days only take RHCP for face value, only know their radio hits, and just haven't dug into this band nearly as much as I have, and with that amount of time that I have given this band, they are hands down my favorite musical act of all time. Sure, there are some other bands out there that will push the boundaries of what we want to hear a little further than RHCP will, and I appreciate them for that, but the Peppers have so consistently put out great music for decades, that it is a shame to only know them for ""Under the Bridge"" and ""Californication."" One problem with RHCP that I encounter a lot in public, is a general disliking of Anthony Kiedis. I agree with views that his lyrics can be dumb, his weird ""scatting"" and what not overlays what would otherwise be a fantastic instrumental, and his stage presence at times can be annoying (my favorite Youtube comment being ""Anthony Kiedis: fighting invisible ninjas onstage since 1983."") Through the years, the musicians behind him have time and time again proven to be as talented as elite musicians of the last few generations; Hillel Slovak, John Frusciante, Flea, Dave Navarro, Chad Smith, and each album shows they have created a very unique niche of pop-rock, funk-rock, soft-rock, hard-rock, you name it, and they have done it, musically. The thing that makes RHCP so accessible and popular is the sheer precision they put into every second of every song, at least since the early 90's. You can literally hear every guitar note and every bass note pop through the speakers like Flea and Frusciante and cast are just showing off.  It all needed to be perfect, and it is something that Pepper fans are in love with. I, myself, am more of a progressive/experimental rock fan compared to the kind of ""arena/pop"" rock that RHCP has been coming out with on their last few records, but the quality of the music on their records from Blood Sugar - Stadium Arcadium is just top notch and, a lot of fun, and quite emotional. Hopefully some examples below can paint that picture.



What I want to do here is just give a lesser known song or two from each album they have released, list the contributing members, and maybe sway your mind from dislike to at least appreciation for RHCP. I will also make a special note on one song or two from each album, a moment I find special, and then list my personal top 3 or so songs from the corresponding album, as well as what I believe to be the ""fan favorite"". I could type away all day about these guys (especially the great John Frusciante), and I hope you will remember great times you've had with this band's music, or prepare for some good times to come.



**1984: The Red Hot Chili Peppers**

**(Kiedis, Jack Sherman (Guitar), Cliff Martinez (drums), Flea)**

The band formed with original members kiedis, flea, hillel slovak, and jack irons (the first 3 named having met at Fairfax High School in California), but irons and slovak were in a band called What is This? at the time RHCP was ready to record their first album. Initially filled in to play at a bar for just 5 minutes, RHCP took to the stage, performing one song, ""Get up and jump."" Kiedis, was given the mic by his musical friends (with no intention of ever being involved with music), and they began. That song made their first album, a self titled one. Here it is.

*Kind of a grungy funk rock.*

Favorite Moments: The beautiful twangy intro of ""Mommy Where's Daddy."" The dirty guitar riffs or ""Buckle Down"" and ""Green Heaven,"" And the Pink Floyd-y sound of the instrumental ""Grand Pappy du Plenty.""

Fan Favorite: True Men Dont Kill Coyotes

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuKVvsY2yfA - Get Up and Jump



**1985: Freaky Styley**


 The band (now with Slovak in for Jack Sherman who got booted from the band to make room for the founding guitarist even when he didnt want to go) was seen as having some potential here. Their new management asked who they wanted to produce their next album. They came up with an idea of getting P-Funk legend George Clinton. And he agreed! A funky album ensued.

**(Kiedis, Flea, Cliff Martinez (drums), Hillel Slovak)**

*Purely a funk rock album.*

Top 3: If You Want Me to Stay, Yertle the Turtle, The Brothers Cup

Fan Favorite: Catholic School Girls Rule

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7pdKH2HvQo - The Brothers Cup


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZtnu9WqT8I - If You Want Me to Stay



**1987: Uplift Mofo Party Plan**

The band was rocking now. Not quite ""famous"" yet, but getting there. Doing some touring, shooting some music videos, but drugs were becoming a problem now too. They were JACKED on shit recording Freaky Styley, most notably cocaine, but Slovak was starting to lose himself to heroin. Still, this 3rd album was something rocking, and the RHCP sound that stayed around for the next 10 years or so was formed (ie Mothers Milk, Blood sugar sex magik). Martinez was let go (against his will) to bring in founding drummer Jack Irons.


*Becoming more of a rock oriented act, there is still some funk. But mostly just straight party rock anthems, group vocals, great stuff.*

My favorite moments: Group vocals on Backwoods, Anti Organic Beat Box Band, Skinny Sweaty Man, and Me and My Friends. The alternate title of ""Special Secret Song Inside"" is ""Party on Your P****.""

Top 3: Behind the Sun, Walkin on Down the Road, Backwoods

Fan Favorite: Me and My Friends

**(Kiedis, Flea, Slovak, Jack Irons. The original crew did this ONE album)**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyr6hWve0uI - Walkin' On Down the Road

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMWM8gY6EzU - Fight Like a Brave (music video)


**1988-1989**: the death of Hillel Slovak, the departure of Jack Irons, the introduction of John Frusciante and Chad Smith, and **Mother's Milk**.


Slovak overdosed on heroin in 1988. The band devastated, obviously. Jack Irons quit the group. RHCP was almost history. They needed 2 new members. There were rumors about this 18 year old boy (Kiedis and Flea were about 25) named John Frusciante who followed the band around, knew all their songs, and was a guitar phenom. He audtitioned for another band (Thelonious Monster - Bob Forrest gave him the job too) but Kiedis and Flea caught John after the audition and said ""you MUST come to the peppers."" John said that would be a no brainer if they were serious. They were. The band auditioned 30 drummers after that and hired the last guy to show up, Chad Smith, a heavy metal looking guy, one they thought just from outward appearance would be worth nothing to them, but he blew their faces off within minutes. They put out Mother's Milk within the next year, 1989. 

**(Kiedis, Flea, Frusciante, Smith)**

Favorite moments: A bass solo followed by a guitar solo all banged out over the audio of a woman uncontrollably moaning in the background. Nobody Weird Like Me's outro. Sexy Mexican Maid has no chorus, just instrumental breaks.

Top 3: Good Time Boys, Subway to Venus, Pretty Little Ditty.

Fan Favorite: Higher Ground

*Now more alt-rock than ever, but even punky, some metal. Gotta love songs like Good Time Boys, Sexy Mexican Maid, Punk Rock Classic. A great, fun, flawless record.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snnft07A3aQ - Nobody Weird Like Me


**1991**: Then they put out **Blood Sugar Sex Magik**. I assume that every person on r/music has heard this album front to back, but that is where I may be mistaken, and which is why I make this post. By now, the band was huge. So huge that Frusciante left the band while touring and descended into a 6 year heroin/coke/crack binge.

**Watch the documentary ""Funky Monks"" for a behind the scenes look at the recording of this record at ""The Mansion"" in the Hollywood Hills.**


(Kiedis, Flea, Frusciante, Smith)


*Gonna call this funk rock all day. Naked in the Rain. I could've Lied...*

Favorite Moments: The whole album front to back is nasty. Every song a Flea, Frusciante, Smith concoction of musical beauty, ferocity, and originality.

Top 3: If You Have to Ask, Apache Rose Peacock, Sir Psycho Sexy

Fan Favorites: Under the Bridge, Suck My Kiss


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTrD9HSqxV4 - My Lovely Man (A tribute to Slovak)


**1995: One Hot Minute**

With John gone, and a couple replacement guitarists not working out, The Peppers brought in Jane's Addiction's Dave Navarro (and Frusciante almost went to Jane's Addiction, but was MUCH too sick). They made ""One Hot Minute."" It was commercially not close to being as successful as BSSM, but it brought out some great tunes, though the band was in a dark state. Drugs were still very present. Navarro was fired after touring, though with strong intentions of them all still carrying on as RHCP, due to cocaine problems and lack of chemistry.

**(Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Dave Navarro)**

Favorite moments: The second half of the song ""Coffee Shop"" has an insane instrumental break in the middle, followed by a HUGE Flea bass solo and a raucous ending. Flea sings the ending of ""Deep Kick"" as the band makes crazy music behind him.

Top 3: Warped, My Friends, Transcending

Fan Favorite: Aeroplane 


*Navarro brought a metal-y grunge to the peppers. Clearly heard in songs like Warped, Coffee Shop, Falling into Grace. Chad and Flea rhythmically dominated the album, but Dave was great.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1MwPDtPjbs - Walkabout 


**1999: CALIFORNICATION**


Frusciante had gone to rehab to save his life in 1997. His arms were scarred up and down from incorrect needle usage. All of his teeth were gone and he got new implants put in because the original ones just rotted away. There are famous videos on Youtube of him just beyond plastered on many chemicals. It was a miracle he made it through. Flea went to John's house one day and asked if he wanted to come back.


By now, they had been world famous for a decade. All eyes were on them as they had to follow up One Hot Minute somehow, some seeing it as their last chance at redemption. The band was on fire. Slowing down from the off-the-wall party rock that their roots took form in, but coming more into what they will become and starting to really hit on what I mentioned earlier, instrumental precision and flawless works of art.


**(Kiedis, Frusciante, Flea, Smith)** by now, the *CLASSIC* lineup

Favorite Moments: The monstrous outros of Parallel Universe, Easily, and Purple Stain. The dualing vocals of John and Anthony on Road Trippin'.

Top 3: Around the World, Parallel Universe, Savior.

Fan Favorite: Scar Tissue

*Now purely an alternative rock sound, but staying in their own divine RHCP brand. The singles are some of their most popular works. Around the world, other side, etc.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiqSl0bfWro - This Velvet Glove


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3sNSWbeTCU - Savior (live) solo around 4 minutes



**2002 - 2008**


RHCP is now huge. Regarded as one of the biggest rock bands of the last 20 years, undoubtedly. They recorded and released **By The Way** by 2002 and put out some amazing music in it. A lot of melody driven masterpieces with divine guitar work and merely no ""rapping"" from Kiedis anymore. The band was unstoppable with music videos for Can't Stop and By the Way propelling this record's popularity through the roof.


*By the Way saw the band take a different turn. One that fans adore. John wrote a ton of the album himself and by now he is basically a full time singer beside Kiedis. He wanted to make a punk record but Rick Rubin said no. John went with his second yearning and went more ""brit-pop""-y. Songs like The Zephyr Song, Warm Tape. Good shit.*

Favorite Moments: John and Anthony alternating chorus vocals on ""Dosed."" The bassline and guitar effects on ""Throw Away Your Television.""

Top 3: By the Way, Cabron, This is the Place

Fan Favorite: Can't Stop


**Stadium Arcadium**. Released in **2006**. John's sendoff. An epic 28 song double album. Full of sort of sing songy tunes with hard bass lines and epic guitar solos on just about every jam like Warlocks, Strip my Mind, Torture Me. Still all in their alt rock, semi funk sound.*

Favorite Moments: Snow guitar riff. Stadium Arcadium guitar solo. Hump de Bump's mindblowing percussion breakdown, Torture Me has one of Frusciante's greatest solos in his RHCP tenure, Wet Sand's finale, Readymade's guitar solo, and the choir of noise behind the band in the experimental ""We Believe.""

Top 6: Cmon Girl, Especially in Michigan, 21st Century, Slow Cheetah, She's Only 18, Hard to Concentrate

Fan Favorite: Tell Me Baby


**(Kiedis, Flea, Frusciante, Smith)**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDLSODB5dIE - Venice Queen (By the Way) *Live at Slane Castle*

**2009 - present**


John Frusciante quit the band during their 2 year hiatus after SA. They brought in longtime friend **Josh Klinghoffer** and put out **Im With You** in 2011. It had its moments, but Frusciante was dearly missed. He left to work on his solo career, a career where he has almost a dozen albums out and they are ridiculously good (at least the post-2000 records) like; ""The Empyrean,"" ""The Will to Death,"" and ""To Record Only Water for Ten Days."" Anyway, I'm With You is just another piece in RHCP's journey, a new beginning with yet another guitarist. 


**(Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer)**


*A lot of pop on here. Still good stuff though. Josh does extremely well. ""Monarchy of Roses"" kicks of the album in promising fashion and there are some fun African influences that can be seen at points, put into the mix after Flea and Klinghoffer traveled to Ethiopia during pre-album downtime. I sure hope the next album they do together tops this one though. Should be doable.*

Favorite moments: Klinghoffer's backing vocals on ""Annie Wants a Baby,"" and disco-y outro to ""The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie.""

Top 3: Police Station, Goodbye Hooray, Look Around

Fan Favorite: Ethiopia

We all miss you. Led Zeppelin never continued making insanely stoney, virtuoso, mind boggling sonic masterwork albums after you went to drummer heaven. They didn't tour either - as they knew they could never really create that LZ sound without you. There were scattered re-unions - but always pointed out without you it can't be Led Zep. 

Your drumming was probably the funkiest hard rock drumming ever ! There are lots of fab rock drummers - but NONE could funk and groove like you do ! The Wanton Song, Out On The Tiles, The fast part of Dazed and Confused, Houses Of The Holy ( the song ), .... Bring it On Home ... were all intense ( just to scratch the surface ) ! And when you would throw away the sticks and destroy that drum set with your hands it was pure nirvana to listen !You were a consummate professional. Never took yourself too seriously and always humble when the lads poked fun at you on stage. 

You inspired a whole generation of kids to want to slap the skins in the 70's and you still rule to this very day. Never has a drummer played on such choice tracks of an entire discography dense with works of timeless classic genius work.

Anyway - you love to party and I raise my glass with you today. Three cheers for Bonzo - the monster drummer who put four sticks in his hand - or no sticks in his hands ! Hip Hip - - Hip Hip -- Hip Hip --

Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand.
All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things.
For example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins., it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do,God, believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child.
On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know!
I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what i used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become.
I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess.
Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away.
Peace, love, empathy.
Kurt Cobain
Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your alter.
Please keep going Courtney, for Frances.
For her life, which will be so much happier without me.
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!

http://www.ottawasun.com/2012/07/03/why-does-everyone-hate-nickelback

People have argued that it's because their lyrics are derivative, or their music is all the same or some more sophisticated argument about popular perception of their music [see the cracked article](http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-celebrities-who-get-more-hate-than-they-deserve-part-3/) and (The Village Voice)[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/11/nickelback_detroit_lions_halftime_show_petition.php]. I submit that hating Nickelback, however, has a much more prosaic origin. An overplayed Comedy Central promo.  


Comedy Central advertised the hell out of *[Tough Crowd With Colin Quinn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tough_Crowd_with_Colin_Quinn)* which aired from 2002-2004.  It was a panel comedy show featuring 4 comedians (and Colin Quinn as host) discussing topical news stories.  One of their promos (I cannot find a video of the promo, unfortunately) that they played a lot (which I swear played for almost 6 months straight in every commercial break) was [a clip of comedian Brian Posehn](http://youtu.be/iW94t6YzG1M?t=2m47s) responding to a prompt about a [study](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030505084039.htm) published on May 5, 2003 tying violent lyrics to violent behavior.  

&gt;&gt;""No one talks about the studies that show that bad music makes people violent, but listening to Nickelback makes me want to kill Nickelback""

This joke was on every Tough Crowd promo and nearly all the time.  After hearing this joke during every promo for a couple of weeks I began to hear everyone at my middle school begin to mock Nickelback mercilessly.  Interestingly, any jokes about Creed and Hoobastank somehow seemed to have [less staying power](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=nickelback%20sucks,%20creed%20sucks,%20hoobastank%20sucks) at the time.   But individual jokes about Creed and Hoobastank weren't advertised as much this one for Nickelback.

The worthwhile part of that repetitive commercial was of course the punchline ""listening to Nickelback makes me want to kill Nickelback.""  The whisper-down-the-lane aspect of the joke telling, allowed the origin to slowly disappear until even people unfamiliar with modern music knew there was something detestable about Nickelback.

The proliferation of this joke through Comedy Central's ad machine followed by people slowly forgetting the origin of it (made easier by there not yet being YouTube in May 2003) is what made the ""Hate Nickelback"" meme prevalent.

When I look up that quote from the show verbatim [on Google](http://bit.ly/Y8i4Df), absolutely no one seems to get the quote exactly right.  And some of these people even quote him Brian Posehn explicitly and still get the quote wrong.

Via [comments section on AVClub](http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-hits-keep-coming-30-songs-inspired-by-domestic,57741/):

&gt;&gt;""I do think certain kinds of music can make you violent. Like, when I listen to Nickelback, it makes me want to kill Nickelback."" - Brian Posehn

Even Dustin Dye's [blogpost defending Nickelback](http://dustindye.hubpages.com/hub/Blog-Why-the-hate-A-qualified-defense-of-Nickelback) which briefly mentions that he thinks Brian Posehn was the origin doesn't get the quote quite right.
&gt;&gt;   ...Brian Posehn's joke: ""Listening to Nickelback doesn't make me want to kill myself. Listening to Nickelback makes me want to kill Nickelback,""

I think that since Since Colin Quinn's Tough Crowd aired in the internet dark ages (B.Y. before YouTube, in the era of EBaum), the exact source of the original Nickelback joke was slowly forgotten, but everyone remembers some modification of the joke or idea.

As an example, [this guy](http://www.peerreviewedbymyneurons.com/2012/09/23/music-can-alter-moral-judgments/) references a study of music influencing morality and then remarks

&gt;&gt;""the study finally provides proof that listening to Nickelback can make you a bad person.""

**TL;DR**

1.) Poor human source memory has left hundreds of people without a direct memory of a Nickelback joke played on loop on Comedy Central for months in 2003.

2.) Since Colin Quinn's Tough Crowd has never officially been released, there has been little to remind us after the 2003 Comedy Central ad campaign ended.

3.) The Comedy Central audience are exactly young and male enough to disseminate uncredited jokes in great proportions.  (I kid, I kid!)

4.) Nickelback continues to tour and earn money, so Nickelback hate/jokes are still relevant.

5.) In light of all of this, Nickelback still sucks.  But I thought y'all would like some background.",,False,,t5_2qh1u,False,,,True,t3_18kyy4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/18kyy4/who_knows_what_popularized_hating_nickelback_i/,

Chris Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=lV6W6_PUj0E) has its main melody taken straight from [Arty and Mat Zo's track Rebound](http://youtu.be/DXQhVmnNmxk?t=1m).

According to [Arty's tweets](https://twitter.com/arty_music/status/324181058906107906), no permission was ever asked for the rights to his song from his label.

It's not like Arty and Mat Zo are small time no-name producers (ranked #28 and #72 on the DJ Top 100 in 2012), and their label Anjuna is pretty well known and respected in the EDM scene. To rip them off in this day and age is either pretty bold or pretty braindead (not to mention the fact that will.i.am made a complete waste of the melody).

How do will.i.am and his people expect to get away with this level of tomfoolery? More as the story develops.

**Edit:** 

Arty &amp; Mat Zo's label Anjunabeats is [aware of the situation](https://twitter.com/anjunabeats/status/324212508699271169).

by Marilyn Manson
http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624

It is sad to think that the first few people on earth needed no books, movies, games or music to inspire cold-blooded murder. The day that Cain bashed his brother Abel's brains in, the only motivation he needed was his own human disposition to violence. Whether you interpret the Bible as literature or as the final word of whatever God may be, Christianity has given us an image of death and sexuality that we have based our culture around. A half-naked dead man hangs in most homes and around our necks, and we have just taken that for granted all our lives. Is it a symbol of hope or hopelessness? The world's most famous murder-suicide was also the birth of the death icon -- the blueprint for celebrity. Unfortunately, for all of their inspiring morality, nowhere in the Gospels is intelligence praised as a virtue.

A lot of people forget or never realize that I started my band as a criticism of these very issues of despair and hypocrisy. The name Marilyn Manson has never celebrated the sad fact that America puts killers on the cover of Time magazine, giving them as much notoriety as our favorite movie stars. From Jesse James to Charles Manson, the media, since their inception, have turned criminals into folk heroes. They just created two new ones when they plastered those dipshits Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris' pictures on the front of every newspaper. Don't be surprised if every kid who gets pushed around has two new idols.

We applaud the creation of a bomb whose sole purpose is to destroy all of mankind, and we grow up watching our president's brains splattered all over Texas. Times have not become more violent. They have just become more televised. Does anyone think the Civil War was the least bit civil? If television had existed, you could be sure they would have been there to cover it, or maybe even participate in it, like their violent car chase of Princess Di. Disgusting vultures looking for corpses, exploiting, fucking, filming and serving it up for our hungry appetites in a gluttonous display of endless human stupidity.

When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you'll hit someone who's guilty. We're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them. I think it's terrible when anyone dies, especially if it is someone you know and love. But what is more offensive is that when these tragedies happen, most people don't really care any more than they would about the season finale of Friends or The Real World. I was dumbfounded as I watched the media snake right in, not missing a teardrop, interviewing the parents of dead children, televising the funerals. Then came the witch hunt.

Man's greatest fear is chaos. It was unthinkable that these kids did not have a simple black-and-white reason for their actions. And so a scapegoat was needed. I remember hearing the initial reports from Littleton, that Harris and Klebold were wearing makeup and were dressed like Marilyn Manson, whom they obviously must worship, since they were dressed in black. Of course, speculation snowballed into making me the poster boy for everything that is bad in the world. These two idiots weren't wearing makeup, and they weren't dressed like me or like goths. Since Middle America has not heard of the music they did listen to (KMFDM and Rammstein, among others), the media picked something they thought was similar.

Responsible journalists have reported with less publicity that Harris and Klebold were not Marilyn Manson fans -- that they even disliked my music. Even if they were fans, that gives them no excuse, nor does it mean that music is to blame. Did we look for James Huberty's inspiration when he gunned down people at McDonald's? What did Timothy McVeigh like to watch? What about David Koresh, Jim Jones? Do you think entertainment inspired Kip Kinkel, or should we blame the fact that his father bought him the guns he used in the Springfield, Oregon, murders? What inspires Bill Clinton to blow people up in Kosovo? Was it something that Monica Lewinsky said to him? Isn't killing just killing, regardless if it's in Vietnam or Jonesboro, Arkansas? Why do we justify one, just because it seems to be for the right reasons? Should there ever be a right reason? If a kid is old enough to drive a car or buy a gun, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager, should someone else be blamed because he isn't as enlightened as an eighteen-year-old?

America loves to find an icon to hang its guilt on. But, admittedly, I have assumed the role of Antichrist; I am the Nineties voice of individuality, and people tend to associate anyone who looks and behaves differently with illegal or immoral activity. Deep down, most adults hate people who go against the grain. It's comical that people are naive enough to have forgotten Elvis, Jim Morrison and Ozzy so quickly. All of them were subjected to the same age-old arguments, scrutiny and prejudice. I wrote a song called ""Lunchbox,"" and some journalists have interpreted it as a song about guns. Ironically, the song is about being picked on and fighting back with my Kiss lunch box, which I used as a weapon on the playground. In 1979, metal lunch boxes were banned because they were considered dangerous weapons in the hands of delinquents. I also wrote a song called ""Get Your Gunn."" The title is spelled with two n's because the song was a reaction to the murder of Dr. David Gunn, who was killed in Florida by pro-life activists while I was living there. That was the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being ""pro-life.""

The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying. Right now, everyone is thinking of how they can prevent things like Littleton. How do you prevent AIDS, world war, depression, car crashes? We live in a free country, but with that freedom there is a burden of personal responsibility. Rather than teaching a child what is moral and immoral, right and wrong, we first and foremost can establish what the laws that govern us are. You can always escape hell by not believing in it, but you cannot escape death and you cannot escape prison.

It is no wonder that kids are growing up more cynical; they have a lot of information in front of them. They can see that they are living in a world that's made of bullshit. In the past, there was always the idea that you could turn and run and start something better. But now America has become one big mall, and because of the Internet and all of the technology we have, there's nowhere to run. People are the same everywhere. Sometimes music, movies and books are the only things that let us feel like someone else feels like we do. I've always tried to let people know it's OK, or better, if you don't fit into the program. Use your imagination -- if some geek from Ohio can become something, why can't anyone else with the willpower and creativity?
I chose not to jump into the media frenzy and defend myself, though I was begged to be on every single TV show in existence. I didn't want to contribute to these fame-seeking journalists and opportunists looking to fill their churches or to get elected because of their self-righteous finger-pointing. They want to blame entertainment? Isn't religion the first real entertainment? People dress up in costumes, sing songs and dedicate themselves in eternal fandom. Everyone will agree that nothing was more entertaining than Clinton shooting off his prick and then his bombs in true political form. And the news -- that's obvious. So is entertainment to blame? I'd like media commentators to ask themselves, because their coverage of the event was some of the most gruesome entertainment any of us have seen.

I think that the National Rifle Association is far too powerful to take on, so most people choose Doom, The Basketball Diaries or yours truly. This kind of controversy does not help me sell records or tickets, and I wouldn't want it to. I'm a controversial artist, one who dares to have an opinion and bothers to create music and videos that challenge people's ideas in a world that is watered-down and hollow. In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us. So don't expect the end of the world to come one day out of the blue -- it's been happening every day for a long time.

1372899605.0,1855,self.Music,1hlsgc,Guide to Modest Mouse,5124,3269,653,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hlsgc/guide_to_modest_mouse/,"Tapping into he genius of /u/JimmehFTW's comprehensive ""Guide to Lil Wayne,"" it seems that these ""guide"" posts can help casual listeners more easily digest the menacing discographies of artists like Weezy. So, in return for Jimmeh's kind gesture, I decided to do the same thing for one of my all-time favorite bands, a bunch of northwest punks that called themselves Modest Mouse. Founded by frontman and songwriter Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green, and bassist Eric Judy, Modest Mouse has seen several musicians come and go as members (including names like Johnny Marr and Jim Fairchild) but Brock and Green have stuck it out. 

Their discography *is* quite large and can be intimidating, soI hope this helps sift through it. 


**Sad Sappy Sucker** (2001)

NOTICE: This is *NOT* the first album that Modest Mouse released. I include it here, however, because it is the album most emblematic of MM's early days. *SSS* was meant to be MM's debut album--recorded in the early-mid '90s-- but was shelved for years because the studios didn't think that it would sell. 

This is Modest Mouse at its crudest, its rawest, its most elementary. This is the west-coast garage band that Modest Mouse started as.  Most is very lo-fi: simple guitar riffs, music emphasizing Brock's ever-angsty voice. Has some flashes of Phil Elvrum.

Solid album, but it won't get you hooked. Let's try some others first. 


**This is a Long Drive For Someone With Nothing to Think About** (1996)

This is where it starts to pick up. *TIALD...* begins to build the band's signature guitarwork and musical duality. Modest Mouse's intriguing balance between screamo-angst and melodious-pensive-lo fi music starts here. This balance really defines their entire career, musically. 

* [Dramamine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK1bi4emEkk), the first track, hits the guitar sound that runs in MM's DNA.

* Also check out [Custom Concern](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQC4XbYvHUo) and one of my personal favorites [Talking Shit about a Pretty Sunset](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CH1Tu9-oSU). 


**Interstate 8** (1996)

An EP that was released on the heels of *TIALD...*, *Interstate 8* has got some great tracks, but the best ones are included on the compilation album *Building Nothing out of Something.*


**The Lonesome Crowded West** (1997)

Here it is, folks. This album is vintage MM from start to finish, both lyrically and musically. The album centers around the singular feeling of isolation that is borne of the American suburbanization. Songs like [Doin' the Cockroach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OGEiOgv86U) and Shit Luck see that frustration build up and boil over into cacophony. Others, like [Trailer Trash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjecIllOEio), are written with an authentic vulnerability that brings you into this feeling of alienation and loneliness. The duality is strong here, often bubbling up within the same song, as in Cowboy Dan and [Styrofoam Boots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li30NxCsJ7w). Still other songs (i.e. Trucker's Atlas) are just as sprawling and monotonous as the open road.

This album is incredibly diverse, yet seems amazingly cohesive when listened through. Though, you may have to embrace their polarized take on life--the duality that I keep harping on about--to appreciate this cohesion. 

* Seriously, listen to [Styrofoam Boots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li30NxCsJ7w) and [Trailer Trash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjecIllOEio).

* [Heart Cooks Brain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2qgEl4KWB4) was the ""single.""

* [Cowboy Dan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBjiYZiv5RE) is always my favorite to see them perform live. 


**Building Nothing Out of Something** (2000)

A compilation album that throws together some songs from throughout their career. It's a hodge-podge, but here are some good ones. As Robert Christgau says, ""dissonant, vulnerable, geeky, and, crucially, sweet.""

* [Broke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlqgijgd3d0) and [Interstate 8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ze3rjQ7jG0). 


**The Moon &amp; Antarctica** (2000)

The breakthrough album. *TM&amp;A* was what truly thrust MM into the limelight, and rightfully so. It was their first album under a major record label (Epic). Under the production of Brian Deck, MM was able to tone down their edgier, more angsty side and still reach the level of lyric depth that appeared in *The Lonesome, Crowded West*. The result was a more polished, emotional, vulnerable, thought-provoking album. 

Lyrically, *TM&amp;A* focused on life and the afterlife, on where the fuck this world will spit us out when its done chewin' us up. But musically, this album takes us for a ride, fluxing from the neat guitarwork and vintage MM sound of the first two tracks into the dreamy, otherworldly passage that comes in the middle, launching you into the stars for songs like The Cold Part and Alone Down There.

Many say that *The Moon &amp; Antarctica* is not only MM's best album, but also one of the best indie/alt albums of the 2000s. Incredible instrumentation, an album that really takes you on an intergalactic journey.  

This is an album that you simply have to listen to in its entirety. I would not be doing you or MM justice if I told you otherwise. That said, if you must pick and choose...

* [Third Planet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsnELWjsCsA)

* [Gravity Rides Everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6XhVj5GF0I)

* [Tiny Cities Made of Ashes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EA5b3FNI4w)--kickass song

* [...but LISTEN TO THE WHOLE ALBUM!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQSVqCTfFtk)


**Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks** (2001)

A nice, less polished set of MM songs. Again, not about to win any converts, but if you're into Modest Mouse's sound this is the still-fresh Brock with some muddled musings. 

* I especially dig the sweet lyrics on [You're the Good Things](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-e18snsF3U) and the down-home folk sound of [3 Inch Horses, Two-Faced Monsters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbIZlmsBxmA)--something you don't hear outta MM that much. 

**Good News For People Who Love Bad News** (2004)

This is a big one. Four years after the release of *TM&amp;A*, MM puts out an album that largely abandons the polished cohesion of its predecessor. Chock full of poppy, radio-ready hits, *Good News* was MM's first (and only) album to go platinum in the United States. It features the band's most recognizable song, Float On. Many of these songs are excellent, and explode into unforgettable riffs of raw, MM brilliance (see Black Cadillacs and Bukowski).  The album makes a marked turn towards the away from the ether and towards the terrestrial sphere, about the pragmatic aspects of life and our mentalities towards it. ""If life's not beautiful without the pain,"" Brock croons in The View, ""well then I'd rather never even see beauty again."" 

There is certain beauty to this album. It is the most accessible of MM's work, I believe, and there are some amazing songs. However, it lacks the fluency of its two LP predecessors. The songs on *Good News* seem like contained units. This album is not quite able to cohere in the dualism of *TLCW* or in the ethereal exploration of *TM&amp;A*.

The hits:

* [Float On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAud5O7Qqk)

* [The World At Large](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNxa9pFwimk)

* [Ocean Breathes Salty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPhnOKmhbBw)

Other good ones:

* [The View](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPofScjGh7g)

* [The Good Times are Killing Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL1cRSRUUZQ)--accessible, fun... just a great song

**We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank** (2007)

The tides continue to change for MM. With the free-agency pickups of Johnny Marr (former Smiths guitarist), percussionist Joe Plummer, and utility man Tom Peloso, MM retooled and came up with another album brimming with several songs worthy of the top of the charts. Throughout, though, Brock maintained his true influence and his helming of the band. His high-angst yells still make it through in songs like Education and We've Got Everything, though they sound a bit more forced than in his teenage harangues a decade before. The real beauty of this album comes in the hits themselves, like Fire it Up and Missed the Boat, where simplicity and outlook are everything. And as Brock ages, we may see this being the focal point of his music. (But as a seasoned fan, I'll say that his anger, his angst, and his energy are still live and well).

The hits:

* [Dashboard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=penvn9VL32Y)

* [Missed the Boat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSfTdzoO4ic)

* [Fire it Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLfFBj1Vk4U)

Others:

* [Little Motel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqQTODR3kR8)


**No One's First and You're Next** (2009)

Modest Mouse's latest release, *NOF&amp;YN* is a compilation of ""outtakes"" from the previous two albums. Listening to the EP, you see many similarities to both *Good News* and *We Were Dead*, including Brock's now-signature course yells. Still, there is some branching out. In [Satellite Skin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am8pPOFJi9g), you get a sound that picks up on more contemporary alt music than MM's earlier repertoire. 

* [King Rat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi7KDOAj4Xo)-- a rollicking, 5+ minute extravaganza of strings, horns, banjo and Brock's throaty musings.

* [The Whale Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_pnlYYHO1g)--makes me feel a bit psychotic in the good way

I've been given total freedom as it comes to what I put on the air (within FCC guidelines, of course) and I'd love to feature artists who are only just beginning their careers, or who haven't had a chance in the spotlight yet. If you're from Michigan - we're based in the Eastern U.P. - it'd be even better; local artists rock.

If you're signed to a label, we have people who handle royalties and such; not my department. If you have questions in that regard, feel free to send them my way; I can run 'em up the chain and tell you what the muckety-mucks say.

How 'bout it, then?

EDIT: By the Bard, I never expected so many responses! I'll be going through the links as fast as possible and will respond as I am able. Keep it coming, guys; this stuff is awesome.

EDIT 2: Wow. Talk about music; there's enough here to last years! I'm going through this as quickly as I can, but there are *loads* of artists here. If I comment on your post, it means I've listened to you, and you've been sorted into a box. Once I've gone through enough of you, I'll go back through my aforementioned metaphorical boxes, *and I will contact you through whatever website or service you contacted me through.* There's no way I'll be able to keep straight what bands are connected to what accounts, so keep an eye on your inboxes, **and make sure you have contact information on your website.**

EDIT 3: There have to be other small-time radio station DJ's here, right? Other DJ's, join in! If you hear someone you like, contact them; get the ball rolling, guys.

EDIT 4: Brain... Is... Pudding... This had been one of the most intense music-listening sessions I've had in ages; props! There's an amazing amount of talent gathered here, and I'm working as hard as I can to get everything sorted. I won't be able to play everyone - I don't think they're going to give me enough air time this year to manage that - but the best sounds are sure to be featured. Now, what would we say to a subreddit where the top-voted artist each week gets a radio feature?

Just an update from the mods on new rules, old rules, and asking for your opinions on both!

#New Rules

&gt;**/r/Music is not American Idol**

&gt;&gt;From now on, any posts which give a sob story and a plea to listen to your music will be subject to deletion. If you're a musician and want to promote your tracks, please let the music stand on its own. 

&gt;&gt;This is the result of [this post complaining about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/104i5a/psa_please_stop_posting_about_how_your_life_sucks/)

&gt;&gt;If you're a musician and want to promote your music here, please follow the guidelines at the end of this post!

#Old Rules

&gt;**No Images**

&gt;&gt;Two months since we banned all images from being posted in this subreddit, and instead redirected submitters to [one of these subreddits](/r/musicpics+albumartporn+instrumentporn+bandporn+metalmemes+lookwhoimet).

&gt;&gt;Do you feel this has been successful?

&gt;**Self-Post Friday**

&gt;&gt;This is also two months old. Has it made any difference? Do you think it should be kept or removed?

#Upcoming News

&gt;**Music AMA's**

&gt;&gt;The mods are arranging some AMA's with bands, artists and people who work in the Music industry. These will take place either here or in a genre subreddit, but will be advertised in the sidebar.

&gt;&gt;If you know anyone who is notable in the Music industry who would be interested in taking part, please [message the mods.](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic)

&gt;**""This Week in Reddit Music""**

&gt;&gt;Some of you may have noticed the [weekly music roundup posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/108uk5/this_week_in_reddit_music_week_2/). If you know a music subreddit that wants to take part, please [message Raerth](/message/compose?to=Raerth).

#Musicians: How to advertise your music on reddit the right way!

&gt;**Do Not**:

&gt;&gt;* Do not beg for upvotes.
* Do not give a sad story to attract attention
* Do not spam your tracks repeatedly.

&gt;**Do**:

&gt;&gt;* Upload your music to [Radio Reddit](http://radioreddit.com)
* Post your music to /r/ThisIsOurMusic
* Post your music to /r/ListenToThis
* Participate in [musician-focused subreddits](/r/bandmembers+redditoriginals+radioreddit+Musicians+musiccritics+300songs+acousticoriginals+icoveredasong+mymusic+ratemyband+touringmusicians+ukmusos+metalmusicians+wearethemusicmakers+songwriters+guitar+bass+drummers+musicinthemaking+Percussionists+NewGearDay+singing+EDMproduction+AudioEngineering+livesound+audiopost)
* Consider buying sponsored links. [They are cheaper than you think](/ad_inq), you're guaranteed to have the top link, and it helps reddit pay the bills.
* Look out for /r/Music's monthly feedback threads, which will be an official place for people to plug their stuff.

They were robbed of thousands of dollars worth of music gear and personal items. 

The following quote is from a facebook message about the robbery: ""The thieves were able to get away with Javier's Chevy Blazer and all of the equipment we didn't have on tour with us. 10 guitars in total. This includes many of our one of a kind custom instruments (Stranberg,Rick Toone ) as well as amplifiers, PA equipment and personal items.""

They have asked their fans to keep a lookout for the stolen guitars, and are posting pictures of them (obviously before the robbery). You can see them at [this link](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151024982956639.481444.103314901638&amp;type=3)

I hope the reddit community will keep this in mind and maybe lend a hand in this search. This band is extremely talented and not as well off as most musicians. If you are interested in any of their music, here are some links.

I thought it was a very interesting read. I missed a lot of the subtext myself. 

[EDIT] Whee! Front page of r/music! Thanks for the comments, I love reading through them. 

My dad teaches at Korea University in Seoul every summer for their international summer campus. While he was over there Gangnam Style went viral and I asked him if it was as big in Korea as it was over here. He said that he's heard it on the radio and seen the video on TVs and such. He also mentioned that the students at the university mostly just laughed it off and thought of it as a fun song. My mom, who is Korean, has told me about the Doenjangnyeo mentality. Growing up in the aftermath of the Korean war, she really doesn't understand how wasteful the youth can be in the sake of appearances.

Im going to begin commenting some albums from this year in no specific order or bias, just based on what ive been seeing on the others lists. 

vote up for what you think deserves it, and then we will have our results. 

if you see an album that isnt listed, just comment it. discussion of the album in the reply section of each




tl;dr : **vote for your favorite album of 2010!**

edit #2: so now that weve got some serious interest here, you can collapse all the replies and leave only the albums by pasting this into your bookmark bar (Code by deodrus in a different thread) :

javascript:$('div.commentarea%20&gt;%20div.sitetable%20&gt;%20div.thing%20&gt;%20div.child').each(function(){var%20t=$(this);if(t.children().length%20&gt;%200)t.prev().find('ul.buttons').append($('&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;').append($('&lt;a%20href=""#""&gt;&lt;font%20color=""green""&gt;toggle%20children&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;').click(function(e){t.children('div').toggle();e.preventDefault();})))}).children('div').toggle()()

that way you can have a true no-nonsense list, if you so desire.

I realize that this is a long shot, but Reddit, I need your help.",4400,2817,714,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/pgsfh/my_father_was_one_of_those_one_hit_wonders_from/,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to read this.

Ok, My father was Isaac Payton Sweat out of Houston Texas, and the song that made him a one hit wonder was the Cotton Eyed Joe. Released in 1982. This song single handedly started the line dancing craze across America. It was #1 for over 30 weeks on the country charts. The only song to ever spend more time at #1 on the country charts was Stand By Your Man by Tammy Wynette. So, My father put out the second most popular country song ever. I think that solidifies his claim to be a one hit wonder.

In 1990 a woman that he was married to for 3 years shot and killed him in his garage as he was trying to leave. I was on that TV show called A Current Affair as well as numerous newspaper interviews following the murder. Ultimately she was not convicted of the murder. She also burned down the house they were living in for the insurance money. Here is the longshot request. Would any of you fine people have, or know an older person that is into country music that may have, any old records, pictures or any type of memorabilia of my father? I have almost nothing but a few scant pictures to remember him by. Even if this post nets me but one single picture, you have no idea how grateful me and my sister would be to have it.

Again I thank you for your time.

Edit: Several redditors have given me some good leads. I knew I could count on reddit! For example, n_md has linked me to some of his old records for sale on ebay. Can't believe that I didn't think of this before. Amazing how something people would sell so cheaply on ebay could be so priceless to another man. I am still searching for pictures, old concert t-shirts and such. Hopefully some more obscure items will turn up from this post yet.

Edit 2: We made a facebook page for my dad. If you friend request him I promise that I will add you.

http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003283517546

Edit 3: To all of you suggesting that I seek revenge on the woman that killed him. I have already wrestled with and defeated that demon. Even though I am 100% absolutely sure that she is guilty I cannot do this. I would be arrested immediately. I have already said on national TV that I know she did it. I promise you I would be the prime suspect. I would be totally ok with the murder investigation being reopened though.

Thank you /u/gonnasingnow for your time on this. Sounds great so far. Gave me chills. 

Thanks to /u/composeradrian as well. He was able to use some different software to create a more realistic sound.

Edit: Here are the 2 computer generated versions so far. [https://soundcloud.com/daniel-cabin/invasion](https://soundcloud.com/daniel-cabin/invasion) and [https://soundcloud.com/adrianlhernandez/invasion-intro](https://soundcloud.com/adrianlhernandez/invasion-intro)  

I have a few messages from people who are planning live recordings I will update with them when I receive them. This is so amazing to get this reaction. I thank you all. 

Looks like it was made in 1956 for all those interested.

Edit: I cannot wait to hear any live versions that people may come up with. I wanted my Dad to see how awesome this has been over the past day, so I sent him a link to this. He is very thankful to you all for what you have accomplished thus far in making the piece come to life. He asked me to post a thank you from him. 

Here it is:

Thank you all for bringing to life the only known music composition created by my father.

My father went to college, played in some Big Bands in the Midwest, got married and went to war. My older brother was born while he was gone. He was a member of the first graduating class of a flight training school now known as the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. He fought in the Pacific theater.  After returning from the war Dad taught music at the high school and college level.

My father was a kind and caring person and two things that I never heard was he never mentioned anything about the war and I never heard him play any music. 

After Dad passed away in 1995 I found a box of his military history and photographs that he took during the war. They were not your normal pictures of landscapes, planes and his fellow flight crews but they showed the devastation of war and the effect it had on the regular people.  

Thank you for letting me hear my father play music after all these years and to hear through this music his feelings of what war is like and the cruelty that it can cause. 

I think this was his “Machine Gun”.

What if we had a week where every song posted to r/music must have less than 300,000 (or around that number) views on youtube (and that counts for the version of that particular song that has the most views)? I think it could be an interesting way to get some more variety and fresh music in here. I'm not suggesting that it should be a permanent thing by any means, but I think it would be interesting to do for a while. Yeah, so that's pretty much it, if you think some form of this could be a good idea, upvote, if you think it's a bad idea, downvote. Have a nice day.

**Edit/update:** Just woke up and I'd like to say I'm surprised and grateful for the comments and upvotes, thanks everyone. Oh and I'm also grateful that I don't have a hangover, that's nice too. So anyway, I've been trying to read through all the comments but I still have a few to go, I like what I've read so far, here are my responses:

1) I'm sure some people would try to sneak more popular songs by, but if the community was behind the idea they wouldn't get upvoted much and mods could remove them if they did.

2) Thanks for the suggestions of /r/listentothis and /r/under10k, I like them both, but they're not exactly what I'm picturing with this idea, because I wouldn't want it to be just underground indie bands, but also slightly 'deeper' tracks by some more popular bands, which is also part of the reason I thought of a higher number and not 25,000 or something.

3) I agree with the person or people who suggested doing it one day every week, that's a much better idea, and I like your suggestion of Tuesday, seems like the perfect day for it. Maybe we could have the best of both and have it 3 days back to back and then every Tuesday?

I'd really like to see this happen, I think it could be a good change, thanks for the interest and support :)",,False,,t5_2qh1u,1346221825.0,,,True,t3_yxxtw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/yxxtw/i_just_had_an_idea_for_this_subreddit/,

One of the songs we are covering is Stevie Ray Vaughan's ""Life by the Drop""  I can play the song well, but its not 100% accurate to the recording and I wanted to learn some of the fancier fills he puts in there, so I go to download the tab for the song.

It's $1.29 @ sheetmusicdirect.com.  Ok, fair enough price.  I register for the site, find the sheet music.  To actually see a sample of it, I have to download and install a 12 MB proprietary software ( 10 MB for a format viewer... seems kind of large, but whatever).  I install it, sample looks good, so I pay for it and then I am allowed to print it.  

About 3 pages in my printer acts like its running out of ink ( even though it shows at 75% full) and by the end of the 4th page its so blurry I can't see shit.  I reset the printer and immediately try to reprint it and get this pop up:
&gt;you have reached your print limit for this purchase

Holy fuck, now I have to pirate something I just paid for because you are so fucking scared of losing a sale here or there that you want to fuck over the people that are actually willing to pay you.  

That is the last $1.29 they will be getting from me and now I am probably just gonna START by checking out torrent sites first instead of taking the legal option.

**My album can be listened to and bought here: http://iammosh.bandcamp.com/**

**Little Warriors Website: http://littlewarriors.ca/**

**Why Little Warriors?**

Fortunately I myself have never been a victim, but far too many of the men and women close to me have been. As a confidante for many, I can say that you are probably WAY underestimating the amount of people YOU know as well.

I had the privilege of attending one of the organizations ""Love Balls"" about six months ago, where I got to watch the Founder of the organization tell her story, as well as meet 3 girls who had come forward independently to speak.

The money goes toward building the ""Be Brave Ranch"" which is a sort of camp for victims of sexual assault in which they will receive the necessary therapy and support, as well as fraternity to heal and recover from the incident.

**I will be updating with proof of donation next week.**

Please, hold me as accountable as you can. This is not about making money or promoting myself. I just wish to help using what I have at my disposal.

**IF YOU CAN SUGGEST A MORE FITTING CHARITY PLEASE DO**

Unfortunately given the size of Little Warriors I don't see it listed on Charity Navigator. I can say that the organization is morally sound to the **best of my knowledge**. That being said I am open to donating to another charity with a little more transparency. I would like to stick within the ""Victims of Sexual Assault"" umbrella though.

**EDIT:**	I will be delivering cash to the head office next Friday the 28, as they are only open while I'm at work, and I won't be able to get time off till then. I will accept donations up until the point when I withdraw the cash and deliver it to Little Warriors. I will follow up with pictures for proof that day.

and I thought that was a great idea, so I decided to make /r/WhereDoIStart. Basically, you can make a self post for a band you want to get into, or a band you know a lot about, and then post (generally) the album you think a new listener would like the best. Other people can post their choices, and vote on them, or comment about one album or another. 

I've got five posts already, just to get it started, but there's a lot of ground to cover, and I think this could be a really great resource, considering its always been hard for me to get into bands with massive discographies. Please leave your impressions below, maybe browse the subreddit, and add one of your favorite bands.

But, this goes way back.  People thought Elvis was the Anti-Christ and that Rock &amp; Roll was the END of Western Civilization.  

Baby boomers get all misty eyed when they hear Dylan, or The Big Chill soundtrack.  

Hell, now even 90s kids are looking at what's being released here in 2013 and going ""Ugh!""

Why?  There's good and bad in every genre of music, for every season of music.  Why do people hardly ever accept newer music as they get older?

I am waiting for something to wrong
I am waiting for familiar resolve
I am waiting for another repeat
Another diet fed by crippling defeat
And i am waiting for that sense of relief
I am waiting for you to flee the scene
As if you held in your hand the smoking gun
And on the floor lay the one you said you loved.

And it's strange
They are basically the same
So i don't ask names anymore.

Sometimes i think this cycle never ends
We slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb again
And it seems by the time that i have figured what it's worth
The squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse.

Dear /r/Music, words cannot describe the exhilaration I feel right now. I'm one of those ""creative types"" that never finishes anything. Stewie's [""how's that novel you been workin on?"" speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pbou_r7ODs) pretty much sums it up. 

This EP is my first release, and it practically destroyed me. I started writing the songs in late 2005. In March 2009, I put a band together and started recording with them DIY-style. I spent somewhere between 1,000 and 1,200 hours on the production process–especially tweaking the mixes–over the course of a year. Then my drummer emailed me  [this story about the makers of Duke Nukem](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_duke_nukem/) and why they never finished their sequel. After spending a few days trying convince myself that my situation was different, I decided to pull the trigger and commit to a deadline at all costs. I spent all my savings and maxed out my credit card to take several months off from work and finish mixing (I'm self-employed). By then I'd lost most of my friends (always too busy to see them), was eating take out and convenience store food 7 days a week (too busy to shop), and had developed an immunity to Red Bull (too busy to go to sleep before 7 AM). Today, the burden is lifted. Here it is in all its imperfection or overperfection. I hope some of you get something from this.

TL;DR - five songs took five years.

1326299035.0,1422,self.Music,ochel,"What is, in your opinion, the most powerful music you have ever listened to?",3186,1764,6626,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ochel/what_is_in_your_opinion_the_most_powerful_music/,"I need to do some more thinking to come up with my all-time favorite, but I had my playlist on shuffle, and one of my favorite symphonic pieces came up. John Williams - ""Born on the Fourth of July"" from the soundtrack of the same name. I absolutely love the trumpet and the strings.

I'm looking for more ""big"" music. What do you consider the most moving and/or beautiful song you have ever heard?

clarification: by big, I mean generally overwhelming emotionally or at least very layered, not necessarily giant symphony blasting away. I'm entirely open to non-symphonic music of all sorts.
A few other things I like in the general category, though several aren't on my ""moving"" list- in no particular order:

* Everwood theme (forgot this one). I went to Park City, Utah and it was gorgeous, had this on and in my head the whole time. This one while not an incredible piece, touches the right places in my memory and I loved Everwood.
* Chevaliers de Sangreal from Angels and Demons
* Now We Are Free from Gladiator
* Coldplay's Clocks and The Scientist
* Metallica's The Ecstasy of Gold from the S&amp;M album.
* I like Edward Higginbottom's version of In paradisium and Agnus Dei Op. 11.
* Brian Eno's ""An Ending (Ascent)"" from Apollo: Atmospheres &amp; soundtracks
* Ave Maria from the OperaBabes 
* I sort of have a thing for some of Ludovico Einaudi's music - first introduced by Stargate Universe with Ascolta on Divinire. Liked some other songs from that show too.
* a fair bit of Battlestar Galactica's soundtrack
* Stargate movie theme
* Sigur Rós' Hoppípolla (thanks for remininding me!)
* Song of Freedom, Songs of Captivity and Freedom, and a Dazzling End from Doctor Who
* Another I remembered - The Dream Academy, Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want
* not in my main group, but a favorite of mine for the guitar. Foster the People - Pumped Up Kicks - Sirius acoustic live version. There's a spine tingling studio echo in there.

hell I like a lot of music way outside this particular set, but I'm sort going in the vein of stuff I might listen to while thinking or working. please don't let the above limit your suggestions. It amazes my how many songs you all have mentioned I liked or loved and simply forgot with the passage of time. This thread has been great.

I realize we all have different tastes and I thank you for all of your suggestions. I like trying new (or retrying old) things. Obviously I can't reply to everyone and it might get repetitive if I did, but thank you in advance.


edit #N+1: wow- never expected so many replies. I'll be busy listening for days

edit #N+2: front-page? criminy! So many suggestions, thanks, this is awesome! Now where are all those summary bots to help categorize and organize this massive list?

edit #N+3: I posted this below, but I wanted to add... I've listened to tons of classical and love it. When I'm working I have a lot of it on. I have cds full of Yo Yo Ma doing Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Mahler, Schubert, Barber and all kinds of things. I love that stuff, but as much as I love it, for some reason though, some songs move me more than others and a lot of less classical stuff has been associated with me by way of powerful scenes in movies or in life. While there are a few strictly classical pieces that move me, I have more symphonic things that may be less classical and even a few that you might consider modern. Perhaps my problem is a generally bad memory combined with being a movie nut and I've listened to music actively my whole life so maybe I've watered down my recollection a bit too much. More recent works are at the top of the stack. This whole thread is about what moves you, gets you emotional, overwhelms you, makes you think. This was a question and a thread I didn't put a ton of thought into originally and I expected maybe a dozen answers at most, mainly looking for a couple new songs to put on while working today and because I'm a bit sick (just a cold). I turn over new reddit accounts a lot for a fresh start and in a couple years of being here, this is the first time I've gotten more than about 5 replies- let alone 5000+. Rather than edit the above, I chose to let you all speak for yourselves, and you all reminded me of many songs I've ""loved and lost"".

All the medication I take, all the medication I will be taking, none of it is a cure and they all have their side-effects, not to mention the time I've spent lying in a hospital bed.

https://twitter.com/mackmaine/status/312719622694653952**

Lil Wayne is in ICU in critical condition after suffering yet another seizure, and we're told it doesn't look good ... TMZ has learned.

We broke the story ... the 30-year-old rapper was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in L.A. Tuesday night after suffering multiple seizures.  He was released Wednesday but just hours later one of his bodyguards found him in his room, on the floor and unconscious.

Wayne was rushed to the hospital again, but this time he did not stabilize.  He was taken to ICU, where he was placed in restraints because he was shaking uncontrollably.

We're told Wayne is currently ""unstable,"" and has been placed in an induced coma.  He is breathing through tubes.

We're told several people are at Wayne's bedside crying, and a number of rap artists and family members are on the way.  Sources say the scene is violent as Wayne shakes uncontrollably.

Sources say there's evidence Wayne went on a Sizzurp binge after being released Wednesday, because doctors found high amounts of codeine in his system.

We're told Wanye's stomach was pumped 3 times to flush the drugs from his system.

The other day, I was sitting with friends talking about album ideas and when the conversation turned to arrangements, someone suggested that rather than do a serious album full of arrangements, why not make it fun and involve reddit.

So please suggest and vote for songs you would like to see me arrange and I will choose three based on upvotes as well as workability (I prefer working with good melodies, not novelty tunes). As soon as I get a window in my schedule, I'll upload videos of the songs for you all to enjoy.

Here are some examples of songs I've covered in the past:

[Classical Gas - Mason Williams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU-3_D26mUg&amp;feature=related)

[Close To You - Burt Bacharach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u32Ex8n4iXY&amp;feature=related)

[You Needed Me - Randy Goodrum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzwNwbDOfcc)

edit2: Dear Reddit folks, I don't normally have time for this kind of thing but as I'm home from tour, I thought it might be fun to be involved in a musical activity that could involve a lot of people and give a lot of people pleasure - and be challenging for me! I look forward to reading your suggestions and hope I can come up with something that says a lot musically. Thanks for all your interest in this and all your words of encouragement to me. And thanks for the overwhelming response! Yours fretfully, TE CGP xx

edit 3: Please keep the suggestions coming - even if one doesn't get enough votes, we are enjoying seeing the ideas and thoughts flowing. We'll let you know when a choice has been made. Thanks all! - TE's SO (long time lurker and technical interpreter for Tommy)

**final edit:** Hi everyone, I just want to let you know that I've had a very busy week but now that comments have slowed down, I can read through them all! Thank you all so much for taking the time to contribute and I appreciate the kind messages written to me. I'm just about to start a tour so it may be some weeks until I can do the arrangements - please bear with me! Looking forward to working on the songs (can't wait to hear them myself!) TE CGP xx

p.s. Thank you CaptainKernel, for the three months of reddit gold :)

Do people even discuss anything about music on this subreddit? I'm not subscribed to this subreddit so I thought if I came here and looked at the sidebar I'd be enlightened, but there isn't even a description.

So what do you guys actually do here? Just post to music that you like and then people will vote on it? Eventually, you're just going to get a bunch of people that like the same stuff and then you alienate lots of other music, right? 

Then people will just start other subreddits about certain genres, bands, styles and all other aspects of music. Which in the end just makes this subreddit redundant. I just had this idea that music is something people find out about and search through thousands of songs and tunes and pick out what they like so it's hard for me to imagine just one place where all of that is going to be. Then again, it's all on YouTube so why wouldn't people just go there? 


What do you use this subreddit for? So you don't have to open up another tab to get to YouTube and basically this becomes a shuffle feature where you'll just listen to whatever is voted high enough for you to notice on your front page? Kind of like listening to the radio. I suppose that's a bit more practical.

I am a huge Kanye West fan and so this is something I've always wanted to do, but never had the inspiration until I saw what u/JimmehFTW did with Wayne. So yes Kanye is my favourite artist and although a lot of folks on r/music and r/hiphopheads appreciate him, there are still a huge number of people who, when they see his name respond with ""lol fishsticks"" or ""I can't listen to him because he's a douche bag"" and such, which I find irritating. So anyway, he is obviously a mega star in the world of entertainment and fashion etc... so without further adieu, here it goes.

**The College Dropout (2004)**

This was Kanye's debut project which was released in early 2004 under Jay-Z's label, Roc-A-Fella Records. He was somewhat known before this publicly, but he was huge in the industry as one of the premier producers who paved the soul sample in hip hop. He was also one of the premier producers on Jay-Z's ""The Blueprint"" album on tracks like Takeover, Heart of the City &amp; Izzo (Hova), the latter of which was a mega hit on the charts. The album is very soul samples heavy and was one of the first mainstream albums in rap to do away with the ""gangster"" imagine most rappers tried to portray. As an aside it took Kanye forever to get a deal because most people didn't see him as ""gangster"" enough to have any appeal as a rapper, which is of course hilarious in retrospect. 

Standout Tracks

*All Falls Down-Ye tackles racism, commercialism and self consciousness on a song that is, almost 10 years later 
catchy as hell. [All Falls Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kyWDhB_QeI)

*Jesus Walks-He made a song about Jesus that gets played in the club. Like he did this on his debut album, that should tell you how much balls he has this song, had it flopped, could have been the end of him in rap. [Jesus Walks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g)

*Last Call-I debated this or Family Business, but I wet with Last Call because of the story at the end. It makes you respect how much work went in to getting signed. [Last Call](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNYF_-mGGUI)

**Late Registration (2005)**

This was released after the whole ""George Bush doesn't care about black people"" fiasco and it was a massive hit. Kanye continued the soul sample thing, but extended don it and got help from Jon Brion to make it sound almost like a movie score. This is one of his most critically acclaimed albums, and lyrically it might be his best work and the production is like an almost perfection of the style he made famous in rap. It is ranked 118th on Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time, but will likely move up as it is still only 8 years old.

Standout Tracks

*Diamonds from Sierra Leone-Along with the remix featuring Jay-Z, this song was the first single, and it tackled so much from his attitude at awards shows to the fact that some critics were still hating on him because ""producers can't rap"". [Diamonds From Sierra Leone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92FCRmggNqQ)

*Touch the Sky-Produced by a producer he came up with in Just Blaze, this song is almost an Orchestra sort of thing. It also made the mainstream aware of a young Chicago MC named Lupe Fiasco who of course blew up soon after, and in my opinion, had the best verse on the track. [Touch the Sky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkwQbuAGLj4) 

*Hey Mama-His mom died in 2007 (I will get in to that later!) and this song was released in 2005, so it has new meaning now. Either way the song is super emotional and is one of the best rap songs I've ever heard. [Hey Mama](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtpKqMpqGU0)

**Graduation (2007)**

Some argue this is Kanye's weakest ""rap"" album, but it was the moment where he went from a rap star to a pop superstar. It had the single Stronger which with help from Daft Punk, became a mega hit and really took Kanye from a rapper to a popstar. He said he was inspired by touring with U2 in to making a stadium sound and he really did. This album was hit after hit but he also had the soulful production I spoke of earlier. 

Standout Tracks

*Stronger-I kind of debated putting this here, because it's so ""not fanboyish"" to put the artists most popular song as one of your favorites, but really this song is just too good. It's one of the first real dance hip hop tracks and in 2013 is still a big hit at sports events and parties. The lyrics aren't the best, but he specifically tried to dumb it down for the stadium appeal. [Stronger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g)

*Bittersweet Poetry-A bonus track, this was a poem he originally performed at Def Jam Slam Poetry sessions that he made in to a song with help from John Mayer. The song is sort of personal to me because of the subject matter, but you can feel his emotion in his words, especially at the end. I think anyone who has messed up in a relationship can understand this song. [Bittersweet Poetry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig0GdSHDCfs)

*Can't Tell me Nothiing-This might be the one song that defines Kanye the most. The first line is ""I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven, when I woke I spent that on a necklace"" just sums him up so well. You could look at his career as a battle between the riches and the want to have a regular life. This song is just so defiant and with that ""fuck you"" attitude we've come to expect from Kanye. The beat, the Young Jeezy adlibs make this one of Kanye's best tracks. I mean he says ""If the devil wear prada, Adam Eve wear Nada I'm in between but may more fresher,"" that line is classic Kanye. [Can't Tell me Nothing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E58qLXBfLrs)

**808s &amp; Heartbreak**

In 2007 right after the release Graduation, Kanye's mother Donda passed away. Kanye was at the top of the world in every way, but when he lost his mom he lost it. You can see in his interviews there is a huge difference from before his mother passed and after it and I think anyone can understand that. Kanye was close to his mom as the song ""Hey Mama"" proves and he also split up with his fiance soon after which led him to recorder 808s &amp; Heartbreak in two weeks. A lot of people hate this album because rather then rapping, Kanye sung with the help of autotune to make him sound almost robotic and emotionless as if someone had ripped his heart out. This is one of my favorite Kanye albums though, it has a dark, emotionless and sad feel to it. You really get the feeling of a guy who just had his world flipped upside down. It helped to launch the careers of Kid Cudi and Drake among others.

Standout Tracks

*Welcome to Heartbreak-This may be my favorite Kanye song. The Kid Cudi vocals on the hook are perfect for the song, Kanye's robotic/emotionless voice tears you apart and you somehow empathise with one of the richest and most famous celebrities in the world. He has everything he grew up wanting but he's missing the one thing he needs; love (from his mother and from a family). [Welcome to Heartbreak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMH0e8kIZtE)

*Coldest Winter-Backed by a sample from Tears for Fears, this song was about his mother's passing (goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?). It's haunting as hell from the beat, the way the autotune works and the lyrics, the whole thing is just so sad. [Coldest Winter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6rjQ9VVLDI)

*Pinnchio Story-Not technically a song more of a freestyle, this song lets you inside of Kanye's mind to understand a the mindset of a heartbroken star and a star without love in his life. I don't even know if I can do this masterpiece justice, it's just so emotional and sad. [Pinnochio Story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLY_NsMi5ZE)

**My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)**

In 2009, Kanye was a mess. His mother had just died, his fiance left him etc... And then of course, the VMA Taylor Swift ""incident"" happened. Say what you want about it being planned etc... I don't buy it at all, but it doesn't matter. One way or the other, Kanye took a year off music lived in Japan and Italy to escape the media and then all of a sudden in May 2010 was seen in New York City, and a few days later ""Power"" was released. A lot of people expected a song where he said sorry to Taylor and sorry to Ameirca, but instead the first words we hear are; ""Living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it/do it better then anybody you ever seen do it."" It was clear 10 seconds in, Ye was back. The album received ridiculous critical acclaim and was recently named number 8 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the top 100 albums of all time. 

Standout Tracks

*Runaway-This is my all time favourite song. It's his song to Taylor Swift, but it can be viewed as a song about a past lover too, or even his relationship with fame. The song is a sorry anthem, but also with his middle finger up. The song is just beautiful and I really don't know how else to describe it other then that. [Runaway](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7_jYl8A73g)

*Gorgeous-If you like lyrical rappers, this is the song for you. In my opinion this is Ye's most lyrical work and the beat is great too. It features Kid Cudi doing his masterful work on the hook and Raekwon of the Wu Tang Clan adds a verse on at the end. This is arguably the hungriest Kanye song, you can tell he wants to claim the top of the rap throne, and it's hard to argue against him after hearing this song.[Gorgeous](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghc_fc4R1rI)

*Lost in the World-Kanye's verse is only 8 bars and that's all he says in the entire song. However, as the albums finishing song this just works so well, the Bon Iver vocals are perfection and it's almost a poetic way to end the album. [Lost in the World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofaRvNOV4SI)

**Yeezus (2013)**

And now we come to his recent release, Yeezus. This album is just so... different from everything else in not only his discography, but in any rappers. In a genre where artists pretty much always stay inside the box or stay inside their persona, Kanye just took the box, lit it on fire and then poured the ashes in to the pacific ocean, or to say, the box does not exist with Kanye. This album has rock, EDM, rap and reggae influences and although a lot of ""old school"" rap fans dislike it, I find it captivating and one of his best works.

Standout Tracks

*Black Skinhead-I think they're making a video for this one, but as soon as he performed this on SNL, I knew it was an instant classic. The song is so agressive and the Draft Punk production on the drums is second to none. [Black Skinhead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq2DVxyJcCI)

*Blood on the Leaves-this is like 808s style perfected. He uses autotune and the beat drop on this is almost a religious experience. The sample is also awesome. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0QcxWPB59o](Blood on the Leaves)

*Bound 2-If you prefer ""old"" Kanye to new Kanye this is the song for you. The beat could pass for a College Dropout leftover and lyrically there are some clever lines in there. [Bound 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0RHjDN3e0)

So this is my rundown of Kanye West's impressive discography in an hour. There are two other projects Watch the Throne with Jay-Z (2011) and Cruel Summer with GOOD Music his record label (2012) which you can check out too, but they were collaboration projects so not Kanye's solo work. I know this is no wheres near as good as the Guide to Lil Wayne, but I just wanted to get my thoughts down on paper and help some redditors appreciate one of the premier artists of our generation!

Since they expanded their genre into every type of music you could think of, I would definitely say that they revolutionized the German music scene.

All this time I've been spending trying to find something I could relate to with my ""troubled"" teenage son, and it was right under my nose. I had no idea he had such good taste. I know it may seem weird to those who have never been in this situation, but I'm pretty damn proud right now that I has such a cool son and stoked to find something we have so much in common. I just wanted to share with some people who would understand just how cool this is :)

Edit: Notice the dates are today. I copied the stuff in his larger folder that I liked and moved it to a new folder for myself to 1- keep for myself and honestly, 2 - show off the stuff I thought was cool. I've been a long time lurker and just wanted to share. Believe it or not, I really don't care. I'm still happy :) - [Original folder](http://i.imgur.com/eEIfu.jpg)

Edit: Quite a few people told me they thought this was their folder for a second and got really nervous. That got me thinking and prompted me to post the response below. Thanks to some input from SoyBeanExplosion (thank for the reddit gold man) and others telling me to tell him this, I've decided to slip a note of an amended version of the post below (omitting the snooping part) into whatever book he's currently reading (he's always reading or plugged into his droid), along with a pair of tickets to the Flaming Lips show December 27th. What a day. I'm pretty wrought with emotion and appreciate all the advise and encouragement. It makes me mad at myself that I've waited so long to come out and tell him how I feel,as if a father has to be some hard-ass authoritarian. He's just a human being like me. No, he more than that. He's my son. Thanks all.  

-Copy of aforementioned post I plan to amend and give to him- 

You know. It never dawned on me my son could be a Redditor, but come to think of it, there's a pretty good chance nowadays.

With that said, you're a pretty fucking cool kid. You're at that age were you're realizing adults aren't really that smart. I'm just stumbling through life like you dude. I'm human and make mistakes just like everyone. There's no guide on how to be a perfect dad and I'm just figuring this shit out as I go along.

Here's my story from last night.,2053,776,230,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/kny54/fleet_foxes_robin_pecknold_is_a_swell_guy_heres/,"Fleet Foxes played my city (Raleigh, NC) last night. I had been looking forward to this show for months—they're one of my favorite bands and their music has helped me through several tough times.

There had been storms nearby, and there were concerns about whether or not the show would go on, as the venue was an outdoor amphitheater.

The storms hit, and hit hard. The crowd stood in the rain and danced and sang along like nothing was going on. Eventually the PA system gave out (I think during ""White Winter Hymnal""), and the crowd finished singing the song.

The band realized it couldn't keep going and would take a break to figure out what they could do. There was hemming and hawing about whether or not the band could start to play again, but rain started leaking in from the roof and was being blown in from the sides of the stage (all of which were open. seems like incredibly poor planning for an outdoor venue).

A few minutes after announcing the show would not continue, singer/frontman Robin Pecknold jumped off of the stage, hanging out on the side and interacting with fans. Anything they requested, he said yes. Pictures, signings, hugs, handshakes: his only answers were ""yes"" and ""of course!"". 

When the security people started trying to wave people away, Robin looked the main one straight in the eye and said, ""I'm not leaving until I talk to all of these folks.""

Robin's actions may have been a small gesture, but it speaks volumes.  He was very kind and patient and apologetic about the whole situation. His behavior/interactions with everyone showed that despite Fleet Foxes' popularity, he still gives a shit about what he does and the people who support it. I respect this band so much more now.",,False,,t5_2qh1u,False,,,True,t3_kny54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/kny54/fleet_foxes_robin_pecknold_is_a_swell_guy_heres/,

It was their first status update in almost 6 months. Today, they updated with a picture that simply says ""Five"". 

Led Zeppelin Did their first four albums titled I, II, III and IV and the rest of their albums were named. Maybe I'm just dreaming but to me it looks like they may go back to their roots and release album V.

**UPDATE**: A new post has just been put on their Facebook page as of 10:13 am, this one says ""Four"". So  I think they are going to make an announcement by Thursday. Unless the announcement is a new album, my suspicion was wrong. We will see on Thursday.

I mean, the songs that everyone knows and loves will get more upvotes just BECAUSE everyone already knows and loves them. 

I mean, let's be honest. Do you really think that every week, someone finds a Youtube video of Hurt - NIN/Johnny Cash and thinks to themselves, ""Hey, I wonder if /r/Music has heard this?"" They would only post it for the karma, because they KNOW that people already know and like this song. People who want to listen to music they haven't heard before could go to /r/listentothis.

The only bright spot of this subreddit that I see is the Fridays where only self posts are allowed, which makes for some very interesting conversations.

If I'm missing the goal of this subreddit entirely, then feel free to let me in on it, but as far as I can see, /r/Music just seems like all the karma whores in one spot.

EDIT: I received a response from Raerth (a mod) that really does help to clear this up for me:

""This is a default subreddit with 1.5 million subscribed accounts and 3 million unique visitors a month. The posts that rise to the top are those which appeal to the widest possible cross-section of those people. If you're coming here to find new, unknown, underground or niche music, you are in the wrong place.

With something as subjective as music taste, and a website that relies on votes to get content to the top, what the hell do you think will be popular in here?

There are plenty of subreddits that focus on music discovery. Off the top of my head are /r/listentothis , /r/indiewok , /r/futurefunkairlines , /r/headbangtothis , and /r/under10k . They have strict rules on what can be submitted.

/r/Music does not have strict rules because what is a classic for someone in /r/HiphopHeads could be unknown to someone in /r/Metal , and vice-versa.

Also, when we attempted to introduce the final solution of a list of tracks which should not be reposted, we received a MASSIVE outpouring of hate accusing us of being evil censoring nazis.

**What we are good for is being the dump that everyone can submit any song to. There are no rules other than it being about music.

We are also the springboard for people to explore the musical subreddits. We maintain [The Big Fucking List of Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/music/faq) , and you should all look at that and find subreddits you enjoy.**""

TL;DR: If you're looking for new music to listen to, you're in the wrong place. Feel free to unsubscribe. There is no claim that this subreddit is the place to find music you've never heard before. There are other subreddits specifically for that purpose. The main purpose of this subreddit is explained very well in the bolded section of Raerth's post - to be the place where anyone can submit any kind of music, no matter the popularity or style.",,False,,t5_2qh1u,1349741463.0,,,True,t3_114rfm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/114rfm/may_i_ask_exactly_what_the_point_of_this/,

I don't usually share my private stuff with the interwebz but I feel like I need to tell this one.

So not more then 30 minutes ago I was coming home driving my car, roof was off, temperature is in fact perfect, was enjoying a mix CD, volume was pretty high, but I didn't care. Songs were good... I stopped at the red light just as a song was finishing, for some reason I took a look at my rear view mirror, saw no one. Next song started and I just noticed that light turned yellow, eventually green.

I've put my right hand down to put a car into gear, I stopped half way down and said to myself ... goddamn not this song AGAIN... Gotye - Somebody I used to know.

As I pressed next on my CD thingey, I hear this roaring sound of a black Yamaha R1 going trough red light on the street that was perpendicular to the one I was on. I shit you not he was driving more then 150 kilometers per hour  (round 100 miles per hour) trough RED light.

All this happened in like 2 seconds... Me going for a gear change and going back to CD changer.

I literally stood there frozen for I don't know how long... Felt totally numb after a giant surge of adrenalin pumping trough my veins.

If that songs wasn't so damn popular, so popular it makes me wanna puke (ok I'm exaggerating) when I hear it for the 500.000th time I probably would have changed the gear and started moving forward a bit earlier. And that would have caused an imminent collision with that f*cking idiot on the bike.

I would have probably died... We both probably would have.

So Gotye, and YouTube and all local radio stations that played that song for a billion times I thank you with all my heart. You saved my life, and a life of that idiot.

I guess I just wasn't my time to go.

Cheers internet, you're awesome!

Toni.

**However**, I've noticed that we're getting a very high number of image posts that are only tangentially linked to music appearing at the top of the hot list.

Personally, I believe memes, image macros and rage comics are the *cancer killing ~~/b/~~ reddit*. I would happily make these posts against the rules. If the subreddit agrees.

I also feel that any image post which could easily be expressed in a self post is pure karma-whoring, and should also be banned.

Valid image posts would be allowed if they're music related (i.e. not Francis Bean Cobain's tits) and cannot be expressed better in any other form.

**Just for clarification, I am a female. Not that it matters much, just odd to be referred to as male in comments.**

***This is not a karma whore post, I actually just want help making a playlist.*** 

Long story short: My mother has Angiosarcoma of the breast. A very nasty and hard to treat form of cancer. The prognosis isn't great but she's going through chemotheraphy and radiation ASAP to assault her system. 

When I visited with her this weekend she asked me to make her a playlist for her iPod that she can listen to while going through treatment. She wants upbeat songs and just kick ass music all around. As you can imagine, I have been through a lot (with my mother's diagnosis) and my usually creative and musically intuitive brain is shot. 

If you guys can please help I would greatly apprectiate it. 

So far all I have are:

* ""I Will Survive"" by Gloria Gaynor 
* ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor

These are as per her request. 

Thank you in advance Reddit... if anyone at all even replies to this.
