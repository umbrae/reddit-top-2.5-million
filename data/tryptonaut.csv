1366745425.0,66,self.tryptonaut,1cyezu,"Trip Report: (My experience with Ayahuasca 12/12/12) E.T. communication, crystal cities, kundalini, prophecy)",75,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1cyezu/trip_report_my_experience_with_ayahuasca_121212/,"**Setting:** Lake Titicaca, on a spiritual retreat for the 12/12/12

**Background:** [This is my first aya experience 2 years prior](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=91566), and [another profound experience I had on 11/11/11](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93630). My opinions on these matters change on a daily basis. I sometimes wish I could rewrite my erowid reports, but whatever. I refer to my 11/11/11 experience as: 'becoming the god-head' now. Due to the coincidence of my becoming on 11/11/11, I assumed that 12/12/12 would be another significant day to trip. I was correct.

I fasted for 30 hours before drinking the aya, as I had done previously 2 years ago. The curanderismos who lead my ceremony were from the Shipibo tribe. A husband and wife aya shaman/shamaness duo, Jesus and his wife. His wife had the most beautiful voice! They had traveled to lake Titicaca for a shaman gathering that took place earlier that day, 12/12/12. In our room, there happened to be 12 people present, including the shaman and his wife, 12 for 12/12/12 ;) There were many blankets, a puke bucket for each person, and Jesus held the space well, fulfilling his role as a shaman superbly. He gave us rattles to shake after we drank the aya, to bring the spirit of mother Earth into the room. At this point, I'm just shaking my rattle and waiting for the effects to start...

Jesus starts to sing, and it's a nice song. I'm feeling pretty normal, until at the end of the song, his voice suddenly changes as if he's possessed. All of a sudden I have a flashback to burning man, when my voice was possessed by something that sounded very similar. [I wrote a post about this earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/11vcqx/insectoid_aliens_wtf/). Why an indigenous shaman of the rainforest, who had probably left the jungle for the first time less than a decade ago, was making digeridoo noises associated with shamans of Asia and Africa, blows my mind. No explanation. Anyways, this is when I began to trip...

I felt the presence of Mama Aya; I could even see her. She appeared as a woman, green, made of plants. Very beautiful. Jesus called her 'grandma', and said she knows the human soul better than any other plant/spirit on the Earth. She started to send me vibes of love and reassurance that everything would be okay. And then I felt this vibration throughout my body, most intense in my hands.  I saw these snakes begin to wrap around my body, my arms, and then my legs. I felt like I was being twisted in impossible directions, and it was very uncomfortable. All of a sudden this chill went through my body, and it felt like every cell in my body was being squeezed of all it's juices, and I started to puke. 2/3 others started to puke at the same time. I just needed to get this poison out of me. Finally, once the aya left my intestines, I laid down perfectly still, and this is when shit got real.

Surrounding me were the DMT elves, these little 'beings', that were very welcoming to me. They were encouraging me to do something, and I think I knew what it was they wanted me to do. On 11/11/11, I actually did it, which is to become the God-head, our 'birthright' as it felt. Anyways, I didn't become the God-head this time, but that's okay. The entities began showing me these objects which looked like faberge eggs. I don't know why they were showing me these objects, but on 11/11/11, I hatched out of an egg as I became the god-head, and it made me think that maybe this is not a coincidence? Also, my entire body, especially my hands, felt very light, like I was made of feathers. This 'lightness' feeling had something to do with the vibrations/twisting and purge I think. The feeling is very similar to MDMA, and I experience something similar with MDMA on a regular basis, but not to this degree. I could also see, with my eyes closed, the shaman, as he would walk around.  With my eyes closed, I could see Jesus with a light coming out of his body. I actually saw him 'banish' a 'dark' entity with this light at one point during the ceremony. Weird. His wife would sing these beautiful healing songs, which were associated with visions. It was as if she were channeling entities to come inside of the room, and heal me. Most of these entities would go into my body, and I would feel pressure, and then a release of pressure, and it felt good. This makes me believe that the shaman/shamaness act as a conduit of healing energy, and don't do any healing themselves. I've read many reports of shamans saying this.

At this point I felt like royalty, like a Pharaoh. I was like, on an alter, being worshiped by these beings, who were telling me that I was the king of kings, and that my accomplishment on 11/11/11 was the most significant event in human history. They were basically worshiping me, and letting me know that there is a kingdom in heaven, and I am the king. I remained skeptical of this, as I always do when entities worship me or try to seduce me in visions. So I began to do yoga, which was really cool, and I would see visions of amplification. I realized that every physical position I make, amplifies, every thought I have, amplifies, like karma into the world. I would put my hands together in namaste, and see a mirrored vision of my position, but like 4,5,6 copies of it. 

I asked, ""Can I experience this without drugs."" The response: ""yes."" I ask, ""can I bring anything back with me?"" The response: ""we give you the power of healing touch."" So I began to check for abnormalities, trying healing work on myself (I've never done this). Eventually I came up to my right side, which had been hurting for some time. What I saw was a crying baby, made of darkness. I ask, ""why is this fetus here, is it supposed to be?"" I am told, ""no, it is a parasite."" So I kill it, and I sacrifice it, letting it know that it's not supposed to be in me, and I want it to be in a better place. I have nothing but love and compassion for this being, but it shouldn't be living in me. I then feel, the contents of it's dark body enter my stomach. At this point, the aya began to wear off, so I drank some more. When the purge happened for the second time, I  lifted my bucket so it would release this darkness towards wherever it needed to go. (Side note: later that night, long after I'm done tripping, I looked in my puke bucket, and saw 2,3, or 4 dark, black, masses, that looked like tumors, that I had thrown up). 

I see this vision where I'm lying on an alter, next to mayan pyramids, and a dagger covered in snakes stabs me in the chest. It doesn't hurt, but I start having trouble breathing, and it feels like how I felt when I awakened my kundalini on 11/11/11. It's hard to describe, but it's a very uncomfortable process where you have this energy that you need to release. It starts at the base of the spine, and then it builds up into throat, and you want to scream! This time, once I release this energy, a golden light begins to pour forth out of my chest. This process takes me to 'the next level"". I see these crystal cities. I see a city over lake titicaca, and I'm just in awe of this beauty. And I see this crystal in the center of the Earth, and then I see the collective consciousness of humanity, like a crystal or ball of energy around the Earth, and I see that we are connected to 4/5 other civilizations, that look like crystals or balls also. I started to act as 'ambassador of Earth' and started communicating with these entities. There was no direct verbal communication, but what I took out of this encounter was that these civilizations are full of love and compassion for us, and somehow we are all connected with them. And then I think ""I want to speak with Bashar!!"" (because I love Bashar). And I connect with what appears to be the Assani civilization, but they just sent me vibes of love, no communication. It was cool.

So, I see the Earth, and I see how our collective is sort of... poopy looking, like brown and goopy. I think it's supposed to look like a crystal, but I see shards of light popping out of the goop, like popcorn, or trees above a canopy. And this goop is sticky, so whoever is popped out, brings up everyone else around them. I think this is a visual representation of our 'awakening', so to speak. It's not going to just happen overnight, but once a certain number of individuals reach a level of awakening, it's kind of inevitable that humanity will all awaken, due to the physics of how this process works. At least that's my perspective.

I have a sense of control of my experience at this point. So, I decide I want to communicate with these 'Asian ascended masters'. (Backstory: After burning man, I had these weird dreams where I was visited by 'Asian masters' teaching me techniques of meditation during my dream. They stopped coming to me after a week, and I was very disappointed because I wanted to learn from them, but I'm not in the right mindstate to remember my dreams that well). Crazy enough, they actually came. There were 9 of them. They began to show me my past life in Asia, they say I was a Buddha in my past life (or something, it's very confusing). I see visions of mountains and trees in Asia. They start teaching me lessons in really interesting ways, like through trickery (pretending to sleep, and then like poking me, testing me and whatnot). They say I'm young in this incarnation? Then I'm shown the importance of strict Asian discipline (because it kind of annoys me, and I was questioning it). It's hard to describe what I saw, but it's like looking at humanity from the perspective of hundreds of generations, like your on a mountain looking below. I understood how in the scheme of things, there are greater purposes for our individual lives. How over generations our actions have an affect on the collective consciousness, which is the spirit realm. The Jungian collective unconscious, full of archetypes (these entities). Like a dream, everything I experience on aya is like a dream, but the dream of humanity over the course of thousands of years.

I realized how powerful our physical bodies are, in relation to these aya spirits. E=MC^2, we are made of matter, that is fucking powerful. And then baby spirits began to play in the fauna of my gut, like it's a field and they're on a playground. And then I remember the agreement. In exchange for healing, entities/energies are allowed to exist within my physical body. They're like babies, getting used to the experience of physicality. There is a lot of power associated with our physical selves, and without us, there isn't really much of a purpose to the nonphysical realm, it's like yin/yang. Everything is connected.

So after the experience was over (I'm not tripping), Jesus closed the ceremony with a prophecy: ""there are 10 others who are destined to bring light into this world, (spread the knowledge of aya?)"". He said that Mother Earth, the Grandma Spirit, Pachamama, was very happy with our ceremony. She sent each of us a hummingbird, which apparently is very significant within the Peruvian culture. Jesus also said that ""I (drpotatoe) was a powerful Asian warrior in my past life."" That blew my mind. Keep in mind Jesus comes from a tribal culture, and warrior can mean a lot of different things. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this. You guys are awesome, it's difficult for me to share this, probably hard to believe, but I hope you at least got an interesting story out of it!!

What should your appearance be to us? What new arts do you bear up from the inaccessible treasure chamber, the sun yoke from the egg of the Gods? You still have roots in the soil like plants and you are animal faces of the human body; you are foolishly sweet, uncanny, primordial, and earthly. We cannot grasp your essence, you gnomes, you object-souls. You have your origin in the lowest. Do you want to become giants, you Tom Thumbs? Do you belong to the followers of the son of the earth?

The Cabiri: “We come to greet you as the master of the lower nature.”

I: ”Are you speaking to me? Am I your master?”

The Cabiri: “You were not, but you are now.”

I: “So you declare. And so be it. Yet what should I do with your following?”

The Cabiri: “We carry what is not to be carried from below to above. We are the juices that rise secretly, not by force, but sucked out of inertia and affixed to what is growing. We known the unknown ways and the inexplicable laws of living matter. We carry up what slumbers in the earthly, what is dead and yet enters into the living. We do this slowly and easily, what you do in vain in your human way. We complete what is impossible for you.”

I: “What should I leave to you? Which troubles can I transfer to you? What should I not do, and what do you do better?”

The Cabiri: “You forget the lethargy of matter. You want to pull up with your own force what can only rise slowly, ingesting itself, affixed to itself form within. Spare yourself the trouble, or you will disturb our work.”

I: “Should I trust you, you untrustworthy ones, you slaves and slave souls? Get to work. Let it be so.”

I: “It seems to me that I gave you  a long time. Neither did I descend to you nor did I disturb your work. I lived in the light of day and did the work of the day. What did you do?”

The Cabiri: “We hauled things up, we built. We placed stone upon stone. Now you stand on solid ground.""

I: “I feel the ground more solid. I stretch upward”

The Cabiri: “We forged a flashing sword for you, with which you can cut the knot that entangles you.”

I: “I take the sword firmly in my hand. I lift it for the blow.”

The Cabiri: “We also place you before you the devilish, skillfully twined knot that locks and seals you. Strike, only sharpness will cut through it.”

I: ""Let me see it, the great knot, all wound round! Truly a masterpiece of inscrutable nature, a wily natural tangle of roots grown through one another! Only Mother Nature, the blind weaver, could work such a tangle! A great snarled ball and a thousand small knots, all artfully tied, intertwined, truly, a human brain! Am I seeing straight? What did you do? You set my brain before me! Did you give me a sword so that its flashing sharpness slices through my brain? What were you thinking of?""

The Cabiri: “The womb of nature wove the brain, the womb of the earth gave the iron. So the Mother gave you both: entanglement and severing.”

I: “Mysterious! Do you really want to make me the executioner of my own brain?”

The Cabiri: “It befits you as the master of the lower nature. Man is entangled in his brain and the sword is given to him to cut through the entanglement.”

I: “What entanglement do you speak of?”

The Cabiri: “The entanglement is your madness, the sword is the overcoming of madness.”

1327922956.0,62,self.tryptonaut,p2wbu,A very simple and easy to follow Ayahuasca brewing technique,64,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/p2wbu/a_very_simple_and_easy_to_follow_ayahuasca/,"**Things needed:**

*For 1 dose of ayahuasca* 

* 5-10 grams of Mimosa Hostilis root bark 
* 2 - 5 grams of Syrian Rue seed matter 
* 1 empty tea bags, or 1 empty zip lock bags.
* 1 stainless steel or ceramic pots, no aluminum.
* Vinegar 
* empty gel capsules

**How it’s done:**

**Step 1** 
The mimosa hostilis root bark is pulverized and shredded into a stringy/powdery consistency, the finer the root bark the better. 
This is done by either using a coffee grinder, or using a blender, or just twisted and shredded by hand works too.
If you are brewing for multiple people it is not necessary to brew the rootbark across individual pots, just throw it all into one and pour out the liquid at the end into separate containers accordingly.

**Step 2**
The stainless steel pot is then filled with roughly about 400ml of water and 4 tablespoons of vinegar. The root bark should be submerged into the water and brought to a slow simmer, not boiled, (the lowest setting on the cooker should be used for this) excessive heat will destroy alkaloids.

Once most of the water in the pot has evaporated, more water can be added 2 or 3 or more times to continue the brewing process as the longer it brews the more potent the ayahuasca will be This is optional but recommended, If there is no time to do this at least twice the amount of root bark will need to be added to achieve a similar dosage.

**Step 3**
Before the water has simmered down to about ¾ of the way down, the root bark should be taken out of the water and left to cool. Once the root bark has cooled down enough, the liquid should be squeezed out of the root bark back in to the pot and the root bark should be discarded of. The water is then further evaporated and what should be left is a small amount of a purple/brown coloured liquid enough to fill a shot glass. Before pouring the liquid out of the pot, egg whites should be added to help eradicate the purge, they will soak up the tannins but not the DMT. The egg whites should then be sieved out of the water once they have hardened and solidified , this step will reduce nausea in leaps and bounds and will chance the Ayahuasca from the consistency of a foul sludge to the consistency of milk.  

**Step 4 ** 
Syrian rue seed matter can be prepared in the same way as the root bark if preferred but the easiest way to prepare Syrian rue is to simply stuff it into empty gel capsules.
If the gel cap technique is used, only 1 gram of Syrian rue is needed and not 2g, or the seeds can simply just be washed down with some fruit juice and swallowed.

**Step 5**
This takes practice.

**Dosage onset and Duration:**
*Threshold:* 5g 
*Light:* 5 – 7g
*Moderate:* 7 – 10g
*Strong:* 10g +
(Dosage for the mimosa hostilis root bark)

*Onset:* 20 minutes – 4 hours 
*Duration:* 2 – 6 hours 
*Normal After Effects:* up to 8 hours

**Consumption**
The Syrian rue, needs to be taken 15 minutes before the root bark if swallowed in liquid form, if the Syrian rue is consumed in gel cap form (the easier route of administration) then it needs to be taken roughly 20-30 minutes before the root bark.

**Precautions**
Syrian rue is an RIMA meaning dietary restrictions can be largely ignored as syrian rue does not contain an MIAO, although it is advisable not to consume large quantities of alcohol or tyramine containing foods. 
Although RIMAs are generally safer than MAOIs, they still have highly dangerous interactions when combined with almost any antidepressant or stimulant, as it can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis.
If one were to consume ayahuasca, they would need to start off with a low dose, and work their way up in small increments.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,True,,flairredfractal,True,t3_p2wbu,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/p2wbu/a_very_simple_and_easy_to_follow_ayahuasca/,

1367948295.0,57,self.tryptonaut,1dvgvb,Things I've learned from the psychedelic experience:,64,7,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1dvgvb/things_ive_learned_from_the_psychedelic_experience/,"* Regarding the psychedelic experience itself, there is nothing to learn beyond what's already contained within you

* This moment of existence is so important if for no other reason that everything is presently stable and one can relax and soak it all in, in relative peace.  Your only objective is to experience and perceive reality as it presently is, in as many ways as you feel comfortable experiencing.
 
* It's okay to stop listening to music sometimes.  

* It's okay to listen to music when it would seem 'inappropriate' to (like in a beautiful natural wonder, outside in general)

* Input:Output.  If you want to get more from your input, you need to generate output.  If you want more output, you need to increase input.

* Marijuana isn't really meant to get 'fucked up' on.  It's just to help you relax / provide fresh perspective.

* Sitting indian-style with your head tilted naturally towards the sun at high noon tends to lead to temporary nirvana

* Nirvana is a fleeting state that must always be fought for to maintain.  it comes and goes and maybe even sticks around if you want it to.

* While our brains are programmed to depression, autism, etc, you can totally deprogram yourself despite what academia and logic may suggest, but it's very difficult to do.  Mind &gt; Matter.

* Every moment, every song, every film, every interaction -- everything is potentially psychedelic if you are open to it and 'stereotypically psychedelic culture', if anything, is limiting many from really breaking through to some radical new opinions (i.e. until you see where waka flocka flame, the beatles and beethoven are all coming from, you still have a lot to learn)

* Nothing is so good that it is above you.  All culture is ultimately guidance.  High-end culture, pragmatically, functions the same as 'low-end culture'.  Everything has its place.

* To change behavior, set up an obstacle.  Don't focus on changing the behavior, just make it harder to perform the behavior.  Use human laziness to work WITH you.  The larger the obstacle, the faster the behavior will change -- but even small obstacles will, over time, be too cumbersome to continously overcome.  (example of small obstacle -- feeling guilt)

* Give up Fast Food.  Try to eat fruits and vegetables when-ever possible and you'll naturally start to eat healthier.

* Everything living around you feels as real as you feel -- this includes insects and animals and people alike.

* We all tap into the same place for information and the notion that some people can 'claim' they 'discovered' this information first is absurd.  Innovation comes in waves because it's only ever one source anyone is pulling from.

* In my opinion, psychedelics should be done sparingly (to me, this is no more than bi-yearly/tri-yearly -- ideally once a year).

* No one, anywhere, REALLY knows what they are doing.

* To have true balance it can be necessary to engage in self-indulgence, especially if it's never been under-gone.  To keep yourself on track, you sometimes need to throw yourself off, just to see if you can still remember how to get back on.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,1367948822.0,,cubensis,True,t3_1dvgvb,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1dvgvb/things_ive_learned_from_the_psychedelic_experience/,

I've gone through literally thousands of visuals for milkdrop2 and have hand selected what I considered to be the cream of the crop.

Most of these are ones that did not come default with Winamp, so expect a new experience!

Meeting another being who approached &amp; welcomed me with some sort of ritual.",49,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/udejg/its_ok_welcome_my_first_dmt_experience/,"“It's OK, Welcome!”
==================
TL;DR First time Smoking DMT. Found doorway &amp; had to choose whether to enter. I did. Broke through. It took me to meet another ""being"" (description below). One of them approached me &amp; draped ""rose petals of energy"" across me &amp; clearly said ""It's OK, Welcome."" It was beautiful!

The search was over, the countdown had begun. After a long 6 months of research, search &amp; failed extractions from native Acacia Maidenii trees I eventually ""stumbled"" into a .5g bag of crystalized DMT, a crystal/wax type substance with a yellow tinge. After excitedly making a ""half decent"" bulb vape my friend arrived. We sit on the floor surrounded by cushions to ensure everything is comfortable, the ambient music of Shpongle plays softly in the background while we carefully weigh two 50-60mg doses and loaded one into the vape. We were all set, the time had come for our maiden voyage - destination unknown!

We spend a few minutes meditating, calming our minds is difficult with such great unknowns only minutes away - very slowly we vape the DMT ensuring not to burn any of it. The vapour eventually fills the bulb, I'm up first &amp; although I am as ready as any first time DMT user can be nothing could prepare the psyche for the experience that was about to come. As the tube hits my mouth I take a massive ""free dive sized breath"" (BIG) &amp; hold it for 10-15 seconds, upon breathing out I begin to hear a high pitched humming, by the time I'm halfway through my second toke reality is fractalizing away into complex patterns &amp; bright colours. I can't see the vape through all these colors but as requested my friend puts the tube in my mouth &amp; encourages a final breath, I take a small 3rd hit and quickly fall into what looked to him like a trance state. Things get very intense from here on but I will do my best to explain what followed.

The start of the trip is hardest to explain. The come on is so quick and intense that I didn't have much time to take in what was happening, it was all so fast but I remember a high pitched hum becoming clearer, closer &amp; louder while I felt like I was being ripped through a dark but colourful tunnel at what can only be described as close to the speed of light. I was mentally just trying to hold the fuck on while at the same time knowing that I had to let go, I eventually did ""let go"" and almost immediately I was ""dropped"" into another ""level"" &amp; the humming stopped. 

My consciousness was dumped in front of a large glowing arch which opened into another tunnel. There was nothing else at this level no colors, no fractals, just a large arched doorway glowing purple. It was made very clear to me that I had a choice to make and more importantly it was made clear to me that this was my choice to make, that nobody else could make this choice for me nor would it be forced upon me. It was a very calming, relaxing &amp; a probably rare feeling of control over this crazy new DMT world. The choice I was presented with was simple. I could either pass through the doorway to ""the other side"" or I could stay here &amp; play in the colours before returning home. Almost instinctively I began to turn away from the purple doorway but gladly had a feeling that this isn't right, that I should be going through the door. As soon as this thought crossed my mind I was immediately pulled into the doorway &amp; began another light speed ascent into the unknown.

This is where things get really weird. I am again ""dropped"" into a new world, a world filled with beautiful bright waves of energy &amp; light. The lines were mostly straight &amp; looked like they had been quickly drawn on with a bright pen, the background was like a brightly coloured sketch book. I had the feeling that I was in a room or some sort of enclosed space, it was not a huge opened space &amp; the sketched lines seemed to keep things ""enclosed"". I could make out what seemed almost like a table in the ""corner of the room"" - it was almost like I had entered someone house, I could feel a strong presence that someone was home. Once I began to look around I could vaguely see other ""beings"" across the room, they didn't pay much attention to me at first but soon a “female being"" came forward and approached me, she was indescribably beautiful. She had a very oblong head shape but no face or internal components – just the beautiful &amp; well defined outline of her body with 2 legs &amp; 2 arms. She was almost 2D, I couldn't see much depth to her &amp; everything was frontal view even though she moved through the room &amp; turned multiple times she seemed to have no back or sides that I could make out. Her body was like a ""rainbow aura"", like someone had traced the outline of her body with a bright greeny blue colour and then traced inside the trace lines with other bright colours. I clearly remember that she had 2 bright red things on her head that looked like ""rose petals of energy"" (for a poor description). I keep referring to ""her"" because her body was like a females except I can't recall there being any outlines around the breast area just a curvy waist &amp; very feminine feeling presence, She was pure love &amp; acceptance. If I was an artist I could very clearly draw the being I seen - this is the only thing that has ever tempted me to try painting.

She smiled at me for a minute and approached closer &amp; closer until she was standing, towering above me, looking down from above &amp; always smiling. While towering over me I'm not sure if she took the ""red things"" off her head or if she ""found new ones"" but had 1 “red rose of energy” in each hand and draped these ""rose petals of energy"" across my body 2 times while very clearly saying ""It's ok, Welcome!"". After she had finished her little ""welcoming ceremony"", she smiled warmly at me &amp; slowly began to leave the room. I didn't want her to leave &amp; asked her to come back. She did turn around and acknowledged my request but only very briefly as she gave me one last mischievous smile &amp; departed for the final time.

The trip was mostly over now. I kept my eyes closed for what must have been another 10 minutes. At first, hoping that if I kept my eyes closed perhaps she would return, perhaps even I could return to wherever this magical place might have been &amp; perhaps we would meet again in distant travels through consciousness. I was also meditating on just how beautiful &amp; touching this experience was. I came out of my voyage laughing and crying at the same time – it was the most overwhelming feeling of beauty imaginable.

The weirdest part of this experience is that you are completely sane through the entire trip, your thinking clearly &amp; don't have any extreme euphoria until after the trip has finished. While it is happening it is like your brain is cleaned for the first time. Very clear. Very non-synthetic. Very deep. Very much a life changing experience.

All glory to the hypnotoad (fixed)",48,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/sm93j/best_most_inspirational_and_thought_provoking/,"This is a fairly long report, it's mainly a trip report but I have also included my theories and ideas about the metaphysical implications of the experience. I plan to expand on those thoughts with future experiences, so I'd like to keep this thread as a sort of electronic journal for my consciousness expansion.

I know some of you have already had these same experiences and ideas so there's nothing new here, but for me this is all just so new and exciting that I have to unload them somewhere. And just to say, I don't consider any of the theories below as fact, they're just my personal opinions and observations on the nature of the universe. Mainly this is just a journal for myself, but if someone else happens to find it interesting then that's a bonus. I'll also try to attach some of my primitive illustrations for both the trip visuals and the metaphysical ideas, so this won't be just a boring pile of text.

Experience Entry #1 2.3.2012

Dose/Preparation: 12 g Mimosa Hostilis root bark (powdered) was lightly boiled during 3 hours in acidic water, after each hour straining the liquid through a cloth. The 3 liquids were then combined. The same was done with 4 g Syrian Rue seeds (powdered). The MHRB liquid was then boiled with egg whites to remove most of the tannins (to minimize nausea).

Set &amp; Setting: The S&amp;S was probably the most perfect I could ever achieve. During the day I didn't eat anything and I cleaned my whole apartment, did the laundry and the dishes. Did some workout and took a long nice shower after that. I felt really good and clean, both physically and mentally. When the evening came, I turned off all lights and lit up an incense stick and some candles around my bed. I was ready to leave this world.

Ingestion: The Syrian Rue liquid was taken first, with the MHRB liquid taken slowly during the next 15 minutes. While the taste and texture wasn't something I would call nice, it certainly wasn't bad either, probably due to knowing what to expect.

The Beginning of the Journey: (Insanity, Entities, Death)

For about an hour I just lay in my bed, getting calm and comfortable, and thinking about what kinds of things I should expect from the experience. It was about a year since I had my last one with ayahuasca, so the memories were all hazy. I've smoked DMT a few times recently though, but in my experience it's kinda different, and a bit too short to get any real insight from. So at the end of the hour there was this sort of calming and mystical feeling of all my motor and visual functions, I assumed this to be the Syrian Rue at play. After the hour things started to get a bit weird and my thoughts with them. There was some kind of an anxious phase at this point, and I started to think whether this was a good idea after all, maybe it's gonna be too intense, maybe I'm not prepared enough, maybe this, maybe that.

After a while I just came to the conclusion what the hell, it's too late to back down now, let's just go with it. Luckily there was absolutely no nausea (and didn't have during the whole trip). I turned on my side and started to analyze what I was feeling. The easiest way to describe it is, it feels like you're going insane. First your train of thought starts to break down, then the sentences start to get messed up, then the words themselves start to become gibberish. Finally your thoughts seem something like this: ""Fzgprrq nbqz... B&amp;fstw fds£hgg?? Z#pr@&amp;w!!!!"", while at the same time there's some really WEIRD imagery flashing before your eyes with a fast pace. In a way it's like you're unlearning everything you've ever learned, so you're like a baby who hasn't learned any languages or anything yet.

The next part, ego disintegration, is always really scary for me because I start to hear some really loud noises and the overall mood becomes very, very sinister. The loud noises are hard to describe, they're not actual sounds and they're different each time, but it's like really loud bangs, and each of them disintegrate a part of your ego and body and apartment. You can actually FEEL the concept of ""death"" in each bang. Even if you can't think in languages anymore, you have a primitive form of thoughts that feels a bit like this: "" BANG Aaaaah shit!! Oh shit.. I can't take it anymore.. I don't wanna die.... When is the next bang gonna come.. When is it gonnaaa comeeee.... ... ... Oh, I guess it's not-- BANG AAAAHHHhhhh!!!"".

The frequency of the bangs also increases with time, so eventually you just stop resisting and give into it. There's also some beings with you at this phase and they're in a way trying to help you get through , but also they're making fun of you for being such a pussy. It's a really weird mixture of feelings you get from these entities. You see images like where the entities are putting a noose around your neck and then they start to pull on the other end of the rope to get you higher and higher into ""somewhere"". And they all seem really happy about this and look at you in a way that says: ""Don't worry you'll die soon, then you can join us. Just hang in there you big baby!"". I think the reason why it seems like a confusing feeling is that we're not used to thinking about death as something positive. But after it's over it becomes so clear to you that death is one of the most positive forces in the universe.

At this point things become really hard to explain or remember, because you're dead and you don't reside in any physical form anymore, you're just pure floating consciousness. In my all previous experiences something like this happened but I don't remember much about it. My ego would then just slowly start to get back together and I would have a really intense trip with more entities and snake-like ",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,,True,t3_sm93j,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/sm93j/best_most_inspirational_and_thought_provoking/,

Please discuss. ,46,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/10ivfv/syrian_rue_smoked_dmt_on_the_come_down_from_6/,"I'm largely non-theistic in nature but last weekend I had my word rocked. I bought some capped syrian rue from a vendor there and usued my personal stash of dmt for blast off. I didn't feel anything after the first 3 hits, so i hit it a few more times so as not to waste the MAOIS. Then i felt it. All of it. Way too much. But it wasn't too much. It was the most euphoria and rushing and clear headedness i had ever experienced and i felt overcome with happiness exactly like the mundane spirits in Buddhism. About 2 hours later I saw a strange caravan of elaborately dressed party-goers...only they disappeared after a few minutes of observation and led me into the forest back a path. There were 2 ""drivers"" walking next to some bizairre cow-beasts followed by about 6 forest sprites around 4ft tall wearing gorgeous clothing. There's more that I've tried for 10 minutes to put into words, but impossible geometry is hard to describe. I saw several hallucinations up to this point, but every one of these had a presence just like DMT elves or you and I. 
My friend was concerned that I was going to hurt myself so he made me wait while he grabbed his coat to come with me. I approached where i could see the burning boars head from the front of the caravan in the woods and walked in on a strange ritual that disappeared when my tripsitter approached and morphed back into trees and a low burning campfire. I had lost them. 

After some time of looking around (had climbed the whole mountain the day before so I knew how huge the area was) i couldnt find them and decided to go give purging a shot as the nausea grew. I walked up a different part of the hill past a large ornate black gate...that turned into thorns when i touched it and walked up a hill to a beautiful marble bench that was actually a fallen log. About this time I began losing my mind. Every 5-10 minute or so i would lapse into a state of total unreality where i could see things pouring out of the forest after me. some on war-horses, some imps, some other mystical creatures that exist only in DMT hyperspace. They all seemed angry whereas the caravan was totally indifferent to my existence. After i got a little bit more of a grip, i had one of the sprites as in the caravan approach me and try to talk to me. She didn't say words but i could tell she was trying to talk to me and couldn't. Eventually she realized i was to dumb to hold conversation on her level and left. I felt absolutely crushed. the worst and most painful form of rejection one can feel. I started crying and the forest was back with a vengeance. I finally ended up dry-heaving my final dry-heave and had no more energy to keep throwing up. I rinsed my mouth out in a stream (didnt swallow because i'd just puke it back up) and walked back to the main stage and every shadow was a teenaged-mid20something humaniod entity chilling in the bushes. I was initially EXTREMELY embarrassed for having lost my shit and chanting and all that infront of them, so i quickened my pace and ran into the gate that was previously thorns. I swung it open (it is NOW a gate...it wasn't the next day when I revisited) and brushed bast it only to be stopped by a limb trying to trip me and a big long pointy thorn at my neck. I had clearly overstayed my welcome. 

I saw more things including other caravans, dancers that periodically shifted through space and time to end up on other sides of the forest.  I just need some help talking through it. One of my friends who tried it with me spoke with a 7 year old version of his self, but no one else in my party thought that what I saw was real. Which would be easy to accept if all the hallucinations were alike. But some of them were speaking to one another, some had presence and they interacted with me. 

I wish i could recall ALL of my experience. I could probably answer questions if you had any, but i'd like to have someone assist me in speaking through this.

Colors flickers and bend, geometric patters morph by predetermined twists of your hand; infinite amount of parallel words spawn before your eyes as they follow through and through the looking glass of your own life.

Shapes form, fractals conjoin and strike each other in an aesthetic pulp of glitter and bright serrated shards, spinning, shaving lines; stars and stripes of lesser known variants.  Quadrants collide and equally divide with a total loss of identity, yet remaining the same, fresh smorgasbords of prisms of spatial deformity. Miscellaneous homogeneous landscapes spanning eras of time, one forgetting the other. Lights shines around the corners, leaking in from the hazed backing of sight, a murky reminder of an alternative world waiting on the other side. 

Tangible swirls of uniform color fades as shapes cascade against each other, compiling across a transverse beam of white; empty and pure, like frost surrendering to spring. Symmetrical structures of active design rise, motion weld in occurrence. Limbs sprawl and grab at the edges of the universe, tugging at the fabric of reality, nevertheless trapped by the boundaries of limit.

People bash to and fro as they swarm from assorted clusters of buildings and domiciles, passing and reverting back into each other without resistance. Polycephic Paleozoic creatures with a sixth sense of connectivity, conducting reflective actions and trivial pursuits. The glazed reality of the kaleidoscope mirrors the world outside it. 

Individuality streams from seams of littered fabric as they are live and return to the tapestry of life. Live and breathe, if you believe these to be real things. Monitor your breath as your chest pumps oxygen into your lungs and cycles it throughout the organs of your body. Feel the blood rush to your heart and then back out. Feel your skin on your bones. Every part of these feelings are you, they are your existence. Not just your existence but everyone else's as a single homogenized lump of human clay. The person next to you, your parents, government officials, what makes their existence any different than yours. You are all part of the same inevitable reality of perception, spinning on a rock within a prism of the universe.

This leaves you to wonder, what is reality? What is your reality? Perhaps you are an idea floating on a thought of someone else's mind. Perhaps a dream on the periphery of a wide ocean of existence. Close your eyes for a moment and think about what's inside your own head. Darkness. A black void reliant on synapses and impulses. A motor box tightly humming to circuitry of your nervous system. A thready wisp of smoke inside the filament of your own soul. 

Leave the phantom hourglass that is life and see for yourself what lies in the parallel darkness.

Color interacts with surrounding light, altering the first color. Warm light from the sun, cool light from the sky, cordial reflected light bouncing off other objects; what you see may not be what you perceive. The nature of existence is reliant on the ability to perceive physical objects. All things and experiences are impermanent within your own conditioned phenomena.   

Everything is in a constant flux, constantly changing; coming into being and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. Your attachment to your reality is fleeting, which leaves you to the connection of your mind. Your mind is filled with bad abstraction. Tangents that go off into nowhere, bad habits of repeating yourself and deja vu. The locus of your being is the communicative event of the language that you use. What you feel, what you think and do comprise your own reality, yet the reality in your mind is formed by the mere awareness of conscious thought. Language shapes the thought process into questioning the inexhaustible meaning of being; you project self as your body, your hands, your legs, your eyes. These respective parts only physically comprise yourself due to your reliance on the fleshly realm. But what about the things that can't be seen that you know to be there? You know that electricity is real, anger, hatred, love, the wind – yet you can't see any of them. The ideas of space and time are constructed by man, so whats to say matter is just another facade of reality? You can reproduce matter on the television, even see it again in your mind. 

You're a product of genes and adopted stance. You are a idea-replicator producing itself in a new host. You are the traditional concern with the truth of ideas and beliefs. A tangible mass of protein strings. An out of body experience. A phantom in the shade.  

Tryptonauts, face the Memetic reversal of your very being, and plunge yourselves between the fibers of what is and isn't.

The ability to find contentment in experience and not material goods has directly influenced the direction of my life since beginning to use psychedelics. The possibility that religious doctrines all in some way focus on reforming the value system in order to gain enlightenment is also a concept that I have come to understand. In my experience religions often have this concept at their original beginning  but that later in the religions life this is usually buried under doctrine that is put in place to control the followers of that religion. For instance this can be seen in the Catholic church and how they restricted the coping of the Bible in any language other than latin to prevent the lower classes from being able to read the Bible themselves and thus allowing the church to create and impress its own value system on society at large.
The most useful property of entheogens (particularly psychedelics) is that they inhibit the ""cultural"" filter that is a natural development of the human psyche for survival in a larger society, this allows the user to contemplate their own value system and how it has been effected by the society which they live in. From this the creation of ones own value system in an mental state free from the ""cultural"" filter is possible and therefore becoming ""enlightened"" as to the true nature of happiness is possible.

Do you agree? How has your own value system changed since using entheogens? If so do you believe that you are better off after this experience?",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,weed,True,t3_wf4e0,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/wf4e0/how_have_entheogens_influenced_your_personal/,

1345448118.0,36,self.tryptonaut,yii9p,"Who likes multi-substance trip reports? 8 hits LSD, 100mg MDA, 3mg insufflated 2c-e",41,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/yii9p/who_likes_multisubstance_trip_reports_8_hits_lsd/,"I'll write a brief report and if people are interested, I'll elaborate in more depth. 

First off, I have been planning on abstaining from psychedelics for a cool amount of time so that my psychedelic tolerance would be absent and I could fully enjoy the potential of these substances. 

I dropped my first 2 hits of the LSD at 3:07pm. Didn't feel effects after 30 min. so I immediately ate 2 more and then waited until i finally felt something at 4:30. I decided that I wanted a more intense experience than I assumed I would have after feeling the come up of the current dose, so I doubled it to a total of 8 tabs by 4:45. The tabs were advertised as 125 ug but they were probably 75 or so. 

After I took my last doses, I knew I was in for a wild ride. I continued smoking some medical weed with my friends as i was blaring music on the home theater system. This was the real disorientation phase, where the visuals hadn't really pronounced themselves yet, but everything was trailing and seemed like there was a massive fog obscuring my vision at times. 

As time went on, I just continued to stay within the confines of my downstairs, which had access to a backyard patio. I'm from Northern California, and I'm lucky enough to have a really wonderful backyard filled with redwood trees, ferns and all sorts of lush greenery. The colors of things were so amazingly pronounced, and I, of course, felt a massive connection with them. They danced and moved as I stood in awe of the moving canvass in front of my eyes. The hallucinations had started and they were very lucid. 

That continued until around 10pm where the effects of the LSD were waning. I was still listening to music and smoking with my friends at the house, and as they prepared dinner (they were just relaxing on xanax and tripsitting), I decided it would be a good time to supplement my trip with 100mg of the finest MDA i've ever come across and bumps of 2C-E to ""taste"". If you have ever had experience with 2C-E insufflation, you know the onset is immediate. When I snorted this 2C-E under the influence of the acid tabs, it was so much more defined and prounounced. It turned my slow warbling fracal vision into a precise sharply tuned array of different moving fractals. 

Another hour passes and the MDA is kicking in and I feel my head come out of the extreme mind fuck of the acid and become more grounded, but with extremely hightened visual distortions. Tracers appearing at their own discretion would start in a pattern in my field of vision and make tiny slow motion lightning strikes leaving trails in my vision. I went outside for a quick puff of a cigarette and a joint, and after hitting both, I took a look at my cement floor. Amazingly intricate geometric patterns moving like cogs in a finely tuned watch. Everything morphed into another working cog in this mechanical geometric persian rug pattern, and it went on for hours, it was breath taking. Some designs would linger longer than others and become somewhat burned in my field of vision, only to fade away in a slow morph of neon colors. 

at around 1am my 2 friends bid me a farewell, but one stays a little later. This is where i felt I was coming down slightly from the whole thing, but the visuals were still very intense if I took time to focus on the music being played. Towards this time of the trip i was playing an album by Liquid Stranger called The Intergalactic Slapstick. The bass was physically pleasing and at this point i was feeling the best. Things had settled down, the visuals had ramped up, and the music was sounding better than ever.

I kept listening to music and trying to keep my eyes open for the vivid OEV's i was receiving. At around 530am I realized it was time for sleep, and to call it a night. I relinquished myself to my bed, and it was like I hadn't slept in 5 years. My bed expanded into a padded cloud of comfort. The MDA's tactile enhancement mixed with the LSD is amazing. I kept moving my legs back and forth for the feeling of the soft sheets until I finally dozed off into a psychedelic sleep. 

The circumstances with some personal issues between friends was the only thing that made the experience slightly less than stellar, but I can look past that for the insight it gave me and the amazing visual show I received. It was probably the best overall total trip because it lasted a long time (I prefer longer trips) and was breathtakingly beautiful and insightful. 

Feel free to ask any questions about details in the trip. Hope you enjoyed the recollection of this awesome trip.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,,True,t3_yii9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/yii9p/who_likes_multisubstance_trip_reports_8_hits_lsd/,

Aliens!

It started when I began to really appreciate psychedelics. Once I realised it wasn't all about rainbow slinkys and glow sticks (although these activities are essential sometimes) I started to prefer using nature for my trips. I was comfortable tripping by myself and would happily just chill in the back garden or anywhere where I know I'm unlikely to be disturbed. 

This one occasion I went on a break with my cousin (who is twice my age and has done his share of trips) who has a little caravan by the beach. It was getting dark but I was still keen to stay up where as my cousin was ready for sleep. I dropped some mushrooms (not loads) and went down to the beach. I just lay there and listened to the sea going backwards and forwards while staring at a full canopy of stars. There was some large palm-like trees just behind me and I could see their leaves above me if I looked back. 

It was one of the nicest little trips I had and as I listened to the rolling sea and rattling leaves above my head while watching the stars I was in massive awe of all the beauty surrounding me. I watched the sky and from nowhere this orange orb slowly went across the sky. If I had held a cent out at arms reach, it would have been a similar size. It seemed to wobble from side to side as glided over me out to sea. It disappeared for a bit and then re appeared further along its trajectory before suddenly flashing and dispersing. I've let off and seen loads of lanterns before so I know it wasn't that. Nor a satellite... Whatever it was, it was big! 

About 2 weeks later I was back at my house with my friend and we decided to drop some acid. We lay on sun loungers as the sun went down and I reluctantly told him about seeing a UFO recently. It was met with a bit of an awkward silence and lack of interest so I left it at that and we continued chatting until we were tripping heavily. I lay there again, in complete awe of the millions of stars above me and watched them sway as if they were floating on water. From no where, two UFOs zig zagged in between each other right across the sky. We both jumped to our feet and were screaming and telling quite loud. My friend instantly said something like ""yo, it's f*cking UFOs"" (seriously) as we jumped around in disbelief. My friend is a massive sceptic with things like that (I didn't blame him) but that made it all more believable for me. Even after, under his breath, he still admits he saw something he has never seen before.


Nearly finished....

About a year or something after this I had another session at my house (with different friends). By then I was well in to the idea that aliens may exist and visit earth bla bla. We had some Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds but stayed inside since it was winter. It got to about 10am and everyone had crashed apart from me and one friend who was still 10 miles high and making some typical profound observations on dog the bounty hunter. I had stopped tripping and was only staying up to keep him company and keep any demons at bay. He eventually came down a bit and was comfortable going home, and off he went.

I woke up later that afternoon to missed calls and a txt from him saying he had just seen UFOs while sitting outside his house! I spoke to him later and he was convinced that while was talking a breather before going in to his house, he was looking at the clouds and a silver UFO darted across the sky. This guy was also a massive sceptic but is now obsessed with the link between aliens and hallucinogens. 

This is obviously terribly flawed since we are talking about seeing a phenomenon whilst hallucinating. However from being around sceptical people and witnessing them I feel strongly inclined to believe that what I have seen, was real. I also feel that these sightings were an acknowledgment to the heightened feeling of love for the earth, nature and the wonder that we are not alone.

Ayahuasca has a female spirit, and for some reason she likes to scare you a little near the beginning. But the medicine is unparalleled in western society. Unparalleled. Almost any medical treatment that ignores the aya is fundamentally incomplete.

It's like DMT mixed with MDMA x 100. You are super saiyan, you can fly, manipulate energy balls, and your hair stands on end. It's as if dbz prepared us for this, but some part of me thinks this is possible without any aya. Every part of your being is saying yes yes yes THIS IS IT.

I stared at it for a while, but suddenly it began to eat the sky and I went inside to tell/show my husband. I didn't get to show him, because he found my heart was beating way too fast (I have mitral valve prolapse), so he was worried and worked on getting it to slow down. He hugged me, and I closed my eyes and matched my breathing to his. With my eyes closed I didn't see ""simple"" geometric shapes any longer. I was seeing plants grow, flowers bloom and snakes spiraling. It was very beautiful. I felt like a plant, and I couldn't eat any strawberries that we had for the trip because I felt so connected to them.

We were able to break down all the constructs of our own minds to reach the elevated state and by doing so our responsibility became to awaken others. You can not tell another man to be happy, only show him the way to it. Sarcasm in its purist form can be effective. 

I speak from recent experiences. I use to just be the clown that made everybody laugh, but now when I see a person, I see their egos constructs and I jokingly take them apart bit by bit and, yes I may hurt their feelings, but that's all they are and that's what I make them see.

My best friend of 15 years was really jealous of my 4 gram mushroom so he decided to buy 3 for himself. We chopped them up and let them soak in lemon juice which was a first time for me and the come up was the most intense i've ever felt. I had about enough time to fill my 4 foot volcano bag before it came on. My roommate (who wasn't tripping) put on this crazy music, dubstep i think is what the kids call it. I'm not too fond of it especially while tripping so it threw me off but also gave me the most intense visuals that i could feel running through body in sections. I looked down at my chest and it was split into dimensions and between those dimensions i could see and feel visuals running through me and all working together like clockwork. At this point I knew it was time to get away from the loud music and lay on my hammock. It was about 30 minutes until sunset so we just watched the sky waiting for darkness. Every little thing about that day made me feel so connected with the earth, the universe, and all of the love life has to give. My trip partner and I also couldn't get over the fact that there was no way to explain the feelings we were having and that language is the only way of communicating our true feelings inside and it can never come close to experiencing something first hand. It was such a refreshing trip and I learned a lot from it. Although it did end with a breaker box on a telephone pole in my backyard shorting out and throwing sparks everywhere. I never thought i would call 911 while tripping on mushrooms but there's a first time for everything!

1351380338.0,31,self.tryptonaut,1270q1,All my trips are preparing me for something.... (salvia/lsd),34,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1270q1/all_my_trips_are_preparing_me_for_something/,"This might not make sense. Or it might, don't know..don't care. I just need to get this the fuck out, seriously.

I just smoked salvia and I am now requainted with that peice of information I've felt I've been looking for over the last few days. Everytime I trip- it is the same thing. A story, a loop. Any form of noise- music, thuds,cars,etc, is something communicating with me and my thoughts. It tells me truths about my life. It has told me in my human form I am going to die soon and that it has to happen because it has to happen.

My first 'learning' trip was a while back, I dropped 2 tabs of LSD with my boyfriend and his friend. That trip taught me the basic fundamentals about oneness and the universe and the point of rebirth and death. That trip was so intense, I felt strongly my boyfriend and his friend tripping with me..hearing and seeing what I was. It felt so..real..but of course afterwards, the words ""just drugs"" are thrown around and the experience is brushed away and forgotten. 

The next time I tripped, it was the same cycle that started off all over again. Teaching me and telling me things...a continuation of the previous trip. 

Every trip has been like this. A continuation... telling me all the knowledge as if to prepare me for something.

The last time I did LSD was a month or so ago.  I felt like I was dying, ascending..whatever. I was explained death. How, the moment you die is when reality slaps you in the face. This life is a big joke. I felt like I was ascending, trying to burst through that other side of light, but something went wrong and the process didn't complete. I felt like half my body was droopy...I felt half decomposed or something... I felt stuck in two different dimensions. I was told that this might not work and we'll just have to try again next time. ... I was so confused. Try what?

My boyfriend and I planned to do LSD together two days from now; and meditate, go for a walk, reconnect with the earth, etc, but today I just suddenly decided I wanted to smoke Salvia.
And now I remember again. I feel like me smoking that hit was a warning, or an insight to prepare me for what will happen if I do LSD again.

I smoked salvia, a song was playing, and suddenly a FAMILIAR realization came over my entire being. and there was a tingly sensation in my right shoulder/collarbone area (where I felt and looked decomposed last time I was on acid)There was no talking or teaching this time, it was simply a 'lets get down to business' feeling. I was asked where my boyfriend was.  I felt like me but NOT me, like an awake me, like an ""oh shit..right- this."" sort of feeling. I became pissed off and mad, and the first thing that came into my head was 'I am not dying- this is NOT happening' and I shook everything off, I shook the 'high' off, and went and cleaned my bong and came to write this.

It had been a long time. I was honestly considering just crashing my car somewhere when a friend/dealer/roommate suggested shrooms to me (she had a whole jar full and wanted a trip buddy). I said ""Sure, why not?"", knowing full well from various sites that you're not supposed to partake of them with preexisting psychological problems.

(6:00 PM) I only took about 2.0 grams (a little over half an 1/8) and discovered that I also was very sensitive to them. I ground the 2.0 grams of dried mushrooms up and mixed them with a drink and downed the whole drink at once(6:00 pm)and then waited for the visuals. I never got nauseated or anything, but my skin was little cold.

(6:30 PM) It started just with seeing halos of light around the ceiling lights, and within the hour I was fully tripping out.

(6:45 PM) For the first time in a decade I felt truly happy. Everything was okay, my worries were still there but I was free of them. I felt like a bird stretching it's wings, like instead of being a fuck-up I could do anything. I suppose this was the euphoria.

It was, in a few words, transformative and amazing.

I understood all of my problems and was able to discard them, and I felt clear-headed about the world for the first time in my life.

(7:00 PM) I saw mild hallucinations as well as the normal patterns (patterns forming people looming over me, eight feet tall made out of matrix-like blue shimmery code, but I wasn't scared because I knew they weren't malicious. I tried talking to them but they loomed and almost invisibly drifted about the apartment). This may be that I have always had an active imagination and vivid dreams and was seeing things inside the normal shroom visuals. My roomie was a little annoyed at how strong my trip was compared to her 'normal' one.

The walls and the ceiling were breathing but if I made myself focus on them they turned into rolling dunes of sand and I would lose time watching a desert landscape shifting like on fast-forward. 

(7:30 PM) I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror (again against advice, I know!) and there were black patterns on my face like tattoos and white, delicate lace writhing up and down my legs and arms and chest. It was beautiful.

The bathroom curtain patterns turned into people trapped in the black swirls, tiny naked faceless bodies reaching out for me in supplication like an old renaissance facade of Hell. I'll tell you again that none of this was scary, it was happy and amazing. My roommate had taken the same amount of the same batch and only saw basic shroom visuals.

(7:40 PM) I took a bubble bath because it sounded amazing and lost time watching the bubbles swirl and slither up my arms and legs and breasts. None of this was scary, I was grinning the whole time (Damn you sci fi novels!).

(8:30 PM) I got out some fabric paint (we had a sheet hung up on the wall as a sort of group art project) and went to work, and the paint began melting and swirling around my fingers exactly like that scene in ""The Pagemaster"" It was so incredibly cool. It melted in the directions of my brush strokes like it was alive.

(9:00 PM) As I was winding down I just lounged naked (lace patterns on my skin!) in my computer chair, watching a dandelion dance on my screensaver. I glanced up and thought about trying to focus beyond the walls, maybe exert more control over the visuals rather than get lost in them.

After a few tries, the walls shifted and became slightly transparent. I glanced up and there was a transparent dark vine/tentacle thing wrapped thickly around my ceiling fan and hanging down, swaying. In the distance, through the walls I could see hulking tentacle creatures reaching up to the sky, all made of advanced machinery and coexisting with life outside. It was all very ""War of the Worlds"" or something. 

(10:40 PM) I hoped the vision wouldn't fade but eventually it did and I was left with a few basic patterns before I eventually fell asleep at the end of the trip. I woke up the next morning feeling well-rested with no negative effects.

Overall it was an extremely positive experience for me, doubly so for where I was mentally at that time.

My friend guided me through some meditation. He knew not where he lead but started talking. I wasn't really listening to his words but rather formed this picture in head. I could see the big bang and could see all the events in time that lead to this moment. I could see the earth being formed and life starting on it. I could see the millions of years of evolution that formed life. I could see animals and early humans growing in harmony and with that I could see magic mushrooms also growing in harmony even potentially helping these apes grow into conscience beings. I could see all the events that had to take place to get my body and spirit to this point in time and space. Then all the sudden I could see all the connections at once. I could see that my body was only a piece of this universe and a way for it to know itself. I felt a pulling as the veil was lifted and I was it. I was the universe experience itself. I was the universal consensus without time or form but was just everything all at once. It saw god and it was myself. It was pure love and beauty and also very bright.


The knowing only happened for a moment in normal reality but I yelled with joy and laughed out loud. I knew and it was funny. Cosmetically funny because I realized I was always this and some part of me knew but the part that is me had forgotten. The feeling of joy was overwhelming and I smiled and knew.


After shouting at joy about knowing enlightenment I could already see the ego coming back and that experience happening in the past. I was a little sad but realized I could go back and it was my turn to be the teacher. I started a guided meditation describing what I had seen the last time. This resulted in the divine knowing again which was just as amazing.


I need to meditation more in my daily life because I don't want to forget. The part of me that I think is me down't know the truth.

There is a lot of information in this post.",30,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/xqbcu/the_paradigm_shift_is_occurring_and_we_are_the/,"FYI: I wrote this for r/psychonaut, but am posting it here first. I assume most of y'all are familiar with the information in this post already :)

I don’t know where to begin, so I’ll start with something [scientific](http://www.frontiersin.org/Fractal_Physiology/10.3389/fphys.2012.00094/full)

Here are some of the main highlights:

&gt;“Life is a self-organizing, self-regulating, self-reproducing, interconnected, open thermodynamic network of component parts existing in a complex regime in the phase transition between order and chaos as a plant, animal, microbe or fungus.”

&gt;I have argued that network phenomena are at the heart of several if not all major transitions of life. While the specifics differ, the essence may be similar: the components of a network gradually approach a critical level. When the critical point is reached, a phase transition brings about a sudden and substantial increase in complexity which corresponds to a new level of structural organization. The increased structural complexity in turn enables one or more novel functions for the organism not apparent before the transition. If such a transition increases the fitness of an individual in its niche, natural selection will spread it through the population.

&gt;If each transition mounts a barrier to reversing itself, then there is an irreversible increase in biological complexity providing a sense of arrow of time in biology. What is the relation of this arrow of time to the physical arrow of time? Except for Prigogine (Prigogine, 1997), most physicists hold that there is no arrow of time and at the fundamental level, time is reversible. However, non-biological chemical reaction networks can be sensitive to the direction of time too (Ricard, 2010). Is it then possible that the macroscopic arrow of time that pervades human experience is related to irreversibility associated with network behavior?

&gt;What is the expected impact of a new transition, biological or other, on human society? It is evident that even over the short time period of human evolution, various new networks have emerged and transitions occurred. A recent and perhaps most revolutionizing network in terms of human experience is the internet. As the complexity of the internet increases, is it possible to live through a phase transition such that the internet acquires some form of intelligence or consciousness, a possibility already raised by Barabási (2002)? ~~Also, consciousness is certainly an emergent phenomenon arising from the neural network connectivity of the brain.~~ Could the human species undergo yet another phase transition?

&gt;Evolutionary changes sometimes occur via symbiosis, a crash of two complex networks. If following the crash, new links form between the two networks such that the flow of information and/or material between them provides selective advantages, a new organism with unexpected potentials emerges. A salient example is the symbiotic development of the eukaryotic cell by the fusion of different bacteria. Since eventually the eukaryotic cells were able to spread through the world, we might wonder whether fusion of computers with humans or symbiosis of robotics, genetics and artificial intelligence can lead to the emergence of a new self-replicating species capable of evolution and spreading through the Earth and perhaps even replacing humanity.

This work is crucial because it supports many of the ideas presented by **Terence McKenna**. I have spent the last 4 years listening to the [psychedelic salon](http://www.matrixmasters.net/salon/). If you have not done so already, I highly recommend you check it out. 

Another must read for all psychonauts is [this essay](http://www.realitysandwich.com/physicalism_false_view_world) by **Peter Meyer**, the mathematician who helped Terence develop the timewave zero software.

Here are some of the highlights:

&gt;If, however, consciousness is a fundamental and irreducible quality of reality (so that a form of consciousness goes all the way down, even to molecules and atoms) then the existence of conscious beings such as ourselves is not a total mystery. But if a physicalist allows the possibility that physical reality is inherently conscious (which idea most physicalists would reject) then the way is open to the idea that there is some reality beyond physical reality (that is, beyond the existence of atoms, subatomic particles and electromagnetic radiation), and to move in this direction is to abandon physicalism.

&gt;Science is not incompatible with the spiritual view if by science is understood a quest for knowledge of what is real. If there is a non-physical reality then a true scientist will wish to know about it. Modern natural scientists often assume that physicalism is true, and thereby exclude the possibility of knowledge of a spiritual reality. Such natural scientists are thus not true scientists. A natural scientist may state that only physical reality is of interest to him, but he is not justified in claiming that science can properly concern itself only with physical reality. 

&gt;There are three positions which a philosopher can take with regard to hyperspace and the DMT entities: 
1.	Hyperspace is no more real than the space experienced in dreams, and the so-called entities within it are no more real than people experienced in dreams (regarded as merely subjective mental phenomena). 
2.	Hyperspace is real and is not part of physical space; thus its inhabitants are non-physical. 
3.	Hyperspace is real and is fundamentally of the same stuff as the physical world; both are physical but are experienced in very different ways. 

&gt;Actually it is impossible for anyone who has not experienced Level III of the DMT experience to imagine it, however much they have read about it or talked to those who have had the experience. This level of the experience is of a nature which is radically different from everyday experience, dream experience and even most other psychedelic experience (having taken a few LSD trips does not enable one to imagine a full-on DMT experience). Thus no-one who has not experienced DMT hyperspace is qualified to say anything about it, except to discuss its philosophical implications based on the reports of those others who actually know what they are talking about.

&gt;Galileo pioneered the foundation of physics upon observation, and he developed an early form of the telescope to view the mountains of the Moon and the moons of Jupiter, whose existence was denied a priori by the Aristotelian philosophers of his time. In this dispute two of these philosophers, Cesare Cremonini and Giulio Libri, refused even to look through Galileo's telescope. Similarly, most if not all contemporary philosophers refuse to look through the lens provided by psychedelic substances so as to perceive a reality which physicalists deny exists (just as the philosophers of Galileo's time denied the existence of the moons of Jupiter). Observations resulting from the use of DMT absolutely refute the conventional physicalist view of the world, but at present this is known only by a relatively small number people - who are the true gnostics of this age.

Jung is also somebody who I would look into. Specifically his Red Book, which you can read in full [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/alexandria/comments/tm44o/cg_jung_the_red_book_67_books_as_grand_opening/) courtesy of [r/Alexandria](http://www.reddit.com/r/alexandria/?count=25&amp;after=t3_uvmcf). There is a gold-mine of untapped information within this book that has not been analyzed by scholars yet. Let’s get to work! I  also found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/alexandria/comments/tt5a6/the_kybalion_a_study_of_the_ancient_philosophy_of/) on r/Alexandria. I would highly recommend you check out this subreddit.

Somewhat related to Jung is a medium named [Bashar](http://bashar.org/). There is seriously some profound shit within his talks. Thank you to whoever posted this here. Whether or not he is actually a medium  is irrelevant, just listen to the content.

I'm looking for people who are enthusiastic and willing to participate in this type of philosophic discussion. It is our duty to analyze and expound upon these works. Please save these links, considering this post will be lost to reddit in a few days. Comment what you will, but I think we should take this discussion off of reddit. 
Does anybody have any suggestions?

I assumed my experience today would go much like my last experience on 25mg and so I spent time during the week creating a playlist of music that went on for several hours. This did come in handy for the come up. I also spent the day completing a large list of errands which upon completion I would treat myself to a much anticipated journey into...? I would also like to mention I intentionally did not eat after midnight and up to the time of ingesting which was around 4pm today. 

The come up was familiar. It's onset was quick. I had some idea of what was coming so instead of lying in my bed and waiting like before I casually went about my leisure activities. When I was clearly hallucinating I put on my playlist which started with The Allman Brothers *Jessica*. I found it to be not quite relaxing, but very trippy. In an attempt to go with the flow I refrained from changing the music even though I wasn't quite feeling this first track, the one I intentionally chose for the playlist thinking it would be great. This seemed a bit ironic as I was pelted by a rambling guitar. 

For whatever reason the first hour or so was ridiculously intense and not like I remembered it to be. Constant OEVs and CEVs. There were eyeballs. There were mouths with big white teeth, but they weren't sharp teeth. I have this one blanket that is really big and I got wound up in that for a while. It was so soft, warm, and safe. I wish I could describe what I saw when I closed my eyes because it was fantastic. It's almost too soon to be thinking about it, but I feel very compelled to write this report while it's still fresh. The last bits of my come up are hazy. I do remember going in and out of my room, on and off my bed, and all around inside and outside the home in pure tryptamine goodness. 

Here is where memories start to form and can recall actual events. I have a 20 minute track of The Dead's *Dark Star* which absolutely hit the spot. The entirety of that track was amazing and I was somewhat saddened by it ending and transitioning into Tool's *Forty Six &amp; 2*. Though it was this track that led me into one of the most in control psychedelic states I have experienced in some time. This is my third experience with 4-aco and it was about this time that I felt as if I had almost conquered it. I was in a blissful state of control and yet going with the flow. This is when I ""discovered"" my sunny backyard, clear blue sky, and all around wonderful nature of a late afternoon in June.

Outside was a wonderland of beauty. 4-aco and summer afternoons are like bread and butter. I found myself lying on the ground next to my pool beholding the blue sky and whips of clouds. It was magical. The majority of my psych experiences have been at night. This daytime trip was magnificent. I was silent for hours just watching the sky. This is where I felt the most irony as I had put together a playlist of all this music and I ended up experiencing so much more outside in silence, in nature. A cardinal perched on a branch and we met each others gaze. Watching a bird fly so high in the sky was incredibly uplifting. I felt so full of spirit. 

Bit by bit I started to experiment with the pool. A few fingers here, a leg there. Eventually I had on my swimsuit and dove right in. Of course it was just great. I posted up with my arms crossed on the edge of the pool right next to the grass where my dog lay in the sun smiling and enjoying life as a dog. Together we sat in silence and enjoyed the outdoors. Clouds rolled over and to the North thunder rumbled in the distance. The sunset was pure heaven. I would have watched it to the end were it not for the mosquitoes growing in number. I can't say enough about the sunset. I was beholden to it. Captivated by it. I was saddened to have to retreat inside. This is where my story ends.

Those marked with an asterisk are what I am somewhat unsure of.

This was originally posted to /r/conspiracy, and I was directed here by a user.

-----

As we inspect matter more and more closely, it appears to be both more reduced in tangible consistence, and more complex in form. Atom as a singular unit -&gt; nucleus and electrons many orders of magnitude smaller -&gt; quantum particles, smaller still, forming each proton neutron and electron. Etc.

There must be an observer.

That observer must be able to observe through matter, via some function or action or arrangement or type or state of matter - as we (for example) perceive each other through air.

Matter is energy; e=mc^2 .

The observer must be connected somehow to the world around it, else it would not receive any aspect of the energy being radiated.

-----

Is there such a thing as ""real"" agency?

We take it as given that the human body performs reactions to stimuli it is agitated by - that is, to energy it receives, energy it is affected by.

The brain holds more complex states than the body (*), and the brain reacts to stimuli which it receives from the body.

The brain also contains the experience of perception (*).

This experience of perception must be connected somehow to the brain containing it, else it would not receive any aspect of the energy being radiated.

Even if there are unknown additional forces, types of energy, etc. that affect the brain, the brain's internal exchanging of energy must be connected to the experience of perception, else that experience of perception could not be agitated to change.

The changing of energy, and the procession of waves of affectation, stimulates experience.

And it is perceived.

-----

The brain agitates the experience of perception by its energy.

And it also preserves its energy according to the laws of thermodynamics (*).

Meaning its energy is not disappeared by agitating perception.

Meaning its energy is either reflected, or absorbed and replaced by energetic emissions from some thing.

It cannot be merely reflected, else there could be no agitation of the experience of perception.

-----

Does perception perform reactions to the stimuli?

The phenomenon of order emerges from somewhere, something, or some process, else there could be no organisation of body, no cohesion of action and reaction in energy.

And it is perceived.

Order must be able to change, as patterns are formed and broken in the experience of perception.

The changing of energy, and the procession of waves of affectation, must be inexorably connected in some way to this phenomenon of order, else that order could not be agitated to change.

This changing of energy must therefore be connected to both the experience of perception and the phenomenon of order.

Meaning the experience of perception is affected by the phenomenon of order.

Meaning order in energy exists in tandem with its disorder and change.

Meaning order and disorder, pattern and change, are inexorably connected in some way.

Therefore, the experience of perception must be connected in some way to both the phenomenon of order, and the phenomenon of disorder and change.

Therefore, the experience of perception must be connected in some way to the changing of patterns and orders of energies that are experienced through/as perception.

Therefore, the experience of perception must produce affectation, else the changing energies in brain states would be mere reflection against the experience of perception, and so could not affect the experience of perception.

-----

Where does agitation and response come from?

Just as it comes from the body, and just as it comes from the brain,

it comes from you.

-----

Hydrogen is a colourless, odorless gas which, given enough time, turns into people.

The brain is the organ that named itself.

It is no accident that ""come"" is a synonym for orgasmic response.

How can we devise a language to describe the patterns seen on psychedelics?,27,2,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/185yqn/science_cannot_see_what_it_doesnt_have_the/,"I think if there was a language to describe various kinds of hallucinations, it would be much easier for people to describe their experiences with psychedelics. It is as if people only say that their experience was indescribable because they do not have the language to describe it.

I have also noticed that while on psychedelics, memory can act very odd. Like when you wake up from a dream and the memory of it fades so quickly. If we just had the right concepts and words to describe these experiences, I think are brains would do a much better job of retaining the information within these experiences.

My intuition says that this language must have some sort of extensive mathematical vocabulary included it in, but it also must expand on the math stuff in order to include stuff like emotions and sensations of different sorts.

I would guess that many of the visual patterns would be very related to the way the eyes and visual cortex works, but the emotional and sensation would be a tad more complicated.

TL;DR Started at the circus, sucked up into their house, met the children who were very playful &amp; was locked in a psychedelic media room for a show. /

It all begins on the couch at a mates place, we prepare for the trip with some mild meditation &amp; enjoy the relaxing psychedelic music in the background. I watch as he slowly waves the lighter below the bulb of 80-100mg DMT ensuring not to let it burn, we watch with anticipation as the white powder in the bottom begins to melt unto itself, the bubbles begin to form and the smoke slowly rises to eventually fill the bulb. I had already decided that I would encourage myself to remain in this world with my eyes open for as long as possible both to inhale as much as I physically could and also to see what this world looks like fractalized, although I quickly realized that keeping one’s eyes open after the second-third large exhalation is much easier said than done. By the time the third breath left my lungs &amp; although my eyes were wide open the entire room, the bulb &amp; my friends were merging &amp; reforming, shaking &amp; breaking in a mix of colorful patterns and fractals. One final large breath &amp; from here on there was no fighting it. It had begun, the moment my eyes &amp; mind slipped out of consciousness I had arrived and it was beautiful, the most beautiful circus you had ever seen... DiMiTry's Circus.

I was not here long but I remember it clearly. It was like the side alley of the circus filled with many interesting rides &amp; shows that I had no comprehension of, there was what seemed like a large blue roof with 4 legs towering &amp; moving above us but before having time to completely study my surroundings the legs of this large blue shed moved in towards me. It was not a shed, it was almost alive but slightly machine like, some sort of keeper, a protector or guard of sorts and as the legs collapsed in towards me I was scooped up in one giant hugging motion and sucked up ""inside itself"". I found myself in a house that was very ""normal"", considering. There were rooms &amp; each room had a purpose. I was first brought into what felt like a bathroom of sorts. It had a half height wall in the middle of the room and I could clearly see a few entities in this room, they all seemed to have giddy childlike demeanors &amp; were much smaller than the last entity I encountered in my first breakthrough (http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/udejg/its_ok_welcome_my_first_dmt_experience/).  

The eldest (but still very young) painted my face with a purple wand of sorts, it was all very precise and beautiful but felt like I was their new living doll of sorts - they were all very curious &amp; wanted to play but some of them were weary of my presence. One of the little ones purely watched from the side, giggling &amp; pointing occasionally as the ""main"" one painted my face. There was another little one that snuck out quickly from behind the half height wall and played with me intensely but very briefly before scurrying off to hide back behind the half height wall. Very funny this little guy, it was like he was scared but had built up the courage to play with me intensely for just a brief moment - poking, tickling &amp; laughing with a childlike giddiness before quickly running back to hide again. Like many small children do with new dogs. As I slowly began to drift out of this room I spotted another entity who was just standing there, he was a black entity with brightly colored facial features, much older than the others but did not seem too adult - it was like he was the older brother looking out for his young siblings while they play with their new pet, me. He seemed happy but did not interact at all.

I was taken through the house, which was surprisingly very ""human like"" it had half a dozen rooms all seemed to have varying purposes and I was taken into one of the end rooms which was almost like it was a dedicated psychedelic media room. I entered the rooms and the light show began - there was a space in the middle of the room where I was presented with various psychedelic shows. Toy like machines would come out to bend &amp; stretch in the most beautiful arrangement of colors &amp; shapes before slowly fading out to give way to an entirely new toy which would put on a whole new show. This repeated for the remainder of the trip until the room I was in slowly faded away &amp; placed me softly back on my feet with mere traces &amp; flickering of light shows compared to the show these ""toys"" were capable of putting on...

Perhaps these entities were similar to the elves that so many describe. They were small, well defined, had very human features but seemed much more ""blocky"" than us with less curves, no waist &amp; a more rounded head.

Enjoy your journeys!

i have arrived. the clarity! the beauty! i understand. i am enlightened. i have experienced what ive been in search of. i will never not know anymore. and that's terrifying and amazing at the same time. wow. just wow. im glad and thankful and intimidated at my responsibility at what's ahead. and overwhelmed at what to do with it haha. but i know it will be okay. great even. amazed. im just amazed right now. i know how to handle so many things in my life now. 




This is from my log today:

I felt like I finally made it. I had moments where I was like holy shit. I am “all knowing” -- not that I know everything or even close to it but that I understand everything to a higher degree, myself, the world around me. I felt that I was “touched” with a higher understanding. I felt like I understood everything that people do, like where their behavior comes from. I feel like I don’t need to actually study psychology anymore haha. I'm being serious though, I no longer need to push for arbitrary causes of behavior because it's like I can just feel where things stem from in terms of the things people say, they way the behave. This higher consciousness felt like like I was coasting on a wave; it felt clear and calm but rushing still at the same time, like a river of energy circulating in a higher awareness around the world. I just all of the sudden knew how I should proceed in interacting with everyone that is significant in my life. I could feel who was also up there, or who has the potential to understand, be “touched” with enlightenment. 

I could see why people are the way they are. Even people who bother me and I don’t feel like are good people, their circumstances and lives make them behave the way they do, not because of anything inherently awful. Everyone has things to deal with and overcome and it molds you.  I feel very lucky that I am overcoming my own past.

I still don’t know what I want to do with my life but I have more potential and can touch more of the world than just being a professional student because that's something I'm good at. I don’t have to get a corporate job or anything, I can work with people, with young girls, which is what I have always been passionate about, and make a difference.  I remember thinking about okay, what’s mine? What’s my passion and what do I want to do with the opportunities I have? I will not be happy or satisfied in life just coasting. I want to make a difference not for the sake of making a difference, or to feel proud of myself, or anything. I want people to be better off, plain and simple. I have never felt more large scale empathy and love.

On that note: I wanted to tell [significant people in my life, loved ones] that I’ve been let in on the secret of the universe (for lack of a better phrase at the moment). But I feel like you don’t do that. You have to find it yourself or else it’s not as good, strong, true. It was hard to deal with the emotions. And that’s why I wanted to tell someone, because it was almost too much, too intense for me to be bearing alone, I wanted to give some of the emotion to someone else to carry, but I knew that if I just did it, handle it, it would be worth it and I'd benefit so much more. A trial to overcome. Of which there are many. At first I was feeling that strong self love that I tend to experience on psychedelics. But it transformed into a related feeling → it wasn’t so much on me but just an overall expansive feeling of love and connectedness and love for the world which included me so it felt really good. 

I was going through life so blind. That's an extreme statement, I mean I was just less aware. Now I get it. I get how to interact with people, and I'm getting what life and breathing and existing are about. I am aware of how I affect people. what my actions mean. How things just come across in my behavior. Sub conscious things. Haha I had a really funny thought of like ""wow I get it I know how to go through life and I wanna teach people how to, how to be good people"" I had really funny visions of myself on a best selling book like a  self improvement one hahah and was really turned off by the idea of profiting off of it. I also pictured myself like as a minister of a “church” which mostly tickled me because of the idea of preaching something that you can only find for yourself.

""A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war, wide-awake, with fear, with respect, and with absolute assurance. Going to knowledge or going to war in any other manner is a mistake, and whoever makes it will live to regret the steps.""

""He (Don Juan) said fears are natural; that all of us experience them and there is nothing we can do about it. But on the other hand, no matter how frightening learning is, it is more terrible to think of a man without an ally, or without knowledge.""

Don Juan explained that there are four natural enemies of a man: fear, clarity, power, and old age. A man must defeat all four in order to be a man of knowledge. The following is a short excerpt on the topic of fear as the first natural enemy.

""What will happen to the man if he runs away in fear?""
""Nothing will happen to him except that he will never learn. He will never become a man of knowledge. He will perhaps be a bully, or a harmless, scared man; at any rate, he will be a defeated man. His first enemy will have put and end to his cravings.""
""And what can he do to overcome fear?""
""The answer is very simple. He must not run away. He must defy his fear, and in spite of it he must take the next step in learning, and the next, and the next. He must be fully afraid, and yet he must not stop. That is the rule! and a moment will come when his first enemy retreats. The man begins to feel sure of himself. His intent becomes stronger. Learning is no longer a terrifying take. When this joyful moment comes, the man can say without hesitation that he has defeated his first natural enemy.""

If I were in the same apprenticeship, I believe I would be still working to overcome the first natural enemy. But again, thank you to this sub for helping in overcoming the fear of the unknown in order to keep exploring. And of course, I highly recommend the book!

My boyfriend, his friend, myself, and my friend bought a gram and met up later that night just around sunset. We decided to smoke it at my friend’s house where there was a lot of forested area. It was also at the end of a dead-end road, so we knew there wouldn’t be much to disturb us.

We sat outside first behind the car, since it was still daylight and we didn’t want to draw any attention. My boyfriend and his friend smoked it first. My first attempt was a somewhat failure because we were using a regular glass bowl to smoke it. I burnt most of my dose and only got some visuals for a second. The tree I was looking at turned into a twisted fractal of jewels and light, but it quickly disappeared.

My second dose I smoked after sunset with my friend. We shared a set of earbuds to listen to music and dosed together. I was careful not to burn the DMT. After the second hit, I put the bowl down and looked up at the massive mess of dress in front of me. The largest of them turned into a tree made up of twisting, live snakes. They all moved independently to the music I was hearing. As I looked down, the grass turned into a maze with small balls moving in unison to the music as well. The experience was over in a few minutes, but left me breathless. I was incredibly humbled by the experience, as if I had seen “beyond the veil”.

My third dose was the greatest of them all (for that night). My friend, my boyfriend, myself, and his friend lined up facing the trees and smoked the remaining DMT. We passed the bowl around a handful of times until we could no longer take it. There was no music for this trip. We simultaneously tripped and seemed to have extremely similar visuals. At one point we fell back on the grass and looked up at the night sky. My friend stated that the stars “looked like they were hanging down on strings”. Suddenly the stars were so close we could touch them, almost manipulate them. I felt the grass and dirt beneath me and looked over my friends. It was such an incredible feeling. I felt like I could feel the entire cosmos, the human experience, and all that was the Earth all that once. It was very powerful and has stuck with me throughout the years.

These three experiences all happened in one night with about 30 minutes to an hour in between for contemplation, discussion, and allowing our tolerances to drop. I do not recommend using DMT this heavily. This happened at least 5 years ago and I have not used DMT since because these experiences were so powerful. After this night I used some again the second night, and foolishly dosed in a bad location. This lead to a terrible trip, that lead to an unexpected ego-death dose. It was horrible and I have not used DMT since.

That being said, it was not the DMT that caused the bad experience, but rather my attitude going into it. I thought I was amazing at tripping and could handle anything, but DMT really humbled me and put psychedelics in perspective. There is only so much you can prepare for a trip and no one is really fully prepared for the different experiences they will have tripping, even on the same substance.

Anyway, I love DMT and would definitely use it again, but in a private and spiritual setting.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,,True,t3_1gavoz,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1gavoz/dmt_connectedness_of_all_things/,

",28,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/xpttz/posted_something_similar_on_rpsychonaut_to_a/,"Hello friends. I've been using psychedelics psychonautically for about 2 years now, and its been about 9 months since I'v undertaken what we call, ""the path of the shaman"". I've always loved this subreddit, but have never seen many ideas being shared. Usually the posts are of trippy things or about DMT and other drugs-- not judging or criticizing just saying-- but I'd personally like to have a discussion about WHAT exactly we have learned from our psychonautic experiences. So I'll start the conversation by telling you what I've discovered to be truth in my experience. I'm not saying I think I'm right and everyone is wrong, and that you have to agree with me; your understanding of the universe must be internal, personal, and a balance of logical/emotional understandings. The following are ideas that resonate deeply within me logically and emotionally:

* All matter is merely energy. (E=MC2)
* We live in a Mind over Matter universe: Our will and even simply our conscious observation is what creates the universe
* Mind stems from Consciousness, not the other way around
* We are all One Consciousness experiencing itself subjectively
* The universe is mathematics and can be explained through geometry
* 'God' exists as that One Consciousness (also mathematically as Phi)
* 'God' is everything: including nature, Lucifer, corporations and their products, the New World Order, and You and me.
* There is no Good and Evil, everything simply is 
* Lucifer, while seeming Evil, simply operates disconnected from Unity Consciousness-- it is still God but separated from itself and operating under Fear rather than love.
* The universe is split into a male/female, dark/light, right brain/left brain dichotomy. (Like Yin and Yang)
* All Emotions stem from two: Love (female) and Fear (male)
* Conflict only arises from a lack of understanding
* Humans are the 'son of god' and have incredible, divine powers we have yet to fully connect with
* The purpose of life is to EXIST! TO LIVE HAPPY AND FREE. To enjoy life, LOVE others, and walk in the light

I know some of the stuff I've said could be explained a lot better, if you want to know ask me. But I mainly want to know, what kinds of things have you learned on your paths?

I began to lose my body, and enter a visionary state.  My consciousness expanded as time, and the seperation between all thing ran together into one.  I saw matter in its most basic forms, and they expanded around me, as I continued shrinking, and seeing the smaller and smaller building blocks.  At one point on this ""journey down"" as I like to think of it- I saw a triple spiral.  The three spirals were ifinitalely tightly spiraled, but it looked roughly like this:

I then proceeded to merge with the infinite one, and have the most awe inspiring ""oh my god, I can't believe I forgot this place.

The triple spiral stayed in my mind as a spiritual symbol.

For me, mindfulness meditation brings as a side-effect the same kind of self-actualization I feel for hours after a DMT trip. I know exactly what I have to do, and exactly how to go about doing it, which makes it practically effortless. I've gained a bit of insight from many substances, but other than this it's been much more difficult to really embody that insight.

Like, on adderall I feel that whatever I'm working on is very relevant to my life, which keeps me focused, but when I'm sober I sometimes have a tough time telling myself why I should be motivated to work more efficiently.

On LSD I'll feel that any existential questions are simply silly because everything is the way it is and that's it. It just is. It's very freeing to know this. Once I come down, though, the experience quickly fades. And of course trying to talk yourself back into the experience through describing exactly how and why you felt that way is like trying to describe to yourself the taste of some fruit you've never tasted before. (I think meditation should help me with this as well, though...)

With MDMA I'm able to fearlessly interact with everyone and can clearly enunciate my most intricate thoughts and feelings on the spot, while sober I trip over words left and right.

For those wondering, the compound was synthesized by a trusted third party.

Experience Time Line:
The main effects lasted a total of 9 hours, while they peaked around hour 3-4  the Come up before visuals started was just less than an hour. 
Mental state was clear until 1.5 hours into the experience when the visuals developed further only to spring to life the un-natural world inside my home.
It might be described as riding a single very large wave and turning out the backside moments before it crashes on the shoreline -if you are familiar with surfing. If you are familiar with psychedelic mushrooms then you know that the mushroom experience comes in waves -building and receding in strength, only to swell to a new heights during the next wave. 

Details:
Music kick-started the experience, but was quickly removed because of extreme peace followed by rushes of paranoia. 
The music is called ""Are you shpongled"" by Shpongle. It is a perfect complement to the mushroom state.
Come-up was extremely quick, an ever intensifying wave of emotion and psychedelia persisted until my mental state was broken down to that of a child -innocent and incapable of truly anything- yet the fundamental instincts of survival remained embedded in the imagery that would present itself later in the evening.
The visuals could be described as fun and mushroom-like until the peak of the experience when they began to take a new form. The visuals now held meaning and represented some memory long forgotten of a world forged in respect for earth and her plants. 
An out-of-body experience occurred during the peak of effects, it had lasted, (perhaps, but no way to really tell) 5 minutes, during which time my body started to shut down. It did not believe it had reason to remain functioning as it did not detect a spirit within. in effect, I witnessed myself --dying right before my eyes. An experience I don't particularly want to repeat, but will not be forgotten. During the time I spent outside of my body I (tried to) speak to entities that revealed themselves to me. The entities I spoke with did not speak english or any language that I recognized as modern. I remember saying ""I don't know what you are, but can we be friends?"". It was so amazingly strange for myself, I usually can keep grounded even in the most intense of situations.

Summary:
It was absolutely amazing, but on the next adventure I will stick to the Shulgin recommended doses. Nearly doubling the highest recommended dose made for an extremely intense experience. Although more intense than those experiences included in Tihkal, it fits the description of effects down to the word.  Insights into side effects related to higher does: During the beginning part of the experience no bruxism was noted where it usually occurs, but my body was clearly shaking (almost seizing level)   from the new found energy that is common for me during high doses of any psychedelic substance. Heart rate was elevated more than I would have liked, but that is effectively normal in any dose. 

After Thoughts
A recurring visual hallucination and something I remembering seeing when out of body... Also rabbits are very sensitive to psychedelics when compared to rats and humans. I was noting that I am much more sensitive to mind altering effects than most people.
It was, the rabbit, I think very related to my mind set previous to the experience. I rarely remember to close my eyes while I trip, which means that all my previous reports described oevs  (possibly otherwise, but not likely) It is a very stimulating experience until the peak is over when the body begins to relax as soon as the mind allows.

Wanting to push that a bit, I decided to go all out, and consumed much more than that, a total of 22mg/kg, about 2/3 of the estimated LD50 for this relatively misunderstood drug.

After it kicked in, and I began to have all those surreal moments - it hit me like a ton of bricks, a feeling unlike anything I had ever known. One where my conscious mind was separated, in a completely silent world away from everyone else. As my body continued to barely react to people - I was 'gone'. More importantly, I believed I was dead. Then - the me stopped. I entered an area, as strange as could be - it was as thought I was looking at a picture of an abandoned Soviet School Yard through a glassful of murky pond water, my memories of all my life were burned away, leaving me without any memory, identity, and I was forced to watch my life. 

My confidence in such a fragile world, a false sense of security where I failed to realize just how futile life was - but now I did. Eventually, the reel was stored away, locked away, and I could no longer use the word me. When we spoke about me, we would only use my name - Scott. What is Scott? What is his purpose, does he have one? We thought about it for a long, long time, confided with each other what we thought about Scott, what his redeeming qualities were, then we decided, enough was enough - we would discuss it later, and the others left. Leaving me alone to view this shattered world, this rusting, symmetrical school yard that exemplified how fragile our peace is. Finally, the lockbox was unlocked, and I came back, to a world with newer meaning.

If we were to create a new subreddit that said that it's guidelines were based on trying to discuss consciousness study and the psychedelics using scientific language and methods, and with the modern principles of scientific method as the ideal, would people talk about these things scientifically?

I am constantly looking for examples of people discussing these things in a way that I think of as following the science model, but I don't actually see much of it.

People will post a cellular study or a rat study or a MAPS clinical study or something of this sort, but, they usually don't then propose a model from it, or suggest how we could test for such things in vivo, in humans.

So, let me ask this - what would have to happen in order for there to be more science culture and scientific method guided discussion happening?

&gt; Shamanism (pron.: /ˈʃɑːmən/ shah-mən or /ˈʃeɪmən/ shay-mən) is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to encounter and interact with the spirit world. A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.

So basically for the purpose of healing and / or guidance, a shaman enter and / or guides another into an altered state of mind, using ethnobotanicals or with non-substantial methods.

I've looked around the /r/tryptonauts and haven't much beyond advice talk about using such and such substances, cool psy art, visuals and media and such.

Are you guys into the idea that giving ethnobotanicals will do the thing and the shaman only needs to have the knowledge the right way to cultivate the substances?

If not, please do tell of the role of the shaman in the ethnobotanical therapy.

my first truly successful shamanistic pursuit",25,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/zhof6/the_infinite_wheel_of_life_the_maw_of_the_void_my/,"I've felt drawn to the beyond for a long time, and had many solo and one-on-one experiments with a broad range of entheogens, but i never had serious breakthroughs that i felt i planned for and achieved, and was most often left thirsting for my next experience. 

Here is what I did when I finally grew the nuts to believe in my pursuits and my intuition and take a dive by myself. I had a long-running affection for 2c-e and a growing taste for ketamine as a boost out of the body
I took 30mg of 2c-e at my favourite outdoor sanctuary. perfect setting: I know the area, there's a huge, super-old tree and a stream that I can walk in or listen to. I come up slowly and calmly, smoking a little bit of cannabis to ground myself, trying not to think about much except for how beautiful my surroundings are, how sweet the fruit i had to eat was, and how good it is to be alive and at peace. 

Once i felt my first real surge of 2c-e flavor (reaching a ++) I got comfortable, lay down, and did a moderate bump of ketamine (~35mg) I covered my eyes with a towel and immediately I could see the same natural scene i had before me, but instead of seeing the physical form I usually can, I was merely aware of this blue energy flowing throughout the tree and the water and all the plants around me. I got uncomfortable and felt like settling, and upon sitting up i felt that i wasn't that dissociated and did another bump, about half as big as the last. I lay down, covered my eyes, and this is where shit got REAL

I went into a vision i can't remember. all I can remember is the conclusion and that it made UTTER sense. the conclusion was the possibility of using mushrooms as part of a cure for my dad's depression/my family's long-running emotional dysfunctions, something that I immediately called my brother about (a behaviour i hope to refrain from in the future on dissociatives regardless of how beautiful the thought might seem, this is recommended for all) and explained to him what I had jsut seen. 

I settled down from this (the vision itself was very brief) and lay down for another dive. This time the visions were far deeper, and more recollectable. 

I saw masses of suffering, in many different ways. I saw an infinite amount of entities, consciousnesses, forever repressed and abused by the power of fear, deceit, evil, Satan, the accuser.. Also the unity of all of these negative ideas became very evident to me, a thought I've been entertaining for some time. In so many ways, I saw and felt the extent to which the misguided can fall into chaos and suffering, and how they can unknowingly become beacons of this hell, this hell on earth that so many live. Among these visions was this imprint of Jesus, or some form of equivalent deity to him. To a certain degree, I felt like i was atoning for all human suffering. 
And then I got sick. 

I had to get it out. it felt okay, i was at peace, but it was inside of me, crawling, and my soul couldn't take it any more

the grinding hell and chaos was too much, my heart was fighting back and out it came. I puked almost nothing, dry heaved while laughing for a few minutes, and sat up. 

Here i envisioned this phenomenon that felt very real philosophically. I call it the gaping maw of the void, something that is referenced in some fantasy stories. I saw it as this flat plane in a 3 dimensional space. the center of the plane was not flat however, it gaped and spiked out toward me. The trend in this visualization (And it all felt perfectly sensically causal (I have a very visual and mathematical mind)) was that this aberration in the plane causes the rest of the plane surrounding it to also spike up and out and gape. the force behind this spreading aberration in the once peaceful plane before me felt inherently evil, and very mathematically chaotic--a state of pure disorder, lack of consciousness, intelligence, divinity, whatever you want to call it ;)
This felt all very very revealing and resounding. I began to eat more fruit, and i went into a powerful rendition of the wheel of life, the infinite cycle of processing. I compared the beauty of a fruit feeding an animal, how there is no harm in the transaction and both parties involved benefit from either nutrition or spreading of seed, to the violence of warfare, of slavery

It all became, as I chewed, just a hierarchy of iterations of the constant cycle of life. The hells where all suffer and make others suffer just to live exist and are real, just as the heavens where none suffer and all relationships are mutually beneficial exist, and that this is a natural and infinite cycle whose eternal significance (karma) is a force to be reckoned with. 

Here ends the shamanistic part of the trip. The rest of my day was spent whimsically boarding about and thinking about the implications of my vision earlier regarding my family, and giggling in awe at how successful I had been in that day's voyage

I felt like I'd been turned inside out and rubbed against mother earth until nothing was left but my brilliant golden soul. I had reason to laugh without reason for days

1. This feeling of Oneness...surely that isn't the ""end-game scenario"" if you get what I mean. That can't be all it is, right? Once you realize that you are everything and everything is you, you're overcome with this profound sense of relief and euphoria. You can do whatever you want, nothing is expected of you, etc. Is there any more to this existence, to this reality? I always entertained the notion when I was younger that reality, rather than being neutral or good, may be evil. That this reality may be a cruel experiment or something of the sort. Do you believe that this reality is, at the highest level, positive? Feel free to answer using your own terms, mine may be a little vague.

2. I still can't get over the absurdity of existence. I wake up every morning and I think ""oh shit, things exist! WTF!"". How do you guys cope with this?

3. I've come to the conclusion of this: lets assume the worst case scenario possible and say that this reality is indeed a cruel experiment. There's no use crying over the fact that we're in a cruel experiment, what's done is done. Now how can we make the best of this? I believe this MAY be what Nietszche was getting at with Sisyphus.  He's put into this shitty situation, but the question is *now what?* So he put on a smile and embraced the absurdity of his shitty situation and was basically all ""fuck you Gods, you make me live this shitty life for all of eternity, well just out of spite I'm gonna have fun and just fucking embrace the chaos"". How's that line of thinking?

4. Sometimes I go through periods of pretty harsh anxiety and I try to soothe myself by saying ""it's okay, at the highest level of reality, I am in total control and I'm the one making all of this happen"". But I feel as if I'm clinging on to that in a faith-based way. Again, I ask you, why do many psychonauts see the ""big picture"" as Oneness and positive when it could simply be layers of delusion and deceit?

5. ""The only thing that we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us"" What are you doing with the time given to you?

6. The thing that would help me the most from this post is a way to deal with the ""oh shit"" factor of existence/consciousness itself and the feelings of anxiety and absurdity that it brings with it.

7. Many psychonauts tend to be good people or tend to want to be good people. They care about spreading good vibes, love, and understanding. Why? What would happen if we spread destruction and chaos? Not out of maliciousness but just ""for the lulz"" (please forgive the phrase but I feel it gets across the concept well). If I am truly everything, and this entire existence thing is just an elaborate way to entertain myself, then surely I can do whatever the fuck I want and although spreading love may seem ""noble"", could that not be construed as just another layer of ego?

Here's a link to where this discussion begins: http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1iqe06/on_dmt_subthreshold_doses_spontaneous_postures/cb7b4x6

I found this a very interesting statement, and potentially very fruitful to examine deeper.

I would like to invite everyone to put up examples of cognitive dissonance between science models and mystic models, and see wether or hot the dissonance is real, or if it is as easily resolved as I claim it it.

Now, I have a word I use a lot, and that word is ""anomalies"". I take this word from Popper and Kuhn, and for me, an anomaly is the most interesting thing there is. It's the place where the model does not fit what is observed and measured, where the explanations break down, and the reason it is exciting is that it's the place where new discoveries, revolutions of understanding, become possible.

Here's an example of an anomaly I love (altho I solved this one long ago):

People will say, ""Such and such (typically something like 'enlightenment"") is a nondual experience, in which there is no experience, no experiencer, there is no separation between subject and object, there is only the underlying unity."". I'm sure many of us have either heard this kind of thing, or had some variation of the experience.

The anomaly should be obvious - if there is no subject or object, what is having the experience? If the experience is truly unity, how is it possible to know it, to talk about it afterwards? Do those who do talk about it afterwards, if it was truly unified, not care that they are lying about it by describing it in non-unified words? Why does the experience end if it is unified? And so on and so forth - the more you look at the experience, the more anomalies appear - but the core anomaly, the first order anomaly, remains - if there is no experiencer, what has the experience?

In researching the neural correlates of mystical experience, Horgan pays an extended visit to Canadian scientist Michael Persinger, who studies the effects of trans-cranial electromagnetic stimulation on consciousness, and Horgan interviews several proponents of “entheogenic” drugs, including Swiss psychiatrist Franz Vollenwieder, described as “arguably the world’s leader in psychedelic research involving humans.” He subjects himself to Persinger’s “God-machine,” but with such anticlimactic results that he wonders, as magnetic pulses play futilely on his cortex, “How will I turn this into a scene for my book?” In contrast, as vividly described in his penultimate chapter, he samples a South American hallucinogenic mixture known as ayahuasca and is pretty much flattened by the experience. But powerful though it is, Horgan’s interpretation is deflationary: “In retrospect, all my ayahuasca visions seemed more like products of my own brain than transpersonal revelations.” This same interpretation, of course, can be applied to any variety of mystical consciousness, however it’s produced, that purports to represent reality the way it “really” is. All such states are, materialists believe, a function of the brain, so why should we suppose that it’s just these states, as opposed to more mundane brain processes subserving ordinary cognition and perception, that get reality right?

I walked to the library where my sitter was, and I knew something was up when it started to kick in within 20 minutes. Not just a subtle “its on” come up either, but BAM! Everything started melting and morphing, and like a lot of trip reports I read, I felt like I was in a big rainbow world. I had strange body load, not completely uncomfortable but a bit agitating at times (though it started out euphoric). I experienced a fair amount of dissociation, at times forgetting who I was and where I was and seeing myself and imagining myself as another person (my friend, oddly enough). At some point, something in me said “GET FOOD AND DRINK” and I went to the vending machines downstairs. I tried to swipe my credit card, but the machine started beeping at me and I got upset and frustrated and started saying “Fuck you” to the machine. Another friend of mine walked by and ended up helping me though and I went back to the library. I somehow got it in my head that I was dead and started panicking a bit, but I ran into yet another friend (who is the psychedelic type and has had a lot of experience tripping) and he sat and talked with me about my experience for awhile which calmed me down and gave me some good vibes. Eventually he left and I went back to my sitter and lied down and opened myself up to the experience...

Everything was incredible. Closed eye visuals of fractal towers and fantastic patterns. Purple, navy blue. Some red. The open eyes were even more astonishing, morphing and melting, loss of dimensions. I couldn't make sense of the ceiling! Colors were everywhere, the world was a rainbow kaleidoscope full of wondrous and whimsical patterns. My body was filled with the most extreme emotions from intense fear and dread to pure ecstasy. 
	Coming back from the experience, I feel a lot more empathetic and much happier. I feel a lot more understanding of myself and I feel a lot happier with others. Overall, even though it was a tough experience in some regards, I'm glad I went through it.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,,True,t3_1azq92,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1azq92/midnight_trip_on_metocin_4homet_third_time/,

1354489735.0,20,self.tryptonaut,1466at,Allow me to tell you about the Lego people in Salvia hyperspace,24,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1466at/allow_me_to_tell_you_about_the_lego_people_in/,"As with DMT elven-like entities that seem to be apparent in quite a few trips there are also interestingly a certain kind of being group that appears in some peoples' trips to Sally's hyperspace of wonderment and I have dubbed them the lego people. Their appearance is a sort of combination of Lego duplo, super mario world, and pastel hues. In any case, I am not the only one that has had more than a cup of tea with these beings and I am writing this as to see if others here have any input they can provide into what I consider genuinely external entities as the elven entities that make themselves known in the DMT-verse most likely are as well. Perhaps we can create some sort of framework within which we can better understand the hyperspace that Sally seems to transport one's consciousness in a non-localized manner. Below is an interaction to help illustrate from a personal perspective what such an interaction with the lego people is like. 

**Encountering the Lego People**

Suddenly I found myself in a vastly different place than where Sally had just placed me. It had appeared to me that I was now a part of a different family than my 3D biological one. This family consisted of myself, a mother and a father. However, this was not some sort of past life remembrance, as the scenario which just took place before I ended up at this place. This was as if I was seeing who I really was in true reality. This family, which I was a part of, was from another galaxy altogether (whether it was in this dimension/universe or one parallel to it was not clear). Every one of us looked kind of inorganic in nature. What I mean by this is that we all looked plastic to a certain extent. We looked more plastic than we did biological...more inorganic than organic. The colours were very pronounced, such as a blue was an extremely vibrant sort of blue, red was an extremely vivid red, and so on. My parents in this different reality explained that it was my actual life and family and that me, along with several others, have been given a mission to go to the planet earth, mix inbetween the humans and take up a human body wherein our consciousness would be, helping the humans in some way because they desperately needed it (I don't remember the details of this revelation). 

There were several of us coming to earth and I had to reassure one of them who felt quite sad about leaving her home and family in this other galaxy/universe. Anyway, back to my parents over there. They exclaimed that it is my choice and I had chosen to do this. When I asked if I can tell others about this, my father was unsure in his answer, which was a 'yes'. I also asked quizzingly, if they were my real parents and that was my true life, what about the vision from my previous salvia trip when I thought it was a past life experience from the late 18th century (it appeared that I was about to duel somebody based on our differences in opinion about something in the articles of confederation if I remember correctly)? The one who was supposedly my father asked ""Don't you remember that you were an outside observer in that vision?"" Indeed, as I recalled it, it did seem like I was an outside observer to the whole event. He them proceeded to tell me that it was not a past life memory of myself, but a look into a small part of history from a unique 3rd person perspective. I believe he was hinting that I was able to see this event that occurred over 200 years ago by accessing the what Ervin Laszlo calls the Akashic Field (A-Field for short).

My feelings of these lego people being more real and genuinely connected with me than my true parents (whom I have no bad terms with, ruling out the possibility of psychological dissociation of my parents based on whatever negative experiences would trigger such a subconscious concoction within my mind during this Salvia trip) indicates that thre is something worth looking into and so I wonder if anyone else may have anything they can share on these beings that we seem to be able to communicate with in the salvia space.

Perhaps after tackling this we can look into how Salvia unveils the 'mechanics' of Reality with the gears theme.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,hunabku,True,t3_1466at,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1466at/allow_me_to_tell_you_about_the_lego_people_in/,

There have always been separate worlds for me, dream worlds, some fantastic, some bleak, some ordinary.

You've had similar sober experiences?

",23,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/12plw6/a_suggestion_for_a_perspective_to_try_when/,"So I read a lot about people meeting these ""entities"" or ""inorganic beings"" Some people think they are extra terrestrials, others postulate that they are from another dimension, instead of another planet in this dimension. 
Another point of view is that they are parts of the psyche of whoever encountered them. Now, I know I'm preaching to the choir when I saw that our perceptions create our reality to I'll just cut to the chase.

 When you encounter an entity like this try the following perspective: Whatever you are contacting is *yourself in the future.* I have encountered many entities under many different assumptions as to what they were and, for me personally, this perspective was the most satisfying. It allowed me to completely relax to commune and to relate. I mean cause y'all know we're all one deep down anyway right, so thinking it's yourself in the future isn't that farfetched, hell you could try thinking of everyone you meet as yourself in the future (if you want to be humble) or yourself in the past (cause you're more enlightened than those fools anyway)

The first time I was able to get a hit that was decent from my little glass bubbler pipe I tripped for about 30 seconds, seeing spirals that had formed from what looked wires into geometrical patterns. Then I was sober. Pretty dissapointing. My buddy got a really good hit and was out of it for a good 4 minutes. When he came back to reality he was talking about how beautiful his vision was, that he saw geometrical patterns among angels that were singing and dancing in front of him. His arms were made of rainbows.  
 
We scraped up the last little bit he had with a knife from the plate and loaded another bowl. I attempted again and this time was able to have the entire bowl fill with smoke. I released the smoke into my lungs and instantly the room started to wiggle and move like it had all become liquid. I closed my eyes and started seeing the geometrical patterns again. Then, just like my shroom trip from a few days ago, the third eye of Tool started forming and moving with the triangles. I felt like a free flowing soul floating down a hallway of eyes and triangles, like a Tool video. After about 2 minutes at the end of the hall, there was the face of Buddha. Just like this. As soon as I saw his face I started backing my way out of the same hallway while thinking ""No! I want to stay here!"" and within another 45 seconds the visions were over. Powerful stuff. The smoke was a little too harsh on my lungs though, I don't think I'll smoke it again. Next we're going to attempt to make Pharmausca, because I feel too much like we're smoking meth or something the way that was.

1346133315.0,19,self.tryptonaut,yy5vo,"[Trip Report] Faces, My Future, and Contact",21,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/yy5vo/trip_report_faces_my_future_and_contact/,"So last night me and my tribe ingested a total of about 7-8 grams each of mushrooms. On the come up I got the crazy idea in my head I was going to try to telepathically make contact with something out in the universe, to try and put a beacon out for something to reach out to me. This was mostly due to my recent research into DMT and my coming DMT trip with the same group tomorrow evening. What followed really intrigued me.  
 
On the come up, we were sitting outside on the porch and I started thinking in my mind ""Hello? Is anyone out there? Can you hear me? If you can hear me please respond."" After about 10 minutes of thinking like this with my eyes closed and watching many closed eye visuals a 3D image of what looked like a brain started to form. I then heard a woman's voice in my right ear saying ""Help me! Please help me!"" I opened my eyes and looked at my friends, and I knew they were not hearing the same voice. I kept thinking in my head ""where are you? Please tell me where you are so I can help you!"" A few seconds later she stopped...while my friend was trying to tell me how the tree near us looked plastic I heard another voice in my left ear, this time a man's voice, but I have no memory of what he actually said. I was told later that the whole time I was hearing these voices and seeing these visuals I was mumbling to myself.  
 
I went inside and sat down on the couch. I have to note here so that it makes sense that I was wearing [this](http://i.imgur.com/cmKTI.png) shirt the whole trip. After we went inside, I started seeing the eyes on the shirt everywhere. On TV we were watching Through the wormhole with Morgan Freeman, the eyes were in the stars, on wood backgrounds...soon after entire faces were forming everywhere. I could look at the wall behind the television and I could see my own face like I was looking into a camera that's image was being projected 10Xs larger onto the wall. The faces changed, there were all different shapes and sizes, different racial backgrounds. I then laid back on the couch and continually thought in my head ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" after seeing a few more faces, I heard an older woman's voice say in a very hushed tone my name. I said simply replied back ""Yes?"" and she said my name again. I then saw her eyes, nose, and mouth. I was so taken back and for some reason felt love run through my entire body, almost like it was a mother figure. Tears came to my eyes and my friends grabbed me and awoke me from the state. I laid there for a moment really taking it in. They were afraid I was having a bad trip, but I kept reassuring them I was fine, that the tears were those of love.  
 
My friends went outside to smoke a cigarette so I figured I would see what else I could get out of closed eye visuals while still continually thinking about about reaching out to anything that would listen to me telepathically. After about 2 minutes I saw two faces of what looked like South American shamans. The faces appeared in almost an etching from a grid of green lines. They appeared, disappeared, and then another face formed out of the middle. This face soon constructed into a full body, except the entire body and face was made of green triangles that were moving the entire time... then I noticed the face changed into my own, except it was like a vision of me if I actually got into shape like I am trying to do now. The ""other"" me locked eyes with me but did not say anything. He slowly started to turn his back to me and once he did he kept looking over his shoulder at me and smiling at me. I kept thinking ""PLEASE SPEAK TO ME!! Please help me achieve this! What do I need to do?"" but he would not say anything, only smile and nod his head at me. I stood up and walked outside to my friend and explained what I had just seen.  
 
After this we all gathered inside and had a silly time. My friend and me wrestled on the floor while giggling like we were 9 year olds who had just seen pro wrestling for the first time in our life. While he went to the bathroom, I was talking to his girlfriend and explaining to her all the beings I had talking to me and the faces I had seen which at the time had seemed to stop appearing. I turned my head and looked up her stair case and saw another old man South American shaman's face appear very big and nod at me. We did a few other things but the trip was one of the shortest I've experienced, only about 4 1/2 hours long. 
 
Oh yeah, and before we tripped my friend taught me how to grow my own and started me on my own grow. I readied 5 half pint jars with vermiculite, brown rice and water then pressure cooked them, and this morning inoculated them with the spores. :D I take DMT tomorrow, and I can't wait.

But isn't everybody. Anywho, I've had only one breakthrough DMT trip about little under a year prior to this, but have attempted to reach one multiple times afterwards with failed attempts from purposely underdosing it because I was slightly afraid.

Getting on to the juicy stuff, I went the method of just topping it on a bowl of a little bit of bud, melting it into the bud and burning it. I topped the shit out of it, I truly thought I was ready for another breakthrough. Took the first hit, held held held, and about 10 seconds in the silence was profound like usual. Knowing my time was limited, I went in for the second hit. I completely forgot I was hitting the bowl halfway through but regained my focus quickly. The second hit was a lot harsher as the bud actually burned a bit.

Things quickly fell apart afterwards. I put the bowl down to avoid spilling the water (bubbler) instead of taking the third hit like I wanted to (my courage had dropped dramatically). I felt normal for a few seconds and then snapped back to realize my room was wrong. It looked simple, like a bad child's drawing, with the drawer only having sharp corners and knobs drawn on and the doors just pure white instead of the detail they used to have.

I was convinced I was hearing whispers even though I reassured myself I was hearing nothing, but I was convinced my mom and dad were screaming ""Fight Happykid fight!"" so I assumed I was on my hospital bed dying. I also convinced myself if I left the room I would live, but I thought I couldn't because the room wasn't real and only in my mind and that's why it looked wrong. One look down at my hand and it looked blueish (skin tone) and it scared me enough to jump out of bed and go check the mirror in my bathroom.

After that I started sobering up fast. I had some moments of confusion where I still thought I was in my headspace, but I convinced myself that it was real and I was back. I am annoyed greatly by the fact I undercut myself and didn't finish the bowl (I took another one big hit and one small hit out of it afterwards and shit got intense again, but not nearly as far). I knew if I had I would have gotten where I wanted to.

I am sorry but I can not put a TL:DR for the specific reason of my question may only be understood by few and those willing to read the whole thing will provide the message I need a TL:DR response could not. Btw call GOD what ever you personally name it in this. 

I have had enough experiences that I come to embrace the void within. I have been on a journey to understand that which can not be understood and I come to a place where I need some friendly advice by the few who can not only understand  but feel in every aspect the meanings being the words even if they fail to describe. 


I have passed through the gateless gate of self (but I still know nothing of me of course :) always learning in the abyss of mind). With the help of Salvia and using Cannabis as a lubricant in meditation I have been able to pick apart myself little by little and have come to love me for everything I am(good, bad, everything is just perspective when it comes down to it). I am God. Just as you all are in your own universes. I speak from the heart when I say I LOVE YOU ALL for the same reasons I love myself. We are all one and you will always be there with you and so will the world, the world being you too. That is why love is so important. my perspective runs deep and this is where I need help. There are two sides to the question. 


The First side

I have come to realize that inorder to continue on in my self exploration I have to embrace my godhood yes? This is where I am lost in the abyss of my mind because we are taught that those who say they are god are delusional.... The WORLD Tells you that fact and of course you are the world....  I was an athiest from the moment I first knew about religion. For 25 years God could not exist and then I come to find I am god in this realm, if only just the smallest part. That I could be okay with, being just the tiny-est part. But you are the world as well but

The second side.

Since I was a kid I was always able to ""trance"" myself out and it is only recently that I learned that is what I was doing as a kid. I was always  outside, away from people listening to music but I could make myself disappear to this other realm... My eyes could still see this realm but I was not aware of being in it (Much more than day dreaming, but like dreaming but awake)... It was my own fantasy playground. Allow me to go out on a limb and assume most you still reading this did something similar and possibly still do. Just a strange little kid living in a fantasy world when you wanted. Like being able to go to neverland when you wanted ( not the ranch). Now, in our realms we are Gods are we not? We dream like lions.... So then the reverse must be true about our god self, Gods dream like sheep. Its part of understanding eachother within. Then your existence is gods trance(what ever it can be called) yes? you are a thought of god. You are of course still yourself in everyway you are and that you must realize too is beautiful. 

So the point.... 

I am god... I am you... you are me... we are everything....  thoughts of ""something"" within that can not be named.... this being understood we also dream and daydream and let our minds wander for specific reasons. They are messages we give to ourselves (even the most insignificant thought carries a message from your higher self in someway) and as in every ""trance"" the symbols in every existence are OUR own.  Do you see where I am going? Where I am trying to say where my perspective is starting to go? I feel at the edge of waking up to something very big and small at the same time but once I wake this will never be the same. This is where love is important as well. 

Would you or did you or could you?  who ever you are or will be and are not would you continue thinking this way or think you are delusional?

1338411803.0,19,self.tryptonaut,ucpbm,"Trip Report: 4-AcO-DMT, 25mg.",21,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/ucpbm/trip_report_4acodmt_25mg/,"I learned about this substance while browsing r/drugs and became captivated by it's potential. An initial web browse yielded one online vendor that did not ship to the U.S. and my search ended. I caught a fellow redditor's attention when I commented on a post detailing my short endeavor and the reason it came to a halt. I was PM'd and given the link to a vendor that shipped to my home country. For this I was very grateful. Fast forward several weeks and both my RC and a proper scale had arrived at my home. Last night I decided to have my first experience.

After weeks of reading on the subject my biggest question was: How much should I take for my first time and also experience strong effects? I decided 30mg would do it, but at the last minute someone responded to one of my comments and told me 25mg would be fine and that I was in for an experience. This was an understatement. 25mg it was. I licked my tweezers, dabbed a small grain on my tongue and waited 20-30 minutes to determine if I might be allergic and then weighed out my decided dose.

Not positive that I was *not* allergic, but sure enough, I stirred the powder into a small glass of cranberry juice and drank it. I waited.

With my Pink Floyd playlist going (first Dark Side, then The Wall, and finally Wish You Were Here) I wasn't quite sure what else to do. The thought of fiddling with video games or browsing the internet caused slight anxiety so I just alternated walking around my house and sitting on my bed. Approximately 30 minutes after I ingested I could feel myself coming up. Not quite giddiness, but restlessness. Halfway through Dark Side of the Moon I noticed the wall next to my bed appeared to be reflecting pale green light. The slight texture on the walls began to move. After this it became increasingly less gradual. *Us &amp; Them* began to play and I felt as though I broke through a membrane of some kind. On the other side of this membrane my room was warm and happy. I couldn't help but smile. My initial focus was on the wall next to my bed. There was a tall lamp with an orange shade shining light on the wall. The wall was a mixture of colors. Green, orange, and blue. I was less focused on the music at this point, although it provided a nice atmosphere for what I was experiencing. I kept going under my blanket and letting the orange light from the lamp shine through it. It was like being in a womb of pulsating patterns. Very small and detailed patterns. Hard to describe. Very much like a mix of a paisley pattern and fractals. All moving and pulsating. I got lost under the blanket and was in complete and total awe of what I was experiencing. This next part is where things get hazy.

Pink Floyd's The Wall started to play. It was joyous. I would go into deep trances of thought, going through time into the past, experiencing pure emotion and past memories. I connected with each one of my family members and experienced things through their perspective with their feelings. My parents just got divorced and I visited a place full of feelings that stem from that event. It wasn't frightening, but sad and also full of love and happiness as I felt so much love for my family. When I would ""come to"" I would examine my room and sing along with the music. That was very personal. It was like hearing the album for the first time all over again with a much deeper understanding of the lyrics. Several times I had to turn the volume up loud and bask in the sights and sounds, usually singing along. As I laid in bed the trances became longer and longer. I would come to and hear the music, but have no grasp on what point in the album I had come to. No matter how confused I was by this I could do nothing about it. I could only remain where I was and continue my journey through my thoughts. I began to wonder how long I had been writhing on my bed twisting through my head in seas of closed and open eyed visuals. 

Once I had gotten well into the second disc of *The Wall* I was more conscious of my surroundings in that I was looking around and stuff, but it was like sensory overload. The open eyed visuals only got stronger as time went on and they were overwhelming. I began to feel hot and nauseated so I made my way outside. I had to tell myself that if I did want to vomit it would be okay. I knew that I was in no physical danger, but I was experiencing a very uncomfortable body load. Also, dizziness. I happened to get a text from my sister saying, ""Sup."" I called her immediately, but she didn't answer. I sent her a text saying I loved her with a :). I called her again and she answered. At the time I knew why I called her, but was embarrassed and ashamed. I felt foolish for taking as much as I did and not being able to go it alone. I didn't expect to get to this level and I wanted her to come over. Side not: She knew I had this stuff and is somewhat familiar with drugs. She expressed her distaste for my decision and expressed she was worried I would hut myself or someone else under the influence of this drug. ""I hear stuff like that all the time."" she said. So she actually texted me that moment to say she wanted to be there with me when I tried it and was in the process of responding to my text when I called her. She answered and I told her I wanted her to come over. When she asked why I wasn't sure what to say so I didn't say anything. I was afraid to tell her I was in the throws of a powerful psychedelic. I didn't want her to be ashamed or angry. I took a moment trying to find the right words which ended up being the wrong words. I told her not to be mad at me, not to freak out, and that if she wanted to come over to not do so in an alarming manner. She took my being hesitant and short with words as me trying to hide something. She asked if my dad was okay and where was dad. I told he was where he always is that time of night, in bed asleep. That wasn't enough as she then momentarily assumed I had murdered my dad and started to bawl. She then caught me by surprise by saying she was sick of me doing this, tired of me using drugs, and that she never asked for me to call her or for me to do what I was doing. I was able to bring the tone of the conversation to a more calm state by explaining that everything was okay. She assumed something was not okay and I just explained that I was having a very intense experience. She said she was coming over. I said okay. She said okay. We both said goodbye and hung up.

I sat in my backyard waiting for her to arrive which seemed to take forever. The distant sounds from the highway took on strange tones. As I gazed into the sky I was captivated by one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen.

My sister arrived and even though I was looking directly at her her entire face looked distorted and melted. We had a small heart to heart where we shared our feelings with each other. She expressed how having not done any psychedelics before she had no point of reference and could not seem to forget the horror stories she had heard on television. She was scared, but seeing me at home now and having checked on my dad she was able to calm down. I wanted to share my experience with her, but had a hard time speaking and when I did have something formulated in my head I refrained from sharing as I thought her momentary fear and sobriety would not allow her to appreciate what I was saying. I felt foolish and childish. Even so I was able to sputter out fragmented sentences and eventually started to feel very tired and that I might be able to fall asleep. She said she was going back to her apartment to finish getting ready for bed and then come back to my house to sleep. As she left my Pink Floyd playlist tapered off, finishing with Shine On You Crazy Diamond parts VI-IX. It lulled me into a trance and I spent the rest of the night with my lamp turned off and in total silence. I don't know how long I continued tripping before I finally fell asleep. Constantly journeying through my thoughts and consciousness behind my closed eyes.

I woke up around 7am and was back to baseline. I took a quick stroll through the house to check on my sister and my dad and then went back to sleep.

TL;DR I had my first experience with 4-AcO-DMT, 25mg. It kicked me around like a rag doll and I ended up completely humbled. My experience had it's ups and downs, but never did I ever feel like I was having a bad trip. Just *really* ***really*** intense visuals and a state of mind I had never experienced before. I would do it again, even at that dose as long as I was with another tripper or a sitter. I am definitely going to try again in a couple weeks at a lower dose.

Consciousness was around long before humans. It inhabited ancient animals, plants, possibly even the earth/terrain itself (elementals). As it saw potential coming about (assuming that it is not related to natural selection in any way), it guided this promising new species (that, crucially, had the processing power to possibly accept a larger portion of it than plants or animals) through the transmission of knowledge via psychoactives/altered mind states of which plants to eat, animals to/ways to hunt, which led to the concept of animal and plant spirits. 

After a time it was able to in some small part temporarily sequester parts of itself off in order to inhabit these new meat bodies with their easier way of imprinting on reality via physical means as opposed to directly. 

Over time this newly endowed species became more and more organised and started to lose some of its ancient traits (pack mentality/communication =telepathy, etc) as well as fight huge wars among itself. 

A guide was needed and was answered by the concept of ""God"", which was an extremely powerful pool of consciousness. In the old testament we see numerous accounts of active impressions upon reality, pillars of fire, Soddom &amp; Gommorah, seas parting, the plagues of egypt etc. 
After the manifestation of Jesus Christ (imbued with some of these powers and an active knowledge of his origins), the pool of consciousness was weakened, or chose to take a more ""hands"" off approach to see how things developed as it communicated with the species in a more direct manner (God learns?). 

More and more people were born, and it started to take more heavily on the pool of conscious energy, the plants and animals had long since lost their vestiges of what little consciousness they had the capacity for, as a human being born without consciousness could no longer survive. So now the parasite is no longer, and a symbiotic relationship has been formed. As world population exploded, the limits of consciousness were pushed to their boundaries with so many brains draining it, magic/druidism/shamanism; forms of traditional manipulation of reality and attempted interaction with the original consciousness stopped being practiced, in the way of the aforementioned telepathy. 

This would explain for the universal oneness among a host of other fascinating phenomena that come out when on psychedelics (telepathy once more!), and for reincarnation. Possibly the experience that that package of consciousness had would impact whether it would be able to come back to the whole with its newfound richness, or whether it would be immediately reincarnated in hopes of a better experience (if we do accept that God was the same thing, then his moral direction is able to be divinated, albeit a very alien way of impressing it- this consciousness would not be polluted by flesh or psyche).",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,neuron,True,t3_pd1tj,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/pd1tj/consciousness_and_its_origins/,

For example, a DMT ""breakthrough"" experience could simply be the experience of entering into a state of total temporal equilibrium (or perhaps even reversal), where our perceptions become mainly influenced by the exogenous, non-temporally-parallel chemicals, opposed to the endogenous parallel ones that normally influence our mind.

It comes in many forms most easily seen in the rhetoric of the .self posts. Words like ""oneness,"" ""consciousness,"" ""buddha,"" ""infiniteness,"" are commonly used but are entirely subjective and are effectively worthless in written or spoken communication. Reality is math and it came from nothing. It is possible to create something from nothing, the simplest way is in pairs. Theoretically, we can take completely empty space, which has some very weird properties on it's own accord, and manipulate it creating two completely equal, but completely opposite physical beings. This, surprisingly enough, does not violate the laws of physics. How many different ways can 0=0 be rewritten? Infinitely, 0-1+1=0+1-1 etc; super simplified, but that's the gist of the idea.

 Mathematics is the reason behind the perceived ""oneness"" with the universe. This ""oneness"" can be captured in concrete terms with a minor understanding of gravity, a.k.a. a physical manifestation of mathematical occurrence. Every piece of matter is gravitationally connected with every other bit of matter in the universe. The blinking of an eye will have effects on the farthest stars in the most distant galaxies, this effect happens to be extremely close to nothing and is generally reinterpreted by the rest of the universe on it's way to that distant galaxy, but it is an effect nonetheless. This is chaos theory.

The laws of physics are defined as such only if they remain consistent at every place in the universe. Another way to put this is that no matter which way you manipulate the universe, whichever direction you look, it will always look the same. This idea is known as self-similarity and is the basis of fractal mathematics. I do not claim to know all the answers as some do, and I really think you should approach this subject and dissertations on it with a heavy grain of salt and a strong dose of skepticism. You will see people's ideas that could have only been the result of a little confusion and a lot of tryptamines; ""mathematical equations"" that read, couldn't make this up, (exi)=(st). No joke, don't get slippery on me, friends, we can make progress but we don't have the time for quackery. I will include a personal favorite list in a suggested order as an introduction to fractals. The math is not hard, just gorgeous, and a high school education would be more than enough for it to make sense. I wish you all a fine time and hope I have provided you with the tools or maybe a stimulus for us to elucidate ourselves more in this most paraprosdokian of an existence.

I took them with three other individuals, and a fourth sober friend (I'll call him Hank) was just hanging out with us while we were tripping.
Around three hours into the trip while all of us were tripping quite hard, I had a conversation with one of the friends (I'll call him John) that was tripping while we were in the bathroom. I cannot recall the specific content of our conversation but I noticed this after we finished talking: if I paid attention to the grammatical structure and word order of his sentences, I realized they made absolutely no sense grammatically. I was, however, still able to completely understand and receive the message he was trying to send.
Once we were back among everyone, including Hank, I pointed this out. And again John tried to describe something he was feeling and thinking to us, and Hank stated that he made absolutely no sense to him at all. But myself and the other two trippers all agreed that we were able to contract meaning from his words and felt we understood.
This astounded me at the time, and I still think it is fascinating.

These experiences happened in March of 2013. First I would like to outline the dosages I was working with.

Dosage Range:

5 – 12mg plugged
5 – 20mg smoked plus unknown mg resin hits
10 – 15mg oral

Now I find it important to add that I was not measuring my dosages because I do not own a milligram scale. This is extremely dangerous and I do not recommend anyone do what I did, as you will soon find out in my reports.


Comments:


-(6mg, plugged): mild MDMA-ish “rolling” feeling with slight tryptamine feel. Hints of visuals, like a low dose of mushrooms. I smoke more throughout the night which is full of good vibes, laughs, and extreme relaxation. Food tastes awesome and the drug doesn’t inhibit my appetite. I sleep well around the 9 hour mark. Throughout the night I also smoke repeated doses of synthetic cannabinoid 5f-ur-144.

 
-(8mg plugged, 12mg smoked, repeated smoked doses): I smoked the 12mg dose soon after the plug dose began to take effect around the 15 min mark. Effects are mildly overwhelming at first, about 20 min after the smoked dose. Anxiety and body load take over, with lots of nausea. I end up puking around the 45 min mark. After puking, I feel much better and the MDMA-ish “rolling” feeling takes over with markedly more trippiness. Empathy is mild, but there, and I spend the night mostly in good spirits. I also smoke several doses of 5f-ur-144 throughout the night. Sleep comes easily after about 8 hours after the oral dose.

 
-(2, 6mg plugged doses, multiple smoked doses, resin hit dose): Intense dysphoria and panic reaction only a few minutes after exhaling the hit. I am sure I did too much immediately. Little to no visuals, and almost no psychedelia to be found. Body high feels like strobing pulses which begin at my heart and reach to my extremities. They are extremely uncomfortable. Doom thoughts of having a seizure and/or heart attack take over and I find it impossible to calm myself down. Heart rate is noticeably high. Effects ease after 10 minutes or so and I fall asleep feeling exhausted and drained. Muscle contractions and involuntary movement was prevelant until sleep. Lots of “oh god” moments where I’m definitely out of control and freaking out. Plugged doses were at the 0 minute mark and the 4 hour mark. Smoked doses were throughout the night, but the last resin hit was around the 8 hour mark. I also used 5f-ur-144 throughout the night.

 
-Other notable experiences: I experienced another mild OD occuring after plugging a 10 – 12mg dose and smoing throughout the night with 5f-ur-144. After a resin hit, I realize I had taken too much instantly. Disorientation and the inability to distinguish what things were occurred as well as everything else that happened in the first one. Very uncomfortable and undersirable. Would exercise caution when smoking MIPT resin, and when using in combination with potent synthetic cannabinoids. This exerpeience was much shorter due to tolerance (I had been dosing for 6 days straight at this point).

 
MIPT acts mostly as a psychedelic entactogen with some empathogenic effects. Overall a nice substance, but tricky to dose due to intense dose sensitivity. Milligrams make the difference with this substance. It also lacks the strong psychedelia I would expect from a 5-meo, with its effects falling somewhere between “rolling” and tripping.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,,True,t3_1be168,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1be168/experiences_with_moxy_5meomipt/,

1361832663.0,17,self.tryptonaut,197xru,"Trip Report: An eighth of Albino A+ on Saturday, and three tabs on Sunday (x-post r/psychonaut).",22,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/197xru/trip_report_an_eighth_of_albino_a_on_saturday_and/,"TL;DR at the bottom, just FYI.
So, Saturday afternoon comes around, my friend L and I both eat and eighth of shrooms on pb&amp;j sandwiches (it's A LOT of shrooms for my third time shrooming) and about half an hour they start sinking in. We took them around 2 PM.
I'm watching the walls breathe, I go outside and I see a bush that looks like the leaves are all green starfish with smiley faces and they were all waving at me. We decide to long board to tempe town lake, about a five minute ride. We get there and the tough mudder race is still going on, so there a lot of people watching the race and a lot of runners, and there were a TON of sail boats on the water, by now my shrooms are in full affect. We sit right on the waters edge in quiet and just watch the water and all the different visuals we are getting.
Since we had quite a few shrooms we both start to get a little uncomfortable outside so we decide to go back. We cannot ride a board at this point lol, so we walk back, I can barely pay attention to what's going on around me, but I'm obviously still able to compose myself. Everything looked like I was watching a movie, like there were no dimensions. I'm staring at the ground and I see typical repeating patterns, the same pile of rocks with each step, so it felt like I was getting nowhere. We get back, and my trip is going HARDCORE. Closed eye visuals, I saw a lot of stuff lol. Crazy scenes were playing out in my mind. I was literally watching a claymation movie in my mind, all these random things were happening and popping up and moving. At one point I felt like I was watching the scene from above, these dolls were popping in and out of the ground, and moving around in a circle, intense for me. By now, I am really contemplating my life and why I've always been so depressed and down and I realized it was because I was trying, my entire life, to make my parents happy, but I always let them down and felt inadequate because nothing I did seemed to get their approval. By now I am crying and questioning everything, L is talking me through everything (he's gay, not that it matters, but he's so open minded and I've known him for so long he was able to really help me) telling me that nothing I did was wrong. I ask him if I was gay, since I was never allowed to explore my own sexuality growing up in an extremely religious household, and he tells me I'm most likely not, maybe a little curious, but definitely not gay, and I realize he is right. This goes on for about an hour, I'm sitting on the floor crying and holding my head (still HARDCORE fucking visuals) and then out of nowhere, I realize that I was not making ME happy. I left behind my art because my parents never liked it, I left behind my academics because I never seemed good enough for them, and finally I come to accept that my parents don't control me. They just did a really great job of bringing me down to their level of insecurities with themselves, and I finally was able to accept my past and move on. Like, out of nowhere I just felt amazing and happy, and completely content with life. I worked out all of my problems and demons and I couldn't stop smiling all night. I just literally felt like I found complete happiness.
I sleep on the couch at L's, my trip finally stopping around 9, I wake up in the morning and go home and contemplate what I learned. I still can't get my smile off my face. I get home, sit around for about an hour and a half, and decide to take a tab of acid (again, around 9:30).
20 minutes later this trip sinks in while I'm in my living room. Everything looks kind of kaleidoscopic, very bright and vivid, a lot of movement and melting and breathing. I go outside and take an hour long walk around my apartment complex and the park by my apartment. I am so incredibly happy at this point I'm almost crying because I am so content. I am just thinking and thinking about everything I learned, and then I go home and start drawing and painting in my sketchbook for the first time in years. It felt so great to create something so beautiful, it seemed like my true artistic abilities were coming out.
I realize at this point I want to take up art again and let it build. Now, around 4 I take a second tab and walk with my roommate to the mall right down the road (where he works). I get back and a girl I've been talking to (A) comes over, and she takes a tab, and I take my third one. I feel so amazed by everything, everything is so beautiful, I literally cannot contain myself. We go on a walk with our friend D (he took a tab too) and we just walk around and look at everything and talk about whatever comes to mind. We get back to my apartment around 7ish, and we watch some simpsons and paint and draw and make more art. We are all having the best times of our lives. I go in my room and meditate for about 15 minutes. I am just sitting there, thinking about how I feel like a completely new person, like I died on saturday and I was reborn with all of my past fears and inhibitions and insecurities all behind me. I just start crying on my bed about how much I love myself and who I am and how I am going to be happy now. After that, we all just hang out and trip the night out, I finally go to bed around 3, my trip was still going pretty hard.
I am so happy today, like completely and utterly happy. I am just completely mentally exhausted lol. I learned so much about myself, and I really want my psychologist to talk to me about what I learned. Even though it may seem like I had a horrible trip, I am so grateful for my experience. I feel like my third eye is open, like I found true happiness, and my purpose in life is to make myself happy before trying to please others.
Thanks for reading, but the TL;DR is that I had an incredibly enlightening experience about myself this weekend, I feel like I left behind a lot of insecurities and depression.

Our experience of time as linear and space as three-dimensional is very compelling and convincing. As a result of it, we tend to believe that these characteristics of time and space are mandatory and absolute. In holotropic experiences* (what Grof describes as moving in the direction towards wholeness, aka altered states of consciousness) *we can discover to our surprise that there exist many important alternatives to our usual perception and understanding of these two dimensions. In visionary states, we can experience not only the present, but also the past and, occasionally, even the future. The sequences of events can appear circular, they can unfold along spiral trajectories, or actually run backwards. Time can also stop or be altogether transcended. On the levels on which cosmic creation occurs, the past, present, and the future coexist rather than follow one another and, consequently, all the stages of the process are happening simultaneously.*

1328248568.0,17,self.tryptonaut,p8wyl,Taking a trip with Mescaline.,17,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/p8wyl/taking_a_trip_with_mescaline/,"I'll be taking a trip with some San Pedro this weekend and I wanted to see if you guys had any suggestions on how I can make it the most beneficial. It's my first time taking mescaline, but not my first trip. But it is going to be my first solo trip, excluding Salvia, but I haven't received very strong effects with that.

I plan on making a tea out of probably 18 inches. I plan on throwing away the core but I was wondering if I should keep the white tissue, which I heard has little active compounds, and is behind alot of the nausea. I'm going to try to drink it by itself but if it is as unbearable as I have read I might mix it with orange juice or something.

I also plan on ingesting 3 Datura seeds and some Harmaline.

Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.


10:57AM:
Today's the day, this morning around 8AM I started preparing it. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get datura seeds, but I do have the harmaline. I used 1 1/2 feet. One section was a half foot, which I tried to get only the green skin, but still had some white tissue left on. The foot long section was the entire cactus, with the core. I blended each piece after cutting them up along with water, then filtered it. At the beginning I tried to add more water and blended again after I filtered the first part, but the blender only blended the bottom so for the rest I only filtered it once. (Squeezing the water pulp in a cloth) After I got all the liquid separated from the pulp I tried to boil it, but keeping the temp below 170, but I lost confidence in that quickly so now it's in the fridge cooling down, I'm gonna jump in the shower and get in the right head space, probably clean up the house, ingest the Harmaline (200mg) a bit and aim for starting to drink the gallon of yellowish green liquid at noon.

I've had only a tangerine and half an apple and I'm going to try to stay away from eating until into the trip.
I tried to identify the cactus to make sure it was San Pedro this morning but I wasn't able to tell if it is Trichocereus pachanoi or Trichocereus pachanot (PC San Pedro), a clone of SP which I have read has no enthobotanical use. We'll just have to wait and see.

11:14AM:
I threw back 200mg of Harmaline and chased it down with water. My first step on the journey. I'm going to wait 30 minutes before I start drinking.

11:45:
Cheers! I've put on some light psyambiet and have taken my first sip and at first was not that bad, the lime juice definitely covers up the weirdly spicy...unique, flavor of the SP. But after it goes down your throat it leaves this weird, unpleasent taste for a couple seconds. It isn't exactly horrible, but I can't see how someone could just chug this much down. I've started to feel 'different' right before I stated to drink it. I'm definitely feeling some head oriented effects, but they must be placebo or just from getting into this set and setting. I'm going to try to drink the rest by throwing a straw down the back of my throat and passing my tongue.

11:51
Getting up to walk around definitely enhances this weird head space. Some light disorientation is definitely there, I have a light cold, just a slightly stuffy nose, but I felt fine before. No visual effects or thought changes, so it must just be one of the most powerful placebos I have ever felt. Not really sure to worry or to give in. Back to drinking. 

Maybe it's just the SP settling in my stomach, the actual effects shouldn't start until 2 hours or so after. I'm spelling errors more often than usual, but not alarmingly so. Three sips and I'm close to a pretty good sativa high, minus the thoughts. 

Thought I was going to throw up, but it was just a burp. Kinda feel uncomfertable, but I'm trying to have good thoughts. When I walk around I hear slight buzzing around me, kinda waving back and forth, left and right. But when I stop it also stops. I'm hearing buzzing from electronics more than usual. Not sure how much I'm going to drink. Happy thoughts.

12:07: Threw up, projectile. Felt relieving though. The uncomfortable-ness went away, but some effects are still here. Might have to drink the rest in the bathroom...

Got a rough road ahead, but I'm sure it will be worth it. Just gotta focus on the goal, forget the pain.

1:41PM: I went to go lay on the couch and rest when I threw up again. I feel asleep, kind of half asleep. Had some weird visions. I am defiantly not going to try to drink it some more. I just can't stand it. I sitll have the weird effects from earlier. But I still feel kinda bad. I'm going to go lay down some more.

2:34PM: I slept some more and I'm feeling better. Walking around makes it all more uncomfortable. I'm just laying down for now and am just going to chill for the rest of the day,  maybe if I'm feeling better, go smoke a little bowl or something. Just have to ride the rest out.

For now on, I think I'll stay with extracts. I was looking forward to a day of good vibes and chillin, but got handed the other side of the coin. It's pretty much 3:00+ and I still haven't really seen any effects of the mescaline, unless they're hidden beneath the sickness. I drank about half a glass, and I think there was about one - 1 1/2 glasses worth left, but I can't bare to look at the pitcher of urine like mescaline. 

3:56PM: Feeling better, still don't want to walk around to much, but it's better than it used to be. I haven't ate to much today but I don't really have an appetite. I'm not sure if it's the Harmaline that caused the weird high, or if it was just the nausea of the San Pedro, I can't see how you can enjoy the trip while the first half is with nausea. If I ever do this again, I'm definitely going to cut out the white tissue and have some datura seeds with it.

9:58PM: I'm fine now, smoke a bowl a while ago. Got more out of the cannabis from the SP. I would love to try it again, but definitely eliminating the nausea. I had a weird experience when having my eyes closed when I was trying to sleep. Nothing intense, just never happened to me before.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,True,,,True,t3_p8wyl,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/p8wyl/taking_a_trip_with_mescaline/,

I sat down on my bed, inhaled, and let go. I could feel every particle, every vibration in my body, as if it’s connection with the mind was finally felt and my self felt whole again, harmonized, aligned with the rest of the universe, without a worry.

There was still an idea of self-awareness, I still knew I was distinct, but there was ego death, the loss of any egocentric taught. No need to think about myself, there is a oneness, a structure, like a puzzle, where every particle fits in perfectly. My mind was just part of this realm, harmonized with all other matter in this specific place in space-time. Body sensations were incredible and seemingly intertwined with the ecstatic mind set.

The universe is felt subjectively, and so its perfection will also be subjectively felt. Perfection is no simple sensory input, nor is it a specific mindset, it is a specific point whereas all sensory inputs are great and the mind is opened to its fullest, thereby harmonizing the physical and the mental world, bridging the last gap between the body and the “soul”. It's an experience to be lived, as the idea comes from deep within your head, not from the physical realm.

I do believe now that perfection exists, and it always as, and it is the goal that we naturally try to achieve. It is about harmonizing your mind with your environment, and it can be achieved in any ""chemical"" state. Once it is realized/discovered, it's a place that, with practice, can be reached no matter the situation. Once harmony is achieved, that you understand your inner self and your outer self align, along with the rest of the universe, that is when you feel it.",,False,self,t5_2szsa,True,,flairpurplemolecule,True,t3_oqneu,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/oqneu/yesterday_i_witnessed_perfection_taught_i_could/,

I'm someone who deals with chronic pain and a severe mood disorder. I've been hospitalized 3 times for suicidal ideation and for an attempt over the course of a year.

It has only recently dawned on me that when I procured some psilocybin from a friend (a half oz for free - so awesome of him) that I could really use a trip and hopefully use it to my advantage. 

I have read many studies on how psilocybin affects mood disorders and PTSD in a positive way so I decided to give it a shot. I have been warned not to use mushrooms when you are depressed but it is in my humble opinion that if I am ready to make the ultimate self sacrifice then why not go for a trip, because there is seriously nothing worse than being actively suicidal. 

I've only had 1 trip so far but am planning on the second one soon. I took just 1 gram on an empty stomach. I experienced a wide range of emotions, from euphoria (the first time I ever felt it) to mourning my old self (before the chronic pain). It was emotionally exhausting. After I came down I went to sleep but was woken by what I thought was a ""waking nightmare"". I woke up with the worse migraine ever. All I could do was scream.  All I saw was black, like I had no vision. I tried to get up and walk but I fell and crawled to the washroom to unload any content left in my stomach. After I cleaned up I smoked some cannabis and was able to go back to bed.

The next day and for the next two months was... me again. My ""old"" self. I haven't felt so happy just because in so many years! As I suspected my *pain diminished* as well. Before the trip I was at a level 7 pain, the day after I was level 4. WOW. No pain medication compares. It felt great to have a smile on my face and going outside and socializing. But after two months the effects went away and I am sliding back into a deep depression again. Thats why I want to try dosing again, but possibly a stronger dose (2.5 grams in tea). I want to avoid getting another migraine though. This is one thing that is holding me back.

Sorry for the wall of text. I appreciate your time, and any thoughts or suggestions you might have to add.

I have never hallucinated so intensely.
So visually all I could see were these really fast moving streams of multicoloured lights. Which didn't have a source or end, or any direction of flow. It was just constantly moving against a faint background of my actually surroundings (lake, mountains, trees and open sky).  Actually, I realised that the only way I could see my surroundings is by looking for this particular kind of distortion that 'real' objects produced on this moving streams of electro-ish lights. 
Auditory hallucination - I could only hear sounds in loop, thus the sound of a bird chirping, my friend giggling and the music would loop and eventually fade out while being replaced by a loop of more recent sounds. 
The weirdest part was that I felt a constant light right above my head (I couldn't figure out if it was emanating from me or if it was just sitting there). If I concentrated on it too much then my entire body would be sort of pulled upwards - my shoulders were pulled upwards till it hurt, my hair seemed like it was standing, I had goosebumps and I was standing on tip-toes. I also had a feeling that my soul (?), life energy or something was being pulled upwards and outwards as well. I resisted this though as it was so unpleasant and uncontrollable.  
This is all the stuff happening outside, my interpretation of it, although it seemed more like revelations, was at another level altogether. I saw really intense tracers. So at one point after constantly moving my hand towards and away from my face (remember the whole time I can only 'see' things because they are distorting the light stream in a particular way) and after some contemplation I remember remarking 'I can see the time-space continuum'. 
I also write a bunch of stuff down - still trying to understand all of it. 
Some of it (unedited) is - 
""There is no meaning there is only the making of""
""No thought process is static. There is no singe idea everything moves in streams of information and our senses can only perceive one way of it existing and the way it communicates with each other. But each of the senses are at the end dimensionless.
""The act of communicating is just you deciding what is real.""
""All of us are just products of a package of dynamic information, whats meaningful is taking our perception of this information - what we call thinking - and sharing it so that it grows and changes and is modified. 
The greatest fallacy - is to think that you can actually understand another's place - situationally, emotionally or through whatever identifiers you and they are using, and by that extension to understand how you exist in 'reality' which is really many different things, it is your perception of reality (for example it really smells right now) what others think of you, what they think of themselves, and how this complexity of information is what we are trying to make sense of at the end of the day. ""

Everyone should be able to exist in a form that allows them to make sense of their surroundings. 
Everything that you feel right now is a process of a multitude of information flowing in a direction, this can either be from a source to an end, or from the past to your future. 
And our existence is a signature which is constantly moving, a signature seems like something static, but these are dynamic signatures, since you are at the same time, constantly being changed by it and constantly changing it, but it is at the same time unique as it is a culmination of information around you perceived in those manners 
Eternity is all around. But the attempt to understand it reduces it constantly. 
Communication is how we determine our position in existence, not only are we processing this information we are also being determined by it and at the same time distorting the information so that it is received differently. All that can be said is that some things are percieved in similar ways

Why acid makes sense – it is a state of existence that allows you to choose what perceptions you think are important for your reality at that point in space and time (so for example this requires verification because the only way you can make sense of things is based on whether other people are perceiving similar things in similar ways?)
The fallacies (?) – universality (more in terms of generalizations) and importance, which Is the sense of whether anything is more or less important, obviously all these are determined by the manner in which you are perceiving information
The problem – why are we nodes of interpretation sent out into the universe to make sense of things in a particular way (which we can say is determined by identifiers such as gender, species which in turn may or may not be determined by what we call physical traits which may lie in mystical energy, chi, or genetics (which seems the most probable but I don’t really know why right now), .
We will always look for meaning and a source and an end. 
What didn't make sense – needs. Everyone clearly has them, its hard to tell how they are so different but really rooted in the same necessities.
What really didn't make sense – self doubt, because that presumes you even know the right way to determine all the information around you, in the first place.""

I'm working on a trip-report trying to interpret all the stuff I have written, but I'm a little mindfucked about it!

This is my first time on this sub. I looked through it and was very pleased with what I read. I have gone through quite a few ritual psychedelic healing experiences. I happened upon a glorious modern shaman in the yoga studio I spend a lot of time at. He brews his own ayahuasca, cultivates his own mushrooms, etc. He spent time in Costa Rica with a true shaman and is certified to take others on the ayahuasca journey. However, this beacon of light has moved to another state.

What he was doing, and what we have done together, have really inspired me to keep searching inward. Through my yoga and rock climbing, I have learned a lot about myself. I feel like I can learn a lot more with a continuation of proper ethnobotanical use. I personally have no clue on how to make/cultivate any of these. I would love to go through that process on my own so that I can put my own work into the process, instead of only my money, as well as being able to trust it fully.

Since I typed all of this out I may as well ask a couple things:

What's your favorite ethnobotanical? And why?

Any advice?,17,1,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1ia6ei/using_mushrooms_for_the_first_time_next_week_any/,"So basically, using for two reasons:one, promising research pointing to psilocybin therapy for depression (which my shrink thankfully fully embraces and endorses) and two, generally communicating with nature/ethereal planes/what have you. 

The product is clean (thank you shroomery for instructions) and I've got my wife (who is my best friend and confidante) babysitting me. I've read multiple guides, she's read multiple sitting guides, and I've done a fair amount of preparation as far as set and setting. 

I plan to take them at home and basically lay out in my backyard, which is completely covered on all sides by plants and trees, blocking views from neighbors. I plan to lay in the grass, listen to some music, and basically hear what the earth has to say to me. Depending on my mood, I may have her take me to a nearby nature preserve, or the beach, if I feel like swimming. 

I'm just wondering if any of this sounds like a bad idea, or if you guys have any fun experiments to suggest (I already plan on attempting to keep track of time, use ESP, etc, just basically goofing around, not expecting to get super powers here).  Am I missing anything?

This sublime recognition temps what is to be, and not be; what is, and what is not; how we are, and are not. Over the course of life, time will eat you alive. You're cornered by nature's inevitable cycle of growth and decay, unmatched by the nature of ourselves. You're trapped by a string of existence, a tangent line brushing against arbitrary points and qualified by the test of time; existence's only value lasts in it's duration through the rhetorical power of expressions in our idealized history. What is life, what is time, and what's it worth to you?

You perpetually move forward, headlong to an undisclosed destination that you can never expect. You shift from playground to classroom to office to tombstone, all while gallantly cascading through the stepping stones of time. Watch the path as it narrows and winds, look back to see the long years of your life, then look forward and know what is waiting for you. Days become weeks become months become years becoming and going til they all slide by as if they had somewhere to be. They wait for no one, especially you, as the hands keep on turning and the tide keeps on rolling in. Where does the time go, where were you when it was here? 

Time goes nowhere you haven't been. It sits, moving yet still, watching you from afar. It strokes its beard and pulls the smoke from its pipe, content with its unwavering stare. Meanwhile you divide it up, marking it left and right, figuring out how to spend it. You sell it like a commodity and then wait for it when you have no more left. You breathe it in and spit it out when you've used it up, taking it for granted. It doesn't care though, because what are you, to it? Just another short lived fly, fluttering in fading undulations.

Is time alive? Can time think and feel? What does it mean to truly live? Can you see it, the albescent void of nothingness? Can you touch the air around you, even if it has no form? Can you hear idle words, if they have no meaning? Can you even know what time is?

Time is every moment you've ever lived up to now – everything you've ever done or said, happened at one time. Time is 12pm through 12am that one time all those years ago on your birthday, and each year subsequently. Time is the scars on your body, the wrinkles on your hand. Time is August 30th, 1984 when U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery takes off on its maiden voyage. Time is the Gregorian calender, the hourglass, the lunar cycle, and the seasons. 

Time is the frame of everything around us, everything that life has been and ever will be.

The time you have is a blessing.

The time you've lost is a curse.

You live to die and die to live, all in one fell swoop of existence. You live, growing physically, growing mentally. You expand and develop, teaming with an aura of sentience in everything you do. You stabilize, your actions become habits and your habits become your life, unfolding in unavoidable circumstance. You wait, bracing yourself for the inevitable collapse of your own ruin. You die, decaying physically, decaying mentally. You wrinkle and devolve, shrinking into the creases of your skin, left to be.

It's the supposed time limit which makes life so precious. Life without death isn't life at all. This value of life creates a value of self, and self is everything. You are a tangent sequence of telomeres dividing and multiplying into a universe of the unknown. You are a line with unlimited possibilities and existences, only you have to realize it.

The world is spinning. You look up and see everyone else, they're perfectly fine, just living their lives. This isn't true. What you see is the in between of life, the footsteps taking you to and from the corners of living. At one point these people tried to live, now they just try to survive. You realize that time stops for no one. We're swarmed by a wave of bullshit, dictating what can and cannot be, surrounded by an endless pressure to conform. Cut your hair short, put on makeup, take your pills, make money pay taxes.

And all this time, time ticks slowly by, biding its time while you waste yours. 

Someone at my school got hit by a fucking car. Someone I knew overdosed alone in their apartment. Someone I met took a bullet in the chest in Afghanistan and never came back. Someone I saw hung themselves out of desperation. Someone's Grandfather just died, leaving their Grandmother in a daze.

Their family, their friends are breaking down. 

and here we are, sitting on time, reading papers, listening to music, pissed over something so trivial but right now it seems so important. Time is the devourer of all things, it flies and ends unexpectedly, even though it continues on without you. Life is the time you hold closest to you. Your life makes up this time through the will of the surface values of your conscious mind. Live your life, live your time, live your mind, the way it was meant to.

Here is the post for reference: http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/11vcqx/insectoid_aliens_wtf/

The insectoid, mantis-like entities are benign and nothing to be afraid of. They appear to be the same entities that Terence/Dennis encountered at la chorrera. At least I know Dennis talks about meeting mantis-like aliens at some point.

The digeri-doo vocalizations, now that's an interesting topic. I was recently in Peru, where the shaman leading my ceremony began making similar vocalizations upon the onset of ayahuasca. As it turns out, it's a traditional form of singing in remote locations of Asia: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0djHJBAP3U

It has a long tradition in Buddhism, and forms of shamanism older than that religion. I realized on aya that I have past lives in Asia. I was channeling my ancestors, those were the ancients trying to 'possess' me. 

It's not as scary to me now, to know that they are my ancestors, and not some evil weird thing from another culture. Sometimes I am afraid of the unknown or the new or the unexpected. Also, I began having dreams after I attended Burning Man (where this occurred), involving ancient, Asian Masters teaching me the ways. Telling me at what time of day to meditate, and why, and how to do it properly, etc. etc. I didn't realize the significance of those dreams until aya, where I was able to interact with 9 Masters in a state where I'm more... aware. 

This shit is cool.

Edit: just to clarify, this report is all subjective and related to my interpretation of events, that I have rationalized in this manner for the sake of my sanity. My viewpoints continuously change as I continue to make observations, but at the current moment, I speculate that there is some-sort of morphic-resonance energy field of collective human imagination, that we tap into with aya/DMT.

I've smoked DMT twice now, but I just smoked it again last night and it was 10 times crazier than the other times I tried it. The first 2 times, It felt like I only saw a bunch of rotating geometrical patterns. Here's what happened last yesterday, I was in my brother's room, sitting on his bed with the lights dimmed and we had candles and fizzy pop incenses lit. I had this native american tribal song for background noise called ""chant to the sun""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_baloCb-nM My brother, his friend, and I all meditated for about 20 min. (they take their Hyperspace journeys seriously) Then without any words being spoken for that entire time, my brother hands me the pipe. I blast the pipe smoothly for about 15 seconds exhaled then repeated. On the second exhale my body started to become very relaxed, But my heart rate was building up. I felt like it was going to burst through my chest. Then I start becoming very drowsy. I wanted to put the pipe down but they made me take on more. After the 3rd and final hit I start hearing this really loud buzzing sound and realized everything in my vision started to vibrate. All of the sudden every single muscle in my body felt like they had strings on them attached to 50lb weights including my eyelids and I basically just went limp and laid down and closed my eyes. I felt like I was dreaming My whole body was relaxed but my mind was far from it. Next thing I know I'm floating through a pitch black space with out any stars, slow at first. Then I start picking up speed and lights started shooting past me and next thing I know im traveling at the speed of light through a tunnel. My visions while traveling through this tunnel were just colors. The colors were synchronized into the music, which was amazing. If the music was calm then the speed and intensity of the colors would also be calm, but if the music started speeding up then so would everything else. At the beginning It was all slow dark bluish purplish kaleidoscopes, then towards the end it changed to a faster brighter greenish reddish kaleidoscope. While in this ""tunnel"" my conscious was fighting if this was all real or just a dream. I was in such awe by these visions that I completely forgot about my body. I felt like I wasn't on this earth anymore but in a spirit realm of some sort. As soon as I started getting nervous about what was going on, I realized my body back on earth wasn't breathing. It was such an awesome sight that I wasn't worried about breathing and just totally forgot about doing it. All of the sudden I realize the tunnel is coming to an end but at the end is a room. Ill do my best to explain what happened after that. Next thing I know Im in this room but its not a room, its a place  made out of light and energy, The walls, ceiling, and floor were all the same colors I saw in the tunnel. (my body back on earth still has yet to take a breath, now my lungs were starting to hurt). Then this figure starts to form across the room. I started getting very frighted by what ever it was. Finally he fully developed in my vision. It had the body of a person but the long head and neck of a praying mantis. He kinda looked like that Zorak dude from the brak Show. http://www.314chan.org/b/src/134907924817.jpg 

His skin wasn't green tho, it was very strange. It was the same color as the room. Let me note though this being and the room had no solid color, the colors were always moving. Kinda like Hypno toads eyes do in futurama. like so http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W84DLa0CLNE 
I about shit my pants when he started talking to me. He wasn't using words to communicate, he was speaking to me telepathically. Our conversation went a little something like this.(body back on earth still holding its breath because its petrified)

Entity: ""Hello! welcome to this wonderful place, Its beautiful here isn't it?! You have no reason to be afraid , nothing here will cause you harm, only pleasure. So go ahead and take a nice very deep breath for me for me and just let go of everything that is holding you back.""

(All of the sudden I exhale and feel my chest expand back on earth and i started breathing again. It was the literally one of greatest feeling of my life. Its like I just exhaled all the stress and worries in my life at once in one big breath. And I was just completely mellowed out after that. And this thing didn't frighten me anymore, All he wanted was for me to gain his trust. When this thing was looking at me It felt like he was staring into my soul. He knew every little thing I did bad in my life but still loved me for it. It was the strongest feeling of love I have ever experienced. A mother loving her child didn't compare to this love.)

Entity: ""I'm so happy your back here, Ive been expecting you."" 

Me: ""Umm.. yea Ive never been here before"" 

(But for some reason It felt like I have been there before, It felt like Ive been there longer than the life I've lived on earth.) 

Entity: ""Silly boy you come all the time! I get happier and happier every time I see you"" 

(It just felt so curious about me, like in a weird uncomfortable sort of way, Like the feeling you would get if you found out you had someone stalking you. When itsaid that I started thinking, Is this thing god or something? I just travel across the universe, This thing knows everything Ive ever done and loves me for it? Maybe I do come here all the time, Maybe my mind does this little travel thing every time I'm unconscious. Via sleeping and what not. Maybe this is the place my mind was at before I was at before I was born into my body and the place my mind will go when My body back on earth stops working)

Entity: ""Come over here, I Have a gift for you""

Me: ""You do?!?! Awesome! Thank you so much"" 

(So my weightless mind or spirit I like to call it, floated over closer to him. Now he was up in my face. And I was kinda sketchy about how close he was now. So He hold this thing up to show me but I couldn't make out what it was. Every time I tried to look at I would lose focus of it and it would become blurry but i could see it perfectly in my peripheral view. From what i made out of it it was a glowing goldish plate of energy, it was a control switch of some kind. It controlled how the colors/light energy in the room worked.) 

Me: No thank you, I don't have any experience with it.(i felt like it pressured me into taking it, but my stubborn ass politely denied) 

(Next thing that happened freaked me out and ended my trip)

Entity: ""Oh, alright then. We will save it for next time. Can I have permission to caress you then?"" 

(When it said that, I instantly got as nervous as I was when i first saw it I didnt no what it meant when it said it wanted to ""caress"" me, i instantly thought holy shit this thing wants to touch me with his alien hands EWWW no thank you. I also started becoming self conscious in myself, ""man Im such a dick I come to his world and deny his gift I bet he hates me now"". Next thing I know hes coming at me At a fast pace, ""Maybe he hates me now! maybe he wants to hurt me! holy shit he moves so weird, I wanna go back home fuck this shit ive had enough!) 

My eyes have been closed this whole time, I finally open them. All the sudden, WHAM! I lean up really fast with my eyes wide open and im back in this realm, this world, this earth, this reality. It felt like one huge long ass dream, you know one of those dreams you have when you wake up in the morning and your like ""damn that dream felt like it went on all night"", and you kinda dont remember it all at first becuase it was so long. My trip wasnt finished yet though, still had some badass visuals. It felt like everything i was looking at in my bros room was made up of cartoon material including him and his friend. It felt like my vision was a neon bright simpsons episode.  My body felt like i just got 12 hours of sleep. eventual after about 5 min everything was back to normal and i was trying to collect my self to what just happened. I took that first hit at 3:15 and i check my phone to see how much time went by and to my surprise it was only 3:25. That drug made 10 mins feel like 3 hours. I Cant wait to try dmt again, I hope I meet with the entity again and this time i wont be a chicken shit and will actually take the gift. I did some research today because im still in shock about what happened and im convinced this thing i talked to was god from reading this http://www.souledout.org/earthday/mantis/pm.html anyways that took a shit longer than i expected it would lol just once i started typing i couldnt stop. Thanks for reading, if you have tried dmt Let me know if you share anything similar to these experiences also did i have an ego death?

Ayahuasca is not orally active DMT, it is something a little different, but DMT oral is involved. With the other 3 entheogens mentioned, I have a VERY hard time integrating the experience.

DMT is the portal,'but it's too short to integrate. 4-aco-DMT is somewhere between ayahuasca and shrooms and DMT, and very very bizzare. There are alot of differences between species of shrooms, and probably ayahuasca as well. Every shroom has a distinct pattern, and those patterns are reflected in the artwork of the insidious people. Mayan, Aztec, pacific northwest, I have clearly seen the artwork of all those cultures. You enter the collective conscious of the people. You can pick up the vibe of thousands of years of ritual. With designer drugs, we are the ones who determine what the hallucinations will be for generations to come. With aco, I entered the collective of the internet designer drug forum scene.

1343637192.0,13,self.tryptonaut,xdte9,(X-post psychonaut) POLL: Personality percentages of this subreddit using the MBTI scale.,14,1,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/xdte9/xpost_psychonaut_poll_personality_percentages_of/,"Hello, out of all the drugs the most common MBTI personality types I have seen are;

- **Introverted/extroverted**

Almost all of the psychonauts I have met that have used the MBTI scale are introverts.
We should take into account how the computer attracts introverts so we should expect almost all poll takers to be introverted

&gt;  *Extraverted Characteristics*

&gt; - Act first, think/reflect later

&gt; - Feel deprived when cutoff from interaction with the outside world

&gt; - Usually open to and motivated by outside world of people and things

&gt; - Enjoy wide variety and change in people relationships


&gt;  *Introverted Characteristics*

&gt; - Think/reflect first, then Act

&gt; - Regularly require an amount of ""private time"" to recharge batteries

&gt; - Motivated internally, mind is sometimes so active it is ""closed"" to outside world

&gt; -  Prefer one-to-one communication and relationships


- **Intuitive/Sensing**

I am not sure about this one, I have seen more sensers liking ketamine over other drugs, and more intuitive people like LSD/DMT types of dissociatives.
I am interested in the results here.


&gt; *Sensing Characteristics*

&gt; - Mentally live in the Now, attending to present opportunities

&gt; - Using common sense and creating practical solutions is automatic-instinctual

&gt; - Memory recall is rich in detail of facts and past events

&gt; - Best improvise from past experience

&gt; - Like clear and concrete information; dislike guessing when facts are ""fuzzy""

&gt;  *Intuitive Characteristics*

&gt; - Mentally live in the Future, attending to future possibilities

&gt; - Using imagination and creating/inventing new possibilities is automatic-instinctual

&gt; - Memory recall emphasizes patterns, contexts, and connections

&gt; - Best improvise from theoretical understanding

&gt; - Comfortable with ambiguous, fuzzy data and with guessing its meaning.


- **Thinking/Feeling**

More commonly we see thinking psychonauts, however this community heavily attracts one type of feeler, (the personality type which I forget) so we could see maybe 25% feelers posting in the poll.


&gt;  *Thinking Characteristics*

&gt; - Instinctively search for facts and logic in a decision situation.

&gt; - Naturally notices tasks and work to be accomplished.

&gt; - Easily able to provide an objective and critical analysis.

&gt; - Accept conflict as a natural, normal part of relationships with people.

&gt; *Feeling Characteristics*

&gt; - nstinctively employ personal feelings and impact on people in decision situations

&gt; - Naturally sensitive to people needs and reactions.

&gt; - Naturally seek consensus and popular opinions.

&gt; - Unsettled by conflict; have almost a toxic reaction to disharmony.


- **Perceiving/Judging**

Perceiving people are more likely to ""go with the flow"" ""live in the moment"" however we see many Judgers interested in looking at how personality works and finding their own ways to  be interested in the mind.
This one can be a mix bag and I am not sure if either one will be out numbered significantly.

&gt;  *Perceiving Characteristics*

&gt; - Comfortable moving into action without a plan; plan on-the-go.

I had had a detrimental life path involving dopaminergics (to each their own, but I go completely skitzed on them), although I was fortunate enough to have this subreddit as a way to ""see the light"" when my life was mostly darkness. 

I strongly believe that I suffered from nerve damage due to the things I did to myself, and that those may have permanently affected my ability to do certain things. However, it is my understanding that through exercise and continuing to stimulate my mind through books and socialization that my body will repair most of said damage.

I had a fabulous experience with acid that cured a cocaine addiction, and later an experience with mushrooms and a chemical called 25i-NBOMe that led me to an understanding of consciousness that I like to think of as a transition into adulthood. I won't talk about the effects of the trips, because one can deduce that from reading. However, what we can also deduce is that we are interconnected. Sometimes I feel so close to the others around me that it hurts. I was a very isolated child, and I'm still very withdrawn. I'm more and more open and positive each day, though it can be very taxing letting people know that you don't want to deal with negativity. The Buddhist principle of the ocean of suffering is pervasive at times, though there is an ocean of amazing bliss as well. I try my best to generate positive thoughts and ideas, although my family at times seems irreparably negative and a bad influence. It can be difficult to transition thoughts that were once negative In the context of a flawed perception and correct them when you've thought about them and seethed and lamented for years. Memories conjured by faces. That sort of thing.

Let me put it a different way: I'm new to this. I had to go get my driver's license the other day, which is difficult to admit because I'm 20. Every time I've driven so far, I've gotten pulled over. 3 warnings, fortunately, no tickets, no arrests. I just drive sort of recklessly but it's getting easier. It's just that the residual effects of tripping have caused me to have time dilation like a mofo, and I get honked at when the light turns green, or I go when the other side turns green. I know there are blinders on the perpendicular street signals for a reason; I find it challenging not to try and beat the system, and get my ass handed to me for not implementing the plan correctly. On the other hand, I have more empathy for the drivers around me, and by no means am I an aggressive driver (On a straightaway I may gun it but I've mastered the inertia of letting up on the accelerator so as to chill out at 5 over). May make some people nervous blasting rap music or whatever. It's just interesting that the thing that is affected the most is my driving.

Do you see? It can really be a challenge to relate to people. I run into certain people who I effortless can lock eyes with without feeling nervous. The other social graces that go along with participating in society are still rough around the edges, for me. But the future is behind us, the past is gone. Thank you for listening. :))))))

It's a religious organization in AZ that has been permitted legal use of Peyote in their religious sacrement. One can become a member of the church and participate in the Peyote ritual for a membership fee and a ""suggested donation"" for the mescaline tea they make for you.

I have an old uncle in Arizona who was once a Triptonaut but unfortunately had to give up psychedelic substances to cope with an alcohol problem he developed later in life. However, he told me that if he ever got the chance he would give up his 'sobriety' to take Peyote (I do not see this as forsaking sobriety, but I guess it doesn't much matter).

Anyway, I would really love to visit my uncle and take a trip with him to the Church for a Peyote experience. Neither of us have taken Peyote, but both have had experience with Magic Mushrooms and LSD.

I just want to talk to someone who has experienced it there first. I can't find many resources on Peyote tea in the first place, making it somewhat hard for me to understand the difference between eating the buttons.

1) I was just browsing youtube, when I stumbled upon a [McKenna lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw-ISdUc19E) about how gender plays a role in psychedelic trips. Some of the comments were rather amusing - your typical ""wow men so much mor enligtnd den women"" ... I find that a tad bit ridiculous. It got me thinking, however. 

(ps. love what he says at the end about how there are thousands of us, reminds me of this lovely subreddit :D) 

My idea is that gender does not play a part in psychedelic experiences. Though that is solely based on how I can imagine a trip would go for the opposite sex, I have no evidence, obviously. I can't vouch for a man's trip since I am a woman. I've always felt a oneness, though, when I trip, as many people report they feel as well. So I would think that gender would be irrelevant as are the other things that separate us. What do you guys think? 

2) Lately I have been experiencing something very intense. It strikes randomly - there are never any warning signs. It is an intense rush - the exact same feeling I experience during a large wave of a trip. At first I thought they were flashbacks from all of the LSD I've done. I'm not exactly sure. They typically last about two seconds, and they feel immensely physically as well as spiritually and emotionally pleasurable. Identical to a trip. Sometimes they happen while I am listening to music, and they hit me incredibly hard.

I will, however, do my best to recollect as much of that afternoon as I can.

It was lightly drizzling outside, sun creeping through the clouds. Stereotypical day between winter and spring. There was a subtle undertone of new beginnings in the air. The smell of petrichor as I walked up to my friends house set the mood for what was to come. 

I am greeted by two of my buddies, one male and one female. I walk with them to their room, in which resides a large tank of healthy and beautiful freshwater fish. I sit down on the side of the bed, nervously shaking for what I was anticipating. My friend, B, could see I was nervous. We spent the next twenty minutes discussing my anxieties and my expectations. I knew what I wanted to get out of the experience, and I knew WHY I wanted these things. I wanted to see some sort of objectivity; I felt as though I was drifting from my core, and needed some sort of knowledge that would assist me in becoming a better person. I had recently begun feeling more distant from family, and was beginning to have a sort of existential crisis. I was an atheist and had no belief or disbelief in any deity or afterlife, so it raised many unanswerable questions that would make me feel uneasy. I wanted to feel more connected, so I decided to do some inward exploring. This is where DMT came into the picture. 

My friend B knew how to extract DMT from Mimosa hostilis root-bark powder, and taught me how to do it. We did a pull/batch the day before, so I knew exactly where this particular DMT came from. This got rid of any suspicion I could have possibly had. Before learning how to extract it, I did research on the substance and read experience reports. I wanted to go into this as over prepared as possible. Little did I know, it would not matter how much I knew about it, it would still be just as intense and flabbergasting. 

Back to the side of the bed: my friend B asks if I am ready. I tell him I'm as ready as I think I'll ever be. He puts a very small cannabis bud at the bottom of the bowl, and delicately sets the white powdered crystal on top. He informs me that he will be holding the bowl and lighting it for me, which puts me even more at ease. I put my mouth up to the pipe, and he puts the lighter near the crystals. He is very careful not to burn anything, just melt and vaporize. I fill up the pipe, and inhale. The taste and smell are ancient. The plastic-like taste runs through my whole body. As alien as this is to me, I take another hit. This particular hit kicked things up a few notches: objects became more vibrant, matter was lightly pulsating, and this electronic hum in the air became significantly louder than normal. I had to take about 20 seconds to let it marinade. As I sit there, I notice that déjà vu was starting to blend with every moment. I felt as though certain human things were starting to dissolve. I somehow took my third and last hit, and B withdrew to give me room to lay down. The electronic hum became even more loud, as though it's always there and we are conditioned to not notice it. This strong vibration took away my sense of free will, which was a magnificent thing to observe. At first, these alien feelings made me a bit scared, made me want to undo what I did. But I quickly forgot about my feelings, and became fascinated with what was happening all around me. I looked around the room slowly, watching objects fold in and out of eachother. Colors I had never seen in this room were flowing like electricity. Golds, greens, reds, and unknown combinations of earthly colors were introducing themselves to me. I soon became overwhelmed, and decided to lie down and close my eyes.

My mindscape revealed itself to me to be related to matter, as it was folding in and out of itself in various dimensions. I watched infinite self-tessellating objects intertwine and glow gold and red. It was an ancient and beautiful pattern that I will never forget. At this point I wondered why I was experiencing this. What happened next is something I half-expected. I had read up on DMT experiences and knew many, if not most people, have interactions with beings. It was still not something a first-timer can mentally prepare for. These self-tessellating patterns began morphing into hominid shapes. Three beings appeared out of the infinity, what felt like right in front of me. In retrospect, it was INSIDE of me. They still retained several qualities of my mindscape: they were still tessellated next to eachother (even though they seemed to be of a higher dimension), and their “faces” were taking the form of something my mind could understand. I still remember their original forms: wide and happy grins, pitch black eyes, short bodies made of a seemingly unknown energy to me. But this original form soon became replaced with what my mind could make sense of: family. I saw my mothers face, my stepfathers face, and my uncles face. They were, without words, telling me they loved me unconditionally, and were happy to see me. It felt as though they were happily humming into my brain, trying to sooth me and let me know everything was alright. 

Once I came to peace with my experience, they folded back into my mindscape. I felt the DMT loosen its grip, and I opened my eyes. Once I saw my friends B and L, I instantly remembered that I had inhaled DMT. My sober mind started to rise, and I could see things very clearly. I was shaking with excitement, and was rushing through my previous 5 minutes so I could remember as much as I could. I started analyzing every feeling I had during my “trip”, and tried to make sense of everything. As alien as the experience felt WHILE it was happening, I could not shake the sense of familiarity once I came back. It felt like I had been there before, a long, LONG time ago. 

I had come to a few conclusions about my experience at the time, conclusions that I still cannot shake. I felt as though the human condition/experience is partially created/monitored by endogenous DMT. When I inhaled the DMT vapor, I was figuratively turning the frequency dial on my perception. The subtle hum that I heard after the first hit was the sound air particles make when they collide and comingle. I felt as though humans had evolved to not hear the sound since it serves no purpose other than a minor annoyance. Another conclusion I came to was that our brains are programmed to take in certain input and turn that into a perceivable reality. By that logic, when I inhaled DMT I was reprogramming my brain to use different energy as input: energy coming from within instead of from the outside world. In my opinion, the beings I interacted with were a constuct of the human psyche, possibly ancient. This would also explain why almost everyone who experiences DMT has contact with some sort of sapient entity. 

This is where I will wrap up my experience in a nutshell: beginning of spring, went to friends house, discussed my apprehensive feelings with him, went over my goals in my head (wanting to become more aware and connected with things that matter), took 3 large hits in a time span of a few minutes, objects morphed and folded, colors became more intense, déjà vu became more frequent, free will dissolved, humming took over everything, nervousness inevitably subsided, saw the beauty of the human mind, witnessed and interacted with 3 mysterious sapient beings that communicated without spoken words, perceived them as family, realized how loving and awesome my family is, realized how complex the universe really is and how I need to be at peace with not knowing most things, and realized how I need to value this moment to moment experience. Overall a very positive and very intense experience, and was my only time using DMT. I think the reason I had such a positive experience was a combination of the DMT being very pure (white crystals extracted by my friend B and myself), the weather being promising, my friends being quiet and mature, and my willingness to learn what I could from such a bizarre experience. I know I will use DMT again some day, but only when the circumstance presents itself in a proper fashion.

1354904302.0,9,self.tryptonaut,14ge0r,Developing higher dimensional consciousness through archetypes and subjective mythos.,11,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/14ge0r/developing_higher_dimensional_consciousness/,"**Assumption 1: Anything that can be imagined exists somewhere in the infinite (or near infinite) universes of the multiverse.** (If there are an infinite number of universes, it is guaranteed that all possible places and characters of archetypal imagery (or any imagery from art, film, theater, etc.) exist in at least one of the infinite universes.) 



**Assumption 2: Higher dimensional information can be encoded into a lower dimensional substrate.** (Holographic plates are an example of this principle at work, with 3d spatial information encoded into a 2d plate surface.)



**Assumption 3: The brain can be such a substrate, and can assemble higher dimensional perceptions from lower dimensional perceptions.** (Research on the structure of the brain suggests that information is stored in a manner similar to how a holographic plate stores information. Other research shows that the brain assembles the 3rd dimension of vision from information that is sent from the 2d surface of the retina.) 





**Myth as archetypal maps for subjective understanding of one’s own neural connections (experienced as the landscape of mind).**
   

The human brain is hard-wired to work with myth – archetypal maps by which the internal landscape of mind can be navigated. When a psychonaut, shaman, bard, or other explorer of the inner world begins to work with myth, the archetypal characters and places are crude and undeveloped – not much can be understood or predicted using such simplistic mappings. As the explorer begins to create more elaborate details, interconnecting different elements of their mythos, their brain correspondingly becomes more interconnected. Myth becomes the language by which the internal world of the subconscious can engage in dialogue with the conscious mind, with archetypal imagery as the words, and events occurring within the mythos as the syntactical/grammatical contextualization. Archetypal characters and places become the means by which the explorer identifies and maps neural circuits of different parts of the brain, while events in the mythos symbolize the interconnections between the corresponding neural circuits that are represented by the characters and places. As the mythos develops, the overall story is the aggregate of all neural circuits and connections that have so far been mapped. 




**Archetypal/mythos mapping as encoding of higher dimensional geometries into the 3d neural substrate.**


Holographic plates store information in such a way that the information of the whole plate is equally represented in each part, the entire image is stored in every point on the plate and arises through the interactions of the points, not through the points themselves. That is to say, if you cut a holographic plate in half, each half can still construct the entire image intact, though with less detail. The brain exhibits a similar property in that if large sections of the brain are destroyed, or become disconnected from each other, memories can still be retrieved, though with less detail. It could be said that a 4d spacetime image of events are stored into a 3d neural substrate; in other words, memory is a 4d hologram on a 3d substrate. As in a hologram where each point of the holographic plate is connected to every other point, it is as if each neuron has an “address book” for each other neuron that was activated during a particular experience. The memory is retrieved as the activation of a neuron’s “address book” for that particular experience. Thus, encoding of higher dimensions into a lower dimensional substrate is a function of interconnectedness of points on the substrate. 


As the mythos develops, the brain becomes increasingly interconnected and the chasm between conscious and unconscious mind is bridged. Neurally speaking, archetypal imagery are “address books” of neurons, and are 4d informational encodings onto the 3d neural substrate. Extrapolating from what is known about holograms, it could be understood that higher dimensional information is encoded into a lower dimensional substrate by the interconnection of all points on the lower dimensional substrate to each other. Just as an archetypal image itself is an “address book“ of the different neurons involved in encoding the image, so would events in a mythos be an “address book” of the archetypal “address books”. In other words, the individual events in the explorer’s subjective mythos are the extension of neural holography into the next higher dimension, 5d. The overall story arc of individual events in the mythos would correspond to a 6d “address book” of 5d encoded information, and so on. 




**Inner mapping becomes outer mapping.**

As the higher dimensional interconnections of the holographic neural network increase in density and number, consciousness can begin to create higher dimensional schema for modeling reality. As the schema develop, consciousness is able to see the world from a higher dimensional perspective, allowing for exploring other universes in the multiverse or even gaining information from the 3/4d universe in which an explorer’s body resides that would normally be inaccessible (for example, a person in 2d flatland would be amazed by how a 3d person standing above him could tell him what is outside the walls of the 2d flatlander’s rooms). Thus, when a shaman consults the “spirits” (archetypal images) for information about where a lost item is, divining the future, or some other prophetic act, the shaman is utilizing higher dimensional interconnections and schema about the world to gain information from the 3/4d world. 


In some sense, the shaman mentioned above is simultaneously projecting his/her consciousness to the universe in which that spirit resides. By the assumptions listed above, anything that can be imagined exists in a universe somewhere in the multiverse. Thus art, theatre, film, etc. all can be conceived of as higher dimensional perceptions of other universes in the multiverse, with the information brought back to this universe. So, I propose that stories such as “Star Wars” actually did exist a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (in another universe). But the difference between George Lucas and the above mentioned shaman is that the shaman has a two-way dialogue with those other universes, and can request information from other hyperspatial, higher dimensional beings that is directly relevant to this universe.


Bringing it back full circle, images are not inherently real on their own, with respect to the explorer developing an archetypal mythos. When an explorer -begins- to develop their mythos, they are imagining things. But as the imaginings become more elaborate and interconnected, they begin to touch something real, as the explorer truly does peer with his/her own consciousness into other universes.

110mg N,N-DMT extracted from MHRB 

3g Syrian Rue uncrushed, boiled in lemon juice and water evaporated down to 230ml (&lt;1cup)

**Trip Plans:**

Originally I had planned on ingesting everything in my vehicle then get out to hike a specific section of the Appalachian Trail til I got to an elevated clearing where I could setup camp and ride the spiral... with no trip sitter.

Instead, because it was my first time with Pharma and I did not have a trip sitter, I decided to play it safe and stay at my house.


**Setting:**

* My house, mainly my room which is a very relaxing and comfortable setting with everything I need
* Roommate is at work, no one home
* Some traffic noise from road in front of house
* Some train rumbling and occasional whistle from the tracks near the house
* Minor noise from Neighbors moving in


**The Trip:**


*Note: I had fasted for 18 hrs and I was not focused on any single thing for my trip which I think was a mistake*


  I drank the Rue Tea at 11:40 am on Sat and waited till 12 noon to take the encapsulated DMT. For the first 1.5 hours(12-1:30pm) I was sitting at my desktop doing things online but all I could feel was the body load from the Rue I decided to lay down and put on some music.
 

 I put on [Tapha Niang](http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS499US499&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=tapha+niang&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=tapha+niang) and WOW was that ever a good idea! The song peaks at the end and by the time I was listening to it I felt like [this](http://zebbler.com/intcomp/shpongle/2011Tour/shpongle_mask_2d_master.jpg), just in awe of everything and seeing(with my eyes closed) many crazy swirling patterns that went along with the music. 
By 2pm I was having intense CEVs(Closed Eye Visuals) that eventually escalated to OEVs(Open eye Visuals). 
 

 From 2pm - 4:30 is a blur I do know the peak happened around 3:15 and lasted to 4:20 where the trip was as intense and other worldly as vaporized DMT. 
  

The theme of my trip mainly consisted of the idea of the individual and our place in the universe. I remember having a mini freak out about not being able to be self sufficient in the event that the planet Earth decided to reject humans (like our body's rejecting transplants after surgery). It was a crazy idea, I know, but I was scared that I did not have a spaceship or interplanetary vessel with which to escape(I blame this on me watching Prometheus a few times in the last couple weeks).
 

 Around 4pm when I got off my bed and moved around a little my brains personal link to the body was just not there. The hand I was seeing was just a hand, not my hand. 
 

 It occurred to me about 40 minutes later when I was more me, that my body is just a vessel for my spirit on this voyage we call life, it is not the final destination just a vehicle to get through this reality.  
  

I started to come down around 4:30pm but the visuals didn't leave till about 5:20pm and I was back to normal at 5:45pm.


**Notes:**

* The trip was very visual, internal, and a fucking blast. I explained it to a friend as a 4 hour party for my brain.

Evolution is a byproduct of nature. If humans were created by nature, then aren't man-made products also natural? Just because something isn't healthy for humans that does not mean it's unnatural.

## Would something unnatural even exist without nature?

I was on the tail end of a very intense trip. Psychically I was lying in my bed in the dark covered in blankets, wearing my favorite green hat and a scarf that my mother had given me. My being was in a winter forest made of trees resembling pines. I followed a guide to the side of a hill where it pointed out to me a little ""tepee"" made from branches. I was told that I needed to go there but the guide could take me no further. I walked alone to the ""tepee"" and discovered inside it a piece of myself that was mine but had been buried there in that tepee for a long time represented in the form of a bear cub. After this discovery I felt very peaceful and I felt on my soul joyful players dancing all over it, as if they were welcoming a warrior home from battle. So this is where the connection comes in, the dancing stopped and I felt as if I was being enveloped and cradled by the love of my significant other. At this time we were not physically together, he was in one city and I was in another. He was aware that I was going to embark on a trip that night and I asked him to meditate on me and ""send me some love"". He is a frequent lucid dreamer and I asked him the next day if he had had any strange dreams the night before. What he described to me was very similar to the trip I had been on, winter forest, leaving a traveler to go it alone, then comforting a ""child"" (which i assume to be the bear cub I had discovered in the tepee) until it fell asleep.

So someone I know was able to acquire a good 100mg of 4-HO-MET  after I told them about it, and they suggested I try it with them, which I excitedly agreed to.

I took about 13mg (orally) first, and after about 45 min I noticed the effects starting to set in. I was in the bathroom peeing at the time and noticed my piss started to shimmer and look green. I looked around and noticed that a package of tissues had begun breathing. I decided to look in the mirror at myself and noticed my pupils looked like they were fluctuating. At this point I experienced dissociation and some ego loss; I felt that the image in the mirror wasn't actually me, that I was just an observer of my body. I went outside with my friend and we just looked at the sky and yard for a little bit, and I noticed that the colors were more beautiful than I'd seen before! I noticed all the colors that form the rainbow were present, which was a recurring theme throughout the trip. We went inside after a bit and turned on some Blue Angel Lounge and watched the last Lord of the Rings movie (everything looked very distorted, Elrond and Aragorn's eyes and foreheads looked bulgy and pulsating and had a green hue to them), which was FUCKING AMAZING! I really noticed how pretty the movie was as I was watching it. After this, we went back outside and the sun was starting to set. We were looking at clouds in the sky and I started seeing the geometric shapes in the sky; triangles in the sky, squares in the clouds, and a 'matrix' behind the sky. Again the sky was the most blue I'd ever seen! We started a fire (it was cold) and went back inside, where we played with a ball python. I held it for some time and felt like he became part of me, like the line between us was blurred or nonexistent! We back out and ate pizza by the fire, and I commented that I wanted to ""curl around the fireplace like a serpent"". I then decided that the fire was hungry and fed it my pizza (which it burned rather quickly). Went spent some time out and then redosed (13mg more orally, 2 hours after the first hit). The next two hours were similar to the last two, very euphoric and interesting. Noticed the patterns in the stars, the specific tastes in foods, patterns on the walls. At some point I held my friend's dog and lied down on the couch, which made me feel as if the couch and the dog were all parts of me. The comedown was very gentle, there was a clear feeling of ""doneness"", but no drop off.

In retrospect, I certainly have no regrets in trying 4-HO-MET! It was very enjoyable and exciting, very colorful and mind expanding. I felt aware that the drug was causing me not to perceive falsehoods, but that it was helping me to see things that I had just never taken the time to see or hear before. I felt extremely close to nature and gained some valuable insights about myself, and I feel motivated to change some of my ways for the better and to live life more. All in all, fantastic. I would definitely try 4-HO-MET again.

First effects started around 8:20,which was the color shift / boldening of textures on carpet. There was also some sort of melting like effect.I sweated a lot,and all my muscles got relaxed.Tripping hit the peak point at around 9. I started hallucinating. First thing i saw was a green,primitive lady(sort of caveman) which had scary eyes and lips.I kept ignoring them because it was my first time and i was scared,instead i focused on carpet patterns and tried to solve some questions,too keep myself sane.After a while i decided i should focus at them. There was a men with the same women,looked kinda like the picture of thread. They would get scarier.Their foreheads were empty and it was sucking something inside. Their eyes exploded,and teeth bled. I started ignoring them again,and i got aroused after a while. So i started masturbating,same lady appeared but she seemed rather pleasent now. I saw dragons on my dick(good side of having a veiny dick?). I didn't prematurely ejaculate,and i still don't which is good(i used to,before trip). After masturbating same scary things appeared. I focused on lamb this time,there were 8 faces of different colours,they would morph into another things.I moved into another room,and again i saw dragonlike things,and same women who looked angry again.When i got back to my room ,i looked at the ceiling and saw some sort of terraria(game) like life(2d,grass,nature and people etc.)
I looked at the wall and saw 8 women of different colour,they all seemed happy. I was enjoying hallucinations now. I saw green fishes,swimming on the wall. Then i looked at my arm,they were swimming on my arm now,feeding on my elbows,which had blue eyes on them. They were trying to absorb/eat the eyes. I got extremely tired/bored now. Turned on tv. Same lady would appear again and again and again.I put on my mp3,and listened to some music. Hallucinations were unrelated with the music but was in some sort of harmony with the music. I checked my pupils,they were dilated. I also looked at myself,my face was morphing into a catlike shape. Anyway,at like 6 am effects got really low. I was coming down. I went to my house,and played CS:GO,but wasn't doing good.Was still seeing that scary lady on walls. I slept afterwards. When i woke up,i felt okay. There was no depression,my premature ejaculation problem was gone(even after 3 days it still is).  I masturbated like 5 times during the trip.I was also obsessed with the thought of gouging my eyes out.

One of the things that happens with those doses are intense feelings of ""energy"" flowing thru the body. (I have various kinds of crazy theories about what those 'feelings of energy' are all about.)

Something I have become interested in the last few times I did this, are these 'spontaneous' postures and movements I make. I feel as if they are helping me process and ""tune"" the feelings of energy, moving from moments of stress and tension, discomfort, load, like carrying a heavy weight, to blazing moments of orgasmic ecstacy and other kinds of intense experiences.

So last night I tripped on 12mg of 4-HO-MET again and I have to say, though it was still a good experience, it wasn't as altering as my previous trip on it. Now, I've been wondering about a few possible reasons for this.

It's entirely possible I realise that I just didn't trip as hard for some reason. But I do have to wonder, did ingesting small amounts (500mics - 3mg) of test doses about a week or two ago cause changes in my serotonergic system that would have blunted the effects? 

I also think that I'm on Effexor (which I'm trying to wean off of) might be having an effect, though from what I've read Effexor doesn't seem to diminish psychedelic effects as much as other serotonergic ADs for some reason. I have cut out gabapentin, though if anything this should increase the effects.

Finally, in the case that downregulation has occured, how long will it take to 'reset'? And bupropion shouldn't interfere with tryptamines right? Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,,True,t3_18pq8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/18pq8i/questions_about_5ht2a_downregulation/,

I used to do a lot of this kind of thing, but haven't for some years. I fell instantly back into the spirit and ritual of it, circumambulations, offerings, prayers and the like.

But, something I thought was interesting was as soon as I let myself go to any depth at all, my mindscape started showing me the distinctive subthreshold visuals of smoked dmt. Bright wavy lines and lenses in white and yellow going horizontally across a black field, then bursts of brightly colored leave shapes, those distinctive fractal forms I call ""leaves"", in brown and yellow with glorious markings, like a salamander or newly shed snakeskin.

Now, I have been doing a series of expertiements studying the visuals of subthreshold doses, but it's been a week or more since my lest session.

It felt like this - like my mind was eager, like a puppy, to show me something it had learned.

When I took that state, and those visuals, and focused them on my shamanic task, that task seeme dmuch easier, and made stronger, by using the dmt trained mind to do the work.

I hadn't had any other molecules for 24 hours, completely straight, as the straights think of straight.

What I am suggesting is that using the dmt in training sessions may make other kinds of shamanic style work easier.

Oddly, I had been doing satipatthana and several other meditations in the past week, and they did not seem to trigger the dmt visuals, just the typical kinds of visuals one would expect.

I have felt, or rather felt I have been under, the watch of benevolence since I was young. When I am close to danger, engaged in any outstanding facility of mind or body (epiphanies, tides of emotion, precisely executed physical exertion) there is felt a definite connection to something ""outside"" or existing not only in myself. Most acutley when physicality is pushed to its limits in a dangerous setting, hence my love of climbing and running, it feels like a ""worship"" (acknowledgement being a more appropriate term) of my capabilities to exert my presence upon reality. The most vivid experience of this kind I have felt was one time, I was on the back of a dirt bike on the way to Siem Reap in Cambodia, riding without a helmet. A truck in front of us slowed way too fast and the last thing I saw was it coming at us at a ridiculous speed. The next thing I knew I was lifting the bike of my friend who had been driving, feeling a power so strong that I could do nothing but act (no shock/trauma/fear). The friend who had been driving behind us said he saw me pop off the back of the bike before we even hit the truck and bounce onto my shoulder, rolling over my back to stand upright and sprint over to lift the bike. I have no memory of these events.
 When in deep conversation with another(s) to the point where one or both of us come away with some changed opinion it feels as to be the channelling  of a great force through the interaction between us, seeming to exist through the system of interaction rather than being an outside force that is brought in (although may exist objectively? But I do not think so, as nothing may). The existence of this force is conscious, I believe, and appreciates ever being brought into existence(from whence could it have came?) When an emotional deluge is given, and one is comforting and consoling another to overcome their inner turmoil, the presence of benevolent interaction is felt heavily on one and the other. 
Notedly whilst on psychedelics, the great feeling of love and oneness is brought about by the conscious experience (unfiltered or tarnished) of reality, the fabric of your inhibitions and social programming rended to let your actual being of experience look out upon the amazing illusion that engulfs us all. A presence is there, even if it is only my/ourself(s), which I suspect it may be. With others on the substance one can sense the camaraderie of existing, the gift that is active experience and appreciation for existence at all.  We are all but a part of another. The love of everything is the love of self that you feel loves you. ",,False,self,t5_2szsa,False,,neuron,True,t3_octwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/octwp/my_deitymyself/,

Now this is just laymen observation but mushrooms need sun to grow which they dont get enough of most other places due to thick weedy growth upon the forest floor.  We clear landmass by inadvertently killing alot of the weed growth around the paths we walk allowing sufficient sunlight penetration to the ground. Furthermore the dead weeds i could immagine would be great for extra bacterial growth to help cultivate the process.

If my observations are correct then its a wonderful coincidence that mushrooms would have a high growth potential wherever animals and humans 'graze' as multiple walks along the same paths would need to be undertaken in order to sufficiently clear the shrubbery growth along the ground.

~ * ~ * ~ * ~


We as an unified and sovereign body have come to realize the reality of the constant threat of external invaders, leeches, scavengers, and other scum forces, as well as the real threat of internal deteriorating of our very own structures due to not yet fully understood mechanisms. Already in our early age, in times when everything was still provided by The Holy Mother, we recognized the power of cognition as a tool for maintaining The Homeostasis. We have elected a number of our most promising stem cells to serve as a guiding brain of schools of neurons and provided for them anything they have asked for in their study, in our trust of the power of intelligence. It is thanks to this collective of excellent neurons and the Ancient Wisdom of our Genetic Heritage to decide to invest on cognition, as well as thanks to the whole supporting community of nutrient processors, waste processors, distribution logisticians, temperature regulators, border guard, and the Will Of The People, The Musculoskeletal Protective Army... it is thanks to the whole Body Of Yuka, that we have achieved this high level of Inner Peace. It is this recognition of the power of intelligence that has brought us here to inquire with you, the honorable citizens of /r/tryptonaut. It is our wish that we may learn together you, and share any health and longevity related information that we may have.


In our past, we have had many struggles. The civil wars have been the most terrible. We have had our fair share of evil memetic kings. Let me reminiscent over just a couple of such evils...


One time a foul intoxicating alien force got bypass The Royal Guard of The Blood-Brain Barrier, and confused our Holy Ancient Self-Preservation Instinct, and unleashed an evil of the foulest nature, The Mad Memetic Demon-Prince Of Self Mutilation, who appears to have been lying dormant within our Royal Temple, disguised as Macabre Curiosity, never much liked but granted a seat at the Royal High Council nevertheless, and as soon as the Demon was unleashed, it hazed our brave musculoskeletal troops into driving Sharp Objects into the lines of our own border guard. It took a few days before our safety mechanisms (most notably the No Pain Protocol) would activate and vanquish the foul demon-prince from the Royal Throne Room, and a justice would return to the realm. In the end we as a sovereign body would rebuild the broken lines of the border guard, terminate the wantonly spreading illegal immigrants which got into our midsts when the border guard was compromised, and finally we replenished the lost Logistics Plasma, and thus The Homeostasis was regained, but at a horrible cost. Some of the records of those times have been lost to the time, but in our dreams we can still sometimes see the rivers of blood... We have now caged the demon, and now that we are stronger we think we could wield the demon as a tool for a few novel new technologies which some of our more imaginative neurons have been toying around with. “Cyborg Implants” is the word they wanted to to ask you about. Do you know how to do Cyborg Implants?


Another horror story from our past was in the horrible bloody age of Anorexia, when an evil Lich-King Anorexia snuck it's gruesome self into the Holiest Throne Room of The Brain, rose to power and drove the people into a Long Hunger which eventually lead to cannibalistic chaos among all the people, all for the Lich-King’s vain amusement and blatant disregard for the well beings of his subjects. For months we let this alien aesthetic ruin our peace and disrupt The Homeostasis. It is thanks to our determined behavioral guerilla warfare experts in the Binge Eating regiment which were able to thwart the evil Lich-King’s plans, so that our Sanity Corps had enough time to plan their attack and eventually drive out the alien influences from the True Royal Gallery Of Beauty and from The Holiest Throne Room Of The Brain itself...


Those, and numerous other civil wars of unspeakable nightmares, we have endured. Many times have we rebuilt our government. It has all been worthwhile, for we have now achieved a sense of Unity like no before. We are many and one. We all trust each other, and have figured out a way to differentiate friend from foe. It has allowed us to prosper beyond all our imaginations. Every day now we are basking in abundant nutrients, in just the right temperature, enjoying the safety and comfort of a well exercised modern army, and generally just feeling well.


It is in this abundance that we have found the time to direct our studies to the more esoteric subjects of Herbalism, Neigong, Yoga, to name a few. It is our belief that a lot of good can be gained from these technologies, and already we have found new levels of feeling healthy with these technologies. It is with health that we can acquire ever more health.


Which brings us to the purpose of this message:


I, as King Yuka, The Prime Protector of The Sovereign Body of Yuka, The Most Enlightened And All-Loving Protector of The Body, on behalf of my subjects, collectively known as The Sovereign Body Of Yuka (in finnish: *Jukan Itsenäinen Keho*, or *Jukka*), also known as The Head *Lärvi*, The Torso *Pötsi*, The Fist *Oikeus*, The Hand *Kohtuus*, The Leg *Vasen*, The Leg *Oikee*, &amp; The Penis, would wish to enter in an exchange of technological knowledge, especially on the subject of Immortality, with whoever out there is listening. We are friendly people, and would like to exchange mutually prosperous information with all the sentient beings out there, who are not intent on consuming us or our resources. Do you know how to live forever, or at least very long? Please share your health advice.


PS: Conversely, if you are intent on consuming us or our resources or just generally intent on disrupting The Homeostasis, we have this message to you: If youre gonna fuck with any one appendage or ingrowth or a drop of blood of ours, you gonna have to deal with the all of us! We are strong! Do not fuck with us! BOOYAH!

Its not easy to get from my location. I have never smoked it but I am experienced with many other hallucinogens and i probably wont be able to get more DMT anytime soon, so i figured ill just smoke it all at once. I want to break through, after all. I was reading about how best to smoke it, and I settled on the machine, because it seems like the best bet. i have some very specific  questions though, about its implementation, because I would absolutely HATE to waste what little material i have, and i want to get it right. 

First question: How densely should the steel wool be packed in the neck of the bottle?

Second question: how specifically do i 'load' the DMT into the steel wool? The way I understood it is that you put the product on the steel wool, then heat the neck of the bottle until the DMT melts into it.  Is this part difficult? Is there some trick, or some factor to keep in mind? is there the risk that i start to vaporize some of the DMT prematurely? 

Third question: how many deep inhalations from a machine will 50 mg yield? i mean how much should i expect that I will have to smoke to finish it off. I dont want to waste any DMT.

Fourth question: how far from the bottle should i hold the lighter when im smoking? Obviously i dont wanna burn the product or light the wool on fire, but some tips would be nice.

ok, so, one tab of acid(possibly 2 dose's), i tripped balls at the edge of this reality, aware of all the other realities and the other realities that were or were not... because any of those realities where something is different than here and etc. its even more different there and googleplex upon googleplex of infinities of different universe that are only the slightest micron different.. i would have gone  bat shit insane if i hadn't already done shrooms before....so i have a question.

now that I've seen/experienced transcendental one-ness, to the point where i made a bunch of not high people aware that we were the same one yet different on so many levels you cant tell weather that person is more or less like you than you.

and had what i can only assume was ego death as i felt no cares, worries, or trepidation....but, now what? i know i am you and you are me and god is one and we are e for wee reach oneness, enter the void and begin gain, ready to argue with ones self instead of moving on, again...such is Penn and teller explaining the universes funniest joke, Siegfried and Roy, Jesus and Judas, Poe and the raven, etc, etc, it's me arguing with me about the other mess because me kicked that one me off a bridge...but then went and donated at a soup kitchen...it's all much more complicated than it looks but it's so siple it brings that feeling of what your average straight edge could explain away ""ohh, that guy's just on drugs, ignore him.""

yeah? well i was on drugs and i seen how your daddy didn't take you to any outside activities, or how that one kid you tried to be friends with pushed you...i feel bad about that, i really do....i can say i empathize with you on a level i don't think anyone has before.

i know others have said that and others have meant it maybe more than me...but i mean it as much as i've meant anything my entire life.......i hold the answers to this earths salvation, and weather anyone listens or not, because on some levels they already know the answer, that's why nobody listens to the high guy....sorry for all this ranting, but i needed to get it out in the way it came to me.


the big thing now is...who do i share the knowledge with? i have all the answers, i want non of the limelight, i need to find that big smile and soothing voice, that also legitimately wants to help people, because i don't have the teeth or  charisma for it.


so when you know what i know, and they know what i know, but we all know it on different levels, we all hold these truths to be self evident and they are, to ourselves, but not other's because the awareness is only 60% out of [1-0] or only 250 degrees on an oven set to 500, etc.   i hope you can understand the ways in which i mean this with using such fractional thought patterns.

so my question is........if i' you and your me and we are all the universe experiencing itself subjectively is it the job of the googolplox's of me's in different universes  throughout all of not history to just be the stoner, the person taking too much drugs, telling everyone they need to lighten up, everyone going yeah yeah yeah, and then lightening up, while still ignoring the stoned guy? is that the lot in the circular circuit that is the improbability drive of the shuttle holding all of earths dna, running  scenario after scenario to see if we could ever repopulate and not wreck shit like we did before....and if so/not why wont anyone listen to anyone who wants to help? why is it always the enxt big fuck up in charge, the next big bomb dropper, the next big war....what the actual fuck guys? we're in 2012 now, in my current physical life form i've seen marijuana reform all over, i've seen an oil catastrophe that nobody talks about anyore. i see people being killed for no reason for some reason for a good reason and for shit reasons...why can't we all just get along?

He didn't have blotter, but a vial. I was pretty intrigued because I haven't seen acid in its liquid form yet. He pulled it out of a black silk sack, grabbed two sour patch kids, some tinfoil, put a drop on each candy, individually wrapped them up in the intentionally mangled foil which the candies were on, placed the two little rectangular foil wrapped candies in a little drug baggy, and all in less than a minute. This guy looked like he knew what to do and I trusted my friends testimonies of this acid, but, as I sit here two and a half hours after taking one of the hits and almost an hour after I decided to take the other hit, I begin to question the potency of whatever I bought. I bought the acid a week ago, wrapped the drug baggy in foil and put in a sandwich bag that has been in the freezer since this morning. 

I let the sandwich bag containing the foil wrapped drug baggie containing foil wrapped acid dosed candies come to room temperature. I let the candies sit under my tongue until it breaks at the slightest pressure and chew it into nothing.

I just really want to see the way other facets of reality view this experience.  Thanks for the patience.  Enjoy, if you will.

To begin with, I am 20 years old, 100 pounds, and have been using drugs for a little over three years- psychedelics for two of them. I have tried a handful of prescriptions, plenty of weed, mushrooms, lsd, MDMA, n,n DMT, 4 HO-MET, 2ci-Nbome, DXM, salvia, and a handful of other drugs I can't remember off the top of my head. Usually 1.75 grams of cubensis don't push me to this level. Yesterday, however, they afforded me the opportunity to truly become something else.
It was an overcast, grey, but warm(ish) ((high fifties low sixties)) day. For ease, I am going to replace my name with A. My two closest companions J and D were with me, D (also J's girlfriend) had come into town a couple of days ago (Thursday night actually) to see J (my roommate). We had all planned originally on going to J's home and take mushrooms in the woods, but various circumstances kept us from leaving. D tripped on Friday by herself (her first trip!) and J and I trip sat. Watching her discover all of the things that I love about Mushroom made my inhibitions about tripping melt away. When the the next day dawned warm enough to go outside, and strangely quiet for our part of town, I decided it was high time to commune and go home. I asked J if he wanted to join me- he said yes. After a quick thank you to the spirit, I ate around 1.25 g of mushrooms, by rubbing clementine slices around in the powdered mushrooms- golden teacher strain to be exacting. Another .5g of them went on a tiny peanut butter sandwich. While we waited for the effects, I filled out this month's rent check, already noticing some funny things about time, date, numbers, letters and writing in general. By the time the check was in the envelope, I could feel the spirit coming on strong. The mushrooms with citrus on an empty stomach were fast and powerful! I pocketed my sacrament sandwich and another clementine. Time to move. We took a walk to the nearest mailbox. After we stepped outside, it began to rain- yay! The precipitation felt so fantastic, and the air smelled heavily of petrichor. By the time we reached the mailbox five blocks away, I was soaked to the bone, but all the way up on the mushies, and loving every second of the weather. The sacrament sandwich and clementine were devoured. We took the gutter on the way home instead of the sidewalk- my annoying urges to stop getting wet or dirty had melted away- we celebrated in the humanity of tripping.
Rain drunk from apple blossoms tasted sweet. We arrived home, but I could not go in with the other two, and I instead wandered about in the alley, feeling the strands of reality reaching down into me and flowing into the earth. I picked dandelions. I sat down for a good while on the stairs, watching CEV's go by. I moved to the deck. I placed the dandelions in puddles so they could drink, and sat down among them, and let myself go again.
I began chanting, singing, and whistling, celebrating the earth and the loss of my self- I was just the universe, awareness, doing many things. Another of my roommates came out and talked to me for a while, gave me a couple hits of white widow, which sent me deeper into relaxing no-self. He went back inside after what seemed like an hour (I'm sure it was much shorter).
I followed him after another ten minutes or so. I went to the bathroom and stripped off my wet clothes, left my shoes in the tub. Wrapping myself in a t-shirt and a towel, I caught a glance at my physical form in the mirror. I stared at it, it stared back. I could see all of the things that were attached to it, this thing that called itself ""A"". It was so weird, so lanky and squishy and clunky and organic and beautiful- it put so much work into itself! So much! ""I"" loved it just because it looked so lonely, but tried so, so hard to be good. Its eyes made me cry, they had so much feeling in them. The tears came out of it, which just made me cry more. Awareness walked out of the bathroom, leaving A to itself.
To the bedroom. The body awareness possessed suddenly gained womanly curves- feminine energy poured through, and awareness adopted another of its past karmic selves- a dancer from Nepal. She(I) danced and danced, reveling in the wonderful sensation of womanhood. Opening the eyes, it suddenly fell back into this male, ginger shell. So much for that- but a beautiful experience! It left the bedroom, and piloted the body into the bedroom of J, where J and D were cuddling, and happy to smoke some hash oil that I provided. J and I compared notes so far- he asked me if I had found my name, I said I learned that I don't need a name. He said, ""well, maybe not, but I was given your spore name- it's Tikal. You were a sun god, and people worshiped you."" The A construct was beginning to encroach upon the space of awareness again- ""Help me kill my self!"" I joked to J as I took several large dabs. ""Any day, any time, man."" Ha! Day. Time. What a joke. The A delusion was receding again. Good. More time to be. It piloted the body over to the desk and slumped in J's chair. Closing the eyes produced wonderful thought processes. The mushroom and awareness took a walk through the mind that it normally inhabits and calls A. We looked around at the dreary mess. The mushroom turned to leave, and it left me with the funniest punchline I've ever heard: ""As long as ""you"" have to come home to this shit hole, you may as well brighten up the place."" I fell over laughing, rolling around, the belly laugh of the cosmos. I planted some flowers next to the entrance of the mind-house. They looked like sea plants, and they could be felt waving slowly in the breeze. This made me laugh harder yet.
After a good several minutes, control was restored and the mind was set back to the task of figuring out what to do about A. It couldn't just go back to being A... but Tikal seemed like just as much of a trap. Assigning a self to awareness was the ultimate insanity, and it just wasn't a good idea! The mind bubbled and boiled over this. It pushed the puny human brain harder and harder as it searched for the solution. The final conclusion was one that had already been revisited several times. It was time to start a new self. The world and other ""self"" creations around it were more concerned about and in need of the A construct than I. As long as awareness was going to be confined to the body again, something larger was going to be necessary. A was pushed aside. A partition was created. A bubble formed in my head- ""give it Tikal"" - and it filled with another awareness, another, older self. A was taken aback. Calming A, Tikal explored. Terrifyingly intelligent and wise, every action and statement, every movement was both the most serious and thought out thing, and yet a total flippant joke only detectable by those with the keenest sense of irony. He was exhilarating. But he was darker than A, less merciful. This made awareness quickly grab A again, and tie him up for safe keeping. A couldn't be thrown away entirely, there was too much good material there Too much love and good nature. It was time for a fusion. Tikal and A slowly began to integrate each other bit by bit, accompanied by awareness pushing as hard as possible to retain no-self. This was the hardest part of the trip. Integrating and compressing and reforming a new self. I have experienced what the MD's are wont to call a ""psychotic break"" or something. A left. Pieces are still here. Tikal is here too, in a partially expressed form. And then there's... ""me"", this new insanity being pieced together so that it can get things done in the physical realm. This thing that created itself against its own will. There is a fracture in my mind- but it's beautiful. All things are possible now. Awareness is free to build the self that it wants now. And it is in much more of a mood to trip more often, to continue reevaluating the self, to tweak it, and to throw out what is unnecessary. Though this is not truly/fully Tikal, A has gone, but is too close to continue calling this A. I am going by Tikal for now.

I did .. I had a 12 hour bus ride to VT from VA for a snowboarding trip.  On the ride back I meditated for about 4 hours straight after loosing interest in the movies they had been playing.  I had been dealing with issues with my girlfriend - namely, continuing the relationship contained an unspoken expectation of commitment from me.  Among the movies viewed before beginning my longest session to date where Brave, 5 Year Engagement, and Harlord and Kumar some christmas movie.  First I will explain what from these movies really touched me, from my perspective at the time (pre meditation and a slightly dissociated mind).
         While watching Brave, I picked up the theme of a daughter, whose mother is close-minded in one setting, manages to prove to her mother that she's been wrong her whole life, and embrace rather than resist awakening.  5 Year Engagement caught my empathy by putting myself in the place of the male protagonist - thus simulating my life if I had acted the way in which the male protagonist did.  His behavior resulted in an engagement to a woman he loved being delayed due to educational aspirations separating them by radically reducing the amount of time they were able to spend together.  While the male protagonist un-realizingly (yet sub-consciously aware; at least when I walked in his shoes) started giving up on the relationship, leading to him not worrying about doing things for her, not taking care of himself, and overall just emotionally neglecting his fiancee during the small amount of time they found together, they started growing a great deal apart.  This emotional separation naturally lead to both members of the couple seeking an activity or subject to fill the created gap.  The replacement for the male protagonist seemed to be becoming a sort of partial hippie/out-cast, whose hippie traits include living in a completely natural way (i.e. off the the land as much as possible) and whose out-cast traits include not looking like a hippie whatsoever leading to lack of culture-group-placement by appearance.  Anyways, the female fiancee ended up kissing another person who ended up spending more time with her due to educational obglications.  Explaining other one would take too much time .. here's an OVERVIEW

The bottom line to the bottom part of above message is saying act on instinct and emotion - don't overthink to try and fit into an accepted pattern.  If your pattern it outside of the norm, do it anyway because through my experience that session I seemed to be able to live through the available options at the particular time in my life.  Since then my lady and I have been MUCh happier together, simply due a change in attitude on my end due to this session; my attitude, thanks to experience, now being that love is supreme.  And because it's supreme, take it VERY seriously rather than being stubborn and not compromising in the name of sacred love.  This love has done nothing but improve my life since I've accepted it into my heart rather than somehow fearing it.  Anyway, that's just my experience, I'm very curious to see if any others have had similar experiences!",,False,self,t5_2szsa,1363666420.0,,,True,t3_1akmtv,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/1akmtv/did_anybody_else/,

I smoke weed quite occasionally, though I’m more of an alcohol fan.  Most of the time weed only affects me a small amount, feeling a little numb, relaxed, slower breathing etc. I ‘ve only had one other bad trip, but it was a party, with a heavy amount of drinking and a very untrustworthy joint, which I always assumed was tainted with something else.  In decades this was my only other bad trip.  I typed it out when I sobered up to remember it clearly in the future, to share and also as physical proof of it happening.  Even after this I may smoke again, but in very small quantities, maybe partial joints, maybe only for the rest of the weed I have left.  The lack of control ever happening again scares the crap out of me.

It’s also interesting to note, that as a movie fan a lot of my tripping took place in the films I love, I’d wake up inside a movie but then realize it’s a movie I like and so therefore can’t be real.

Sorry it’s a mess of gibberish, I’m still not clear headed enough to proof read or edit it well, I may alter it in the future to make more sense of it, but here’s what I’ve written so far:

To start 

Incredibly bad trip.  Went from laughing fit and fun watching Beavis and Butthead to suddenly realizing how high I was.  Decided to stop watching Beavis and Butthead, and lie down.  Somehow the induced creativity of the weed and short term memory problems, ended up in a paradox of having a brief trip then coming to realization it was a trip, and who I actually was.  Went through hours of existential identify crisis trying to remember who I was and what was real.  The 'trips' got shorter and shorter as I'd touch or feel something (such as the bed, my arm etc) and suddenly become aware that, that was my physical self and the previous trip was in my head.  Until each trip lasted seconds and each was interrupted by realization of each trip being a trip and that my real self was outside of it.  The more it occurred, the more 'under layers' of the trips I felt, a trip-within-a-trip-within-a-trip, infinite nested trips, unsure which was the real me, but short term memory constantly disappearing, unsure how far back in my life I actually was, 'waking up' in memories past, sometimes in school, sometimes in different houses I’ve lived in, different situations, different existential thoughts I’ve had in the past and that my life from that point was all a hallucination.  Each time going back and forward through my life wondering where i ACTUALLY was.  Did I hallucinate the present, or the past? did any of it exist? am I actually another person? am I even a person?  The hopelessness and lack of control made me feel imprisoned in an infinite layered trip, maybe I was in a coma, maybe in an insane asylum, maybe I was dead.  Was this hell? being aware enough of the horror I was going through to suffer, but not enough to confirm I had just experienced what I had, or whether that was a trip too.  Trying to change things about the physical world to know what was real.  Moving things in room, looking at a glass of water to see water level changes.    Looking at clocks to see the time, sometimes time seemed to go forwards a few minutes, sometimes backwards, was it because i forgot the time and thought it was later? or did the next few minutes not happen yet and that was a trip too?

Am I in hell being punished?  is this infinite, eternity? Can I get out, escape? will it ever stop?  It seemed to never stop, was each trip an entire lifetime, were the lifetimes real?  was I reliving my life each time just for the trip to realize it was fake and come out of it, only to relive it again at a lower level?  Why would I be in hell?  What deserved hell?  Did I do something bad?  What am I capable of, did I do that?  Am I being punished for something I did in my actual life, that I can no longer remember?  Where do these memories of my past come from, are they real or an implant to experience for the horror?

I was scared to interact with people in the physical world in case I made it aware I was tripping, the embarrassment, the illegality.  So I avoided leaving my room unless I absolutely needed water, or to pee, how many times have I already left my room?  where all the times trips, or did I actually go?

I felt like for each second passing I had an infinite number of trips, micro-trips, and real time was moving so slow the physical world wouldn’t even notice them.  maybe I’m just moving really slowly, and in the real world seconds are padded with trips.  Maybe that's what 'time' is, you live but in each nanosecond that passes, you trip exponentially, something to occupy your mind in the idle times? but you forget each trip and so you can live a normal life unaware.  But now  am aware, did something with the system break?  did the weed break the padding so it all bleeds together?

I ended up losing most conscious ability, just remembering the feeling of realization of actually, this is real life, no wait this is real life, no this is...I pleaded quietly to myself if anyone in the physical word was near me, maybe someone putting me through this torture, could they finish, kill me, let it end, ""the testing you're doing to me isn’t working"".  Can they hear? do they exist?  Maybe they like hearing you suffer and it prompts more torture.   
Maybe I’m alone and no one can help.  Someone would check on me eventually?  maybe in the physical world there’s no one but me.  

Maybe each trip is a parallel universe, maybe every second i trip a new memory or a new realization everything prior was a hallucination, maybe these are all galaxies, or dimensions I’m spawning, maybe the dimensions /galaxies have life in them, maybe I’m spawning life, maybe I'm god, what if this was what god was? a conscious mind of pure creation creating life and destroying it as each trip is realized to be a trip.  Is that what God is?  wait that's what I'm doing, so yeah I am God.  It's horrible, Each time I feel something, the pillow, my arm, my face, I realize that is the physical me and everything before this was a trip.  maybe realization is tied to physical feeling, maybe if I keep feeling I can wake out of it, maybe it's tied to pain, maybe pain is my existence, maybe I really am here to suffer pain indefinitely.  The entire time I'm tossing and turning in bed, uncomfortable, sore, rotating in bed, trying to get comfortable, still micro-tripping, thinking ""how long have I been rotating in bed?"", I picture myself having just rotated in bed for hours, and in the physical world I’m just looking like an idiot spinning around in bed. But with each realization of what might be real, I realize I’ve felt that realization thousands of times already and that by feeling that I’m still tripping.

This went on for hours, I tried to leave myself clues of what is real in the physical world.  When I ceased to trip in the morning, I remember looking at the clock many, many times. The clock was now in a position I normally didn’t leave it in,  but I remember the time ranging between 12am and 4am, forwards and backwards.  I accidentally knocked something off my wardrobe and that was on the floor, so I knew that trip was real too. I left myself a note on my laptop, of ""worst trip of my life. infinite galaxies within each other. can’t stop"" so I know that I’d be conscious through all of that after all.  There's also lots of things I know weren’t real, days at school I hallucinated while thinking I’d just woken up at that point and all my life from then was a trip.  But Beavis and Butthead was paused where I left it,  things I kept remembering I had to do when I woke up, an appointment, a postal delivery I was expecting, all still needed to be done.   But I was this sure I was 'back‘ all the times I thought that already, there's no way to really know.

1332294200.0,2,self.tryptonaut,r628u,The Mayan Journey: What I Learned About Myself Within A Species,4,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/tryptonaut/comments/r628u/the_mayan_journey_what_i_learned_about_myself/,"	I didn’t think it could be real – the concept of a journey. We all fantasized about that; about Odysseus and the lands he got to see. And even though he was separated from his love, I felt jealous of him because of his liberation. So go ahead Poseidon, take me out.
	We set up basecamp at the falls. Our shirts stuck to our back like we were the first humans to feel heat. It would be a trek of firsts. The gorges in front of us radiated a teal blue I’ve never seen before and it wasn’t long before we found ourselves in the water. I know this is my perspective - my life, my personal attempts at finding something to justify all the shit in the world - but you’ll hear me saying “we” occasionally. We were temporarily on the same path, physically and mentally, and it made us feel human. It made us feel like we were surviving. Not defending but learning to live through social contact and treating nature as an equal. Not many people know how to do that.
	We found a ledge on the top of the first waterfall that overlooked both the dive pools and the bare rock bustling with water. I pre-rolled a few joints for these serene moments so we were really feeling good. Eventually our trip would start and we would enter the ravine, surrender ourselves to biology, and lose our minds. 
	It’s difficult to present to you a perfect image of the beauty we saw those few hours – sometimes words feel awkward attempting to describe a view that catches breaths at sight. You’ll never have been me at that specific moment so it seems pointless to describe it to you. Nevertheless, the stream had the innate quality of miracles (in a purely existence-focused context) and harbored the necessary connections we must form with the plane our minds physically exist on so I guess it’s worth explaining to you.
	We could’ve been travelers stopping through in the 19th century from the whisper of rumors a few towns over, we could’ve been following a path to a Mayan ruin, ready to talk to the gods, we could’ve been college students frustrated at time’s rigid structure and the way it prevents us from experiencing the emotions of every traveler ever to scale these waterfalls, condensed into a single frame and burst of time and life. I kind of hope they all would feel the way I did.
	I felt a personal connection with all those travelers and the people yet to laugh like a child in this natural water park. I’d like to think everyone would feel as happy as me – so in a way when I say “we”, it also includes you. 
	The stream was isolated by two steep hills of dark rock, pushing the limits of the sky. There was only one road in front of us and we were coming up hard. The abundance of pine trees creates a forest green canopy above us, letting in only enough light where we actually appreciated and noticed it and that’s when we knew we were in the deep wilderness. We found beauty in every site we passed which made it difficult to move on through the ten waterfalls in less than two hours. 
At the beginning of our journey we didn’t even know the phenomenon awaiting us. We were content at the bottom of the stream, not asking for any more, when the adventure presented itself to us. Who knew back then the trail continued on for miles, increasing in beauty at every literal bend to the point it almost seemed surreal. And while those waterfalls are all still pushing and manipulating water as if through some magical force, I like to think it only existed for that one day. Maybe I’m hoping it becomes a symbol for every miracle I see in life, for the selfless social contact that can bring us love at a base, simple, human level, for the idea of a heaven and it’s many waterfalls.
	Was I overwhelmed by beauty to the point it struck a chord inside me that resonated with the idea of a higher power until we were both shaking so out of controllably in control? Or was it the neurotransmitters in my brain creating synaptic connections on this drug I’ve never seen before? I’d like to think both ideas could co-exist. I’d like to believe truths aren’t restricted to the manner they were gained or the outcomes they push towards. 
	It’s interesting the barriers we put up when we define worth by how many objects we have. When everyone releases his or her muscles to hold the overwhelmingly dense truth of simplicity we can work together. It’s survival not on an individual level but a species level and it all starts with how small we are. How small, short-lived, and improbable our existence is. From there we realize most things don’t really matter. Not to the point we should discard them for having no value but to let them exist as they are. This goes for rocks, people, bugs, and the minor inconveniences we face as a result of another person’s misdoing or moment of uncertainty.
	We accepted this fairly early as we cut down anything that caused more deceit than bare truth. We tried to just go with the trip as we examined the lifestyle of fish brushing against our legs but some realizations required quiet reflection on a note pad – so we could enjoy these insights later. Our first entry was “time is a biological function of the expectancy of death.” The second entry consisted only of “underwater dinosaur land.”
	Once we appreciate simplicity, it’s only a matter of finding others who share this knowledge. On intercepting another group of people, our defenses go up and we immediately assess their outlook on life. Just that would tell us everything about our possibility of co-existing together. If they too are looking for that natural balance of living and being alive, a commune is made without words or agreements.
	Maybe it’s where I lack but my level of comfort had not yet expanded enough to include a dozen people. I could have done maybe six at the time but since that was not an option, us three original voyagers kept moving upstream, hoping to find the source of it all.
	We had to turn back eventually but I knew deep down in my heart if we kept going we would never hit a road. We lost the initial awe from nature so the walk back down strengthened previous ideas we struggled with earlier.
	It wasn’t about beauty anymore. I was so focused on trying to comprehend the meaning behind the beauty in random ion deposits in rocks; I didn’t know what to do when the rock broke in two. You had just finishing up sharing a revelation you had – they were often person when on our search to find our niche in the universe – and so I felt it necessary to share half the rock with you. I could’ve had two rocks to learn from, sure, but you had empty hands and I wanted you to know this individual wanted to form connections to his species. It’s so strange to realize there are other thinking things out there, isn’t it? Their minds think like us but deep down we know no one else can feel like us.
	And while that may feel lonely, never being able to fully identify with another on a personal level (by definition), we can take that first step to identifying on a species level. On a level that says we’re all existing on top of this waterfall so we might as well exist together and with nature, which somehow shows more wisdom through longevity than we do. Maybe we could learn from it.
The rock that helped me find myself was much smaller in two, but it allowed me to share the emotion and get glimpses of how it feels to identify with someone on a personal level. To possibly witness first hand their defining qualities from which they’re unique without completely shattering any comfort we’ve found and have reinforced in the self. Without cracking the boundaries that keep us within ourselves and make us who we are. We still couldn’t look into each other’s eyes though.

After watching my friend attempt to drink himself to death I began to become inquisitive about this study and the possibility of such a thing helping. My friend drinks a few cans of steel reserve a day and hasn't had more than a few sober days in the past month. When I met him several years back he wasn't even drinking due to issues with his pancreas.

So I chat with him from time to time about stopping drinking or at least slowing it down, and he realizes that he has some shitty days because of drinking but often rationalizes them as not that big of a deal. (He has lost the past 2-3 jobs due to being too fucked up at work or too fucked up to come into work.) I recently got a 10 strip of LSD at what I estimate to be around 100-150ug per blotter. Given that, earlier today I proposed that he take acid with me, and he seems to be down. He just doesn't want to do it alone. He's definitely taken LSD in the past and used to be a meth addict, so the idea wouldn't be all that new to him.

I'm sure he would be uncomfortable if his drinking was the main discussion of our trip, but I feel like it could work its way in there and I can be relatively subtle.

While I'm usually a solitary tripper, I'm open to the idea and believe that I could perhaps guide him through the trip and his own inquisitive nature if he is so inclined. The only trouble is, I'm not even sure if I've done LSD before. I mean I've taken things that people call LSD, but the sheer street cost of those substances compared to what you can find on The Road seems a bit disheartening. (I doubt A street level dealer is selling pure acid for 15 a hit.) Even given the fact that I may be new to the experience, I am not new to psychedelics and can certainly handle myself.

TL;DR: I have a friend who is an alcoholic and is only getting worse. He seems to be okay justifying his alcoholism, but I know he realizes it is really harming him. I've talked him into tripping with me and my main reasoning for agreeing is that I want to help him purge his habit.

So given these facts I have a few underlying questions:

1) How much do you think would bean appropriate dosage for him given the circumstances. I probably can't get him to take more than 3 (300-450 ug), but would 1 be fine too?

2) Do you think this idea of getting him to reflect on his past is a bad thing?

3) How do you think the best way to broach the subject is during the peak?

4) Do you think this is even a good idea?

5) Should I go into it thinking it has the potential to even work? Or should I just go into it with a mindset of having fun and just see where it goes from there?

6) He probably wants to have a few beers that day, do you think two beers three hours before dosing will have any noticeable effect on the trip?

7) What about weed? I don't smoke anymore, but he wants to take a few hits while he's peaking. Do you think that will prevent him from being more introspective or is it desirable?

Thanks for the help or even just for reading this. If you only want to make a statement or address a single question, I'd still be more than happy to read it and get back to you(if applicable). If you have any questions for me, I'd be happy to answer them when I get the chance.

I don't know, so I will just to be safe) in Southern California (Inland Empire) who isn't in the ""party scene"" and is a bit older (mid-30s but he feels young!) has trouble finding reliable sources for quality enthoegen.

SWIM gave a young man (19?) $100 and so far all he's gotten are 3.5 grams of small dried up old cubensis much of it shake with a promise of another 3.5 grams. That's $14 a gram if you do the math and that seems like a lot. Is SWIM wrong to think that this is a bit of a rip off? Are there other people you know of in this area or even in the US in general who find it much easier or is this typical?

Of course I think it has a lot to do with your ""connections"" and social circle, I guess I just wish it were easier to find like-minded people. If I were to be on the lookout like SWIM was for psylocibin (or, even more exciting, 5-MEO-DMT) I'd be so happy to find people who would make a fair trade, you know?

Entheogens are for far more than just a ""fun trip,"" but maybe that's just the old man talking.

All the best my fellow travelers!
