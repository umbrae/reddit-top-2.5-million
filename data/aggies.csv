One thing that really gets my blood boiling is poor gameday etiquette. This is a really big game this weekend, so big that Texas A&amp;M thinks this will be the [highest crowd](http://tamutimes.tamu.edu/2012/10/16/crowd-for-texas-am-vs-lsu-expected-to-be-biggest-yet-in-aggies-first-sec-season/) we have had in a long time. Please, please, please be nice and friendly to the visiting Tiger fans. Yes, some of them may try to start stuff with you. Be the better person. Be an Aggie.


We have not played LSU at Kyle Field for a very long time. For many visiting fans, this will be the first experience they have of Aggies in Aggieland. Many Florida fans have sung praises and praises of all the nice things Aggies did for them at the game a few weeks ago. LSU should be no different. Already, the fans are coming in with [low expectations](http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/p/36799314/AandM-is-just-one-screwed-up-people.aspx). I think it would be great if we could blow them away with hospitality.


Friendly banter about the teams, score, and season are fine. Hissing at Tiger fans and their families that walk by is not. Greet them with a Howdy. Killing them with kindness is the better and mature thing to do.


If someone starts something with you, keep your composure. Don't rail on them. Don't try to prove them wrong. Just ignore them, be mature, make them look like the idiot. When you wear a Texas A&amp;M shirt, you are representing the school. Please don't make us look bad.


If you see fans wearing hats in the MSC or walking on the MSC grass *politely* inform them. 


Finally, get to know the fans. Ask how did you get here? Do you know where you are eating dinner tonight? How has your experience in Aggieland been? I know many people that have already established ties with fans that will help them tailgate and attend away games next year. Trust me, they will appreciate it.


Sorry if this sounded like a rant. After reading Facebook posts and flame wars, I felt like it needed to be said. If you already do these things, hey- thank you. Keep up the good work! 


I cannot wait until Saturday. Everyone look sharp, look good, and enjoy the football game!",,False,self,t5_2qyds,False,,,True,t3_11mzv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/11mzv0/some_words_about_lsu_gameday_etiquette/,

1336363354.0,84,self.aggies,tao6c,What Ags Really Are About: a (very) short history of aggie homophobia.,123,39,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/tao6c/what_ags_really_are_about_a_very_short_history_of/,"Homophobia is an old and still-thriving tradition at Texas A&amp;M University, one of the last great bastions of homophobia among American universities. To this day the Princeton Review consistently ranks Texas A&amp;M as the least GLBT-friendly public university in the nation. Minor scandals happen every year, but occasionally you hear about, for example, a student being [brutally disfigured by some homophobic cadet](http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-01-24/news/rotten-to-the-corps-a-question-of-justice-at-texas-a-m/) and the incident getting covered up by the aggie powers that be.

When the first group of students wanted to organize a group of support for GLBT aggies, a couple of students [held them at knife point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Student_Services_v._Texas_A%26M_University) to force them to take down their fliers. So the students sought the protection of an officially recognized student organization, which the school administration summarily dismissed. Gay Student Services, as the group was then called, had to fight an eight year legal battle, going all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, for official recognition any other student group could enjoy. Administrators, including the university president, are quoted in Battalion articles from the era defending the decision, saying the proposed student group would promote sodomy which was illegal in Texas at the time. It is unclear how the administrators reached this conclusion. When the state of Texas ruled that A&amp;M's discrimination was a violation of Gay Student Services' constitutional rights, university administrators were informed that they could no longer spend public funds to continue the legal battle to keep the gays off campus. But John Koldus and company couldn't let even a hint of tolerance into their aggie hearts, so they raised private funds to continue the battle. Issues of The Batt from this time are filled with letters to the editor, editorials, and news of student protests against GLBT aggies--and even occasionally in support of them. A sign was hung out of one of the corps dorms that said (if I remember correctly), ""There are no gay aggies."" It stood for days as a testament to the aggie tradition of homophobia.

Was that really so long ago? Is it just the worst of a student body of 50,000 cherry-picked to sound bad? To this day, GLBT aggies have to be careful about what aggie traditions they take part in. An GLBT ag who mugs down literally risks hospitalization. Maybe they'll be fine. Maybe not. That's our current environment. GLBT ags are [consistently taunted and harassed at A&amp;M events](http://www.dallasvoice.com/hate-aggie-1054011.html). Today.

There are plenty of redass GLBT aggies who love this school and its (other) traditions. There are many GLBT ags who cherish their time here. And there are GLBT aggies and GLBT ally aggies who are trying their hardest to rid this campus of its long and strong tradition of bigotry. During the Gay Student Services battle, the university president repeatedly justified his discrimination as standing up for ""aggie values."" But there are many who don't want hate and discrimination to be an aggie value. Do you want to change the culture of this campus? Then what will you do when you see one of your buddies wearing a homophobic shirt? What if that cadet had felt the disapproval of the other cadets in his unit? What will you do when you hear a hateful ""faggot"", the GLBT community's n-word, spoken from the mouth of your classmate? Will you just sit there? Will you let your friends justify homophobic speech with the first amendment, as if bigotry is appropriate merely because it is legal?

Ags, be proud of your school. If you love your school, you gotta change it. We need to do better, ags.

[*The GLBT Resource Center provides a variety of resources for GLBT aggies and their allies. They are also a good place to go if you just want to talk to someone. If you are an aggie in crisis, please call the HelpLine at 979-845-2700. If you need a listening ear, any faculty office displaying [the Aggie Ally placard](http://allies.tamu.edu/placard) is a safe place for you.

Do you guys think we should weed this stuff out, or is it okay for you? Maybe we could make a bryan/cs housing sub and link it in the sidebar. Maybe we could just tell people to post on craigslist instead.

Edit: /r/bcstx is already an active sub with plenty of local advertisement, including roommate searches. Can't we encourage posters to direct their ads there instead? People actually looking for housing could be directed there easily, if it were only advertised as such in our sidebar.

Edit2: sure are a lot of people around here who don't want to use their words. The downvote to reasonable reply ratio is stupid, learn some reddiquette.

Edit3: /u/ID10T_er brought up the site aggiesearch.tamu.edu. It seems active as well.

Racist White Guy (student age with typical redneck truck and TAMU decals),

I realize that you had problems with communication with an older Asian woman at JitB this afternoon, but storming off and yelling ""YOU SHOULD ONLY HIRE WHITE PEOPLE"" was totally uncalled for.  Since you have no concept for decency or what an Aggie (assuming you aren't some non-affiliated Blinn student) is, let me inform you of what happened following

During and after your spiel behind me in the drive through then storming off, I had to wait 15 minutes while her manager chewed her out.  By the time I got her to take my card, she (60+) was in tears.  I assumed some sort of disciplinary measure, so I asked her what happened.  I then calmed her down apologizing for your embarrassment to your race and your school (with your Aggie decals, I assumed).  

I made sure her manager knew that you were a shit stain on humanity, and I asked them to not punish her for something she cannot control.  Hopefully, everything will be ok.

I cannot tolerate racial-based harassment from anyone for any reason.  I am not 100% racist free, but I sure as hell don't insult them for their race.   I realize we are a deep red, but I'll be Goddamned if I let shit like that happen in front of me.  Be glad you weren't inside.

1346595491.0,74,self.aggies,z8aoo,So.... I found a drunk guy sleeping in my car this morning in front of my house on College Main,85,11,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/z8aoo/so_i_found_a_drunk_guy_sleeping_in_my_car_this/,"As I groggily exited my house this morning to go to work I noticed  a cell phone on top of my car. Now I wasn't all that surprised considering that I live just behind an area packed with college bars (Northgate for all you Aggies out there), so I didn't think there was anything out of the ordinary. I decide to take the phone with me to work so that if someone calls the phone I'll be able to answer it. I then get into my car and right before I start the engine, I hear something.

A snore.

I turn around to see a guy passed out laying down across my backseat... In nothing but his *boxers*. Surprised, I immediately  begin to shake him awake and am relieved when he sits up relatively quickly. But then he doesn't get out of my car. I tell him I'm gonna be late for work, I hand him what I assume to be his phone, I even open the door for him, but he will not get out of my car on his own. Annoyed, I grab his shoes and his soaking wet clothes (still don't know why they were wet) and throw them on the ground next to the car. This seems to get the point across and he crawls out of my car while drunken mumbles escape his lips. 

At this point I think I'm free of the drunk, but just as I sit down in my car to get going to work, he opens the car door and puts his dirty wet clothes and shoes back on top of my car seat. I reach behind me, throw them outside the car, and politely but firmly ask him to close the door. But instead of complying, he sends a slew of annoyed mumbles my way and again places his things in my car. Getting closer to anger, I get out of my car, walk around to his side, throw his things out of the car again, and slam his door closed. But just as I get back into the driver's seat he **again** opens the car door and puts his things inside. After running through this exercise a few more times and just about yelling at him to stay the fuck away from my car door handle, I finally am able to get my car started and pull out of the drive way.

But after only driving a few blocks, I realize my mistake.

*Reddit needs pictures*

I quickly turn around and zip back to my house so I can snap some shots from the road, but when I get back the drunken stranger is no where to be found. His clothes and shoes were right where I put them, but the dazed boxer clad man had disappeared. I hang around for a minute or two hoping to get a shot of the wild college drunk, but after no luck I drive as fast as I can to work so I can get paid to post my story reddit.

Lesson of the day: If you live near bars or a college campus, please lock all your doors.

**TL;DR** Find cell phone on top of car. Find drunk man in car. After a battle he finally gets out. Run and tell Reddit

**Update:** I spoke to my neighbor after work and he said that the drunken man knocked on his door after I left, claiming to know the residents inside (he did not). My neighbor and his friend refused him entry and the guy then tried to force his way (unsuccessfully) through their front door. Then their back door. Then my neighbors called the cops. After calling the cops they decided to let the fellow in and let him borrow some athletic shorts (yes, he was so drunk that he never put his clothes back on), at which point they informed him that the cops were on their way. As soon as he heard the word ""cops"", he bolted, leaving behind his clothes and shoes still piled up on my drive way, his cell phone, and his wallet... which had **$800** in it. When the cops came my neighbors handed over the phone and wallet with all it's contents. My neighbors appear to be very decent men for not attempting to profit from this man's drunken escapade, but as for me... I've got my eye on quite a nice pair of Nikes sitting atop a dirty pile of clothes outside my front window.",,False,self,t5_2qyds,1346707272.0,,,True,t3_z8aoo,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/z8aoo/so_i_found_a_drunk_guy_sleeping_in_my_car_this/,

While walking up some stairs, I see a man in in classic blue collar attire re-caulking the edge of the stair case. As I am walking toward him he looks up, cracks a grin and says ""Howdy!""

This leads to a good 10 minute conversation, with me talking about my major and him expressing genuine concern over my future career prospects. He truly seemed to lament that I will be put out into such a bad economy once I graduate, but was very encouraging, saying that as long as I keep trying I'll make it.

I'll admit, I'm not a very good conversationalist. I think all I really did throughout the exchange was nod, smile, and answer the occasional question he threw my way. Looking back, I really wish I'd done more than comment on his caulking job (which looked top notch, if anyone cares).

At the end, he shook my hand and told me his name, although I already knew it by reading his shirt. I returned the favor, and then we parted ways, wishing each other the best in the hard times to come.

I guess the point of this post, if there really is a point, is that it felt wonderful to be welcomed and accepted by someone on campus. A complete and total stranger. I remember in Fish Camp how everyone told us that the whole university is super friendly, and everyone will say howdy to you and just be generally nice. While I've been lucky enough to avoid any negativity, I will say that I have never felt so welcomed, and so much kind-spirited concern, as I did while speaking to Ernest.

This is a man who just spent the last few hours outside, kneeling on bricks, to re-caulk a stair case. No one will notice what he's done. Hell, I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't stopped to talk to him. And yet, this man, with such a thankless job, encouraged me to complete my degree, despite the hardships I'll face, and almost seemed proud of me for working my hardest to get a degree. Me. A complete stranger whose name he didn't even know until we shook hands and parted ways.

Ernest isn't an Aggie, or at least wasn't wearing the ring we all take such pride in. But I can honestly say that, Aggie or not, he is one of the few people I've met here that seem to truly embody the Spirit of Aggieland.

There were plenty of questionable calls that went against the Aggies, but there was one pass interference call that was particularly awful. I usually sit first deck, but we pulled late, so I instead sat in the upper 2nd. After the call was made, chants of ""BULLSHIT!"" and booing began to rise. It was disgusting. There were other Aggies, along with myself, who were attempting to tell them to cut it out, but there were just too many. 

My freshman year (2008) we lost to Arkansas State in the opening game. There were these 2 guys who started booing and they were immediately told to shut up by all the surrounding students and they did. It seems that with the new image of SEC and a few other things, our ""politeness"" has been fading. I am not sure how to explain it, but I thought I would try. With the image we try to uphold here, I just never thought I would hear the student section chanting bullshit.

I wanna meet more people. How many of you would want to come? Maybe one night next weekend? I'm thinking 20 will be the max, but I doubt that many people will want to come anyways, right? We have a side yard that's nice to smoke in and a fire pit that we make s'mores over, etc - it's pretty nice. I have a good amount of alcohol but it would be great if people could bring beer as I'm running low. I want it to be more on the hangout/chill side - nothing wild. Non-drinkers would be welcome to come too, no peer pressure here. Anyone in?

Edit:

Okay so the only time that works for me is Friday night. Thinking you guys can start coming around 8 or after your respective dinners. If you want to come earlier and hang out that's fine, I don't have any Friday classes. PM me an RSVP if you can make it and I'll send you the address.

Edit 2:

Also, if someone could bring two nice gamecube controllers that would be cool. I only have two myself and Super Smash Bros Melee is great at parties.

I was enjoying a few beers with some friends last night at a table in O'Bannon's when 2 guys approached me. I don't remember the exact wording, but one guy said something to the effect of ""Hey, we are from Waco looking to have a good time tonight. Would it be cool if you went and got us a pitcher? We have money but we are only 20 though.""

Super sketch to me. All sorts of alarm bells were going off in my head. After I turned them down (they asked multiple times after I already said no), they bee-lined out of the bar. I have no real proof, but the directness and wording leads me to believe some sort of law enforcement was attempting to set people up.

Unfortunate, yes, but injuries &amp; concussions are part of the game; what disgusted me (and what leads me to making this post) was the fact that fans were cheering while Cassel was quite obviously injured- while he was down, while he was being helped off the field, the whole time. Not only that, but the game was in KC... his own fans were cheering that he got injured!

So thank you, Aggies, for being infinitely classier. Texas A&amp;M has been my adopted family; I fell in love with the school because I could feel a sense of tradition and honor around Aggieland, and the fact that at games we 'step off the wood' whenever a player is down speaks louder to me now than it ever has. I know this is a somewhat scatterbrained post- I'm damn tired after working all night- but I just want to thank you guys for keeping a tradition alive of not just staying quiet while a player is injured, but visibly standing down to show respect for the injured.

&gt; * Communicate the message that you’re calm, confident and know where you’re going! Stand tall, walk with purpose, and make eye contact with people around you.

&gt; * Trust your instincts! If you feel uncomfortable in a place or situation, simply leave.

He was in the President's Box for the Kansas game and, while I was working up there, I overheard secret service talking about a little incident that happened Saturday...

Apparently, President Bush was at the alumni center on an elevator when the thing froze up. For a good 15 minutes.  Now, Secret Service being secret service went into commando mode as they didn't know what was going on.  Apparently the couple of agents that were in the elevator with him jumped *out of the the top hatch of the elevator* looking for a way to reset it and make sure it was safe. They weren't able to do much from there, so a couple of other agents broke their way into the elevator maintenance room and had to shut off the main power supply, kicking in the backup system and returning the elevator to its default position on the main floor of the building. 

While I was in the box, I had a long conversation with one of the agents about his job and the agency and blahblahblah and tried to casually ask him about what I'd overheard a couple minutes earlier. He told me he ""wasn't at liberty to discuss the incident"", which probably means something cool went down. True story, just thought you guys'd enjoy it.  :)

Quit doing the Wrecking Crew hand symbol at the games when it's not appropriate. You know, when we have a fucking amazing defensive game, go for it. But when the team keeps losing yards and getting outwitted with the same play over and over again, THEN makes a lucky move, it's not okay to chant ""Wrecking Crew."" It's stupid, and disrespectful to the players who were part of the Wrecking Crew era. Our team hasn't been the Wrecking Crew for a long time.

Can't say I'm a big fan of the phased development, was hoping for an 18month build with us moving to Reliant for a year.


Scope of Work


This project consists of a significant redevelopment of the Kyle Field Stadium on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. The work is anticipated to be implemented in multiple phases, and the successful CMAR must be capable of performing phases valued at up to $225 million within an eight month construction window per phase. The phasing must be scheduled such that Kyle Field can continue to host home football games during the regular collegiate football season(s). Supporting work can continue during the football season so long as it does not materially affect home football games. The work includes significant structural modifications and additions to the west, south and east side of Kyle Field Stadium, and site and new exterior enclosure improvements to all sides of Kyle Field. Following is more detailed information on specific modifications and additions that the project will include:


The demolition and replacement of the Netum Steed Conditioning Laboratory


Relocation of existing athletics and operations staff in the West side of stadium


Initial site utility work (chilled water, power, storm, etc.)


West Side: demolition and replacement of the entire West stands including adding six rows of seating closer to the field, private suites, loge boxes and related premium spaces along with chair-back seating at the lower decks. At ground level, the West side of the stadium will have a grand indoor plaza that will allow for large indoor gatherings as well as a connection to the outside tailgating areas directly adjacent to the stadium. The upper seating decks will have bleacher seating serviced by an upper concourse with typical fan amenities (restrooms, concession stands, etc.). Finally, a new Media Level will be located at the top of the upper seating bowl to house the Press/Broadcast areas along with coaches and other associated booths.


South End Zone Lower Level: an area for press, interviews, 12th Man Productions, computer operations, football locker room and recruiting room. The lower seating deck will have chair-back seating with access via a new concourse to the Bright Building Nutrition Center which will serve as a club on game days.


The playing field will be lowered approximately seven feet and moved approximately eighteen feet to the south. The relocation of the field will also improve sightline issues for the north end zone seats and allow for the addition of six rows of seating to be added on the east and north sides of the stadium.


South Side Upper Level: the addition of an upper seating deck and concourse. The seating capacity of this deck is approximately 12,000 with the future potential of an additional 7,000 seats. The seating will be located both below and above the new upper concourse. The concourse will also contain the typical fan amenities.


East Side: to help address code and inadequate egress issues in the east stands, the project will demolish the existing Read Building and G. Rollie White Coliseum. The lower seating bowl will also be demolished and replaced. Accessible seating areas will be created along with twenty private suites.


A final sequencing plan for all phases will be established in coordination with the A/E team, the CMAR and The Texas A&amp;M University System. The plan must be capable of allowing regular season home football games to be played in the stadium during the 2013, 2014 and 2015 seasons.",,False,self,t5_2qyds,1353429608.0,,ring,True,t3_13ih0u,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/13ih0u/kyle_field_remodel_rfp_has_been_posted/,

On our way to Layne, we noticed this restaurant that sold hot dogs AND ice cream. We got curious so we went inside to check it out. It was pretty empty. The guy behind the counter looked pretty excited to see us stop by and got me thinking if we're the first customers in a long time. After looking at their flavors of ice cream, since we originally wanted Layne's for lunch so we stuck to that, we got some ice cream. This other guy came out (looked like the owner) and helped serve us. 

I got a simple ice cream cone with amaretto and red velvet ice cream, it was pretty yummy. My boyfriend, on the other hand, got this raspberry sherbet. He was going nuts in the car saying how delicious it was. So we were all pretty satisfied with our experience there and vowed to stop by again. Thought I'd share this since it looks like a new-ish (or barren) place and if you guys want to stop by, it'll be worth it. :3

1375735725.0,48,self.aggies,1jrjhk,For all those worried about Manziel: Here is my buddy's (who is an attorney and writes extensively about NCAA infractions/rules) analysis.,59,11,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/1jrjhk/for_all_those_worried_about_manziel_here_is_my/,"I posted this in another /r/CFB thread, but I figured you would want to see it as well:

The NCAA really has zero leverage in this instance. They won't have any physical evidence tying Johnny to any money. So they will have to rely on testimony.

Now how do they get the testimony? Well...they really can't compel it. Basically, they have to hope that one of the brokers who actually gave him money or agreed to give him money will throw him under the bus. That broker would risk their career if they did.

So lets say that the broker decides to say that Nate told him that Johnny wanted money for his autograph. Well now what does that get them? Johnny/A&amp;M/everyone else will deny that this ever happened.

So now what can they do? Well they have to get ""Uncle Nate"" to admit that not only did he solicit money for Johnny, but Johnny told him about it and he agreed to it. No way that kid admits that. He is Johnny's best friend and the only way he can ride his coattails is if Johnny doesn't go down in flames. NCAA can't compel the kid to speak.

So when it's all said in done (barring other evidence we don't know about), all the NCAA will have is a prayer that the broker rolls over on Johnny, which Johnny will deny, then that Nate rolls over on Johnny as well...then MAYBE they have grounds for a suspension.

Edit: Source - best friend is an attorney who has researched and written extensively on the NCAA.

Edit 2: The NCAA will also be thinking about the ramifications of taking down JFF. If they target and suspend the most popular/exciting player in the nation (and the in SEC even more importantly) based on flimsy testimony and hearsay, they risk pushing the Big 5 even more over the edge. They won't want to mess with the SEC for fear that they will say ""We are tired of this shit. You are going to jeopardize the most important player/game of the year? Yeah we are done.""

From 8am-10pm on April 28th, we'll have 50 students playing all sorts of PC games, door prizes, and a League of Legends tournament! It is a BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) LAN party, so be ready to show off your gaming machine!

Registration for the event is required. There are two registration options, one for people who want to participate in the League of Legends tournament, and another for those who want to play other games. You only need to register for one or the other.

r/aggies, you're invited to be a part of this! 
If you have any questions, feel free to post here or PM me.

       For those going home for the summer, and not anticipating returning to College Station any time soon, 
       you can return your TAMU parking permit and receive a prorated refund for it.

       Last time I got around $80 for returning mine for the summer.  Although that means I wouldn't be
       able to park on campus if I did return, this broke college student didn't mind the extra cash.

As a friend of Anthony Carey and his family, I feel it necessary to let you all know about the Silver Taps ceremony that will be held. Anthony was a great friend, an avid Redditor, and an outstanding person in general. If you can make it to the ceremony to support everyone involved, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

EDIT: Along with Anthony, four others will also be honored (thanks to hankypanky44 for posting):

Luca Bonasera

Nigel Hart

Blake Matthew Schoenrock

Luke Thomas Urbanovsky

Here is the information regarding time and place:

The ceremony begins on the day of Silver Taps when the flag in front of the Academic Building is placed at half-staff. Notices are posted at the Memorial Student Center, Evans Library, and at the base of the flagpole in front of the Academic Building. At 10:15 p.m., chimes from the Albritton Bell Tower begin to play. The ceremony begins at 10:30 o’clock as the Ross Volunteers Firing Squad marches in slow cadence to the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross. Three volleys are fired. ""Silver Taps"" is played by six buglers three times – to the North, West, and South. This concludes the ceremony, but not the feelings of respect and honor.",,False,self,t5_2qyds,1346777146.0,,,True,t3_zc3x1,http://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/zc3x1/silver_taps_will_be_held_in_honor_of_cadet/,

It was last seen between sections 117 and 118, row 1. Her fiance wore this helmet his freshman year so it has lots of wear and tear on it. It also has a sticker to memorialize the bonfire, as this is the year it fell.  She will PAY A REWARD FOR ITS RETURN. Hopefully someone has access to some resources (security footage, etc...) or has seen it around campus. Ill include a picture and link to the Facebook page in the comments.

Gig'em Ags!!!!

Edit: She is okay with me giving out her info. PM me if you have any information/helpful contacts, and I will provide you with her information.

They are checking craigslist, local pawn shops, etc... I am using Reddit to try and locate someone who may have been assigned to work at Kyle Field or knew someone that was there that day (cleaning, maintenance, security, etc...) So far, the school hasn't reported it being turned in by any of its personnel. Ill find out what time the helmet was last seen. Thanks Ags!!!

This training is designed to prepare students for potential situations they may see in the medical field. We are seeking over 200 participants to help make the disaster training as realistic as possible for our students. There will be two shifts available for standardized patients (SPs) with options for morning 8am-12pm, afternoon 1pm-5pm, or both! For those that participate all day, lunch will be provided. If you are interested in participating, please let us know which shift you would like. 

You do not need to have any special skills to participate in this event!

Please mark your calendar for March 22nd, 2013, and then contact us by emailing us directly at: hsc-disastervolunteer@tamhsc.edu with ""Disaster volunteer"" in the subject line. You will receive further instructions via email as the date approaches, and we are ready to start training. Also, if you are unavailable for your scheduled training time, other arrangements will be made. Please invite your friends, family, and co-workers to also volunteer! You are welcome to make copies of this invitation and distribute it to other individuals. NOTE: anyone who is NOT currently an SP will be a volunteer at Disaster Day and will not be paid.

 

NOTE: If you are a member of the media, and wish to broadcast this information in any way, you must first obtain permission. You may email us for more information.
