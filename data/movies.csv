I'm doing this for one of my favorite non-profits, Alzheimer's Association, as my family have been unfortunate enough to have been affected by the disease. 

As a BONUS, I'm offering you all the chance to be flown to the UK for lunch with ME in return for just a tiny donation to this amazing cause.
I'll also sign a beloved Kangol hat and mail it to anyone that donates $200 or more!

Check it out at: www.prizeo.com/samuel 

Let's go muthaphukkas give me something interesting to say!!!!  

Obligatory proof: https://twitter.com/SamuelLJackson/status/339773173950189570/photo/1

**EDIT: Alright Reddit and 4chan(Don't think I don't know about you muthafukkas), I'm about to blow shit up right now. We're at $70k in donations, if we break $100k I will read ANOTHER monologue of my choosing. (Not necessarily one of the most upvoted ones) I'm doing this because this cause is really close to my heart. Now go to www.prizeo.com/samuel and donate some mahfakkan money to the Alzheimer's Association and help me put an end to this muthughphoukkan disease!**

**https://twitter.com/SamuelLJackson/status/340185807862251520 and retweet this shit** 


**Update: You guys are some badass muhfukkas we killed it we broke $130k this morning!! Think about what we did here, think about the good YOU all did and the major impact it will have. Monologue #1 coming soon** 

**Update 2: To clarify how I chose the winner, this feed was a muthafukkin mess, it was easier to tell which ones got the most death threats rather than the most upvotes, so out of the top ones I chose the one that I felt was the most badass and monologue 2 coming over the weekend!**  

**Update 3: Monologue #2 coming tomorrow(Wednesday) with other surprises as well**

**Update 4: Monologue #2 is posted! http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fqfax/its_finally_here_im_a_big_breaking_bad_fan_which/**

Reddit, you've changed my life!",9023,6211,477,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/13gjt8/i_posted_a_series_of_stories_on_rnosleep_ran_a/,"Hello r/movies!

I spend most of my time over on /r/nosleep (and I just told them about this a minute ago), but I thought I should post something here because it's relevant to this sub, and, well, it turns out that I'm too excited not to!  

I'll give just a bit of a back-story/context. I'm going to include some relevant links just in case any of you want to see the things I'm referring to. 

A year ago, I posted the following stories to NoSleep:

1. [""Footsteps""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/k8ktr/footsteps/)
2. [""Balloons""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kcl8q/balloons/)
3. [""Boxes""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kg0jf/boxes/)
4. [""Maps""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kl1cd/maps/)
5. [""Screens""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/krdm0/screens/)
6. [""Friends""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kyshm/friends/)

Retroactively, I called this series *Penpal*.

Not too long after finishing the stories, I began revising and expanding them into a novel. In April, 2012 I ran a [Kickstarter for the book](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1153987072/penpal), which, mostly thanks to NoSleep, was a huge success. In August, I [published the book on Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Penpal-Dathan-Auerbach/dp/098554550X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349741729&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=penpal).

Before the book had even launched, however (and I haven't told anyone until today), I was contacted by a producer named Rich Middlemas, who won an Oscar for the documentary Undefeated this year. After talking for a while, we reached an agreement, and he is now officially on board to produce the film adaptation of *Penpal*! Rich has just started shopping the book around in an attempt to get it set up in Hollywood, so we've still got a ways to go, but I'm hopeful that we'll get there.

I never anticipated things getting this far, and I haven't forgotten for a second that the people of Reddit are who made this possible. The support I've gotten so far has been incredible, and whatever comes of all of this, I'm proud that it started on Reddit.

This is George Carlin as Cardinal Glick during the DOGMA shoot in Pittsburgh, circa 1998.

The first time I met George Carlin was May of 1997 at the Conan O'Brien show, back when they used to shoot it in New York City. I was there to promote CHASING AMY and when I found out Carlin was gonna be on the same show, I nearly shit myself. He'd always been a hero and a role model to me, so I brought a DOGMA script along in hopes of asking Curious George to play Cardinal Glick - the marketing maven behind the Buddy Christ. 

But shortly before the show, Brenda - George's wife of 36 years - lost her battle with liver caner. Ever the professional, George kept his Conan booking, but you could tell he was heartbroken. I didn't bug him with DOGMA that night.

I'd meet the master again a month later at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. He'd already read DOGMA and we were grabbing lunch to talk about whether or not he wanted to be in it. He said he was into it but had one request.

George asked if Cardinal Glick could have a bandage on his finger, which would hide George Carlin's wedding band. Because, he said, he wasn't ready to take it off just yet.

I miss his mind.",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,False,,,True,t3_10yc8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/10yc8h/kevin_smith_on_george_carlin_and_dogma_i_rolled_a/,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Prometheus contains such a huge amount of mythic resonance that it effectively obscures a more conventional plot. I'd like to draw your attention to the use of motifs and callbacks in the film that not only enrich it, but offer possible hints as to what was going on in otherwise confusing scenes.

Let's begin with the eponymous titan himself, Prometheus. He was a wise and benevolent entity who created mankind in the first place, forming the first humans from clay. The Gods were more or less okay with that, until Prometheus gave them fire. This was a big no-no, as fire was supposed to be the exclusive property of the Gods. As punishment, Prometheus was chained to a rock and condemned to have his liver ripped out and eaten every day by an eagle. (His liver magically grew back, in case you were wondering.)

Fix that image in your mind, please: the giver of life, with his abdomen torn open. We'll be coming back to it many times in the course of this article.

The ethos of the titan Prometheus is one of willing and necessary sacrifice for life's sake. That's a pattern we see replicated throughout the ancient world. J G Frazer wrote his lengthy anthropological study, The Golden Bough, around the idea of the Dying God - a lifegiver who voluntarily dies for the sake of the people. It was incumbent upon the King to die at the right and proper time, because that was what heaven demanded, and fertility would not ensue if he did not do his royal duty of dying.

Now, consider the opening sequence of Prometheus. We fly over a spectacular vista, which may or may not be primordial Earth. According to Ridley Scott, it doesn't matter. A lone Engineer at the top of a waterfall goes through a strange ritual, drinking from a cup of black goo that causes his body to disintegrate into the building blocks of life. We see the fragments of his body falling into the river, twirling and spiralling into DNA helices. 

Ridley Scott has this to say about the scene: 'That could be a planet anywhere. All he’s doing is acting as a gardener in space. And the plant life, in fact, is the disintegration of himself. If you parallel that idea with other sacrificial elements in history – which are clearly illustrated with the Mayans and the Incas – he would live for one year as a prince, and at the end of that year, he would be taken and donated to the gods in hopes of improving what might happen next year, be it with crops or weather, etcetera.'

Can we find a God in human history who creates plant life through his own death, and who is associated with a river? It's not difficult to find several, but the most obvious candidate is Osiris, the epitome of all the Frazerian 'Dying Gods'.

And we wouldn't be amiss in seeing the first of the movie's many Christian allegories in this scene, either. The Engineer removes his cloak before the ceremony, and hesitates before drinking the cupful of genetic solvent; he may well have been thinking 'If it be Thy will, let this cup pass from me.'

So, we know something about the Engineers, a founding principle laid down in the very first scene: acceptance of death, up to and including self-sacrifice, is right and proper in the creation of life. Prometheus, Osiris, John Barleycorn, and of course the Jesus of Christianity are all supposed to embody this same principle. It is held up as one of the most enduring human concepts of what it means to be 'good'.

Seen in this light, the perplexing obscurity of the rest of the film yields to an examination of the interwoven themes of sacrifice, creation, and preservation of life. We also discover, through hints, exactly what the nature of the clash between the Engineers and humanity entailed.

The crew of the Prometheus discover an ancient chamber, presided over by a brooding solemn face, in which urns of the same black substance are kept. A mural on the wall presents an image which, if you did as I asked earlier on, you will recognise instantly: the lifegiver with his abdomen torn open. Go and look at it here to refresh your memory. Note the serenity on the Engineer's face here. 

And there's another mural there, one which shows a familiar xenomorph-like figure. This is the Destroyer who mirrors the Creator, I think - the avatar of supremely selfish life, devouring and destroying others purely to preserve itself. As Ash puts it: 'a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.'

Through Shaw and Holloway's investigations, we learn that the Engineers not only created human life, they supervised our development. (How else are we to explain the numerous images of Engineers in primitive art, complete with star diagram showing us the way to find them?) We have to assume, then, that for a good few hundred thousand years, they were pretty happy with us. They could have destroyed us at any time, but instead, they effectively invited us over; the big pointy finger seems to be saying 'Hey, guys, when you're grown up enough to develop space travel, come see us.' Until something changed, something which not only messed up our relationship with them but caused their installation on LV-223 to be almost entirely wiped out.

From the Engineers' perspective, so long as humans retained that notion of self-sacrifice as central, we weren't entirely beyond redemption. But we went and screwed it all up, and the film hints at when, if not why: the Engineers at the base died two thousand years ago. That suggests that the event that turned them against us and led to the huge piles of dead Engineers lying about was one and the same event. We did something very, very bad, and somehow the consequences of that dreadful act accompanied the Engineers back to LV-223 and massacred them.

If you have uneasy suspicions about what 'a bad thing approximately 2,000 years ago' might be, then let me reassure you that you are right. An astonishing excerpt from the Movies.com interview with Ridley Scott:

Movies.com: We had heard it was scripted that the Engineers were targeting our planet for destruction because we had crucified one of their representatives, and that Jesus Christ might have been an alien. Was that ever considered?

Ridley Scott: We definitely did, and then we thought it was a little too on the nose. But if you look at it as an “our children are misbehaving down there” scenario, there are moments where it looks like we’ve gone out of control, running around with armor and skirts, which of course would be the Roman Empire. And they were given a long run. A thousand years before their disintegration actually started to happen. And you can say, ""Let's send down one more of our emissaries to see if he can stop it."" Guess what? They crucified him.

Yeah. The reason the Engineers don't like us any more is that they made us a Space Jesus, and we broke him. Reader, that's not me pulling wild ideas out of my arse. That's RIDLEY SCOTT.

So, imagine poor crucified Jesus, a fresh spear wound in his side. Oh, hey, there's the 'lifegiver with his abdomen torn open' motif again. That's three times now: Prometheus, Engineer mural, Jesus Christ. And I don't think I have to mention the 'sacrifice in the interest of giving life' bit again, do I? Everyone on the same page? Good.

So how did our (in the context of the film) terrible murderous act of crucifixion end up wiping out all but one of the Engineers back on LV-223? Presumably through the black slime, which evidently models its behaviour on the user's mental state. Create unselfishly, accepting self-destruction as the cost, and the black stuff engenders fertile life. But expose the potent black slimy stuff to the thoughts and emotions of flawed humanity, and 'the sleep of reason produces monsters'. We never see the threat that the Engineers were fleeing from, we never see them killed other than accidentally (decapitation by door), and we see no remaining trace of whatever killed them. Either it left a long time ago, or it reverted to inert black slime, waiting for a human mind to reactivate it.

The black slime reacts to the nature and intent of the being that wields it, and the humans in the film didn't even know that they WERE wielding it. That's why it remained completely inert in David's presence, and why he needed a human proxy in order to use the stuff to create anything. The black goo could read no emotion or intent from him, because he was an android.

Shaw's comment when the urn chamber is entered - 'we've changed the atmosphere in the room' - is deceptively informative. The psychic atmosphere has changed, because humans - tainted, Space Jesus-killing humans - are present. The slime begins to engender new life, drawing not from a self-sacrificing Engineer but from human hunger for knowledge, for more life, for more everything. Little wonder, then, that it takes serpent-like form. The symbolism of a corrupting serpent, turning men into beasts, is pretty unmistakeable.

Refusal to accept death is anathema to the Engineers. Right from the first scene, we learned their code of willing self-sacrifice in accord with a greater purpose. When the severed Engineer head is temporarily brought back to life, its expression registers horror and disgust. Cinemagoers are confused when the head explodes, because it's not clear why it should have done so. Perhaps the Engineer wanted to die again, to undo the tainted human agenda of new life without sacrifice.",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,1339226750.0,,,True,t3_uswn1,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/uswn1/prometheus_everything_explained_and_analysed/,

Let us suppose that there is a bomb underneath this table between us. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, ""Boom!""
     There is an explosion. The public is *surprised*, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely ordinary scene of no special consequence. Now, let us take a *suspense* situation. The bomb is underneath the table and the public *knows* it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there. The public is *aware* that the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one. In these conditions this same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene. The audience is longing to warn the characters on the screen: ""You shouldn't be talking about such trivial matters. There's a bomb beneath you and it's about to explode!""
      In the first scene we have given the public fifteen seconds of *surprise* at the moment of the explosion. In the second we have provided them with fifteen minutes of *suspense*. The conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed. Except when the surprise is a twist, that is, when the unexpected ending is, in itself, the highlight of the story.

I'll also soon have a radio show with [PRI](http://www.pri.org/about/fyi-from-pri/pri-signs-actor-writer-stephen-tobolowsky11380.html), and I'll be at the [Moore Theater in Seattle this Saturday 10/13.](http://stgpresents.org/moore/calendar/eventdetail/306/-/the-tobolowsky-files-live)

Alfred. Gordon. Lucius. Bruce . . . Wayne. Names that have come to mean so much to me. Today, I’m three weeks from saying a final good-bye to these characters and their world. It’s my son’s ninth birthday. He was born as the Tumbler was being glued together in my garage from random parts of model kits. Much time, many changes. A shift from sets where some gunplay or a helicopter were extraordinary events to working days where crowds of extras, building demolitions, or mayhem thousands of feet in the air have become familiar.

People ask if we’d always planned a trilogy. This is like being asked whether you had planned on growing up, getting married, having kids. The answer is complicated. When David and I first started cracking open Bruce’s story, we flirted with what might come after, then backed away, not wanting to look too deep into the future. I didn’t want to know everything that Bruce couldn’t; I wanted to live it with him. I told David and Jonah to put everything they knew into each film as we made it. The entire cast and crew put all they had into the first film. Nothing held back. Nothing saved for next time. They built an entire city. Then Christian and Michael and Gary and Morgan and Liam and Cillian started living in it. Christian bit off a big chunk of Bruce Wayne’s life and made it utterly compelling. He took us into a pop icon’s mind and never let us notice for an instant the fanciful nature of Bruce’s methods.

I never thought we’d do a second—how many good sequels are there? Why roll those dice? But once I knew where it would take Bruce, and when I started to see glimpses of the antagonist, it became essential. We re-assembled the team and went back to Gotham. It had changed in three years. Bigger. More real. More modern. And a new force of chaos was coming to the fore. The ultimate scary clown, as brought to terrifying life by Heath. We’d held nothing back, but there were things we hadn’t been able to do the first time out—a Batsuit with a flexible neck, shooting on Imax. And things we’d chickened out on—destroying the Batmobile, burning up the villain’s blood money to show a complete disregard for conventional motivation. We took the supposed security of a sequel as license to throw caution to the wind and headed for the darkest corners of Gotham.

I never thought we’d do a third—are there any great second sequels? But I kept wondering about the end of Bruce’s journey, and once David and I discovered it, I had to see it for myself. We had come back to what we had barely dared whisper about in those first days in my garage. We had been making a trilogy. I called everyone back together for another tour of Gotham. Four years later, it was still there. It even seemed a little cleaner, a little more polished. Wayne Manor had been rebuilt. Familiar faces were back—a little older, a little wiser . . . but not all was as it seemed.

Gotham was rotting away at its foundations. A new evil bubbling up from beneath. Bruce had thought Batman was not needed anymore, but Bruce was wrong, just as I had been wrong. The Batman had to come back. I suppose he always will.

Michael, Morgan, Gary, Cillian, Liam, Heath, Christian . . . Bale. Names that have come to mean so much to me. My time in Gotham, looking after one of the greatest and most enduring figures in pop culture, has been the most challenging and rewarding experience a filmmaker could hope for. I will miss the Batman. I like to think that he’ll miss me, but he’s never been particularly sentimental.

For all its lighting and camera work, there was something else that I knew I was subconsciously seeing but not realizing. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that made it so pleasing to the eyes. Now it hit me.

Remember that concept and overuse of orange and blue that we've seen in various movies and posters alike? Drive did it nicely without being obnoxious and distracting.

I took a few stills (spoiler-free) to show what I mean!


http://imgur.com/a/C3jUq


I was surprised that I only noticed it the second viewing, considering that you could really snap any frame and see it very clearly. I personally found that it worked really well with the aesthetic of the film, and the colour grading was elegantly and subtly done (non-intrusive).

Lastly, if you haven't seen it yet, you should!


Cheers!


EDIT: For all those of you who are saying ""wow you noticed orange/blue in a hollywood film, so what?"", yes, orange/blue has been over-used and is very VERY common in Hollywood films. That is NOT the point here. It's about the level of execution and how it was done. Rather than relying completely on post-production colour grading to achieve this effect (which when done badly results in an over-saturated distracting picture,) they used key objects, costumes, backgrounds, and background objects for a more natural look and to create depth. And when the post grading shows, it's nicely done and not intrusive. That is something I haven't seen used so well many pictures.


EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking for higher res stills. I didn't think this post would become popular so I didn't bother uploading high quality shots, but if you want 1080p stills from these or any other parts of the movie, feel free to pm me and I'll be happy to send them!",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,1354197974.0,,,True,t3_yaohm,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/yaohm/i_rewatched_drive_noticed_something_about_the/,

In a 2003 interview, writer Tim McCanlies recalled ""Quest for Camelot did so badly that everybody backed away from animation and fired people. Suddenly we had no executive anymore on Iron Giant, which was great because Brad got to make his movie. Because nobody was watching."" Bird, who regarded Camelot as ""trying to emulate the Disney style,"" attributed the creative freedom on The Iron Giant to the bad experience of Quest for Camelot, stating: ""I caught them at a very strange time, and in many ways a fortuitous time."" By the time The Iron Giant entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. However, although the production was watched closely, Bird commented ""They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good."" Bird regarded the tradeoff as having ""one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule,"" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as ""fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.""

MORE COOL STUFF: Vin Diesel voiced the Iron Giant. Jennifer Aniston voiced Hogarth's mom. Eli Marienthal voiced Hogarth. Harry Connick, Jr. voiced Dean McCoppin, and Christopher McDonald voiced Kent Mansley.  **It is the highest-rated movie any of them were ever in**, according to RottenTomatoes.

The movie is hand-animated in 2D except for the giant, who is 3D and fully computer-animated to look like he was drawn.

By the way, Brad Bird also directed my two favorite Pixar films, The Incredibles and Ratatouille! so yeah guy pretty much owned my childhood

EDIT: whoa, unexpected upvotes! I posted this after watching the movie with my family last night. After about the seventh or eighth time I commented on the amazing CGI, art, and lighting direction, and then said that Iron Giant was a better critique of American Exceptionalism than Bioshock Infinite, my little brother who had never watched the movie before told me to shut up so he could actually enjoy it.

But I wanted to know how much shorter.

[A nice graph to look at the results.](http://imgur.com/iYjuq) (EDIT: Now updated with years going the correct direction on the X-axis)

Also a [line graph!](http://imgur.com/lXeGp)


&gt; By popular demand, a [graph with both my original numbers and with adjusted inflation numbers.](http://imgur.com/ir6KW) As you can see, not a big difference. All of the adjusted numbers used 1998 dollar values.


The 2012 numbers are through August.

To save time and not research every single movie released since 1998, I limited my choices to movies that made at least $100 million in worldwide box office, or fairly close to that. I wanted to go back further but I was unable to consistently find data.


**Interesting things to note:**

*2003 saw the biggest drop in wait time, averaging 153 days from 176 days in 2002.

*2012 is on track for the shortest average wait time so far, averaging 115 days.

*The first movie to crack 90 days was the 2003 movie Mona Lisa Smile, released theatrically on December 19, 2003 then on DVD on March 9, 2004. A wait of 81 days.

*The shortest overall wait was the 2007 Ben Stiller movie The Heartbreak Kid, released theatrically on October 5, 2007 and released on DVD on December 21, 2007, just 77 days later.

*The longest wait was the 2002 movie The Santa Clause 2, released theatrically November 1, 2002 and released on DVD November 18, 2003. A wait of 382 days, though not unusual for a Christmas movie.

*Also not surprisingly, the number of movies hitting $100 million in worldwide box office has risen a lot since 1998.

Ok. Any questions?


**EDIT:** Standard Deviation: about 22.5 (days)

**EDIT 2:** Okay, as of 2:07PM EST, I am logging off. I'll answer more questions if anyone has them later today.

**EDIT 3:** Holy crap this took off. To appease the masses, a [line graph](http://imgur.com/lXeGp) with years in proper order. And the first graph has been fixed.

**EDIT 4:** Because a lot of people have mentioned it, Jurassic Park was released June 10, 1993 and then on VHS on October 4, 1994. At least that's the date I've seen mentioned the most.

**EDIT 5:** Back again this morning, trying to read all the comments. A lot of people requested my information so they could take a look at it, so [here you go](http://www.2shared.com/document/7-sbzM-L/results.html). Hopefully that link works. It's just an excel file, so do with it what you want. Can't wait to see what people come up with. I'm also trying to work on adjusting this for inflation.

**EDIT 6:** Okay, as of 1:30PM EST, hopefully making the last edit. I now added a graph showing numbers adjusted for inflation. All those numbers were based on 1998 dollar values, so some years saw a significant drop in the number of movies that hit $100 million, while some years didn't see much of a drop.",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,1346348277.0,,,True,t3_z1393,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/z1393/for_the_past_couple_days_i_have_been_researching/,

The whole point of a twist is to have the audience thinking one thing and then have their brains explode with new information that changes the movie. Why do people (and some trailers) think this is a good idea to share?

Yesterday in my press conference in Cannes for Chinese 12 Zodiac I said that this movie was my last big action movie. 

Today I was shocked when I woke up to read all the news coverage that I was retiring from doing Action movies.

I just want to let everyone know that I am not retiring from doing action movies. What I meant to say is that I need to do less of the life risking stunts on my movies. After all these years of doing so many stunts and breaking so many bones, I need to take better care of my body so I can keep working.

I will continue to do international action movies.

And I will keep improving my English :-)

I love all of you!""

Jackie

1327065099.0,1980,self.movies,oosfe,I urge you again to boycott hollywood - they are using our money to curtail our rights. Stop giving it to them.,7942,5962,1309,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/oosfe/i_urge_you_again_to_boycott_hollywood_they_are/,"Yesterday I started [a new subreddit to try and encourage people to join me in boycotting hollywood](http://www.reddit.com/r/boycotthollywood/). I really think if we don't show the big players in the entertainment industry how we feel, if we allow them to continue to take us for granted, we will inevitably be the losers. So here is my proposal:  
  
Hollywood today is dominated by 6 big studios. They are (in order of market share) Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Disney, Sony and NBC Universal.
  
We all know about Murdoch's anti - Obama platform - he has given his ""journalists"" (is there anything more powerful than inverted commas that can be used here?) carte blanc to attack Obama since the day he was sworn in. We know that NBC is a major backer of SOPA and we know that Disney has already had copyright law in the US changed to protect its older works. The others are no doubt well behind SOPA/PIPA as well.
  
These are not the only studios but together they account for about 80% of the movie industry in the USA.
  
My proposal is, we boycott these studios until SOPA/PIPA is dead or until they publicly oppose these bills (which is highly unlikely to happen).   
  
A lot of mention has been made of watching films for free. I think this is a personal choice. I don't want to recommend it, because it reinforces the arguments the studios are making. I am personally going to just refuse to watch anything made by these studios. Batman? Fuck it! I can go without.   
  
I'll play games instead of watching movies. Give your pocket money to Good Guy Gabe instead of Scumbag Rupert!
  
  
Please make a new post in this subreddit telling us how you plan to avoid hollywood, and what you'll be doing instead, and try to promote this boycott wherever you can. If we want to make a difference,we need more people, and more wallets.  
  
 Because in the end, they are spending **our** money to try and curtail** our** rights. Time to stop giving them their ammunition.  
  
EDIT: **I am not advocating piracy. I will happily pay for a quality product.** I am upset because hollywood want to stifle online innovation because they are too lazy. They have had it too easy for too long. Don't come here to post ""I love piracy"". This debate is not about piracy.       
  
EDIT2: Nice to make the front page but I'd prefer if everyone actually subscribed to the subreddit!  
  
EDIT3: Not about piracy.  
 
EDIT4: Not about piracy.  
  
UBEREDIT: Not about piracy. Allow me to elucidate again.   
  
Democracry in America is no longer about people, it is about buying power. One dollar, one vote! Hollywood (and others) lobby for SOPA and it gets onto the voting agenda. Silicon Valley outspends them and everybody backpedals. If this is to be the way the system works, we need to understand how our dollars combined (are captain planet!) can influence the system. If you are interested in taking part of this movement because you don't want SOPA/PIPA to pass, then feel free to take part.  
  
I doubt this campaign will affect any jobs, but if it does, not my problem. I am doing what is best for me. That is how America works now. If the cameramen are unhappy, they can unionize or strike, or just ask their bosses for a raise out of the obscene profits their bosses make. They should do what is best for them.  
  
Do I like this new democracy? Not a jot. I just think we all need to know how it works. Your vote means nothing. Your money means everything.  
  
For the several hundred people who simply posted ""not going to work"", I hope your solid contribution to the dialogue doesn't give you carpal tunnel syndrome. To everyone else, thanks for plosting, I hope you joined the subreddit, and have a happy spring festival! Have some Chinese food, and remember to wish the waiter or waitress Gong Xi Fa Cai!  
  
EditX: JOBS!!!! AAAHHHH! Let me tell you, this argument is always used by the rich to make it seem like their actions are selfless. How can we stop mining asbestos? Think of the jobs! Stop logging old growth forest? What about the jobs!!!!  How can we stop paying people to beat you about the head and neck? How will they feed their families?  
  
Edit(final): All those who say there are not enough of us, or that Hollywood won't notice, let me just say this: Reddit is one of the biggest mouthpieces for driving opinion on the net, and the net is where the world meets now. We are the cool kids. Every studio is scrambling for comic book IP so they can show that they are ""down with the nerds"" and it is sickening how successful they have been. Boycott, change your FB status, twitter it, tell your parents! As Gandhi said, ""be the change you want to see in the world"" (also ""fuck bitches, get democracy"").",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,True,,,True,t3_oosfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/oosfe/i_urge_you_again_to_boycott_hollywood_they_are/,

This movie completely blew me away. The cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack is glorious, and the fight scenes are the best I've ever seen in a super hero movie. They even manage to captures one truly tender moments between Clark and his parents. 

Zack Snyder has a brilliant imagination and it really comes through in this movie without over powering the subject matter. There is a primal current flowing through this movie that comes to a head in a scene filled with victory, and fear.

The cast and crew really knocked it out of the park on this one. I had Pacific Rin pegged as my summer movie but now I'm not sure if Man of Steel can be topped.

**EDIT**: first real movie review written for the public, definitely the most traffic I've gotten for a review. I've learned a lot from the experience. For instance: don't review from your phone when you are still hyped from the movie. Let it simmer a little. I still think MoS is the best movie of the summer and that it's my favorite Super Hero movie to date. I still think the story was great, if not deep it's satisfactory. But next time I will try to keep my hype in check, regardless of my love or hate for the film. Basically, keep it professional. So thank you to all for helping me become a better reviewer.",,False,self,t5_2qh3s,1370970530.0,discussion,,True,t3_1g39ct,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1g39ct/just_saw_man_of_steel_spoiler_free/,

Avoid any movie where your response would be, ""my expectations were really low so I was surprised to see that it wasn't that bad"". 

The two movies that I would list are: **Cabin In The Woods** - It was released this year and is probably the best movie released along with the Avengers, when my friend asked me to go see it I was like ""great a stupid slasher film, whatever it's $5 tuesday"". Wow it was amazing hilarious and terrifying all at the same time and followed no cliches by including every cliche. The other movie I'd list is **Kick-Ass**, the trailers I saw on TV made it look terriblely unfunny, bad action and just crap all the way around, but when I watched it I realized it's probably one of the best superhero movies ever made. It has surprising moments, fantastic action, one of the best soundtracks and is comedic and dramatic at the right times.

Edit: I mentioned it below in the comments, but I was thinking maybe a sequel where 
Mr Shadow creates an evil version of Leloo, maybe called the 'Sixth Element'. Black bandage outfit and all. 
The Light vs the Dark in some big ass superpowered fight. Super Green!  
Edit 2: woo hoo, first front page post.   
I think a lot of people have lost faith in Hollywood with all the crappy Reboots, Sequels and prequels that have polluted our screens this last decade and I can't really blame them.    
I think if Luc Besson, Jean Paul Gaultier, Bruce, Milla and Chris Tucker returned and the story was good, it could be an amazing film. Korben, Leloo and maybe their hybrid teenage child (suggested by someone in the comments) could be a family special forces squad, a bit like a Mass Effect squad going after whatever baddy they can think of (I still like my Dark version of Leloo, the Sixth or Dark Element.  
Edit 3: Well this has really divided a lot of redditors. 5000 downvotes and still on the front page, that's great. It's great to know there's so many lovers of the film out there in the Reddiverse. I wonder if Edgar Wright could do something good with a sequel? I'm loving reading all the comments.  
Edit 4: Still loving the suggestions the fun imaginative redditors are coming up with. I realise how poo mine are, but I'm really enjoying your guys ideas. I'd love to see a fan fiction made out of them.

13 minutes of previews. And not just movie previews (fucking owls, how do they work?), but a goddamn dumbass Harry Potter video game advert, and get this, a movie industry advert that is supposed to make me feel all warm and fucking fuzzy about watching movies, which dumb ass, we were already trying to watch, but were getting less and less inclined to do so because, in case I didn't say this before, there were 13 minutes of fucking shit that we couldn't fast-forward through before we could watch your goddamn movie that we fucking paid for.

So my New Years resolution? That this movie, with 13 fucking minutes of non-fast-forwardable/skippable previews, will be the last fucking movie I pay a goddamn dime for this year. Why? Because if I pirate a movie, I don't have to watch 13 fucking minutes of previews you ass wipes.

I, a non-techy, heretofore non-bit torrenter, non-pirater, am going to do a trade with my techy, IT friend and he will teach me how to download movies. And if he can fucking teach me to download a car, I'll motherfucking download that too. I'll become the motherfucking posterchild of pirating. Why you cry?

-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any movie that they don't constantly hear about on reddit, the media, or from their friends.

**What it actually means:** a movie that wasn't critically well-received, that you think deserves higher praise.

Examples: We've all seen them. Every week someone calls Dredd ""underrated"" or some Oscar-nominated actor ""underrated."" It borders on self-parody at this point.

----------------------

**Homage**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any time that Tarantino (whom I love) steals an idea from another movie. But only Tarantino, anyone else is a ""thief"" who rips off other ideas. For proof of this, just recall how many times you've heard that Avatar is a Pocahontas ripoff and how [Tarantino pays homage to every movie he takes from.](http://vimeo.com/19469447)

**What it actually means:** A deliberate nod to another piece of work, showing respect for it.

Examples of real homages: 

The [staircase scene in *The Untouchables*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-3DKkIv9S8) referencing the massively famous [*Battleship Potemkin* ""Odessa steps"" sequence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-v-kZzfec). It should be noted that Brian de Palma walks the same fine line as Tarantino in terms of ""is he stealing, or making a homage?"" since some of his movies are nearly direct knock-offs of other movies, like [Blow Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/?ref_=sr_1) to [Blow-up.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060176/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Not ironically, de Palma is a favorite of Tarantino's, as well as Goddard, who also openly admitted to stealing from other works.

Charlize Theron walking on water in *Arrested Development*, [a nod to the ending of](/s ""Being There"") - [Link](http://youtu.be/Bow1ZJTV4L4?t=3m56s)

John Wayne [grabbing his elbow in *The Searchers*](http://youtu.be/GXUz-Nntyks?t=47s), a [tribute to Harry Carey](http://youtu.be/e0klfBXd5Jc?t=3m47s). This shot is also mirrored in Kill Bill 2, without the elbow grab.

Homages are typically *obvious* to the audience, because that's the point. It's not merely copying something, like nearly everyone suggests, it's making an overt gesture to tell fans how much you respect another piece of work.

Tarantino says that he [steals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LYT4JC2dd4), just like one of his major influences Goddard. He doesn't say he ""pays homage"" to anyone, as many of his fans like to argue. He wasn't *paying homage* to [City on Fire when he directly lifted large parts of the plot in Reservoir Dogs.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgbSAL8OKY)

Another [one, just for fun.](http://youtu.be/7ZKgptV4GmQ?t=1m2s)

-------------------------------------

**Pretentious**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means:**

- Anyone who uses big words

- Anyone who speaks with a condescending tone

- Movies that are enigmatic

Examples of movies that are often called ""pretentious"" by /r/movies: The Master, Tree of Life, Brokeback Mountain, Crash

**What it actually means:** when art tries to be showier and deeper than it actually is, or when a person self-aggrandizes beyond their actual merit. 

Subjective Examples: Terrence Malick (whom I also love) is often criticized as pretentious. Why? Because in a lot of movies he has whispering voice over deliberately stating how characters feel, not giving the audience a chance to learn and feel with the characters. He skipped a step and went straight to the punchline. On the other end of the spectrum, overly-dramatic scenes in Transformers can also be called pretentious, when we're all-of-a-sudden supposed to care about two characters because the music changed and the sun is setting *just so* behind Megan Fox as she tries to hold on to Shia LeBoof's hand. Transporter also did this, constantly switching music to try its best at making us feel something for the characters. Man on Fire did this same technique with more success, prob due to just better filmmaking, acting, story, and characters. Wong Kar Wai's *Happy Together* was critically successful uses the same (years earlier) technique of constantly changing film stock and self-conscious cinematography, but due to the authentic drama of that film it'd be foolish to call it ""pretentious.""

Whatever *is* pretentious is obviously subjective, however the word's definition is being watered down everyday here by being thrown out every time  someone feels insecure about ""not getting"" a movie. It's fine to not get movies, btw. I've never understood the praise for plenty of classics.

---------------------

**Foreshadowing**
-

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Any conceptual link between an event earlier in a movie to what occurs later in the movie. I often describe it as ""the astrology of film theory"" because so many people want to believe that [every little nuanced thing in films is part of some larger grand scheme](http://www.room237movie.com/about/). Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and [accidents do sometimes happen in films.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/12vdtv/loop_lines_what_they_are_how_to_spot_them_and/)

Examples:  [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19382h/noticed_some_foreshadowing_on_einhorns_desk_while/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14plo4/possible_foreshadowing_in_skyfall_spoilers/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/178wwx/spoiler_cant_believe_i_never_noticed_the/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sw6s7/maybe_im_late_but_i_just_noticed_and_love_the/), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/p4nqm/my_favourite_lineforeshadowing_in_the_shawshank/)

**What it actually means**: Foreshadowing is a direct hint to the audience about what direction the movie will go in. Foreshadowing must nudge you. Going back and noticing the misty breath in The Sixth Sense isn't foreshadowing, because the film never hints that that meant something. Clues aren't the same thing. And if they are, then we need a *new word* for the *old definition* of foreshadowing.

A good explanation from [/u/Clumpy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dt0it/defining_foreshadowing/c9tl12d) - ""At its most basic level, foreshadowing is authorial and sort of a bending if not breaking of the fourth wall. ... **Giving undue emphasis** to some peripheral element of the story or world only to have it come back into the story in a big way is another common example.
... Shows like Lost really relied on this audience tendency to create depth whether it was actually there, and the tendency still seems particularly bad in ongoing narrative-based television shows. But **a character eating a sandwich in one scene and then getting hit by a food delivery truck at the end of the movie isn't foreshadowing**.""

Examples:

Evil music behind a character's entrance is foreshadowing. Someone entering via shadow hints at their motivations.

Foreshadowing can be dialogue ""You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain"" begs us to apply it to the whole story. It can be repetition - seeing oranges around death in The Godfather gives us a pattern. Or it can be semiotics - The box of ""Ka-Boom"" cereal in Kill Bill is pretty distracting - ""why'd they name it Ka-Boom?"" it suggests.

The level of emphasis remains subjective, but an overt hint is much different than just conceptual similarities. Most of the examples I provided earlier are considered [""motif.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_\(narrative\))

Here's a [student video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJdXA6zNgqU) examining more excellent core examples of foreshadowing, emphasis on it being a *narrative technique that helps move the story along*, not *cool puzzles for the audience to figure out*.


-------------------------

**Plot Holes**
-

This one might just be lost to the masses since it's so overly misused these days. If that's the case, we need a *new term* for the *old definition* of the phrase.

**What /r/movies thinks it means**: Anything unexplained, literally ""holes in the plot,"" or things someone didn't understand.

**What it actually means**: When a movie betrays its own logic.

A great explanation is [here](http://badassdigest.com/2012/10/30/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-plot-holes-and-movie-logic/), with highlights:

LET'S BE CLEAR - A PLOT HOLE IS NOT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:

A) SOMETHING THAT ONLY SEEMS CONFUSING IN RETROSPECT

B) AN EVENT THAT OCCURS OFF-SCREEN

C) A LOOSE END (THOUGH IT CAN BE)

D) SOMETHING BASED ON AN UNRESEARCHED HISTORICAL ASSUMPTION

E) SOMETHING BASED ON OVER-RESEARCHED HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE

AND F) CONTINUITY ERRORS + PEOPLE JUST PLAIN NOT WATCHING MOVIES AND MISSING INFORMATION

Examples of actual plot holes: From the above article/referencing [this article](http://badassdigest.com/2011/05/05/best-movies-ever-jurassic-park-1993/) regarding Jurassic Park:

""What’s most incredible, for me, is the way the scene works completely on its own terms despite making no real world sense. How did the trams end up back at the T-Rex paddock? How did the T-Rex eat the goat and climb up on the road when it is established after this scene that there’s a hundred foot drop on the other side of the wall? Sometimes movie making is magic, and sleight of hand is a magician’s best friend; Spielberg is such a master that even when you’re looking out for these geographical bloopers they barely register.""

Another plothole: At the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the movie tells us that anyone will fall through the hop-scotch stone tiles if they don't step on the correct letters, in order. Jones steps on the wrong letter, falls through, but [*grabs on and pulls himself up from another wrong letter tile.*](http://youtu.be/9iDeE3mKVfs?t=38s)

------------------------------

Hope some of this helps! If you have any questions, want to offer more examples, or challenge any of these concepts, it's all welcome!

Personally I really enjoyed the film. Despite some obvious flaw with any big budget blockbuster the film was solid and visually stunning. 

Was John Carter a victim of harsh critics? or did the lack of advertising (in the UK atleast) kill it?

Adjusted for inflation it has made 3.3 billion dollars. Does this sound familiar? Whenever people bring up big summer movies that make a ton of cash there is always someone who throws this out there and to them I say... that's awesome, but let's put that into context. All $ from here on out has been adjusted for inflation.  
   
Gone with the Wind was released in 1939 and its initial run lasted until 1943. It made 221 million its first year in limited release and then 285 million over its next 3 years in general release to bring its initial 4 year total to 506 million globally. Combining those 4 years it sold 60 million tickets. So over four years it sold 60 million tickets and made $506 million in the US. Let's compare that to Iron Man 3 that sold roughly 40 million tickets and made 380 million in its first four weeks in the US or The Avengers that sold 50 million and made 532 million and all of a sudden Gone with the Wind isn't looking all that impressive. So where did the rest of Gone with the Wind's gross come from? That would be the eight re-releases in 1947, 1954, 1961, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1989, and 1998 which earned the movie its additional 2.8 billion dollars.  
   
So the next time someone throws out how much money Gone with the Wind made keep it mind it took the movie nearly 60 years to reach it’s total. Many of those years took place during a time when alternative entertainment was not as easily accessible as it is today. There was no TV for the first 10 years of the movies run, no movie rentals for the first 40 years, there certainly wasn't Netflix, video games, sports packages, computers, and whatever other endless river of entertainment options we have today.  
   
TLDR – Gone with the Wind made 506 million in its first 4 years and had 8 other re-releases over the span of 60 years to bring its total to 3.3 billion.

If this doesn't matter to you please feel free to respond with whatever colorful variation of, ""Frankly geekRAT, I just don't give a damn!"" that you would like.

Switched need to had in the TLDR because GwtW didn't NEED anything. Fixed the wiki link to actually work. /patchnotes

1358974412.0,1674,self.movies,1757in,Has your Netflix Instant signal quality been sucking recently? Here's why that might be...,3062,1388,359,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1757in/has_your_netflix_instant_signal_quality_been/,"In the last month I've been having issues with my netflix app on my 360 maintaining more than 1 or 2 bars, and HD popping on and off. I've never had any issues with this before, so I called my ISP out to check my connection. They said it was fine. I also noticed that on the same console, the Amazon Prime and HBO go HD streams worked perfectly. Full bars, always on HD.

At this point I assumed it was a Netflix error, so I called their customer support. At first the ""tech"" woman I spoke with said it was my connection speed not being fast enough. I explained to her that I had 30 megs down (Time Warner Cable Austin's fastest residential option), and it was just checked and working properly (not to mention all other HD streaming services were working fine). She contacted a supervisor and came back and said the supervisor said the ISP was throttling Netflix.

At this point I asked to speak to the supervisor because I didn't want to go back to Reddit and accuse my ISP of throttling without some more facts.

Here is what the supervisor ""William"" at the Netflix location in Denver told me.

1. Netflix just released (a month ago, when I started having issues) what they're internally calling ""super HD"" or a true 1080p stream for their HD instant content.

2. They are having issues with ISPs throttling this stream because it's not really a stream. With the 1080p content, they are downloading large data packets instead of smaller 1080i/720p streams. This is sending red flags to ISPs to throttle.

3. The reason Amazon Prime and HBO GO is still working is because they're not requesting as much data.

4. They're having less issues with Instant Netflix streaming on PC because it's based on Silverlight, and this is mainly an issue with apps on consoles like the 360 or PS3.

I asked him if there was anything I could do. He said I could suspend my account with Netflix until the ""heartburn period"" was over with this 1080p upgrade to their streams. He said they're in constant talks with the ISPs to resolve the issue, but the ISPs are upset because of peer connection issues with Netflix, and Netflix not allowing it.

So, just a heads up if anyone is experiencing HD streaming issues with NETFLIX and their console apps.


Edit Update: 'NfNitloop' in comments below pointed to this article which explains things a bit more. Seems like TWC and NetFlix are butting heads over how to supply this new ""SuperHD"" while we sit around with substandard service. http://m.cnet.com/news/time-warner-cable-netflix-at-odds-over-super-hd-3d/57564467


Edit Update 2: Snarfox suggested switching to Google Public DNS on my router. I just did and so far it seems to be helping.
