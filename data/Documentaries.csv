1363372902.0,1239,self.Documentaries,1ad4pa,"Should /r/documentaries have an ""essentials"" list to avoid reposts and provide easy recommendations?",1465,226,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/1ad4pa/should_rdocumentaries_have_an_essentials_list_to/,"There are some documentaries that are reposted almost every week (I'm looking at you, Century of the Self).  I agree that most of these are very good viewing, and I certainly don't want to discourage less-active viewers of this subreddit from finding out about them.  I also feel that some docus get less exposure than they deserve because the same films are often at the top.  I believe both of these problems can be solved.

My proposal is as follows: create and vote on a categorized list of documentaries that could be considered ""essential"" viewing for their particular topic.  This list would be prominently visible on the top and/or side bar.  Following the completion of the list, re-submission of ""essential"" docus would be discouraged.

In theory this would promote the visibility of smaller documentaries, while still allowing popular documentaries to be easily viewed.

There are some downsides to this system:

* It would require more mod involvement, both in the short term and in the long term
* It would perhaps discourage active use of the subreddit if there is not enough ""new"" content, if people deem that the subreddit's job is ""done"" after the completion of the list
* It could discourage active discussion of the ""essential"" documentaries

I'm sure there are more pros and cons, but I believe those are some of the major ones.

What are your thoughts?

EDIT: As some have pointed out, ""Essentials"" is probably not the best title.  Something like ""Community Recommendations"" or ""Popular Documentaries"" would probably be more appropriate.",,False,self,t5_2qhlh,1363382006.0,,,True,t3_1ad4pa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/1ad4pa/should_rdocumentaries_have_an_essentials_list_to/,

(Full movie and more in the post)",647,149,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/1e9g8e/so_my_aunt_produced_filmed_and_directed_a/,"Hello Reddit!

I just recently finished watching my aunt's (Debbie Lum) new film: Seeking Asian Female. She already has had a tremendous amount of support and exposure. However, she could always use more publicity, and this film is right up Reddit's alley. If you were wanting to watch a documentary about an older white man who fulfills his fantasy of marrying a young Chinese woman, this film is for you. Seeing how this all unfolds is just straight up bizarre. This post will include a trailer, hour long edited version that was used on PBS, and of course her website. I would like to chime in first before I list all of those items.

First off, this isn't a post to beg for money/kickstarter. I was just so impressed with this film that I wanted to share it with you all. She has already won a ton of awards, and was recently on PBS's Independent Lens which showcases independent film makers like her. 

If you're looking for a film that will make you cringe and yet sympathetic at the same time, please take the time out of your day to watch this film.

Keep in mind that the PBS version isn't the full film, she had to edit it to fit the hour time slot. Below is where you can buy the full version if you choose to do so.

Thanks for reading!

Edit: Thanks everyone for being so receptive. It's about my bed time here, I'll answer more questions tomorrow. Let me know if you all are interested in a AMA with the film maker. I'm sure she'd be interested if there was enough demand. Good night all.

I'm still actually learning about all the sub reddits and what not. I wanted to thank you guys because /r/Documentaries has LITERALLY changed my life. I was browsing around and I came across ""Bulgaria's Abandoned Children (2007)"". I was adopted from Riga, Latvia at 18 months old. I never really understood what my living conditions were like before watching this film. When I was first adopted, I constantly rocked like the children in this film. I had no idea why - until I saw this documentary. One of my favourite things to do (still) is rock. I sit in my rocking chair sometimes for hours and it just relaxes me. 

Another thing that struck me in the film was how the children were forced to sit on toilets for hours on end. I obviously do not remember this, but my mother has told me many stories about the first time she came to the orphanage in Riga to adopt me and how they made us sit on toilets for hours on end, too. I have scars from sitting on toilets for such long periods. It's something I am still self conscious about to this day. Actually, my mom has even told me the day she finally got to take me back to the US, I started to cry and one of the caregivers gave my mom a wooden spoon that she could use to beat me. I know my living conditions were not as bad as these children - but I know more about what I went through and I feel as if I've learned some things about myself. 

However, the point I wanted to make is that I have been considering what career path I should follow. I am 18 and it really hasn't been clearer for me until now. I know for a fact now after watching this documentary that whatever I do, I want to do something that will have a direct impact on improving the lives of others. I seriously feel as though I have found my life's goal - I just want to help people. I don't know how yet, but that is what I want to do. I want to make a difference, I don't want anyone to experience what I (or these children) had to experience at a young age. 

So THANK YOU SO MUCH /r/Documentaries, for helping me find this film and helping me find my life's goal. I am serious. Thank you.

**TL;DR** - /r/Documentaries has changed my life and I just thought you guys should know. I am seriously grateful. I don't care if I sound crazy.

**EDIT** - Thank you guys for all the support. I couldn't of asked for a better way to welcome the New Year. =)",,False,self,t5_2qhlh,True,,,True,t3_nxazy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/nxazy/thank_you_rdocumentaries_seriously_my_life_is/,

Bored, I decided to watch it. One hour and nineteen minutes later and my jaw is hanging low, my eyes can't comprehend what I've just seen and I want more. 

It is a staggeringly beautiful documentary, the story it tells is fantastic and I'm certain it's the best camera work I've ever seen.

I thought I would make a post with all of my documentary related websites, to share with everyone.  

I've tried to list the streaming sites from 'best' to 'worst' in terms of ease of use... meaning the lower you go on the list, the more you might have to deal with pop-ups/ads or broken links.  It was just a quick sorting though, so it may not be 100% accurate in that regard.  Also, this means that even though a site may be low on the list, it may have a better selection of documentaries than those listed higher.

With the download/forum/torrent sites, you may be required to sign up for access to the videos.

Hope people enjoy these, and feel free to suggest more in the comments.

The Fog of War was #3, then the number of points it gets for that post with 43 points=3x43). First place was 5, second was 4, third was 3, etc. If a post said no particular order then all submissions were given a 3. If there was only one documentary in a submission it was given a 5.

Many of my kids live life in an ""eye an for eye"" mindset where if someone does you dirty, you give it back twice as hard...or you're seen as weak.  This means that everything from accidentally using someone else's pencil to a slight verbal insult invariably escalates to nuclear proportions. 

Details:

1.  All of my kids are growing up in poverty.
2.  This district is one of the most low-performing in the country in terms of educational opportunity.
3.  All but one of my kids are African American.
4.  Age range 15 to 18 years old.

I want them to understand that tearing each other down is not going to improve their life prospects.  Anyone know of a documentary that outlines empathy, long-term happiness, escaping the poverty/achievement gap, the problems with revenge/anger, or any other topic you feel would be relevant to this situation?

To give you an idea of how rare it is, it was only screened twice at film festivals in 2002. Disney then forbade its release and ordered copies of it destroyed. It's so hard to get a hold of that a Disney representative had to accompany a copy at all times during a rare screening at Pixar:

&gt; It seems that -- in mid-2002 -- the folks at Pixar Animation Studio wanted to hold a screening of ""The Sweatbox"" for all of the employees working at their Emeryville, CA. studio. So -- after a little negotiation -- Disney agreed to send a copy of the film up to Pixar ... provided that the print was always accompanied by a Disney studio representative.

&gt; And when I say ""always,"" I mean ""ALWAYS."" The story that I hear is that ""Monsters, Inc."" director Peter Docter actually offered to take the print's guardian down to Cafe Luxo for a quick bite to eat. The Disney studio representative refused, allegedly saying: ""If I ever let this copy of 'The Sweatbox' out of my sight, it could wind up costing me my job.""

So you can see how shocking it is that, two days ago, a 480p version was uploaded to YouTube. It far surpasses the quality of the previous bootlegged version, and is a direct transfer from a master VHS tape. It lasted two days and got 30,000 views before it was removed.

Re-uploading it to YouTube isn't an option, and with seizures of domains like MegaUpload, rampant anti-piracy measures at HotFile, RapidShare, etc., it'd only be a matter of time before it will be removed there. Fortunately, there's still a way for you to see it.

1. Download and install [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/). I2P is an anonymous network. It lets you browse a darknet and share information without corporations like Disney dictating what you can and can't see.

2. Once I2P is running, open ""I2P Snark,"" which is a BitTorrent client. You can do so by clicking ""Torrents.""

3. Paste the following magnet URL into the ""From URL"" box under ""Add Torrent.""  This will indicate to the network that you want to download *The Sweatbox*:

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:97a76d8e0acb341cbb8811e50a367b197fa9a8f7&amp;tr=http://tracker2.postman.i2p/announce.php

[screenshot](http://s18.postimage.org/khfmhustz/tmpscreenshot.jpg)

(If for some reason this doesn't work, you can click ""Postman"" to access that I2P BitTorrent tracker. Search for ""The Sweatbox"" there, or check the recent torrents.

4. Click ""Add torrent"" and wait. The page will refresh and indicate when the file starts downloading. 

I2P will be much slower than the regular Internet as your traffic has to bounce around peers in order to make it anonymous. You can help make the file faster for others by seeding it. Just let your computer and I2P run even after the file has downloaded. 

There are other ways to share files, such as The Piratebay and private BitTorrent trackers. These aren't anonymous, and private trackers don't allow just anybody to share information. You have to belong to a special club. 

The value of this documentary is so high, however, and the content so compelling, that hopefully you won't mind learning how to use a new, cutting edge, open, and truly anonymous technology. One day you too might depend on the anonymity that I2P provides.

*edit*

***TL;DR/why should I care?***

**Synopsis -- or, why animators think it's kick-ass that this documentary suddenly surfaced two days ago:**

Similar to ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Sweatbox"" offers a titillating glimpse into what it's like to work at an animation studio. Traditionally Disney has tried to present the appearance that their movies are created in a very flowing, genteel manner (in keeping of the spirit of the ""old men"" of animation, and Disney himself), and have suppressed information to the contrary. This documentary really paved the way to dispelling that smokescreen.

Basically if you like film making, animation, or wonder what it's like to work on a project where hundreds of people are literally pouring their hearts and souls into a project that (should something go wrong) could crash and burn tomorrow, you'll probably enjoy it. The film starts out with an animator whispering that the producers hated the first version, and they're all upstairs in a story room discussing six different pitches for the future of the movie. He admits that they might actually decide to kill the movie outright (which isn't unprecedented in animation studios), which would mean, literally, that hundreds of people would lose their jobs just like that. These are artists who pore their heart and soul into their work, and it shows. At some point they (accurately) talk about how getting a character cut from the script is very similar to the feeling of losing a part of your life. Something you've literally spent years creating suddenly being worthless and lost, as if it died

You also get to see plenty of pencil tests, storyboards, interviews with the creators, and brainstorming meetings. Including one where they basically call in the most respected names in animation to try and brainstorm a way to save ""The Kingdom of the Sun"", the then-name for ""The Emperor's New Groove"".

It also has an aura of mystery around it, because it's basically shocking that THIS movie, which has been so rare and hard to obtain, suddenly surfaced in excellent quality! It's satisfying that, after ten years of Disney suppressing the film to the point of requiring its representatives to literally not let it out of their sight, it suddenly surfaces.

So I end up not playing the ones that are heavy on the visuals because I'm ""missing"" half the program.  I like anything educational (especially history/anthropology, psychology and the like), or ones like the Rodney Dangerfield doc that's currently on the front page (lots of interviews and narration, with clips from his act, it was great to listen to), but unlike the BBCs Victorian/Edwardian Farm, even though the series' are fantastic, you can't really only listen to it, the whole idea is to *see* how they live, you know?  

The reason I ask more for docs than podcasts though is because once in a while I like to look up from what I'm doing and watch for a minute, a sort of break from my work, and then go back to it when I want.  Does that make sense?

This annoys me, because IMHO it isn't the best documentary about North-Korea, not even close. So I always respond with this text:

Other and better documentaries about North-Korea in my opinion:

- A State of Mind (I was amazed when I watched this one, best NK documentary IMO): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nd-iSCy1og&amp;feature=related
- Seoul Train (about NK refugees, confronts you with the harsh reality of North Korean refugees): http://www.seoultrain.com/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgBBTANnG10 (trailer, you can torrent it)
-  North Korea: A Day in the Life: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQSIEAz3rws

Other NK documentaries that are interesting are ""Crossing the Line"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeL5Xk1qz4 ), ""The Game of Their Lives"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Du92VFNxWI ) and ""Friends of Kim"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C76HqPaA6kw ).

Last but not least: Read "" Nothing to Envy"" (http://nothingtoenvy.com/)

Please watch these documentaries if you haven't and are interested in the topic, and spread the word in NK-threads!

We release it as a DVD ISO, our users download it, burn it to disk, then leave it in the city for people to find. We're trying to make the worlds biggest printing press. Can you help?",178,23,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/edviu/rinfograffiti_every_30_days_we_cut_the_top_voted/,"Hi guys,

I'm the guy who started the project and I'm really looking for support from other subreddits to get this idea going. So far we've had a really great reception and our numbers are continuing to grow, but we're looking to get well into the thousands of members to really make a splash when we release our first episode.

Why are we doing this?

Well, everywhere has an end product to their news/information gathering - everywhere but reddit. We find fantastic, life affirming, inspiring, challenging and uplifting documentaries, but we share them with a closed community of people who already like this kind of thing. We preach to the converted.

We believe that *new* literacy is measured in your ability to discover information, rather than your capacity to understand it. That makes you and I some of the most literate people on the planet, and /r/infograffiti wants to share our literacy with the wider world. We're trying to invite people in to our world by producing an episode each month, of the most inspiring videos and documentaries we've found.

If we get enough people on board, we really can make a huge difference. For example, if everyone in /r/documentaries printed 10 DVD's, you could make over 130,000 DVD's and have them all over the world in no time - that's more than most Sunday Newspapers circulation in the UK.

We want to go well beyond that, but we need all the support we can get. So I ask you /r/documentaries, can you help?

I just saw this documentary for the first time today on the History Channel (I know, I know...) and it completely blew me away. It uses footage from the personal lives of many Germans and Nazi soldiers while documenting the increasing influence of the Third Reich and it's unbelievable influence on the German populace. 

There are 2 parts. The first, as mentioned in the title of the documentary, focuses on the rise of the Third Reich and its influence on the German people. The second part lends itself to the horrid downfall and eventual collapse of the Third Reich and its devastating effects.

The production of this documentary is absolutely outstanding and, though it can be graphic at times, I believe it should be required viewing for everyone as a reminder, if nothing else.

It premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was released limited on September 1, 2006. The Independent Film Channel, the film's producer, aired the film later that year.

The MPAA gave the original cut of the film an NC-17 rating for ""some graphic sexual content"" – scenes that illustrated the content a film could include to garner an NC-17 rating. Kirby Dick appealed, and descriptions of the ratings deliberations and appeal were included in the documentary. The new version of the film is not yet rated.

The film discusses disparities the filmmaker sees in ratings and feedback: between Hollywood and independent films, between homosexual and heterosexual sexual situations, between male and female sexual depictions, and between violence and sexual content.

Our library doesn't have much and there's a 2-3 week turn around when requesting videos for classroom use (one at a time, eesh). I'm worried that if I have them go to other libraries to watch something, they just won't do the assignment and I'll lose them. Damn.

I already use the online PBS videos, but I was hoping for some more variety. Part of the idea was getting them to explore evolutionary topics on their own, rather than all watching the same thing. Any ideas?

Edit for clarification: I should point out that this supplementary to their textbooks and lectures. I saw a pretty big improvement once I started using the videos. Hence, it's depressing to lose them and anticipate dropped scores. I didn't want anyone to read this and think ""Wait, you're just having the movies teach for you?"" XD. No, no, no. It's an assignment to reinforce the classroom material.",,False,self,t5_2qhlh,1350254743.0,,,True,t3_11hcam,http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/11hcam/damn_damn_damn_the_youtube_channel/,
