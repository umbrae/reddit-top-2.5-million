/r/all (/u/Arrowjoe)

For all you redditors that are coming in from the front page;

Greg ""IdrA"" Fields is a long time pro-gamer. He's a very polarizing figure in the Starcraft 2 community, for the attitude he shows when on camera. He has been a member of the team Evil Geniuses since late 2010, and was released today for comments he made earlier in the week where he insulted his and his teams fans.

State of the Game is a weekly talk show with members of the Starcraft 2 community. One of IdrA's now former-teammate (and long-time friend) Geoff ""InControl"" Robinson was a guest on the show and announced the news live.

While many people may have been thinking that some disiplinary action would come from this, it's a big shock to everyone that IdrA has been released.

This is an incredibly heated topic, and I'm speaking a bit outside of my comfort zone. Be warned, some things in this thread might be ~~a bit~~ completely outside of the realm of possibility/reality. I'm only speaking from my own, personal experience using the (incredibly) limited amount of knowledge I've accumulated while existing in this part of the internet over the past couple of years.

**History**

For a little bit of backstory, Brood War was ENORMOUS in South Korea. ENORMOUS! It was broadcasted on [national television](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_lXiiK5IAk) to millions of people. Players like Boxer earned [almost a half million dollars](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_248/7378-BoxeR-in-Brief) per year in salary + endorsements. Brood War was, for a lot of people, considered THE definitive E-Sport. Over [100,000 people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starleague_(Ongamenet)#History_of_Starleague) were attending OSL finals.

There's really not much to argue about here. Starcraft: Brood War was enormous. Brood War was an undeniable stepping stone in order to get to where we are today. **So why does it feel like growth has stagnated in Starcraft 2?** Surely there's only one direction to go from the end of the Brood War to the start of Wings of Liberty, and that's up, yes?

**Stagnation and South Korea**

People expected Starcraft 2 to only build upon Brood War and explode in popularity over the 2010-2012 seasons. ""E-SPORTS E-SPORTS E-SPORTS"" people would chant on the forums. Leagues such as IPL, NASL and MLG were raising all sorts of capital to invest in these tournaments with the idea that we'd be getting hundreds of thousands of viewers.

But that growth never came.

Even Sundance went on Live on 3 to explain that he's still [""not making money""](http://www.twitch.tv/onemoregametv/b/308703349?t=55m19s) and that the amount of money being spent now was more akin to ""investing"" than anything that was turning a real profit. We haven't seen the explosion in prize money we've been hoping for.

IPL's prize pool has [remained the same](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/IGN_ProLeague#Tournaments) from seasons 3-5. The NASL's prize pool has [remained the same](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/North_American_Star_League#Tournaments) since its inception. MLG's prize pools [have been rising](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/MLG#Tournaments), but they are the only ones to push relatively innovative monetization schemes into the market (such as the $20 PPV model, + high production gold membership content).

So we haven't really seen the explosive growth that we were kind of expecting and hoping for. There are no million dollar Starcraft 2 tournaments. And, arguably the worst news yet, South Korea didn't bite.

A [quick glance](http://www.gametrics.com/rank/Rank02.aspx) shows that almost 25% of all South Koreans are playing League of Legends in PC Bangs. It's by far the most popular game, with the next game falling in under 13%. Brood War comes in 8th place, at 3.4%, and Wings of Liberty doesn't even make the top 10 list.

**Heart of the ~~Swarm~~ Bored**

There's been a lot of hype concerning Heart of the Swarm. Streamers were looking forward to the (hopefully tremendous) boost of popularity due to having access to the Beta. Players were hoping for innovative new mechanics and play, reinvigorating what was becoming a relatively stagnated and uninteresting gain. I can speak from personal experience here, and from watching others play, that most of the HotS excitement died off **in about one week**. There was a noticeable bump in viewers for a little while, but everything has pretty much settled down now and people are back to Wings of Liberty.

To me, personally, this is one of the biggest nails in the coffin for the Starcraft 2 scene. Brood War was a whole different game, it changed **everything** and it remained popular for some 10 years, arguably defining a generation of South Korean athletics.

--------

Alright, now that we have the history out of the way, it's time to get into some of the more controversial topics and ideas.

**How do we grow Starcraft 2?**

**You** can't.

This sounds like a dick answer, but I'm going into full-on asshole mode for this one. **The people telling you that e-mailing sponsors to thank them for supporting teams etc...etc...and that it's really helping the scene are lying to you, or are delusional.** It may help just a bit, but the impact is incredibly minimal compared to the most important factors - SALES. Companies don't sponsor events so that their PR people can jerk off over e-mails all day long; they sponsor events to get a monetary return on their advertisements.

Here's a simple formula.

I invest $x into an event knowing that it gets y viewers. I expect z% conversion on those viewers and my average sale is $a.

The money you invest into a team is the sponsorships that we hear about. The viewers are the number of people that watch tournaments. The ""conversion"" is a % of people that will make a purchase based on the investment in advertising, and the sale amount can be used to determine the worth of advertising.

If MLG gets 150,000 viewers and their conversion is .5% (750 people) on a particular product and my product sells for $30 each, I can expect to gross ~$22,500 in sales from ""sponsoring"" said tournament. If I were going to advertise or invest in MLG, there are no amount of ""friendly e-mails"" that are going to cause me to invest more than that into it, because it's simply not worth my time or money to do so.

Yeah, I simplified this quite a bit. Brand image (people being happy/associating your brand with positive ideas) and loss leading (losing money in one area in the hopes of using the marketing to gain money in another area) do exist, and it IS a good thing to tell advertisers that you have MADE A PURCHASE of a product DUE to them sponsoring a particular event. However, I get this feeling/notion that people think that if we just go on these mass e-mailing sprees that somehow it will ""grow e-sportz!!111"" or cause this huge influx of money into the scene.

In the end, it all comes down to money. **The best way to grow E-Sports is to acquire more viewers**.

**If we can't do anything, who can?**

There is only one person right now who can grow Starcraft 2 in the way it needs to grow. One entity, rather.

Blizzard.

Starcraft 2 is suffering from a lot of problems. It has been from the very beginning, but Blizzard has failed to address them time and time and time again. They are continually proving themselves utterly incompetent when it comes to managing a game as a competitive sport backed by a casual community.

People, ESPECIALLY people in this community seem to fail to realize that a game's competitive success lives or dies by its casual accessibility. Yeah, in a dream world we all want this ULTRA CUT-THROAT COMPETITIVE FUCK YOUR FACE game where OH MY FUCKING GOD SKILL CEILING SO HIGH NO MULTIPLE BILDING SIELECT FUK AUTO-MICRO OH MY GOD SO COMPETITIVEEE!1111...But in the real world, no one wants to play that game except competitive people.

Competitive games are not fun.

It's not fun to play ranked matches that affect a ladder ranking. Why on earth would you play a game that gives you ladder anxiety? Why would you play a game where 11/11 or 6 pools or 4gates can kill you in under 4 minutes? Why would you play a game that punishes mistakes so cruelly?

The average, casual player wouldn't. One of the Starcraft 2's major problems is its inability to understand that its primary audience (the casual gamer) has been completely neglected.

Let's look at Brood War for a second. Check out [what you see](http://i.imgur.com/KyINg.png) as soon as you log in. The chat + friends list takes up almost 70% of the screen! If you want to play ""Melee"" games (kind of the equivalent to Laddering in SC2) you have to click the ""Join"" button on the right, and then filter for the melee games you wanted to play. **Starcraft 2 has taken a relatively minor and extremely unpopular feature of Starcraft Brood War and made it the [focal point](http://i.imgur.com/FKDuq.jpg) of their game.** Why in the FUCK would you design a game around the most unpopular feature of its predecessor?! **This shows a clear and disgusting lack of understanding on Blizzard's part and is entirely unacceptable for a company trying to design a competitive game.**

I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to things like these; obviously the people in Blizzard who work in the positions they work in are there for a reason, so I assume they know more than me about these things. But this...oversight...I just don't understand. Everyone who played Brood War played for the UMS games; the 2v2v2v2 BGHs; the 3v3 zero clut!111 nr 20 and 2v2v2v2 FMP!. When most people think of BW, they remember playing hundreds of games of Evolves or Bunker Wars or that fucking Yugioh! or DBZ game.

WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THE FOCAL POINT OF SC2 A COMPETITIVE ASPECT WHEN 95% OF CASUAL GAMERS HAVE NO DESIRE TO COMPETE?!

This lack of understanding on Blizzards part is the number 1 reason why Starcraft 2 is dying, and their **[utter failure](http://kotaku.com/5599252/starcraft-ii-chat-rooms-are-inbound)** in understanding even the most basic concepts of designing a casual-friendly game are mind-blowing.

Here are a few suggestions just right off the top of my head, that would increase SC2's popularity among casual gamers:

- More ways to get achievements (everyone fucking loves achievements, look at: X-box live, Square-enix's online play, Steam, PSN, origin, WoW, to name a few)
- Customizable decals or skins for units (no affect on play, only visual)
- Paid/unpaid name change (THEY ALREADY ACCEPT PAYMENTS AND YOU CAN ALREADY CHANGE YOUR NAME, THE BACK-END EXISTS, WHY NOT MAKE A FRONT-END FOR THIS WHAT THE FUCK?!)
- Fix the clusterfuck that is ""The Arcade"" (I don't even)

Blizzard is by no means an indie company, it's not like they lack the funds or the resources to do any of these things. The fact that we had a game launch without chat channels...I don't...what...how...my God....

Players LOVE ""building"" towards something when they play. That's why people grind out games on League of Legends - they always earn points every game that they can put towards new champions or runes.  **There is no reason to play more than a few online games of Starcraft 2 before putting it down and being done with it.** This is a HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM.

What's worse, Blizzard seems to be completely oblivious to all of these problems with Heart of the Swarm. Clan support? WE DON'T WANT CLAN SUPPORT, JUST LET US CHANGE OUR NAMES. Ability to play unranked games? This is nice, BUT FIX THE CLUSTERFUCK ARCADE, casual gamers don't give a fuck about 1v1s!

**So what's going to happen in the next few years?**

I'm sorry if I come off as pessimistic, but with the way that RioT and Valve are doing SO MANY THINGS right with their respective games, I can't see SC2 being considered a serious competitive game come 2 years from now. LoL's growth has been explosive, DotA 2 is...well, fuck, it's DotA and Valve, what else needs to be said? Both games push their marketing HARD (RioT [pushes their youtube](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/news/subscribe-riot-games-youtube-get-unchained-alistar) and runs [all sorts of promotions](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=80451) to get people involed in the community, DotA has [HATS](http://kotaku.com/5914769/dota-2-is-free-but-you-can-buy-hats) MAN, HATS!).

Starcraft 2 has....people clapping during Blizzcon when players don't spawn in close positions and people screaming in agony when lag screens come up. And don't give me this bullshit about how ""IT WASN'T B.NETS FAULT!"", IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT IT'S NOT B.NETS FAULT, IF IT WAS ON LAN THEN INTERNET WOULDN'T BE A FUCKING FACTOR. And them having the nerve to say that emulating the b.net server locally would be [impossible](http://www.joystiq.com/2009/06/30/starcraft-2-blizzard-responds-to-lack-of-lan-support/) is a fucking [JOKE](http://www.taultunleashed.com/starcraft2-bots-hacks/starcraft-2-lan-hack-easy-to-set-up-t81015.html).

Again, sorry if this sounds pessimistic, but if this game is going to grow and be considered a serious contender to LoL or DotA 2 over the next few years, the only person we can really rely on to step up their game is Blizzard. The community can help, a bit; purchasing products and letting advertisers know you are making purchases based on sponsorships + telling your friends about the game. But Blizzard HAS to make some kind of serious attempt to appeal to the casual player and to bolster interest and support from the casual gamer.

The ball's in your court, Blizzard.

Last year I organized a local SC2 tournament for students in my home town of Nijmegen. This year the Nijmegen Student StarCraft League has grown into the [Dutch StarCraft League](http://dutchstarcraftleague.nl/)! In one year we've grown from one man and a computer to an organization - ALL volunteers - of 40+ people! Right now we're in the World Forum in The Hague (Den Haag) setting everything up for the Finals Event tomorrow. As I'm writing this I'm sitting on the stage in the main room, watching technicians, casters, admins and lots of other people setting everything up. The production is going to be top-knotch, we have the best equipment and AMAZING volunteers giving up countless hours of their time to make this happen. I myself have taken the week off from work and over the past 4 days have spent 62 hours on all the necessary preparations - an exhilarating experience to be so completely immersed in this project. 

Now all we need is an audience! If you are anywhere near Den Haag in the Netherlands please consider [coming by](http://www.dscl.nl/finals) tomorrow. You'll see the very best Dutch StarCraft players (and one Swede :)) as well as four amazing teams in action. Casted live by the likes of Madals, BelleNOiR, Lyrlian, Weiman &amp; Odin, and yesterday Kaelaris even said he might drop by! Entrance is FREE!

The [brackets for the Individual League and Team League are here](http://www.dutchstarcraftleague.nl/brackets-finals-live-team-prizes-finalized/), and starting tonight the website will be completely revamped to maximize the viewing experience. There will be two streams ALL day long - the matches start at 10:00h CET and end around 23:00h CET. The finals show starts at 19:30h.

If you can't come but want to help spread the word that'd be great too - you can find [a poster](http://www.dutchstarcraftleague.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/poster_finals2.png) on our press page that you could share on Facebook for example. 

Go e-sports in the Netherlands!

So today after waking up to some of the following scenery, I really decided it was time for a change! Results in Starcraft 2 have not been spectacular as of late, and I am actively thinking of ways I can turn them around and start delivering good performances again in the game I love. To jump right into things..

This is what it looks like: http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/DSC_0448.png

The Room:
http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/DSC_0449.jpg
http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/DSC_0450.jpg

I've been smoking cigarettes for about 6 years now. Im up to about a pack a day, and I feel like I'm heavily addicted to them. Being a SC2 progamer, it's not easy when you are playing a series and you have that strong urge to have a cigarette. Overall it's just a completly useless and bad habit to have, that costs a lot of money and makes a lot of situations more stressfull, rather than relieving stress which is what people originally use it for.

Other than smoking, I also have pretty disgusting health habits. Some of the people in the SC community may know that I used to be a lot bigger - over 300 pounds.

Before: http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/ret1stprizedhs09.jpg
After: http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/LiquidRet/ret_interview2.jpg

I have succeeded before living healthy for a long period of time and managed to lose about 120 lbs in the course of 8 months. After picking up SC2 again though, my workout habits slowely started to decline and are no pretty much non existant. Because of the hours theres a ton of garbage (gas station) food.  I've been gaining weight and I want to make a change where that's concerned as well. I figured the best way to give these lifestyle ideals a good headstart is by sharing them with the community.

Today will be the last day I will smoke a cigarette, and the last day of junk food and other bad nutricion as well. The next 5 days are probably going to be hell, from smoking a full pack of cigarettes a day to zero. I don't know if I'll be able to sleep well, or what kind of side effects I should expect. I thought a fun way to keep myself distracted from whatever may happen - is just to play a shit ton of starcraft. I have 2 big tournaments coming up in November, MLG Dallas and LoneStarClash, and if I just do nothing but play Starcraft 2 for 8 days while beating a bad habit, I think nothing but good could come out of this for me. 

Other than obvious downsides of smoking, such as smell, cost, and addiction, it also makes your heartrate increase and has a bad influence on your brain. I don't think this is good for a starcraft progamer. I want to try and compete and be as healthy and fit as possible from this point on - we are cyber 'atlethes' after all.

Tonight I will clean out my room, make it look super clean and neat! I think that will help make a new start in a good direction. Tomorrow I'll take new pictures of my room (the place I will stream from). And I hope if there is anyone out there that also wants to make some lifestyle changes, will join me now in making changes. It doesn't have to be tomorrow when I start, but think about it, and live a little healthier, nothing bad can come of it!

First thing I'll do tomorrow is go to the gym and then I'll stream for 10 hours - everyday untill I go to MLG Dallas to compete, and you guys can watch me struggle with beating this addiction, support me, make fun of me, whatever!

But I know now that I've told EVERYBODY about this, I won't fail :D

My personal goals:

- Becoming a non smoking person over the course of 1 day...2 days... 1 week.. 1 month..forever.
- Living a healthy lifestyle that attributes to becoming a better progamer overall. Fitness, physhical health, mental health are all linked and living a healthy life should contribute to better results in the game.
- Being happier. (Of course!)

Short term Goal:

- During this 8 day heavy stream stint before MLG Dallas, I will Absolutely, Unquestionably, obtain rank 1 EU GM!! :D (This is just for fun, and to motivate myself haha)
- You can expect from me to stream 10 hours for the next 8 days each day, untill I go to MLG Dallas to compete

No matter what happens I will update on twitter - wether it's sleeping problems, headaches or anything else, aside from the hours a day ill be on stream and you might see me squirming away on the floor screaming for a cigarette. Everybody whos tried knows what a bitch it can be to cold turkey quit smoking, but hopefully after a little while I can start tweeting about how much nicer it is to breathe, and all that good stuff.

As a Follow up of all this I will post a VLOG at some point during or right atfter MLG Dallas, recapping the whole experience.

hope you guys enjoy the show tomorrow, and most of all I want to call on people that enjoy SC2, or even ones that don't, that want to make a change in their life to pick up the axe and start axing away in the following days, and we can start living healthier (This bunch of emo crap should appeal to the American Spirit around here - note ret.)

Tomorrow people will laugh at me for this but in the end I hope to see the benefits and I just wanted to make it fun. And If I can get one other person to quit too then this would be a great succes also :)

As I post this the whole room is clean and all the traces of ashes or cigarettes are 99% gone - it was too dark to do it 100%. And tomorrow we start this battle with sc2 as the remedy :D 
Lets GO!

1334266907.0,1846,self.starcraft,s6uxo,"Hi Reddit, This is HD, &amp; I should have wrote this a long time ago.",5871,4025,1180,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/s6uxo/hi_reddit_this_is_hd_i_should_have_wrote_this_a/," Hey guys, this is HD, and I was one of the broadcasters during IPL4 at the Cosmopolitan last weekend. I am here on Reddit to make a post that I really should have done a long time ago. Reddit is a community that is very outspoken with their thoughts, and you guys have made it known that my casting has been terrible, mis-informed, and fake, and that, I, as a person am idiotic, stupid, etc. And nowhere was your voice heard louder than last weekend at IPL4.


Now, I'm sitting here, 4 days removed from the event, and I've finally had a chance to process the entire event and the feedback. First, let me say that the reason why I haven't responded or made a public post on Reddit before is because quite honestly I was/am? scared. I am human, and last weekend was definitely an emotional roller-coaster. You guys tore me a new one. I was hurt, still am, but I need to address the community. Although I'm not entirely sure how this post is going to come across to you guys, I've decided I'm just going to let it all out, and see where it goes.


First off let me say that I agree with most of you guys, and I appreciate all of the constructive criticism I received during the weekend. I'm not here to make any excuses, nor am I here to garner sympathy.  I'm here to accept responsibility for my position, make ammends with the community, and hopefully look forward to a brighter future. You guys are right in saying that I need to improve my casting, whether it be improving my knowledge of the metagame, the players, my choice of words, etc. I'm also here because there is a stigma associated with me, and while I'm not deluding myself into believeing that this response  will break that stigma, I'm at least hoping that it can shed some light on me as a person, Alex, NOT HD.


If there has been any doubt about me not reading posts made about me on Reddit, I hope it is clear now that I do. Any free time that I had this past weekend, I was on my phone browsing through R/Starcraft. It was pretty hurtful, some of the things that were said (I think I read somebody would like to punch me in the face if they saw me? Good thing that didn't happen O.o), but I tried to take all of the constructive posts and comments as best as I could, and improve the way I casted on Sunday in order to give the community what they wanted. I took great care to slow down my commentary, because I feel like I blurt out mistakes when I get excited, and I made sure to be as genuine as possible, rather than incorporating ""excitement"" that might come out as fake. Althought it still may not have pleased everyone, I know I gave it my best. Now I'm not going to lie, there were still silly mistakes made in the heat of the games, (obviously concussive shells doesn't add damage to Marauder's attack damage) but overall I feel like I delivered one of my most accurate, professional, and genuine casts on Sunday, and it was because of the community. Its also no secret that my fundamentals of Zerg are much stronger than Protoss or Terran, being that I used to compete with Zerg. I think a fabulous suggestion I read was to start playing Random on Ladder, in order to strengthen my grasp on P and T, something that I plan to do.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you for catching me and helping me to right the ship, before it was too late. 


Obviously, not everybody is going to agree with me here, and I'm sure there are still those that feel I should be taken out of the picture entirely, and never heard from again. But for those who have been there to support me and give me constructive criticism, I want to give my thanks. It can be very difficult attempting to cast and please both the casual and hardcore StarCraft audience, and this is where I have to find a balance that makes sense.  It is my hope that in the future, should I return to IPL, that the community will see I am working hard to improve my casting, and I continue to humbly submit myself to the community and its comments and critiques. Afterall, E-sports is a community driven project, and you guys have the final say. Constructive critique helps me improve, pure hate hurts. Well that's all I really have to say. I hope this ends up coming across the way I had originally envisioned it. Keep on rockin Reddit.


PS. I would like to take this opportunity to clear the air regarding somebody who was impersonating me on Reddit last year. (That was not me.) I hope nobody took offense to what was said under my supposed alias, that was just a troller. 

Edit: Also would like to take this opportunity to ask Reddit to keep an eye on my upcoming YouTube casts. That's where I can continue to improve with your critique, and I will be making a very solid attempt to build on Sunday's casts and deliver some very solid games.

Prepare your pants people.",2926,1185,677,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1d2qet/gsl_wcs_kr_code_s_group_b_life_parting_innovation/,"The GSL, now known as the World Championship Series Korea, is the most prestigious individual league in Starcraft 2. The premier division of this league - Code S - contains 32 of the best players in Starcraft 2. After 16 are knocked out in the first group phase, another group phase is played. Four players are seeded by the number of points accrued in previous GSLs. Each seed is a member of a different group and gets to choose their first opponent. The opponent they choose picks another, and so on, until there are four groups of four players, from which two will advance to the knockout rounds (Ro8 -&gt; Semi-finals -&gt; Finals).

PartinG, the winner of two world championships and arguably the best protoss player in the world, was a seed for this Ro16 group selection. Instead of picking an easy opponent, he picked his rival, the player who beat him in the final of GSL Blizzard Cup, and whom he knocked out in the last GSL - Life. Life is a prodigy, a freak of nature who has won five premier championships in the space of five months. He is indisputably the best zerg and best overall player in the world. Either because he did not want to show weakness, or because he is supremely confident, Life chose to add INnoVation to the group. Although he does not have the same resume as the former two, he is one of the two best terran players in the world and is in frightening form. With the crowd at his back, he completed the group of death by choosing Flash... the player who was a prodigy before it became cool, the greatest StarCraft: Brood War player in history, and the man revered as 'God'. He joins INnoVation as the other great terran player of today.

If each of these four players made it to the semi-finals, that would be the strongest semi-finals of all time. Whoever the two players are that advance from this group, either of them is a favourite to win the whole tournament.

TL;DR: The (arguably) best protoss, the best zerg, and the two best terran players are in a knockout group for the Ro16 of the most prestigious StarCraft 2 tournament in the world.

**--EDIT--**

Following iNcontroL's response below, I'd like to change the tone of this post from the above all caps line to this:

Geoff, at MLG Dallas I asked you to sign a boxed copy of SC2 for me. You were in the player area but you seemed free at the time. As I handed it to you, others came up and started requesting more signatures. At the same time, an MLG rep approached you and your attention was split like 5 different ways. You had already signed my box, but I could tell you were flustered trying to find out who to hand it back to so you could move on. I grabbed it, smiled and walked off.

With my back turned, you yelled ""Hey! What's your name man?"" I told you.

Then you said, ""Nice to meet you, _____, thanks.""

You thanked me. I wasn't sure why, but I knew instantly that you were a good guy. A good man with a kind heart. It made my day.

So here's what I'd like to change that line to:

**I will support everything you do Geoff. SotG, SC2, streaming, casting, you fucking name it man. I'm with you.

Based on everything we have learned about it so far, the Starcraft expansion is just further proof that Blizzard has no idea how to design a game. The new units range from bland ""me too"" designs, to completely broken units that will ruin the game.
Let's look at them race-by-race.

TERRAN:

To understand why the first new Terran unit is a bad idea, you need to understand the way the three races are designed. Until now, Starcraft has been balanced around the three races different ways of recovering damage. Zerg units regenerate. Protoss units regain shields. Terran mech units can be repaired, but bio units can not. Introducing the medic, a new bio unit that can heal marines, firebats and even SCVs not only makes Terran bio simply too powerful, but it removes the important uniqueness of the various races. In essence, it stops Terran being Terran.

The valkyrie is expensive and, given all the answers Terran already has to air units, unlikely to ever be built.

Special mention should also be given to the ""Charon Boosters"" upgrade for goliaths. By making it easier to a-move goliaths into guardians or carriers, Blizzard is dumbing down the game, and removing the importance of micro, positional play and strategy.

ZERG:

The zerg army is all about manoeuvrability and strength in numbers. So why the hell are they getting a big, dumb, immobile, lame copy of a siege tank? Lurkers are not zerg-like at all and have no place in the game.

Devourers, on the other hand, look promising as they finally give the zerg an answer to carriers and battlecruisers, where previously players would have had to build (and lose) scourge to take care of those threats.

PROTOSS:

Dark Templar were fun in the single-player game, but I can't for the life of me understand why Blizzard think they will work in multi-player. Maybe they were just too lazy to make a new unit, and fell back on one they'd already developed? Zerg has to make Overlords anyway, so they already have detection everywhere, Terran can take out DTs with a single scan, and Protoss has cannons and observers. I don't see DTs being used in any kind of serious game.

Dark Archon. Does Protoss really need another spell-caster? Some of its abilities seem useful (Mind Control could be potentially game-breaking as it allows you to exceed the supply cap (!)), but since nobody is going to be building Dark Templar, putting those abilities on the Dark Archon seems a great way to ensure they are never used.

Corsairs: oh great. Protoss gets _another_ useless air unit to go alongside the Scout. Yawn.

Overall, I am incredibly pessimistic about the release of Brood War. All I can hope is that enough people keep playing the original Starcraft without these worthless additions that we can maintain a viable league for years to come.

I'm crank. I write a post. because I appreciate for reddit.
First of all,I am not good at English. but don't worry. my translate ability is better than google translator. :D
sometimes i thought. do i deserve about supporting, cheering?. I am not high level of progamer and famous. just I am progamer to live in small country.
so I surprised about cheering and supporting. recently, I lost my passion and my mind of job. but your give me the reason for keep going. 
when I receive suggestion about going to MLG, I don't think to get good result. at least, I'm not top player, to my mind. I'll practice many game to be a top player In future.
It's not humble. just objectivity. so I thought about my responsibility. so I feel a strong sense of responsibility about supporting.
I thought. All I can do is practice. and show my game. Although I will not get good result, I must practice very hard for my fans, me.
Thank you for read. Thank you for everything. Thank google translator and English dictionary. :D

1375990028.0,1603,self.starcraft,1jz4u5,Let's have a chat.,2756,1153,1052,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1jz4u5/lets_have_a_chat/,"Despite my degree I am actually horrible when it comes to just about all things literary but I do read good (huehue) so pardon my wall of text.

Right now it is uniquely more in fashion this week to do your best chicken little impression in regards to SC2. This is because the mammoth of a tourney in TI3 is going on and it is one of if not the single most watched eSport event we have to offer. It's awesome! Amazing production, the biggest prizepool and the best players.. what is there not to get excited about? 

During this week (in particular) SC2 gets picked on. SC2 WAS the gaming stud in 2010. All other games envied us. Since then things have changed and we are now no longer the top dog and that is ok. That being said, due to our success, at times like these we get reminded of this and that too is ok.. competition and being proud of your game/community is good. 

When MLG ""announced"" that they probably won't have SC2 at their last big MLG event of the season they were doing a couple things as far as I can tell:

A. they were announcing bad news (as far as the SC2 community is concerned) months in advance so the story runs it's course and dies down before MLG rolls around.

B. They were announcing it amidst TI3 because this news cannot steal the headlines and will be to a certain extent muffled by this weeks events.

C. It is MOST ok to ""abandon"" or ""quit"" on SC2 this week because people are at a mindset where they are more likely to accept it as a natural course of action with SC2 ""dying""

This is disappointing but also expected. MLG pays Blizzard to run SC2 at their events. They are PAID BY Riot, CoD, Infinite Crisis etc.. to have their games at MLG. Much like WCG in the past. When your company is spending more than it is making and massive investments from years past are starting to have questions raised about some form of a return the fat gets trimmed. 

I for one am thankful for what MLG has done for SC2 in the past. They ran amazing events and they were a hell of a lot of fun to attend, watch and be a part of. I am sad that at this point it would seem to be over. I am disappointed with how it was handled (tweet unofficially from sundance amidst TI3) and I wish it was different.

Is SC2 dying? Is the NA scene dead? Is the game.. declining?

Real talk? No. Do we have problems? Yes. I am going to take a risk and voice an honest opinion that can get me in a lot of trouble:

WCS was initiated sloppy. It was a great idea execute horrifically and it cost us time, money and an image that needs a lot of work. WCS has a strangle hold on SC2 content which means the non Blizz affiliated companies have almost no room to grow. Partners (MLG) if not executed properly will damn near die trying to manage WCS. Right now WCS is heading in the right direction. ESL has done a fantastic job, NASL is promising and from what we've seen can be a NA version of the ESL in terms of managing WCS. Korea always puts on a good show so we are heading in the direction of a solid WCS presentation. That said I believe it needs to humble itself. WCS not allowing other events to broadcast against it in theory maximizes viewership on our best content.. but it also strangles and kills innovative ideas, the job market in SC2 and really any kind of natural growth. By empowering 3 different partners (4 if you count Kespa/Gom) to the extent you do with WCS you are making it illogical to get involved with SC2. WCS needs to have confidence in it's product but also allow for other people to come in and try their hand. Maybe shorter/fewer WCS seasons would be nice. More down time between seasons. Openly and actively work with the community to encourage non WCS content. We are not Riot, you do not have full control over this scene and that is your STRENGTH blizzard. Trying to seize control now is hurting the ecosystem.

So yes, WCS could use some work and improvement and in it's current form it's a great idea executed poorly becoming a solid broadcast we can all count on. 

Moving forward the SC2 scene will be ok! We will never be #1 again but that too is ok. I am happy with being top 5, 3 or what have you. MLG made many mistakes and is now bowing out of the SC2 scene. Fine! That vacuum can be filled. DH has very intensely been working on bringing over their show to the USA. NASL has been doing fantastic and with MLG gone maybe they fill that void because they KNOW they can put on a great show and now they have no competitor to do it? I can't say specifics but EG has been kicking some ideas around as well. The NA scene is rough.. it's dire and it's the wild fucking west here but it WILL go on and we WILL have NA centric events you guys can be proud of.

This game, this community and everything that makes it up has given me so much. My life is based around this. Think I am biased? You are god damn right I am biased.. biased as shit. But I am also a fairly intelligent logical human being (mostly!) and I can tell you I am not filling out applications for other places or creating a plan B. I feel secure and I know that while right now things aren't as sparkly as they were in 2010 I know we will be fine. Avoid super fatalistic talk and engage in the conversation. There is work to be done and we don't have time for self-loathing tears and acting like a coward. It's time to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps, support those that contribute, innovate and generate!

And here we are folks. The beginning of SHOUTcraft America is upon us. A couple of years ago we started a little invitational series that rapidly became one of the most watched online tournaments around. After a long break, that small tournament has evolved into a continent-spanning proof of concept with the largest sponsor-free prize-pool ever.

1) Support foreign players and help close the gap with Korea

2) Support sponsors shown on the Virtual Jersey and help the scene grow stronger

3) Enjoy face-to-face pre-match banter with the players as they face off prior to their series.

4) Gameheart custom maps for a superior viewing experience

5) Evenly matched and unpredictable play from American pros looking to impress

6) The best intermission music with classic originals and remixes from all your childhood videogame favorites. It's ok, we know you're a nerd, it can be our little secret. Guaranteed dubstep free.

7) No caster cams! Seriously, you don't have to see our ugly mugs at any point! Enjoy cool-ass visuals and minimal downtime instead. Let's be honest, we're probably not wearing trousers.

8) The only tournament where you can encourage and reward great plays by throwing money at them. No coins please, seriously those things hurt.

9) 720p 60 frames per second free stream. It might even work for more than an hour if Time Warner Cable doesn't fuck it up. Oh who am I kidding... you might have to watch the free VoDs.

10) Husky and TotalBiscuit are pretty decent casters I guess. I mean hell, we can think of worse. No seriously, gimme a minute.... hmm.... welp

- Casts all weekend of MLG Anaheim
- After 3 full days of casting and with his voice going fast, he hosts a live Live on Three after MLG. (with Flash!)
- Gets sick with an ear infection after MLG weekend, doctor says he shouldn't fly to cast Dreamhack, says ""Fuck that noise."" and still plans to go.
- Despite his sickness still hosts Live on Three a few days later, in which he has to leave the show for a period due to the pain, but still comes back to finish the show.
- Has his flight to Sweden delayed, causing him to miss his connection, and having to take a flight the next day. 
- Uses that time to go to the doctor and get a shot (in the ass no less) to try and be as well as possible for Dreamhack and make sure he gets there.
- Has his second flight delayed, but this time is able to make the trip to Sweden, although doesn't know if his bags made it as well (fortunately they did).
- Makes it to his hotel a few hours before his first cast, can't check in and even take a shower before having to go cast. 
- Finally makes it to Dreamhack, and is casting with Apollo without missing a beat, sounding like he didn't just step off a place that came from the other side of the world a few hours earlier.

1289858493.0,1507,self.starcraft,e6lsu,Day[9]'s Letter to Reddit,2639,1132,340,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/e6lsu/day9s_letter_to_reddit/,"Hey guys!  Day[9] here!  Although I read reddit regularly, this is my first ever post on /r/starcraft! :&gt;.

A while back, approaching my 200th episode, I told everyone I wanted to do a special: a day in the life of Day[9].  Even though my time constraints forced a delay, I noticed a thread on reddit trying to organize a mass donation drive to coincide with the special.  I was deeply flattered to see people actually offering to send money my way.  

Sadly, traveling on the road to a million and one tournaments caused delay after delay after delay of the 200th episode special, so I felt a tad guilty for letting people down.  However, I promised myself that it WOULD happen eventually: I spoke to a videographer and an editor to ensure that the episode would have fancy production values and really give people a sense of my day to day existence :D.

As I organized everything for that episode, answered my slews of daily e-mails, prepped for the daily shows, and traveled to tournaments every weekend, I didn't have much time to do much else.  In particular, I didn't check my paypal donation page very frequently.  As much as I love the image of me F5-ing paypal every 15 minutes while fist pumping and screaming ""SHIP THE MONEY BITCHES,"" I actually derive my happpiness from doing the show, the warm community, and hearing people say things like ""you helped me get into diamond!""  I'm always blown away by how insanely nice and supportive the SC2 community is.

However, I underestimated how nice you guys really are.  My schedule cleared up and I finally got the chance to log into my paypal.

Before my eyes were thousands of dollars.  THOUSANDS.  And not thousands of dollars donated by a handful of generous individuals.  The donations were in small increments: 1$, 4$, 10$, and a couple of 15s and 20s.  In other words, an astounding amount of people voluntarily donated enough money so that I don't have to take out another gigantic loan for my last semester of grad school.

I was so happy I didn't even know what to do.  Student loans have always been a point of stress for me, and that giant burden was lifted from my shoulders in an instant.  I made a thank you in one of my dailies, but that absolutely doesn't do justice to the amazing gift you've provided me.  I saw people from gosugamers, teamliquid, and other communities provide donations.  But, I know that the reddit community orchestrated the entire drive, and that it would have never happened without you guys.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much.

I'm more motivated than ever to keep making as much content as I can.  I'm even expanding the daily so that I can do more than 5 a week! (doing 2 on tuesdays and wednesdays hopefully!).  As expected, I'm still traveling to tournaments to cover those (Dreamhack Nov 25-28th!).

At the end of the day, whatever you think would be fun on the daily, let me know, because the Day[9] Daily is YOUR show.  I might use my face and voice, but the daily has been and always will be about YOU.  Thank you thank you thank you thank you for being so awesome and supportive.  I can't express my gratitude enough :&gt;.

With that said, let there be eSports!  Cheers guys!

Of course we may, over time, discover replays which we can resume that are quite easy to beat. But equally as likely, I assert that a replay will be found, from a game when it seemed to many people that he prematurely quit, a replay that is conquered by none, a replay that will prove to be near impossible in which to become victorious.  
But then a man, a professional gamer, a God among men, He will defeat the odds. And we will know that he is the greatest among us. And we will be certain of this because IdrA believed it to be impossible.  
It shall hence forth be called IdrA's true test of skill",[Fluff],False,self,t5_2qpp6,1365155101.0,flu,,True,t3_1bnhjp,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1bnhjp/who_else_wants_to_see_pros_resume_old_idra_games/,

Please be aware that it is fairly easy to write a script that will detect and instantly claim game keys when they are written into self-posts.

Instead, I suggest putting the key into an image and posting that for the karma you deserve. *(see edit below)*

Alternatively, you can make a self-post, choose someone from the comments and send them the key in a private message. Anything is better than putting the key in the main body.

---

**edit:** Some good points from the comments - it is indeed possible to parse text from images (similar to those meme transcriber bots). If too many people start posting images with keys, we will probably see bots implemented for them.

The best defense would be to edit the key in a simple way that a human needs to fix. For example, post the key with the first/last digits reversed, post it completely backward, add extra characters, etc. and explain what you did. The more unpredictable, the better. In this case, putting the key in a self-post may be acceptable.",[Other],False,self,t5_2qpp6,1365022239.0,oth,,True,t3_1bljg9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1bljg9/psa_for_those_giving_away_hots_game_keys_to_the/,

You might recognize me as the main contributor of GosuBuilds.  You might recognize me as one of the moderators on /r/AllThingsTerran.  You might recognize me as one of the casters of the ATP/ATT and ATT/ATZ subreddit battles.  You might recognize me as the captain of Rice University's CSL team.

Or you might have no idea who the hell I am and really not give a shit about what I'm writing about.  Regardless, here's my brief story:

In the summer of 2012, I saw a post about GosuBuilds.com, a site advertising itself as ""the place to go to"" for good sc2 build orders.  I very quickly realized that the community does in fact very desperately need a good build order site, and I was definitely willing to help make that a reality.  I emailed the singular guy who owned it and soon started writing build orders for the site.

However, after working on the site for a full year, writing up over 100 pro build orders that he got credit for (I wrote up 76 out of the past 80 build orders uploaded to the site in the past 8 months, in the time he wrote up 1), and sometimes not being able to contact him for over a month when it comes to basic changes I would like to see to the website, I decided things needed to change.  I asked to buy the site from him.

Surprisingly, it took me several emails, and a full year of working under this guy to realize that he only cared about the money, and not about helping the community at all--the main reason that I started working on the site to begin with.  He wouldn't settle for anything less than $1000 (money which to a college kid like me is simply impossible to come by - as well as unreasonable to ask for seeing as the builds I wrote up are the only reason the website went from 200 viewers/day to 5000 viewers/day).  Fully aware that nobody would update the website with new builds if I left (he has told me he stopped playing this game and is only keeping it active for the ad revenue), I left the website.

--------------------

**I would now like to introduce the new Starcraft build order site that I'm working on made FOR the community.  Please check out [IMBAbuilds.com](http://imbabuilds.com/).**

It has most of the builds I wrote for the previous website, as well as several new ones that I've recently written up in the past days such as [NaNiwa's Zealot/Immortal All-in](http://imbabuilds.com/pvz-naniwas-zealotimmortal-all-in/) he used so effectively at Dreamhack Stockholm 2013, or [Innovation's Reactor Hellion 3CC build](http://imbabuilds.com/tvz-innovations-reactor-hellion-3cc/) that has become the standard go-to macro TvZ build to use in the recent months.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to message me below or email me at imbabuilds@gmail.com if you don't want others to see your questions.  Any UI concerns on the website would be great too - a lot of the website design has changed in the past couple of days, so it wouldn't be too bad to change it a little more.  

Thank you for reading this long essay.  I thought it would be a bit more brief when I first set out to write it, but I had a lot to get off my chest.

--------------------

**TL;DR** I wrote almost all of the builds on GosuBuilds.  Fed up with the owner of the site only wanting money and not contributing at all, I offered to buy the website.  Couldn't afford (and was unreasonable to give) the ridiculous $1000 he asked for, so I left the website.  My new website is [IMBAbuilds](http://imbabuilds.com), a build order site I will constantly update made exclusively for the community.

PS: In case any of you are Zerg masters+ players who want to write up builds, I would love for you to contact me.  I am only a Terran/Protoss player, so am uncomfortable writing up Zerg builds for fear that some of the information might be incorrect.

Thanks,

My name is david, and I go by the handle of ""SmiLe"". I am not a pro gamer, what I am though is a top master Terran player that enjoys competition. This weekend I spent my time competing in the MLG Anaheim Open Bracket. Because I wasn't on a sponsored team, I had to pay for my competitor pass myself ($70). Spectators cost ($20). What benefits do you get from getting a competitor pass, rather than the spectator pass? You basically get everything a spectator gets, but you just get to compete. That's a 50 dollar difference, just so you can compete. 

The problem?
The MLG ""staff"" or ""refs"" are completely bias. Unfortunately for me, I got eliminated early because I played some pretty notable players, not the point. Eventually more and more people get eliminated, and then the MLG staff tells you to leave, if you're spectating in the competitor section. 

Since i'm not on a pro team, I obviously did not have a team jersey. These MLG pricks walked up to me, and told me I had to leave. Sure I can leave, no problem.. but why the fuck am I the only one being asked to leave? The korean pro gamers that were eliminated, weren't being asked to leave.The notable American players weren't being asked to leave. Some ""semi-pro"" players that weren't very known were asked to leave too.. 

After leaving, I snuck in with some of the other players that were kicked. Couple of minutes later, they approached me told me to leave. I asked him, word for fucking word I kid you not: ""Why aren't you asking them to leave? It seems like you're only harassing me to leave. Why do they get to stay?""

MLG STAFF: ""I'll tell them to leave too""

Me: ""Can you tell them first, then ask me to leave. Because it seems like you're only harassing me. And I really want to see if you're really gonna tell them to leave""

MLG STAFF: ""No, i'll tell them when you leave.""

Me: ""You sure now?""

MLG STAFF: ""yep""

So i left once again, only to see the stupid MLG staff go back to his seat and drink his dr pepper. 

I payed as just as much money as those pro gamers(&amp;their sponsors) did, why the fuck do I not get the same privileges? 

ALSO

I was playing a practice game before the open bracket started for day 2. The idiot staff told me I had to get off! I looked around me, guess who was practicing. LOL. Every other progamer!

Why am I reporting here, rather to MLG? 
Well, quite simple really.
1. I felt like the community should know this
2. I hope MLG gets bright red with embarrassment and fix this issue.

I don't plan on playing at another MLG ever again (unless a team pays for me^_^) waste of money. 

TLDR; MLG staff are stupid. They should fix it.

From what we've been told, apparently his hand has been really acting up and giving him a lot of pain when he's playing (guess that's why we saw him casting at IPL, glad to see him still being involved!). It's been really hurting his practice and staying up to par with the other players since he can't really use his hands that much now.

Also, recently his father has gotten into a major motorcycle accident, breaking some ribs, collarbone and his entire left side of his back swollen and full of bruises.

I figured I'd make this topic both to inform fans who were wondering what's up with him (since other TL players have been in PL and such) and also maybe to show him some public support for his troubles. Typically, I don't really do this sort of thing (kinda cheesy + we see it a lot for almost any reason [someone doing a good job/not enough recognition]), but given his injuries and taking care of his family (his father won't go to the hospital and tried to mow the lawn yesterday) as well as being an amazing friend, I thought I'd post this for all to read.

Wish you the best Shawn!

Let me start this by giving you the backstory of how I got to where I am, a story which is in no way unique or even interesting, but it's important to know where I came from.

**The Bright Beginning**

Back in 2009-2010, the countdown to SC2 had begun and myself and my group of friends were excited. Some of us had played small amounts of boodwar, but most of us were as noob as the term can describe, so it wasn’t the competitive scene we were excited for, it was simply the game. I watched a few battle reports, watched some HD and Husky vids on youtube and found the site teamliquid on the way. But that was it, before the game came out, my knowledge of the competitive scene was little to none. I had heard that Brood War was big in some asian country, but i never thought to look into it because I didn’t play the game anymore; what would be the point? 

So what were we excited for? It’s really simple: the Single-player, the UMS (custom maps) and some team games. We were excited because it was a new Blizzard game, and up until then Blizzard games had given us ridiculous amounts of fun, why would we assume this game wouldn’t? 

Upon release, we all hammered out the single player campaign, discussed it’s pros and cons, it’s plot-holes and twists, it’s character development and it’s gameplay. But that wouldn’t satisfy us forever. In fact for me, I could only bring myself to play it once. I never bothered with with any harder difficulties because that’s not what I wanted from the game. I wanted to play something more interactive and involving, something that could be shared instantly with my friends. I wanted this because it’s what being a gamer (for me) is all about. Yes, single Player campaigns are great (my favourite game is Half-Life 2) but I wanted to to play this game with my friends. Plain and simple. So we sought other means of entertainment. Enter: custom games and team melee. I’m not going to give my experience of the custom games system yet, but I will come back to this later.

We played custom games for a while and we were genuinely having fun. Then one day, a friend (who was a little more into the competitive side) told us about the GSL. At the time it was still Open Season 1. Almost instantly, we were hooked. Tastosis were hilarious, FruitDealer was incredible and the doors to this whole other world swung open so violently that it took awhile for my eyes to adjust. I couldn't get enough. And for a good while there, neither could my friends. I was more passionate about starcraft than I think about anything else. When Jinro was in the Ro4 in GSL, I joined a rally for Julian Assange, holding a Sign that on one side said “Ignorance is Strength” While the other said “[Go Jinro](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=175764)”

Here’s where my story takes a turn. a turn that results in me being alone out of my group of 5-6 friends who still watches any starcraft at all. 

**The Fade**

Why did my friends all stop watching it? For the longest time I couldn’t understand. Watching tournaments and streams was, to me, just as good as playing the game. No, it was better. Why weren’t my friends sharing the passion I had? After talking to them, I now know the truth, and it’s really simple. They didn’t care about the game anymore. When we got bored of playing the same custom games over and over, they lost interest. (I will also add that a big part of why some stopped is because we are Australians, and since it’s release, we are still playing all of our games on american servers. Even when you choose to log into SEA, the server is still in the USA. Playing every game, whether it be ladder or customs, on 250+ ping isn’t a good way to be entertained)

So that brings me to now. I still watch all GSL code S games. I Follow my favourite teams in the various leagues and I am still waiting for IdrA’s glorious comeback. But this past week has been frustrating to me because almost all of the pro’s and community figures don’t seem to understand me. 

Today on Inside the Game, shit went crazy. For those who haven’t watched it, here is the [VoD](http://www.twitch.tv/onemoregametv/b/336653494).

**The Present Dark**

I watch the show almost every week and find myself in agreement with the hosts on almost everything. But today was different. Today, everyone was so quick to decide on what the casual gamer wants, but no one seemed to point out that they, in their position, cannot know what we want. djWHEAT is one of my most admired community pillars, because of his passion for the scene, but today I differed from him and for once, found his yelling rant to be frustrating and alienating. In almost every tournament, IdrA and iNcontrol are my [cock choices](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=33V5n4F-rxs#t=33s), but I only got frustrated when Geoff told me that I don’t play SC2 because the ladder is too hard and that I will most likely go play sim city, while Greg sat there with this (to me) gross attitude that says “well Blizzard haven’t done anything so lets ignore that and do something else” while not offering us anything of any actual substance as a suggestion. 

WHEAT was saying that we all need to stop believing the unfounded posts of a few and to look at the numbers ourselves. OK. As of right now LoL has more than 3x the viewers on twitch and is behind WoW (assumably because of the expansion). Over at Own3d, Destiny has less viewers that 3 people OF THE SAME TEAM, playing THE SAME GAME OF LoL. You may be content with watching the viewer numbers of the other games rise, simply because it’s the same industry, but I didn’t spend the better part of 2 years dedicated to this game to see it give other games a leg up because the developers aren't paying attention. 

**The Light at the end of the tunnel and the Way Out**

So it all boils down to this: Blizzard are the only ones who are capable of winning my friends back. People say that nothing will happen because the development teams for WoL are too small or that they are spending too much time on HotS. The WCS is a step in the right direction, but if they can spend all that time and money on these tournaments, they have waived the right to say LAN is too hard, or that Cross-Server play is too complicated, that name changes must be paid for, that we have to wait for HotS for replays with friends, that it’s too difficult to make the online experience feel more community based, that it’s the tournaments fault when the drop screen appears. All these things add up and result in the average gamer feeling, at the least, ignored. Blizzard have the power the power to change these things, and I believe we have the power to make them do it.

Nothing IdrA or iNcontrol say will change my mind on that (I want to really press the fact that i’m not doing this to target these guys, I have nothing but the utmost respect for these two, and will continue to be HUGE fans of them). I know this because I’ve seen it and I have experienced it. I’ve seen whole communities disappear because of the choices of developers. I’ve seen friends leave me behind because they were frustrated with how they were treated and bored of the content available to them. 

I hate to take sides in this debate, but it seems that Destiny is the only person that seems to understand me and my friends. We will all be buying HotS, but unless something big changes, I will be following my friends when they move on.",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2qpp6,1351052073.0,dis,Nv,True,t3_11zj8j,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/11zj8j/pro_players_need_to_stop_talking_for_me_a_casual/,

Please someone read this!",2064,810,320,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/uwxei/dear_mlg_i_know_how_to_fix_your_problem_with/,"Thanks to VikingMop for posting about this on reddit first, but I wanted to offer my professional advice on the topic. First off, I think qualifications are in order for me to be able to give any kind of advice on this. I went to college for 3 years and received an advanced diploma in ""Entertainment Technology"". This is basically, working in theater as a carpenter, painter, stage hand, lighting designer/technician, sound engineer/technician, production, animatronics, etc. Basically, I could do any and every single tech job at an MLG and do it well (except maybe the streaming one). I've also worked for countless productions and bands, the biggest being KISS, Our Lady Peace(nicest dudes ever), Lights, Stone Temple Pilots, Brad Paisley and Grease(the stage production).

So here is what you guys need to fix, which will more than anything bring out the passion from the fans/players:

1) You absolutely need a confetti drop/air cannon. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoRBp4ztCr4 I feel like people really underestimate exactly how important this is especially at an awards ceremony. As soon as DRG wins at MLG and walks out of his booth, these cannons should be firing immediately.

2) Music. This is also stupidly important. I'm obviously going to reference dreamhack, but honestly compare the final seconds of dreamhack http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tUmLc1_LI to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=257hSj57TIY. It's almost pathetic, but the difference is not the crowds fault, it is completely the tournament organizer. Watch the dreamhack video and listen to the crowd clapping in beat with the music. The whole point of music, is to fill the air and make it sound busy and !!!take the burden off of the audience!!! clapping and screaming for the minute or two after the match is over as opposed to letting them go crazy for 30 seconds, and then awkwardly fading away. In my opinion, the music should never stop playing in the arena once the games are done until there are going to be speakers, to carry the momentum of the final moments and prolong them as long as possible.

3) The Stage. I understand if MLG might be limited by the venue as to what they can do with the stage, but they are not limited to what they can put ON the stage. The ideal situation in this type of event, is a thrust stage that extends into the heart of the audience. Again, think dreamhack, but it doesn't have to be used like they did. What's wrong with conducting a pre-match interview on the main part of the stage, and then have the players walk down the catwalk into the heart of all the fans and play right in the middle of them. This way, the players are more connected with the fans and are right in the middle of all the joy and passion and energy of the screaming clapping fans when they exit their booth after winning A FUCKING MLG TITLE!!!

""But Dave, the venue won't let us use a thrust stage :("" 

Then fucking decorate your main stage and not simply with a few booths. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7krjklSLgfE This is a good example of what I mean where there is no thrust stage, but it is still decorated better than simply a couple booths and a couch or something dumb. The team members all run out and hug the winning player, and oh yeah, constant music after he won until they're about to speak, go figure.

4) Have the trophy waiting on a pedestal on stage with a spotlight on it or something. A really big negative I get from these tournaments, is that it isn't about winning the title, but winning the money instead. I don't even care if it is about the money, make me and everyone else watching feel like all the players care about is the title. I've been watching starcraft for almost a year, but I still can't tell you what the trophy looks like, but I can name every sports trophy ever in existence. Fix that. And yes, it's your fault for not ramming that down my throat and making me know, not mine.

5) Rehearsals. Yes I guarantee MLG does run-throughs and dress rehearsals and the like, but I can't believe you guys have ever practiced an awards ceremony where you pretend the tournament just finished, and you re-enact that hectic moment of getting everything organized and keeping things running smoothly without these awkward moments that are at every MLG finale. 

I feel like I might be missing some things, so if MLG wants to shoot me an email and consult what can be done, go right ahead and PM me. But NONE of these things are in any way difficult or even expensive to carry out, but make for such a better atmosphere than you already have.

EDIT: TL;DR Confetti Cannon.

EDIT 2: Im sorry if this has come across as a ""copy DH PLOX lolololol"" type of post, it isnt. Honestly, fuck dreamhack its not about copying them, I was only using it as examples and that was just what first came to my head. What will make MLG better and honestly, appropriate for TV, is BUILDING ATMOSPHERE which MLG has all the build up but none of the POP at the end. It's like they're the exact opposite of a premature ejaculate. 

EDIT 3: Lets tweet at sundance so hopefully he sees this. My twitter is @Toffee_Dave so maybe just retweet my shit so he would see it? Let's all help make MLG and Esports what it deserves to be.

thanks mpmar!
&gt;Frontpage context. Teammates MVP.DongRaeGu and MVP.Genius competed against each other in the finals of the most prestigious Starcraft II tournament, the GSL Code S.
Genius has recently been a paragon of Protoss play showcasing creative strategies as he moved through the 32 man tournament. DRG is a long time fan favorite and his play throughout the tournament has made him the consensus best Zerg player in the world.
The two met in a best of seven series played today in Seoul, South Korea. It was a back and forth series with several nerve wracking games. DRG was victorious in the 6th set taking the match 4-2 for his first GSL championship.
To the frontpagers interested in learning more about Starcraft; I would encourage you to visit [gomtv.net](http://www.gomtv.net) the host of the GSL tournament.

I beg of you to read this with an open mind, its a long read, I understand and apologize, I could've continued to go on, this is a subject that has been haunting me for a long time]**

Previous reference (exactly 2 years ago today) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CAXidm7roE

I'll start by saying, I completely agree with everything written here: http://adebisimv.tumblr.com/post/47550054338/ramifications-of-blizzards-announced-wcs-2013-format.

The first thought I had at the WCS announcement was ""HOLY SHIT, THIS IS BIG! Finally a Regional League! I'll start a team house in USA!"" A few days later, knowing a little bit more, it's incredibly discouraging that NA players will not only have to likely compete with a lot of SEA and CN players to qualify, but on top of that, with a lot of Koreans. As mentioned in the article, I can't help but to think the skill gap will continue to grow until we reach Brood War level, where a foreigner taking *A GAME* from a Korean was reason for talk and celebration for the foreigner scene.


I thought WCS was going to be the league to look forward to. With the prize distribution, I thought, ""Alright, let's make this shit happen. Let's grow the NA and EU scenes. We'll move to California, close to EG or NASL, and start building an e-sports city there in the hopes that other teams would follow, in the hopes that we can stay motivated and improve a lot, aim at a realistic shot of winning a good part of the NA prizepool."" 


But, no, just more of the same. 
For the last 3 years, I've been talking about this same thing. The Olympics analogy the anonymous person uses is great to illustrate what I've been trying to say. This isn't about making it easier, it's about motivating and growing the NA and European scenes so that in the future, we can stay on par with korea. We have something we never had in Brood War: an audience! A lot of money is coming from this side of the world, and it's going to the other side, for it to continue to grow in infrastructure and pull further and further ahead. 


My dream isn't to win 100k at WCS. I am happy with the money I make streaming. I am doing what I love for a living, and I am fucking happy. My dream is that e-sports become a reality - especially StarCraft - that it becomes more widely accepted, that players will be OK saying, ""I'm a professional gamer"" without people asking ""wtf"". Our gaming culture is so behind, our infrastructure is so behind - we seem to be a good 10 years away from having anything close to what they've got in Korea. The sad part is we keep refusing to even *start*. 


This isn't about the players, it isn't about me not wanting to practice hard or the better players deserving more - the infrastructure will simply always hold us back, Koreans aren't born with a greater ability to play Starcraft, nor do they necessarily play more. Are they more organized? Hell yeah. They are a lot better at a ton of shit that we don't know/haven't learned. But they also got coaches, live with team-mates, have schedules, team, practice.


They eat and breathe SC2. 
Go try to eat and breathe SC2 in the US and see how fast you starve.

If I told you I'll give you $100,000 if you can beat Michael Phelps in a swimming race next week, what would you think of your chances? 
Would you go and swim every day? 
Would you stop going to work for it and practice 24/7 to beat Michael Phelps? 
Probably not, because you probably won't be able to anyways.
So whatever job you have/do whatever you do with your time will be better spent economically than practicing for something that you stand little-to-no-chance to win.

Now let's say I say, ""I'll give you $50,000 if you beat the local town champion of swimming 5 months from now."" Would you start training for that and dedicate yourself to swimming? Much more likely, right? At the end of that, you'll find you're already a much better swimmer, best in town, and ready to compete in the State Championship. Then you'll give Michael Phelps a run for his money in the National Championships. You see how it scales up? 

There's motivation in between with archievable goals - goals that would have teams and players invest more time and dedication into the mindset and infrastructure needed to compete with Korea in the long run. I am not saying that players will be as good as Innovation after even a year. But perhaps two years down the line, we have more teams moving to California, we have more regional/national leagues, prize pools, a GSTL or Proleague around international teams, coaches, and all of a sudden we're on even ground. The viewer base, the support, its all there. The infrastructure and motivation isn't - that's what we need to start building.

The example I used three years ago in a video was USA and soccer. USA has always been trash at soccer. Slowly they developed their own soccer league, even brought washed up players from Europe to compete in it, and slowly but surely local stars arised, to the point where they can put a good game against Brasil or France despite soccer not being super-duper popular in the US.

Now, let's say you throw all of those rising stars, from day one, to play against England and Portugal and Brazil and France. Well, they'd get shit on. They would be worth jackshit in the market, they would be the bottom of the food chain no matter how hard they train. Opportunities for them to be sustainable as professional players just wouldn't be there. People need to put themselves in the shoes of players here and realize that the great majority of them aim at top 16 MLG, which is shit money, because  - let's be honest - top 4 for an up-and-coming player is pretty much out of the picture. The best forgeiners travel to Korea in order to stay competitive. If it wasn't for visibility, the fact that mid-tier Koreans can still lose games to them, if it wasn't for the support of forgein teams and fans, they would stand no chance whatsoever. This wouldn't be a feasable way of living. 
This is our job, our livelihood. I am 26 years old with a degree in Media Arts in Animation. I do fine in gaming - I own a team, I get good streaming numbers, I have a reason to play 8-10 hours a day. May not be the best practice ever and my mechanics aren't top notch, but the point I'm making is at least I can do it - most players can't.

Do you start to get it? You need motivation, money and backing to do this as a living. You don't just play games because it's fun - it's your job. If we can't treat it as such, if we have *no reason* to treat it as such, we will *never* catch up to Korea. Sure, Koreans aren't rich, there's a lot of talent etc, but they have the infrastructure in place where b-teamers still get to eat and have a roof over their heads and all they have to worry about is playing Starcraft and performing well. How many forgeiners can you think of that are in the same situation, or have the opportunity to be in that situation at all? Not many. Not to mention culture, which we need to start growing *now*. In Korea, gaming is a form of living that's accepted to some extent. Even the military had AirForce Ace - a StarCraft team. In Korea, you can say you're a professional gamer without people wondering wtf you're talking about. I've met American progamers who are literally *ashamed* of calling themselves a progamer, because as cool as it is on Reddit and TL, outside of this world and this industry, it's essentially seem as being a bum, or at least not taken seriously.

We need to start changing that. People need to stop saying ""You're not good enough, go practice more,"" because that's simply not enough. Scarlett - the best foreigner, in my opinion, right now - would've never gotten a chance for anyone to know her had she not won a Playhem qualifier for IPL, where she didn't have to beat the best Koreans in the world, then she went onto IPL and defeated a semi-known Korean, and everyone was like ""WOW!"" Then she lost 1-2 to Oz  - an acomplishment in itself - and turned heads. Then she shined in WCS Canada where she won against *Canadians*. She beat HuK - widely considered one of the best forgeiners at the time. She beat *foreigners*. Then she went on to win WCS North America, defeating ViBE in the finals, and stablishing herself as the bset player in NA. Then eventually she got picked up by Acer and now she gets to live in Korea, practice with the best and live off the game she loves. 

Now let's play pretend and say Scarlett had to play Leenock or DRG in that Playhem qualifier tournament. She didn't make it to IPL, she had no support and didn't participate in WCS Canada. It's very likely you wouldnt've seen Scarlett beat MVP last week in GSTL. 

Do you get the point yet? It's not just about practicing, it's not just about dedication. There needs to be motivation, a system in place that rewards you progressively, so that you can improve and set yourself attainable goals, rather than impossible ones. Korea has the culture, the infrastructure and the motivation. If you're completely cool with Korea being the mecca of Starcraft and e-sports forever, if you think that's sustainable, by all means - do what you gotta do. I'll stick around to see us fail like we did in Brood War. 

Every sport has regional leagues and divisions within them. You prove that you are the best in your city, then your country, then your continent, then the world. You don't just prove you have talent in your city and get thrown in with people who have been doing this for longer and better. Look at college basketball, college football, and imagine freshmen thrown in on the NBA and NFL on their first year every time. 

Keep in mind, after WCS NA, WCS EU and WCS KR, there would be a world finals, where the best in the world would always get the biggest piece of the pie. 
As a disclaimer, I wouldn't mind Korea having more prize pool. That's not the issue here.
I'm not pushing for equality, I'm pushing for development.
Slow and steady is fine by me.

I beg of you and anyone who reads this to think carefully and empathize with players.
*Not with me*, I'm doing just fine. I am not arguing for myself. I genuinely want to see e-sports grow in this side of the world. I want to live in E-Sports City and work to grow the best team in NA and eventually the world. As it stands, it's close to impossible. 

Open your eyes, people. Stop being stubborn and closed in your ideas. The Brood War foreign scene was laughable. All any forgeiner could ever look forward to was WCG and Nationwars, which Korea didn't play in. Taking one game, *ONE GAME*, off a Korean pro in BW was an amazing acomplishment - not to mention an extremely rare one. It'd bring a lot of satisfaction, but satisfaction can't buy food or justify the time investment to get better.

I think that a lot of people share a lot of the same views, not just for the sake of players and the scene but for the growth of E-Sports and StarCraft 2 as a competitive sport outside of Korea, for the spectators and fans, in the long-run: we need to start changing, the talent is there, and i've struggled to do the best I can do with what I have to help develop and nurture talent over time, but it takes more than time and dedication, I feel like the community support is there for the most part, but we need to start taking baby steps if anything. 

NOTE: NO ONE is saying foreigners should not compete with koreans, the majority of all events will always be global, there's no changing that, and honestly little reason to do so - but that is not to say that regional leagues and tournaments wouldn't help grow and nurture a scene that will continue to go downhill otherwise, please trust me, I am doing as much as I can, since the game released.


 ROOT -WILL- open a team house in the US, we want to move close to EG or NASL and build from there, we WANT to become the best players that we can become, and practice as hard as we can. The hope is that more teams will follow and we can start building a culture over here, build a 'Proleague' or 'GSL' in time, on this side of the world. I can do it, I can commit to it, because I stream and I make money like that, I can live off of gaming - Most NA pros and up and coming players -CAN'T- I am trying my best through ROOT to create opportunities always have, always will. 

But if we're gonna make it as a scene, we need a bit more than just the will, can't eat and drink the damn will. 

**EDIT: CLG one of the most prominent and well known League of Legends teams was planning to INVEST money into StarCraft 2, with the announcement of WCS in North America and Europe, they viewed NA as a feasible market to invest money into and grow talent, as the exposure these NA players would get by competing in a tournament with realistic chances of winning would provide CLG's sponsors. I as the owner of ROOT can only invest the money that we have and we have a fuckload of players already so growing more is close to impossible in terms of numbers for me, as I mentioned before, I try to as much as I can. For this reason alone, I volunteered to help CLG's management to find and foster North American Talent, provide these players with support and welcome CLG into our scene, we were throwing names around, all a very exciting prospect. They were even planning on opening a team house for StarCraft 2 in North America... With the announcement of the amount of Koreans joining in on WCS NA, CLG's business manager just msg'd me on skype:**

I want to personally apologize to you on behalf of all of us at MLG for the mistakes we made with the WCS America Qualifier this weekend. 

As many of you know, we have been working on a fast timeline with Blizzard and all of our partners to make the WCS a success and bring you as much competitive StarCraft content as possible. Unfortunately we made some errors that rippled throughout the weekend. 

First, the demand to enter the WCS Qualifier was much higher than we had anticipated which resulted in many excellent players not getting a chance to enter. We featured a 512-player, double elimination, best of three bracket to maximize individual players opportunity for success, however that impacted the scale of the tournament. Additionally, we experienced strains on both our online product and administrative staffing that should have been avoided. Finally, we admittedly made a poor decision to try to hold back some results of the tournament in order to make spoiler-free viewing a possibility. We will not do that again for any online qualifier. 

We have immediately opened the final bracket to the public which can be found [here](http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/tournament/wcs-america-season-1-qualifyin/bracket). 

We have also created a feedback email address specifically for WCS America. Going forward, please email your feedback, suggestions and complaints to WCSAMfeedback@mlg.tv. Our staff and I will monitor every email and aim to incorporate constructive feedback into our future plans. 

Again, I want to apologize personally and on behalf of everyone at MLG, to the StarCraft community, the players and to Blizzard for failing to uphold the level of tournament execution we pride ourselves on. 

I assure you that we are making every effort to rectify this for all future WCS America operations. 

Sincerely,

Sundance DiGiovanni

CEO

A little about myself...
My name is Evan Ju.  I am 20, in college, and  I've been playing chess all my life.  I have a huge passion for chess and I am a proud nerd-baller.  I have represented the United States in international chess tournaments around the world and have been top ranked in the country for my age ever since I was 10.  If you're curious about some of my other chess accomplishments..please follow this link :   http://www.chess.com/members/view/Eilyisum

Anyways, and more importantly, I have recently really gotten into Starcraft II.  I followed Stephano's tear at IPL Atlantic City (especially his loss in g2 against KiwiKaki gave me nerd chills) and Leenok's magical run at the recent MLG Providence.  I remember being glued to my computer watching the live streams of those tournaments for nearly the entirety of those two weekends.  

Until now, I have been simply happy and content watching the likes of Huk's top 3 control, the Day9 Daily, Destiny's Stream, reading sc2jokeexplainer, and etc.  However, I now really want to try my own hand in playing SC2.  There are obvious parallels between chess and Starcraft...strategy being the backbone of both games.  However, chess is purely a strategical and psychological game, while Starcraft has the added element of keyboard speed and mechanics.  Furthermore, chess is a game of perfect information, starcraft is not.  

Basically, I am curious to see if my skills in chess can translate over to starcraft 2.  Although SC2 is my first serious RTS game,  I believe my ability to think strategically and my study habits/work discipline  from playing international tournament chess are very applicable (professional chess training and Starcraft 2 Pro training methods are very similar).  
So far, I have made it to diamond league with relatively little effort.  From here I plan on playing 2-4 hours a day to see if I can make the jump to masters and then grandmasters!

One of the best parts of SC2 in my opinion is the community behind it.  There is a sense of togetherness and support that frankly is not felt nearly as much among the chess community.  I would greatly appreciate all of your guys' support as I continue my journey and plunge into the starcraft world :).  It would help me so much if you could like my Facebook page to stay up to date with my progress:  https://www.facebook.com/EvanJu1
and my twitter: www.twitter.com/Evan_Ju

TLDR: Top ranked chess player also trying to become a top SC2 player.  Liking my page helps me tons and I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks!  

EDIT: wow!  I did not nearly expect this amount of support so quickly.  You guys really are the best.  Some people asked about the potential of a stream/blog.  I really intend on starting both of these soon (at least the blog, for the stream I feel I have an obligation to make at least masters before starting that).  I will make a future post regarding those (on rstarcraft, my fbook page, and twitter) and thanks again!

EDIT: I will reconsider the idea of waiting to start the stream before making masters.  I'll let everyone know via twitter/facebook/rstarcraft when I decide.  I am also very interested in taking lessons from top players if you have the time.  Having taken many chess lessons and as a chess coach myself, I know the importance of having a very solid foundation and not mentally ingraining bad habits.  Please send me a private message or email me at jue@lafayette.edu 

EDIT: I started a twitch.tv account: http://www.twitch.tv/evanju/videos 
      Not sure exactly when I'll start streaming SC2, probably after the semester ends :).

I've seen a lot of conjecture and rumors flying around and it's unfair to Artosis.

For the record: My correspondence with Artosis was brief and polite. He told me he was flattered that I made a shirt about him and sent it to Day[9] but that I could not print the shirt with his name. I sent him a response saying I meant no offense by the shirt and didn't want to print it without his approval, even if there was no legal reason not to.

He said cheers, thanked me, and that was that.

There was still a large group of people who were all interested in the shirt without text, and I still intend to print it that way. I'm appalled that so many people were upset with Artosis about this ""issue"" and this is my attempt to salvage his good name. I completely understand, respect, and support his decision about the shirt and I'm glad he's a part of the StarCraft community. Our correspondence was brief and amicable and I have nothing but respect for him.

1346434600.0,1173,self.starcraft,z58e9,I made a streaming application so I could stream startcraft.  Now it's open source and free for everyone,1549,376,438,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/z58e9/i_made_a_streaming_application_so_i_could_stream/,"When I first had an interest in streaming starcraft and games for my friends to see, I heard about a certain other app out there, and I thought, ""A subscription?  seriously?  I could probably write this myself""  ..and that's exactly what I did.

So, two or three months later, after much learning and much toil, I have completed the first public alpha version of my streaming application.  This application supports capture cards, webcams, as well as software desktop capture.  You can make scenes, bitmap overlays, and it even has a plugin API so developers can add their own functionality to the application.  It's fairly simple in design, and relatively easy to use.  It's also written entirely in C/C++ and Direct3D 11 to maximize performance.

Best part is it's entirely open source and free.

There are still many features yet to be implemented (such as streaming to avi/mp4 files), many rough edges and polishing that needs to be done, and the UI could also probably use a bit more refinement and adjustment, but it's become very useable in it's current state, so I decided to bite the bullet and let everybody try it out in it's current state if they wish.

You can download it at https://sourceforge.net/projects/obsproject/

Important notes:

- Currently, there's no setup application.  Fortunately it doesn't require any external libraries, so you can just download it and run it, but I will get around to making a proper setup application for it at some point

- It does not support windows XP, as windows XP unfortunately does not support direct3d 11

- There is a 64bit version available as well in the downloads section, and it's recommended over the 32bit version if you happen to use the 64bit version of windows.

- If using software desktop capture, make sure to use the option to disable aero, or disable aero in your own windows settings, as aero will absolutely kill your framerate and cause frames to lag.  Note that software desktop capture also does not support games in fullscreen mode.  You'll need to run the games windowed, or for startcraft/diablo, fullscreen (windowed) mode.

- The help file is incomplete but should have the basic gist of how to set up and use the application

- I have yet to document the plugin API

- Currently, the only pre-defined streaming service is twitch/justintv.  If you don't use twitch, you'll have to enter in your server information manually.  If anybody could provide me with more information about different services, such as own3d or ustream and such, I'll gladly add them to the list (in services.xconfig)

- It still is untested, as it's an alpha version that has only been run on three different machines so far as of this writing.  People will no doubt have crashes, problems, or have potential difficulty with certain hardware configurations that I have not yet foreseen

- If you wish to make a translation of the app to your language, you can easily do so in the locale folders.  All you need to do is duplicate, say, the english file, rename it to [iso 639-1 code].txt (example, ko.txt for korean), and then open it and translate the strings on the right.  If you send it to me, I will put it up and include it with the application.  Make sure to save the text file in UTF-8.  There is also plugins/DShowPlugin/locale files that should be translated as well.  Apologies for making them separate, but I really wanted to make the plugin as an API example.

If you wish to contact me, my email is obs.jim (at) gmail.com.  Also if you have any crashes, please make sure to send me the log file and any information about what happened.  It would be greatly appreciated.

Also, before people mention ffsplit, I did not know about it until my application was nearly complete.  Still, I decided to finish mine regardless.  At the very least someone can learn something from my code, and that will leave me satisfied.

**Created a twitter for if you wish to follow for project updates.  https://twitter.com/OBSProject**

--------------------------------------------------
**Update** You guys work fast.  Thank you for testing it and the support.  As I expected, there are some issues.  Here's a list of issues people have had so far:

**Audio**: Certain microphones possibly may not work.  You may have to try another or disable your microphone in the time being until it's fixed.  Please email me your log if you have issues with your microphone.

**Speakers**: Some speaker configurations do not work.  If you get the ""Speaker setup not yet implemented"" crash, please send me the log so I can see what speaker configuration you use and add it in the next version.  If you don't want to wait, set your main windows audio speaker configuration to a more common configuration in the mean time, and it should work again.

**Video Unsmooth or Stutters**: Update!  This actually wasn't caused by the desktop capture.  This was caused by something else, and a fix is on the way in the next update.

**Software Desktop Capture not crashing, but painting black, or nothing**: Ah, yes, I actually had this problem some time back, it was exclusive to the 64bit version, but it's possible it could happen with the 32bit version as well.  The issue was not with my app, but that microsoft libraries needed to be updated.  See if you're using the latest windows updates in your windows updates, and if that fails, try updating both your directx version and your video drivers.

**Crashes when adding a desktop source**: With the generous debugging help of Ramuh, I have located this bug, and it will be fixed in the next version.

**PNG images**: some PNG images don't seem to be working properly.  If you have a PNG that's not working properly, please send it to me.  ...if it's not too large, that is.  preferrably.

**If you have a crash, please email me the log file.**",,False,self,t5_2qpp6,1346476820.0,,,True,t3_z58e9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/z58e9/i_made_a_streaming_application_so_i_could_stream/,

Following the 1st stream of Prime last week, we are preparing the 2nd live stream on 8th Nov. KST 12:00(GMT 3:00), a day before this week GSTL match(9th Nov.) vs. FXO. 
There will be 3 parts in our 2nd stream. 
Part 1 : Introduction of Prime players and Q&amp;A
Part 2 : Show match among MKP, Creator, Byun and Maru for Prime’s Ace position
Part 3 :  MKP’s Quiz show and raffle with our stream viewers. There are a lot of prizes like players’ private collection, Prime uniforms, etc.
And our big event! 
3,000 viewers watched our 1st stream. Thank you so much. So, if the viewers of our 2nd stream are over 10,000, every member of Prime will dance to Gangnam Style in front of the camera. More extraordinarily, if our subscribers become 2,000, at GSTL match vs. FXO on the next day, we will enter the studio dancing “Gangnam Style”. It can’t be over 2,000, can it?
Prime team is not looking for sponsorship. And your little attention and help become a big help.
Asking your big interest and love.
Thank you!

1373414671.0,1155,self.starcraft,1hz031,"Announcing StarCraft 2 League Season 1, Powered by D-Link!",1511,356,373,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1hz031/announcing_starcraft_2_league_season_1_powered_by/,"Hi Everyone,

If you read my Twitter and Facebook, or if you watch any of the various shows I appear on, you may have heard me over the course of the past several months mention a project that has been in the making for quite a while now. Well, I am excited to share the details behind this project with you as we are finally ready to launch! Today, I am proud to announce the SC2L (StarCraft® II League), Powered by D-Link! Our goal with the SC2L is to create a consistent, high-quality team league for the organizations in the West. We want the SC2L to become the Western world's premier team league.

Why the team format? Well, while we are fortunate enough to have plenty of great 1v1 tourneys and leagues available to us in the West, the landscape for team-based competition isn't nearly as strong. We feel it is important to support and feature the West's best team organizations, and in doing so help improve the quality of competition in the West, and the Western scene at large. This is why we are pushing as hard as we can to be the premier team league in the West.

SC2L's first season will be about two months long, and it will feature eight of the West's top teams (including Western team organizations that have Korean players) competing in the traditional ProLeague format (best of 7 rounds, one map per round). Joining us this season will be **Liquid, ROOT, MouseSports, Acer, Axiom, EG, and Na`Vi, with Dignitas and compLexity competing as one joint team.** Season 1 will be a single round-robin (meaning every team plays every other team once), leading into an online playoff. The final two teams standing after the online playoff will receive travel and hotel stipends to compete for the **SC2L Season 1 Championship at DreamHack Bucharest,** September 14th &amp; 15th! With our Grand Finals match co-produced with DreamHack, so you can expect the same top-notch production value we've seen from DreamHack Open events over the years.

Our casting lineup for this season is really cool. SC2L Season 1 will be hosted and casted by some of the finest in the biz. I'll be your regular, everyday host and commentator and will be joined on a weekly basis by an amazing rotation of co-casters, which includes **djWHEAT, Day[9], and Artosis.** I'll be bringing the casts to you live from our studio in San Francisco, with our co-casters joining me remotely via voice and webcam. 

Additionally, we are really excited and grateful to have D-Link as a new sponsor for SC2L Season 1. Without their support, we wouldn't be able to bring you the high-quality production and casters that will help make this league one of the best. Additionally, with D-Link's support, we are also proud to announce that SC2L Season 1 will feature one of the first crowd-sourced prize pools in StarCraft II. 

How does that work, exactly? It's really simple. D-Link's coming out with an awesome new gaming router, and **for every router our tournament's viewers pre-order, D-Link will add $10 to the prize pool. So while SC2L's prize pool will open at $10K, it can be doubled to $20K with the help of our viewers!**

If you like what you've read so far, I'd ask that you please check out D-Link's new gaming router by visiting its [Newegg.com profile page.](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833127525) If you're interested in purchasing it, make sure to enter promo code ""DLNKGAME5"" when you check out. By using this code, you'll get a discount on your purchase, and you'll add $10 to the SC2L prize pool! 

SC2L's first broadcast will be tonight, July 9th, at 9PM PDT, featuring Day[9] and myself. I hope you'll all join us as we kick off what we hope will be an awesome team league!  Also, if you'd like to read more about SC2L, check out our website at www.SC2L.gg!

1339493741.0,1151,self.starcraft,uxpf6,My take on the MLG player area situation,1960,809,292,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/uxpf6/my_take_on_the_mlg_player_area_situation/,"The way MLG handles the player area as it stands right now is really bad. Plain and simple. We want to pretend that this is a competition where things like teams, managers and media matter but as it is those are fluffy after thoughts for what is otherwise just a very simple ""space"" that is managed like a dance room. If you are a dancer or korean you can stay. If you are eliminated, a nobody or a white dude you need to leave.

This is really bad and annoying for a multitude of reasons that I will go through now.

Competition - Remember in DH when Tyler went in the booth and gave some support to his teammate? These are moments when teammates/friends CAN help change the course in history. It's also a huge part of what makes this game and others so great. If IdrA needs someone he trusts to calm him down and help him focus between games 1 and 2 why isn't that encouraged? It makes literally everything better for everyone. It's currently in the rules that players can't talk to anyone between games except for a ref but lets just ignore that at the moment since everyone does both at MLG and everywhere else because that is literally a nonsensical and dumb rule. As it stands, rule or no rule this cannot happen. Some managers are allowed in and only players that are with circular badge OR still competing. This means in the final rounds of a tourney you are kicked out or left alone. I don't think a player should have 30 teammates surrounding him and putting a wet towel on his shoulders but I think within reason this should be looked at.. pictures of a team supporting their top dogs, teams helping players give better performance.. these are all GOOD things. If a team is going to send a bunch of people to an MLG at least let them cheer on /support their players without being booted to a distance they can't watch.

Spectator quality - As it stands right now some people pay to go to an MLG and see specific players compete. If they aren't streamed or on stage they may never see them play merely because the player area makes for horrible spectating. The answer is of course NOT to allow everyone into the player area but maybe more accommodations to be made for those that want to see someone play that isn't on the main stage. Lots of people tweeted at IdrA saying they were there just to see him play and they only saw him play a couple of times and the spectating quality was poor due to MLG format. Featured stations within the player area with monitors large enough for the audience to watch overhead OR having the matches streamed to another location on site.. something so when people want to watch IdrA or someone else they don't have to hope and wish he is on the outside computers otherwise they are in the dark.

Racism - MLG doesn't ask koreans to leave whether they are eliminated, circular badge or whatever. The reason is pretty clear, it'd be a huge dick move to treat someone who flew across the planet that way. They let them watch and do everything they SHOULD get to do because to ask them to do otherwise would be insanely dickish. This is really bad and basically equates to MLG pushing domestic people around because they know they will come back.. if they treated koreans that way they'd say ""fuck MLG"" and not come back. I don't think the answer is to boot koreans.. I think it's great they aren't asked to leave. I think the same treatment should be extended to those that have good reason to be in the player area (more on that in a bit). But to blatantly treat koreans far and away better than the rest of us creates a really ugly scene.

We are not all the same - Yup, this portion will not be popular and a lot of people will misunderstand what I am getting at here but I hope  people try and get where I am coming from. If I stand outside of the player area I will have someone ask me for something every 5 seconds. This is wonderful. I actually plan out time to make myself available this way so I can be there for people that want to interact with me. It's an honor. But I also am there to support/watch my teammates as well. I can't do that when I am either telling someone ""no, not now, sorry"" every 5 second OR I am signing, taking a picture, talking, hugging etc etc.. I am either being kind of a dick for saying ""no"" OR I am literally not participating in my teammates match in any way shape or form. If I am in the player area I can do that x1000 obviously. Additionally, sometimes I need a break. I am fortunate enough to have a lot of fans and I really appreciate that.. but I don't want to be a zombie or rude to them OR be boring.. I want to have energy to express to them how excited I am that they  care about me.. but that means some times I need to catch my breath and charge up. Usually I do this while watching my teammates play and inbetween matches I go outside and sign more autographs and interact with fans. I really hope people aren't reading this as me being ungrateful or unappreciative.. I am.. but I also need to be realistic. I can't go to an MLG and be on call 24/7 ... I need breaks and I want selfishly, to be able to cheer on my team uninterrupted and be available to them. This essentially means I am asking to be treated differently than others and  I get that that isn't a popular notion.. sorry but tbh it's completely true and accurate. 

Now MLG argues it's a space problem and logistics issue that they aren't as concerned about and would rather focus on more important things. Fine, but I would argue this is actually something people have complained about for a long time and more so than any other tourney I can name MLG is the absolute worst in this regard. People are treated very poorly around the player area and it NEEDS reformation.

He strived to have fun, and be very skilled at games. 

In winter 2011 he wanted me to use his account to improve. This was great, I was playing a lot of SC2. Eventually, I got over my ladder anxiety and didn't need to use his account, that and a lot of encouragement by him kept me trying to get better at SC2 and not stagnate or get frustrated. I would send him IMs of my ""epic"" wins that excited me in platinum and diamond league and complain about the losses.

Greg killed himself in April 2012. 

I set out to complete both a goal of mine, and his. Under his name I am going to be placed into Masters League. I was very determined to get this goal, somethings got in the way; but tonight I can proudly say that in his memory my goal is complete.

Tonight; I placed into [Masters](http://i.imgur.com/d6PNp.jpg) after two seasons of battling and getting better. 

I'm not looking for karma, I just want anyone who is in a dark place to know that there are people who care about you and love you. There are a ton of places for you to go, people to talk to, things to do in this beautiful world and nothing can justify the oh-so-final decision. There are great resources out there; please seek them out.

Context: [SPOILERS] MVP forces a map split on Metropolis using Planetary's. The obvious choice from there is to go BC's as you cannot stay on Tier 1.5 M&amp;M. The islands are also taken by MVP.

Squirtle uses recall to attack an island. MVP decides to move forward and attack as there will not be a better opportunity with Squirtle's army split. Squirtle at this point has 10+ archons with many high templars. Using a vortex, Squirtle makes another universe full of Battlecruisers. When their universe collapses, Squirtle's archons and high templars destroy 25+ Battlecruisers and uses Void Rays to clean up.

Why don't we care?,2070,939,444,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/p9c9h/ui_still_subpar_2_years_later_why_dont_we_care/,"*I initially posted this on TL, but several people urged me to spread it further. It has since seen a lot of feedback not only on TL and Reddit, but on the official forums as well. Check the bottom of this post for additional links, videos, images and background information.*

------------------------------

Counting the beta, SC2 will be two years old in March - and the game's interface has barely developed over that span. While the lack of LAN support is the major issue for most people (as frequently demonstrated in tournaments with connection issues), I feel that the general feel and usability of the new battle.net UI are just as frustrating for the average user.

Sure. We've seen *some* improvement with chat being added. But it's telling that we had to ask for that in the first place. And we have vague promises for the map marketplace / arcade to fix the completely broken custom game scene with HotS. But there's so much more. 

Personally, the game's UI discourages me from playing on a daily basis. When the new battle.net was developed, we were promised that we'd ""never want to be offline again"". But every single time I log on, I feel utterly alone, maybe play a game or two, and then leave again. Both in SC/BW and WC3, I'd idle around forever, hang out in channels or waste time in custom games.

So what`s different?

**Communicating and socializing is too hard.**

*Chat. It still sucks*. Simple commands like /w outside of games would make life tremendously easier. Real channels would be great. Or sending messages to my whole friends list. At the moment, any act of communication is a hassle; I either have to navigate through my friends list (which could be a lot more accessible too, by the way) to message people; I have to clumsily navigate through menus to send messages to other folks (or add them to my list); I even have to click through menus to ignore or report people. 

Everything could be so much easier with a decent chat interface, yet we seem to be stuck with the farce of a system we currently have.

*Clan support (+clan channels)*. This*rocked *in WC3. You had a place to meet with friends and clan mates, and you could even moderate your channels. You actually had a sense of community while online. 

*Automated tournaments.* Where are they? Why was such a great feature removed? Despite losing quickly in most of them, I often played them in WC3. You got to meet new people, had a competition that wasn't ladder, and had an incentive to play for the portraits.

**Simply playing the game can be hard at times.**

*A working custom game system.* Despite the chaotic first impression, WC3's system worked. All the SC2 popularity system does is kill any incentive to play maps that aren't on the first two pages. Also, Blizzard's attitude of blocking development instead of encouraging it have led to a custom scene that's pretty much dead. The vocal criticism of the ridiculous limits on map developer freedom have died down because most developers have stopped developing and caring.

I had hoped to see countless maps by now, exploring the boundaries of the map editor and creativity, but all we have are some DotA clones, some TD maps and nothing too exciting else.
 
*AT vs. RT issues in team games.* While team games are looked down upon by many, they nontheless enjoy a large following. The strict separation of AT and RT from WC3 was scrapped for SC2 in favor of short queue times, but despite having a matchmaking system implemented, it's still prone to abuse and frustration. Things like 2/3man ATs signing up for 3/4man RTs is just one example of many. Currently, the team ladders are a sick joke and the results / ratings and the general activity reflect the utter neglect with which this issue has been treated.

**Analyzing is overly hard as well.**

*Shared replay watching*. It was such a great feature in SC/BW. Requested since beta, and we'll probably never see it.

*Statistics*. Where are they? Why can't I see my race-specific %, or my odds on certain maps? And why are lower league players belittled by having their losses hidden, even when everyone knows that those people still here after two years must have realized that it's a competetive game and losing is part of the deal?

*The whole league system.* Sure, we all know how and why the MMR works right now. But why scrap the system that worked so great in WC3? Right now, we can't compare anyone (regardless of whether you think ladder matters or not). Grandmaster league helped, but only if you're looking at pros. I can't even judge whether I'm better than my buddy or not, because we're both in meaningless divisions of pointless leagues, and our MMR is invisible. 

------------------------------

Things went wrong when Blizzard decided to develop the new B.Net from scratch, and to employ a casual game / console developer for the job. I have nothing personal against Greg Canessa, but I feel it shows that he developed for PopCap and Xbox Live before. That by itself needn't have been a bad thing, but why for the love of all that is holy did *everything* that worked well in previous games have to be removed? Hell, the better part of Blizzard's fame came from releasing games with fantastic interfaces and great functions, yet SC2 is a step back (or several) compared to 2003's WC3 or even 1998's SC.

And why all this? Well, of course because it works for Blizzard. Enough people were happy with what they got, not enough people cared. The folks who just bought the game for the campaign obviously didn't bother with the menu much, and the competetive 1vs1 crowd basically just needs a working matchmaking system (which is great, btw, and the only redeeming feature). But there's a huge number of players interested in socializing, custom maps and analyzing their play. Those that haven't left have grown complacent or jaded with Blizzard's ignorance.

The adding of chat and the scrapped forum real-ID feature have shown what players can achieve when the voice concerns; the complete lack of development in the meantimes is a great sign of how little will suffice for the majority to accept their fate. 

This game could be so much better.

* For example, I would love to see a brief red sheen flash across a bunch of marines and marauders when +1 infantry kicks in. The flash would fade into a glow and then nothing over the course of 10 seconds or so.

   You could even color code upgrades by type: red = attack, blue = armors, green = speed/stim, etc...

* I'm not suggesting that the players see this as I like to leave that up to skill and intuition.

So who wants to make an obs map for this? :)

[Physics and Graphical update](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IurLEBNu5Qw)

***New Units:***

**Protoss:**

[Replicant:](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2011/10/Replicant-B.jpg) 

[Gameplay video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCXeiTQfUM8)

Health: 60 hp/60 shields

Cost: 200/200 (4 supply)

* No attack
* Seems to be some confusion here, so I'll just say, it is a GROUND unit by default, even though it appears as if it floats.
* Requires Robotics Facility
* Copies a non-massive targetted unit(yes, including workers), including abilities and upgrades, in your vision (possibly infinite range as long as you have vision of the unit you're copying?)
* All upgrades enabled, including ones that have not yet been researched by the opponent

[Oracle:](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2011/10/Oracle-B.jpg)

* Preordain - Reveals what enemy buildings are producing (reported 2 minute duration and short range cast, not sure)
* Phase Shift - Temporarily ""warps out"" buildings for 45 seconds, Players not have access to tech for warped out buildings (still blocks pathing, offensive to disrupt production, defensive to stop attacks, seems to be general consensus that you can't use this on Capital buildings [CC, Nexus, Hatch])

[Tempest:](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2011/10/Tempest-B.jpg)

[Gameplay video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWPxf1qhH4o)

[Battle Hellion:](http://i.imgur.com/S3Wx7.jpg)

Health: 135 hp

* Transforms between ""battle"" form and the form of the hellion we currently have
* ""Battle form"" slower than normal hellion form, short, cone style attack, similar to firebat from Singleplayer
* Attack does 8 damage, +11 to light
* ""Battle form"" has more health than normal Hellion form

[Shredder:](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2011/10/Shredder-B.jpg)

**Zerg:**

[Viper:](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2011/10/Viper-B.jpg)

[Gameplay video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV0mdfaJTHA)

Health: 120 hp

Energy: 200

Cost: 100/200 (3 supply)

* Requires Lair tech (Not Spire)
* Ocular Parasite - Grants permanent detection to a non-massive ally(seems to be energy based, some sources say it's only one cast per viper)
* Abduct - Pulls a unit (friend or enemy) to it's location(100 energy, unit has 200 max)

**Other:**

* ""Collapsible rocks"", can be broken down to close a path, rather than opening it up, like Destructible rocks.
* New Maps: [Image1](http://i.imgur.com/tS6uGh.jpg) [Image2](http://i.imgur.com/y7K4ah.jpg) [Image3](http://i.imgur.com/UtGqVh.jpg)


***Changes to Existing Units:***

**Protoss:**

* Carrier removed
* Mothership removed
* New Nexus ability ""Arc Shield"" grants buildings a 20 damage vs light attack as well as additional shields and armor(25 energy, 20 sec, for early game defense, requires Gateway to prevent cannon rush abuse)
* Nexus has mothership's old Mass recall ability(75 energy, radius reduced, units unable to move for a short time after)
* Low ground pylons no longer power high-ground areas, even if they are within the power radius (this prevents some cannon/warp-in cheese)

* Reaper gains HP recovery skill (passive)
* Ghost cloak is now time based, costs a set amount of energy

**Zerg:**

* Overseer removed
* Hydra speed increased by 50% off creep (So speed is equal on and off creep. Hive tech upgrade, cost 150/150)

* Corrupters no longer have the ability ""Corruption""
* Corrupters now have a channeled ability ""Siphon"" against buildings that does 1 dps and converts damage done to minerals

1359475361.0,1095,self.starcraft,17i0wn,OK r/starcraft. There is something I want to get off my chest about balance whining (hyphen?),1802,707,518,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/17i0wn/ok_rstarcraft_there_is_something_i_want_to_get/,"It doesn't matter what race you play. Maybe youre protoss and someone hated on FF. Maybe youre Zerg and someone lashed out at you for building infestors. Maybe youre terran and someone railed against the incredible cost efficiency of 3/3 marines.

**Even more universally,** it doesn't matter if you're bronze platinum or masters. Right now, in numerous games all over the world, RIGHT NOW, people are balance-whining after a gg.

To all these people, I have this to say:

If you played parting, life, or MKP BO 15 with any race, how many games would you win?  If you can say anything other than 0, you are an incredible player. I cant.  So what, what does all this imply? 

Well, to me, it means you need to realize the following things:

* every time you rage quit a game, chalk it up to balance and skip the replay, you are stifling your growth as a player
* your ability to say this meaningfully is inversely proportional to your distance from Code S, **and even for high masters, thats a great, great distance**    (see note below)
* if you are worrying about balance and don't yet have constant scv or probe production, or larve injects for zerg, you are being myopic
* if you take a long view of it, every race will likely be better at one time or another, probably more than once
* the difference between you and the league above you is either a balance patch or, more likely, improving your play, and you have control of **1** of those 2 things.

Last one. It is much more subjective than the others, but I would argue it is the most important: 

* you are making the game less fun *for yourself, and for your opponent*


Note from above: The fact that there are Code S players of each race in every single code S means that it is at least possible to attain that level as any race. Therefore, if you are saying imba imba imba as a silver, plat, masters player, etc., that is fine, but you must still realize that it is possible for you to rank up to high GM as your race. But what will get you there isn't a balance patch. It is improving your play.

Whether you are playing for Aiur, the Swarm, or just to kill Mengsk, lets have some GGs and improve together

**Edit 1** changed you into you are and changed phrasing of one comment just after posting

**Edit 2**  I am writing this edit because many people, apparently, feel at least similar to the way I do.

I would like for you all to consider the following challenge:

I challenge you to try to help me make ladder more fun. Here's how: next time you lose a game that you feel is BS and you should have won, say gg and then watch the replay.
**In return I pledge to post 10 screenshots to imgur of me losing, saying gg wp, and then watching the replay by Feb 5, 1 week from today.** After doing it, if you can say that you didn't learn anything from watching it and you're mad that you gged, then I apologize.  My suspicion, though, is that you'll feel - and play - better.

**Edit 3** Many people are bringing up very good counter arguments, and there are far too many for me to reply to all of them at this point. I will make some general comments though.

* Note that I never said SCII is balanced. Further, I might go as far as to say it is not even possible to balance it across all skill levels simultaneously. But this is not my point.
* I am not saying that, if you are not Code S, you do not have a right to an opinion on balance. Rather, I am saying that *using balance as an outlet to whine and vent personal feelings* hurts you as a player and hurts the community by making SCII ladder less fun.
* Last, I believe that discussions on balance are critical. I am only asking that we change the timing of these discussions. Don't make them in the form of a personal complaint said on ladder; rather, make them on an online fora, like those blizzard has.

This will be the last edit, and I'm glad there was such a response to this. PM me for a game!",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2qpp6,1359488925.0,dis,,True,t3_17i0wn,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/17i0wn/ok_rstarcraft_there_is_something_i_want_to_get/,

Zerg players are having to MASS a spellcaster just to get effective use out of them, when really spellcasters should be made in limited numbers.

**Increase Fungal Growth radius to 5.0 (up from 2.0)**

We often see the Zerg players needing to use MULTIPLE fungals to ensure they hit a 200/200 army. This is RIDICULOUS. Increasing the fungal radius from 2.0 to 5.0 will ensure that 75 energy from a single unit should be MORE than enough to kill an entire 200/200 army.

**Decrease Infested Terran energy cost to 5 (down from 25)**

Sometimes in major engagements in the mid-late game we see parts of the screen that are not covered with Infested Terrans (or other Zerg units). This quite frankly is absurd and I'm not sure why it hasn't been patched already. Decreasing the energy cost to 5 will allow more Infested Terrans to be cast to ensure there isn't a single pixel on the screen that isn't covered in free Zerg units.

Well, as we all know, me &gt;&gt;&gt; Sheth X1000, so there's no way I'm going to let Sheth out-do me in anything.  Since I've already posted better GSTL/MLG/NASL results than Sheth ever will, I decided to take my dominance of him one step further and destroy his charity fund-raising efforts as well.

The most humiliating way to do this?  Out-fund-raise him for a large donation to Doctor's Without Borders, of course!

Justin.TV has said that they will match the largest (see: me) donating force for tomorrow, starting at 9 AM CST/10 AM EST!  I'll be donating my entire day's worth of revenue from commercialing AND all of the money that's donated to me via my paypal.  The donation paypal link is Steven.Bonnell.II@GMail.com.  You can donate directly to the Doctor's Without Borders website if you wish, but donating through my (or Sheth's) paypal is the only way to have JTV match the donations!

My stream can be found at - 

http://www.twitch.tv/steven_bonnell_ii

Sheth's stream (dunno why anyone would want to watch this...) -

http://www.twitch.tv/liquidsheth

AHEM

All joking aside, I hope me and Sheth can raise a lot of money tomorrow.  I've never been in a fortunate enough position in my life to actually have the resources to donate extra money to good causes like this.  Doctor's Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières, in the rest of the world) is an awesome, secular organization that specializes in helping developing countries, and countries that have experienced hardship due to conflict.  They've won a Nobel Peace Prize (1999), among other things.  Check out the wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9decins_Sans_Fronti%C3%A8res if you've never heard of them.

If you're going to donate to me for the charity event, don't donate until TOMORROW MORNING at 9AM CST/10AM EST.  ALL donations I receive during that time period will be tallied/added to my total and then sent the next day to Doctor's Without Borders.

I think I get the most viewers when I'm doing a lot of commentary/replay analysis of games that I play, so I'll try to stick to that (and less raging) during the 24 hours I'm streaming.  If more people want, I'll try to cut back on the language/bm as well.  This isn't really about me streaming, it's just about getting as many viewers as possible so I can raise as much money as possible in the 24 hour time period I'm streaming.  **Let me know what you guys want to hear, and I'll do my best to oblige!!**",,False,self,t5_2qpp6,True,,Z,True,t3_kdnuo,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/kdnuo/charity_drive_lol_more_like_destroy_sheth_drive/,

Do you live in The Netherlands or know someone who does? Send them to [our website](http://nssl.nl/tournament-info/finals-event-june-7th) and have them invite their friends through [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/events/155272411251778/)

______________________________________

*It's been a fantastic experience*. After visiting DreamHack Winter 2011 and meeting many pro's and casters (Day[9]!) I decided that we needed a SC-tournament in my hometown in The Netherlands. So I set up the [Nijmegen Student StarCraft League](http://www.nssl.nl) and got an overwhelmingly positive response. Not only did 72 participants from the Radboud University and HAN University sign up, but many people from all over the country sent me e-mails explaining their enthousiasm. When I posted about a possible *national* follow-up to the NSSL [on TeamLiquid](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=317135), it was soon decided that next year there will be an open tournament for all Dutch citizens: the [Dutch StarCraft League](http://www.dscl.nl).

But back to the NSSL! Like I said I've spent [countless hours](http://nssl.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SlimtimerNSSL.png) running the tournament - from setting up and maintaining the website, to writing to tons of possible sponsors and maintaining contact with all the participants to plan their matches. And of course: casting the matches! ALL of the replays from the group stages will be casted (I've had a lot of help with that!) and we're now casting the RO16 and RO8 LIVE. 

Now there's one last event coming up - the culmination of all that we've been working on: [the FINALS](http://nssl.nl/tournament-info/finals-event-june-7th)! On June 7th the semi-finals and finals will be played in front of a live audience in a large lecture hall at the University Campus. Several sponsors have stepped in to provide all the hardware that we'll need, so the players and casters (and the stream) will not be lacking. There will also be awards and a 'pimpest-play compilation', as well as a presentation on scientific research into the positive effects of gaming that has been done with help of our participants. In short: it will be a proper e-sports gala!

But there's one thing I cannot do on my own: get out the word to as many people as possible about the finals. The event stands or falls with the amount of people that show up. Not only will it be much more **fun** if the room is completely packed with a cheering audience, but it will also be a sign to our current and possible future sponsors that the e-sports community is thankful for their support, and worth investing in.

So please - to all you Redditors - if you live in The Netherlands or know someone who does, let them know about [our awesome event](http://nssl.nl/tournament-info/finals-event-june-7th) that will take place on the evening of June 7th in Nijmegen. Everyone is welcome, entrance is free. Please go to [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/events/155272411251778/) and let me know that you're coming by signing up for the event, and importantly: **invite your friends**!

I would be very glad to welcome you all at the finals, I promise I will work hard to make it a night to remember!

For those of you who can't make it to Nijmegen there will be a live stream. Check it out on [Twitch.tv/NSSLeague](http://www.twitch.tv/nssleague)! Next saturday the last set of quarter finals will also be streamed live.

This was at the end of WoL when it was just Zerg turtle in BL Infestor win boats. I played LoL with my flatmates. I can say I have never been so shocked with a bad attitude from a community until I played LoL and frequented the LoL reddit. 

Last weekend I was alone in the flat and turned on MLG SC2 coverage. It played a clip from the Starnation documentary. It brought a tear to my eye. I then proceeded to watch one of the best events of my life. A game that was beautiful played to perfection by players with passion. Casted by the best casters in the world. This is not a LoL bashing thread but by god is SC2 beautiful in comparison. 

Thank you Blizzard and everyone. Once I make some money I will buy HotS and never look back. 


PS. Feel free to down vote. I just needed this shared with folk because I love you all. Even the SC2 reddit admins rock in comparison &amp;lt;3

Edit: I just woke up. I cannot explain what type of a sensation this is. I feel so humbled and yet so happy to be part of a community that is so deeply empathetic and caring. Thank you so much.

	Whiskerless -7 points 1 hour ago
ROOT is built on hype, show me any achievement worth our praise from any of the players on the team and I will change my opinion of them.
	[–]Whiskerless 2 points 35 minutes ago
All people got to go on is Vibe's recent WCS win and Fitzy's getting to finals at the open bracket.
Yet everyone is convinced that ROOT is this unbelievable SC2 pro gaming team with a ton of accomplishments and I am way off base to even consider saying the're over hyped.
Although I am the idiot that went into the pit of dick riding fanboys and offered and opinion that might be viewed at a negative light. Shame on me.

----
sure, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but a lot of people seem to be missinformed, we didn't randomly make a post about our remaking and a bunch of people got excited for nothing, we have a history, clearly, you haven't been following sc2 long enough to know it, so let me tell you a story, and hopefully 'change your opinion' as you said you would.

Before moving onto the archievements let me tell you a little bit about our team; we recruited every member in the team based on potential and common goals, we all wanted to be professional gamers, we were all devoted, and we all still are. 

We forged strong friendships and a team spirit like i've never seen EVER before, and I've been in A LOT of teams/clans. Had you ever heard of qxc before he joined ROOT? nah, unless you went to school with him you haven't, kevin was our first recruit.

Did you know that fnatic didn't want Sheth -FOR FREE- when we took him under our wing? yeah Liquid'Sheth, you might recognize him. 

Did you know that CauthonLuck became famous under our banner, inventing terran opener builds that are still used today, 2 years later? did you know he was the longest person to hold the crown of the ""MLG Koth"" defeating Artosis 4-0, TLO 4-0 and IdrA 4-1? nah, you probably didn't know that. he eventually lost in that Koth... to Slush

Did you know that SLush won the Team Liquid North America Invitational, with all of your favorite north american players in it? (CauthonLuck took 2nd) did you also known that SLush is one of the most if not the most consistent forgeiner at MLG placing at least in the top 20 or so at every event he attended? 

Did you know that drewbie and qxc dominated almost every weekly tournament such as team liquid opens in the early days of sc2, for a long time? course not, you were prob not arround then.

You can talk shit about me and destiny all you want, and say we're overhyped and say we're entretainers, whatever you wanna say, its fine, Steven is moving to poland to train sc2 for a few months soon &amp; i'll do my best to prove you wrong on that front altough i do have some archievements of my own, wether you know them or not.  but you can say w/e u want about me, but don't you talk about my team without knowing anything about it, let me expand a bit on that:


in the beta, in 2010, ROOT won every but 1 ""triple strike team tournament"" during the beta (with 16-32 teams competing in each one), SGL the only clan league during the beta in the americas was won by ROOT Twice in a row (every time we competed in it) and every ""major"" NA team played in it

ROOT had FOUR (drewbie,cauthonluck,slush,kiwikaki) out of the top 8 seeds going into the 2nd MLG season, vs EG 1, Dignitas 1, Liquid 1, aTn 1 (IdrA/SeleCT/HuK/Socke), there was a meeting with the top 8 seeds and their managers, we joked around about it, we liked to call it a team meeting. go check out some interviews on AskJoshy's youtube channel, he was basically the only guy around doing interviews at the time, you'll notice, ""we got 4 in the top 8 again"" being a common line, almost every event.
ROOTKiWiKaKi was the 2nd highest rated player of the entire circuit circuit by points, HuK I believe was 1st. 

ROOT had 5 in the top 8 qualifying players for IEM Americas (drewbie, qxc, kiwikaki, suggy, cauthonluck) cauthonluck retired, being replaced by silver, ROOT took 2nd and 4th place at this event, FIVE IN THE TOP 8.

ROOT finished 2nd in the MRI, where only 4 of the most prestigious teams at the time were invited to compete in (Liquid, EG, ROOT, Prime) - beating Prime and Liquid and losing to EG in a close match in the finals. note: ROOT's record vs EG before disbanding was 6-2 in clanwars played.

After ROOT's 'disband' ROOT's remains in Minigun drewbie and CatZ finsihed the job ROOT STARTED as a team in the EG Masters Cup #V finishing 2nd to Mouz in the whole league, drewbie and I went undefeated the entire season for 2v2 and shortly after won the PSTL the only 2v2 tournament with a prizepool that's worth recalling.

Did you know that EG, compLexity and MANY other teams made ROOT offers to be absorbed and become their new squad? nope, I doubt very many people at all know that.

Did you know that HuK wanted to join ROOT but at that point in time we couldn't let him in cause Sheth and him didn't get along? ofc they became great friends after, but he ended up joining VT and then Liquid later on (now in EG). 

Did you know that drewbie and I practiced a lot and helped SeleCT when he first made his switch from Dota because of the potential we saw in him? he was ready to join too when dignitas made him an offer after winning his first tournament.

Did you know that ROOT was 2nd in the popularity polls on TL back in the day (only to Team Liquid) and that even today, we have more people wearing the ROOT tag on TL as a favorite team for sc2 than every other team except for 2? of course not. it is a shame that I can't take you back to our old website, cause we had 5 pages worth of individual and team archievements. 

You wanna know why people love ROOT so much? because ROOT members love the team so much, remember the offers I just mentioned? well we declined the offers as a team, I should also add that EVERY SINGLE player in the team had individual offers to join other teams that would provide them with salary and travel, guess how many took the first offer? one: MajOr. Every other member of our team refused MULTIPLE offers and most of us stayed together against all odds until we disbanded. 

Because we're friends, because we have the same goals, and because we know how to feed off of each other, because we know each other and can improve together, because we keep each other motivated and pushed each other to be the best. if that wasn't enough archievements AS A TEAM, here's just a few individual acomplishments that I can think of of the top of my head, from some of our members

drew: 
1st place MLG Winter Arena Qualifier NA
1st place NA Zotac Cup #1
1st place @ The Canadian Cup 2010
4th place IEM Season V NA Championship
1st TL Open #5 and #7
2nd Spaz&amp;justin Tv invitational

catz:

1st place Justin.tv Invitational
1st place Eye of E-Sports Grand Opening
6th place IGN Pro League Season 1
2nd Miami sc League Lan (destiny won)
1st CSN After the Clash 2

slush:

1st place Team Liquid Invitational NA
multiple top 10 finishes at MLG incluiding a top 5 at MLG Colombus 2011, defeating naniwa 2-1
2nd EG Masters Cup #1
3rd EG Masters Cup #2
1st in -3- gosucoaching tournaments
kiwikaki:
2nd Place IGN Pro League Season 1
1st place LAN ETS
2nd place MLG Raleigh
2nd place MLG Dallas
2st place Success Pays Invitational
2nd WCG Canada
3rd FXO Path of Ascension
1st place ROOT Challenge NA
ViBE
1st place WCG USA Qualifier #4
2nd place Tactic 3D Tournament
1st place WCS USA National Finals

I hope that's enough acomplishments to change your mind, we've been arround for less than ONE month, so, yeah we haven't played in much since, but in the little time we have, I think we're doing quite well, with ViBE winning the WCS USA and Fitzy falling 1 round short of the championship bracket at MLG incluiding a 2-0 on Zenio. Are we were we left of? again, no, not quite yet, but we aim to get there, we'll be working hard and we'll be putting a lot of time into this, and when HotS arrives, I think we will shine brightest.

 I hope this answers the stupid question of why we are hyped so much. We're not just entretainers bro, we just happen to be funny too!. Lots of people say ROOT's a team of fan favorites, and nothing makes me more proud because we worked hard as fuck to become fan favorites and because while we were alive, the community was essential to us sticking together, telling us all the time ""you can do it!"" we went without a penny for an entire year, thanks to the community, this time, we hope to stay much much longer.

so,""Whiskerless"" shame on you! 

P.S: sorry if I feel repetitive at times, when I start writing I don't usually stop for a while and that usually results in a bit of a mess :) haha.

1322894978.0,1019,self.starcraft,myigu,"Dear NASL, I have worked in professional sports broadcasting",2103,1084,250,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/myigu/dear_nasl_i_have_worked_in_professional_sports/,"For the audio guy: You always, ALWAYS set your preamp gain by having your commentator yell at the level they're going to be at when they're excited. The really professional guys can keep the same level when they're excited, but hey, not everyone has that kind of control. Set a compressor to just barely be kicking in when the commentator's at their normal talking level, and to be smashing when they're excited. Put a limiter on your master, but don't ""mix into"" it. The limiter's a safety to keep things from blowing up.

A downward expander (or a gate with a high floor if you can't get your hands on an expander) on the caster mic might get rid of some of that nasty room ambience for you. Use crowd mics to get your ambience back, with a compressor sidechained to the casters so you don't pick up the direct audio of the casters from the speakers.

Run the room audio off a separate mixer from your stream audio, or using aux sends on the casting mixer. For fuck's sake, eq the fucking feedback out of the room. That shit is not fucking acceptable.

EDIT: Omni lavalier mics are a very bad choice to use on your announcers who look like they're sitting in the coverage pattern of the PA... No wonder there's feedback. Get some directional headset mics and that should help you a ton. Something that's not held in by the ear canal, I noticed Day9 struggling with his mic 'cause it came loose, sending sooo much ugly handling noise into the mix.

Mix the game audio to be sitting just under the announcers. Throw a compressor on there so that huge battles don't blow things up. Not an NASL thing, but for everyone else... Personally, I am not a huge fan of having the in-game music in the mix. If you watch a pro sports broadcast, you don't have music sitting under the game. Turn that shit off.

The interview cameraman: Start with a 1-shot on the interviewer, pull out to a 2-shot when he introduces the player, zoom into the player when he starts replying, STAY THERE FOR THE REST OF THE INTERVIEW, even when the interviewer is talking. Pull back out to a 2-shot when the interviewer wraps. If your camera doesn't have tally, stay on the shot several seconds after you think you're probably think you're not live anymore, and the interviewer should stay ""at attention"" for the same amount of time. Whip pans on air should be punishable by death.

Tell the players to not try to grab the microphone.

A little ""NASL"" mic flag would make it look so much more professional and would be really easy to make. A little cube of plastic with decals on the side and some foam inside to grip the microphone.

The casters: I find the endless crowd hyping annoying. This is probably a consequence of the caster audio being piped into the room, but really, more people are watching the stream than are in the room. Build your show around the streaming audience. How much do you hear commentators on pro sports broadcasts hyping the crowd? Exactly zero. Stop addressing and looking around at the crowd, address the camera and your stream audience.

Whoever is setting up the matches and running the spectator computer needs to start making the player colors consistent from game to game. Either let each player pick what color they will appear as on screen (though veto any combinations that would be confusing), or make every game red vs. blue, and the player who was left side red the first game should be left side red through the rest of the series.

EDIT: Watching Sheth vs. Puma right now... Purple and green are the worst colors possible for the players, the green doesn't read very well on the green grass on the minimap, and the purple doesn't read very well on the purple creep on the minimap.

Try and aim the booth cameras so we can see the players' hands. I loved MLG's booth camera angle. The hands are how the players are interacting with the game, and it adds a lot of visual interest to the shot (the players don't really tend to show a lot of emotion except at the end of the game or when they really fuck up). If you can't get the MLG angle, maybe shoot from the side, as long as you can make it so it looks on screen like the players are ""facing"" each other.

Not an NASL thing, but something I noticed during Dreamhack's Quake Live coverage. Whoever's directing video, LISTEN TO YOUR FUCKING CASTERS. For a full minute a caster was trying to show the layout of the map to the audience, but the camera was on the announcers, showing a picture of the caster talking about the layout of the map. Totally fucking amateur.

The game video is noticeably delayed compared to the caster audio... Frequently a caster will talk about something before it actually happens. ~~No idea what could be causing this~~ EDIT: Oh wait we can see the mouse cursor. Second guess: Whatever frame sync you're using to get the video into your switcher is adding delay, and the game audio is flowing through it as well, and the frame sync is smart enough to add make-up delay.

I noticed something that I haven't seen previously on other terran streams. He was pulling his mules off the minerals before they expired. Why? You may ask yourself. The mules don't complete their last trip therefore wasting the minerals they collect entirely on that trip.

This got me curious if this was true for close and far mineral patches. It isn't. The far mineral patches return the exact same amount of minerals over the mule duration (270) but the mule expires before taking 30 more from the mineral patch

 Everything I have heard has been terrans saying to mule the close mineral patches as the income is greater because they make the trips faster. This is true, though only slightly so. Watching the replay with the income tab open and only a mule harvesting the income would fluxuate between 120 and 240 at a rate that I could not tell the difference with my naked eye.

What does this mean? Every mule on a close patch will waste 30 minerals (blue). It actually better to mule the far patches unless you intend to pull the mule off before the final trip. that 30 per mule will add up quickly to be a substantial amount. By the time the base is mined out you may have completely wasted hundreds of minerals.",,False,self,t5_2qpp6,False,,,True,t3_of9oz,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/of9oz/mule_efficiency/,

It takes two to make a good stream - both the streamer and their opponent.  As of lately, some opponents have even gone out of their way to que up repeatedly against popular streamers over and over again, ensuring that we (the streamers) will always have a match to play and you (the viewers) will always be entertained with good, fair, games.

That being said, I encourage all of you - of your own free will, of course - to message these players and let them know how happy you are that they're providing you with entertainment every time you see one of them on a stream.  I've provided some sample messages you can send them, along with a list of name.identifiers for an easy, message-sending experience!

MVP has battled criticisms about his plays due to being plague by a wrist injury. He is considered one of the best Terran (Starcraft 2 race) in the world.

The two met in a best of seven series played today in Seoul, South Korea. Lots of intense games were played, which left spectators and casters on the edge of their seats, speechless.

To the frontpagers interested in learning more about Starcraft; I would encourage you to visit [gomtv.net](http://gomtv.net) the host of the GSL tournament. I would also recommend visiting some of our largest fan communities, [teamliquid.net](http://www.teamliquid.net) and, of course, /r/starcraft.

I am still here in China with Carmac and he has showed me some feedback from this community.  I personally am thrilled with the abundance of positive responses to this tournament because of the passion I have for esports.  My son and I play StarCraft II - he always makes me bring home player autographs and other SC2 memorabilia.

I am glad that all the hard work that we have done with Carmac has paid off and that we were able to provide a great tournament for so many people around the world to follow.  Your feedback, good or bad, is of immense value to me.

The fact that it was so positive pushes me even further towards legitimising esports as a real sport.  I hope to see you at our events or that you continue to follow them online.

Someone wrote a thread here thanking the sponsors of Intel Extreme Masters.

I want to say, all the thanks goes to YOU.  We make it all happen because of you.

George Woo",,False,self,t5_2qpp6,False,,P,True,t3_l1dfz,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/l1dfz/intels_response_to_the_sc2_community_on_reddit/,

As a Starcraft fan as well, I remember when SC2 was the side event at MLG Dallas, and it meant a lot to see so much support. So thanks in advance for being understanding when we take up the main stage for a little bit before the finals, and I hope you check out our game, or even give it a try (it is free to play). If you have and questions about competitive Tribes, I can try to answer them.

Hey guys! 

I have been a long time Lurker here on Reddit but have never made more than a few posts.

If you have any questions for me feel free to ask and I will do my best to respond! Depending on how late this goes I may doze off in a couple of hours but will do my best.

Theres only a few things I request not to be asked about:

1) Me and HD. I get asked this every day and have answered it numerous times. There is nothing bad between HD and myself. We simply do not cast together anymore. Its happend with other casters in the past and there is no crazy story behind it.

2) Questions about my income. This is very private information for anyone who has a job and is something I personally would never ask someone.

3) Questions about my super personal life. I personally like to keep some of my life private and dont gloat about who I'm dating (see what I did there).

So I'm not going to make excuses for the TAC 3 finals over the weekend. I'm not going to blame a specific technical issue or put the blame on any one person to scapegoat them. A lot of things were messed up and blame ultimately rests with us. For all of those issues, I'm sorry.

What I can tell you is what we're going to do moving forward: We have listened to all of the criticism and, frankly, share a lot of those concerns that you have. We're going through an all hands on deck meeting today to identify every specific problem and what we can do to make sure those don't happen again, all the way from stream/technical issues, to tournament management, to production.

For every subscriber of our Twitch.tv HD pass that was upset, we're offering refunds for subscribers for the month of August. Email us your Twitch username to iplsubscription@gmail.com and we'll work closely with Twitch to ensure that this gets resolved in a timely manner.

We now want to regain your trust through IPTL which will be launching tomorrow with the Amateur Division. In addition, we're taking a pause on our IPL5 announcements to address all of your concerns from production issues to compromising the format of GSL Code S. We're committed now, more than ever, to make sure we get things right.

We've just invested a huge amount into our studios, and equipment just started showing up last week. As we move forward, you'll even see improvements to set design and quality of stream in the coming weeks.

If you have any questions or concerns, please voice them in this thread and we'll take note of them and respond or act on the issues as necessary. Your continued support means the world to us, as we want nothing more than to provide high quality eSports content to you on a daily basis.

Thanks so much.

Kevin Knocke and the rest of the IPL Staff

TL,DR: We screwed up. Bad. And we want to make it up to you. Please comment on anything you have concerns about and we'll address them appropriately.",,False,self,t5_2qpp6,False,,TSL,True,t3_y80mw,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/y80mw/apology_from_ipl_and_a_promise_moving_forward/,

1335843379.0,964,self.starcraft,t0zt8,Question about decision making by Polt.,1403,439,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/t0zt8/question_about_decision_making_by_polt/,"Hi Reddit.  I'm going to be talking about this point (http://www.twitch.tv/tslpolt/b/316683050?t=7m30s) of the game in this post.

I noticed Polt make an interesting decision in a TvP he played earlier today.  He opened 5 rax and pushed out at ~7:30.  When he reached the opponent's base at 8:00, he caught a glimpse of 7 sentries, a couple zealots, and a stalker.  Upon seeing this, he immediately pulled back, finished his wall-off, put up 2 bunkers, in an obviously defensive position which allowed him to hold off the all-in that came a few moments later.

I'm a high masters terran and I would have never made that read; my question is what exactly did Polt see that triggered his defensive reaction?  Was the sentry count abnormally high?  If so how many sentries would be normal at that time in the game?  Also what stopped him from pushing up the ramp when he saw those units?  My first instinct would have been to rush up and try to pick off sentries since the zealot/stalker count seemed low.

Thanks for helping me! :)",,False,self,t5_2qpp6,False,,,True,t3_t0zt8,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/t0zt8/question_about_decision_making_by_polt/,

Here is the thread on TotalBiscuit's video explaining why SOPA is a terrible law, and could ruin distribution of eSports content http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ngcu5/totalbiscuit_explaining_sopa/

I've spent some time this morning looking for and emailing + tweeting the webmasters/owners/CEOs of SC2 teams and content providers regarding GoDaddy's support of the SOPA.  Please help by making similar requests via twitter.  We need to make organizations like GoDaddy aware that their disregard for an open web is unacceptable.  

You can check if a website is registered with GoDaddy by entering their URL here: http://www.whois.sc , and then clicking on the ""Registration"" tab 
You will see something like this: ""ICANN Registrar:GODADDY.COM, INC"", if the domain name is registered with GoDaddy

So far I have tried to contact complexity, day9tv, totalbiscuit, djwheat, twitch.tv, EG, CloudNineLabs (destiny's website)

**Edit2:**
Lifehacker has a good post on some alternatives to hosting and domain registration (transfer discounts!):
http://lifehacker.com/5870649/ditch-godaddys-sopa+loving-butt-and-get-a-better-web-host-at-a-discount

**Edit3:** Wow that was fast, just a day after the boycott was suggested, GoDaddy is already claiming to have withdrawn their support from the legislation.  I still recommend transferring your domains to set an example (especially if the process is not going to hurt your business / operations). http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/victory-boycott-forces-godaddy-to-drop-its-support-for-sopa.ars 

**Edit4:** Really glad to see how much support this post received.  I was even happier to learn that Day9, Twitch and MLG were already in the process of transferring off GoDaddy before this post was made.  

This is definitely a small victory if you think only in terms of the scale of this corporation, considering much bigger companies like Intel and ~~Microsoft (whoops my bad)~~ Sony (more listed here http://www.scribd.com/doc/76259944/SOPA-Supporters) are still in open support of the bill.  GoDaddy was also an easy target because switching off their services is usually not going to be a major expense.  But what's more important is to note that we are setting precedent here, and showing the power of the consumer.  This change in position will also be great ammunition for SOPA-opposing congressmen when the committee returns to discussing the bill in January, especially since GoDaddy helped design some of the amendments to help 'improve' the bill.  I hope people will continue to follow through with their transfers.  The damage that companies like GoDaddy have done in helping write this bill far outweighs the consequences they have been subjected to thus far.",,False,self,t5_2qpp6,True,,,True,t3_no38o,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/no38o/please_help_convince_esports_websites_to_move/,

This rumors are only good for DOTA 2 fans,since NASL is one of the best and most prestigious professional leagues outside of Korea,with talented casters,big prize pools capable of rivalry the GSL ones and a top notch production value. It helped the NA Starcraft 2 scene for 2 years now and this rumors are only bad news for us,there is already a thread on Dota 2 subreddit supporting the switch(1),and casters from time to time teases at it(2).


We couldn't blame them for a decision that Blizzard made,but it would be cool(and hopefully profitable for them)to stay where their heart initially was, or maybe we could ask Blizzard to run WCS NA like they do in Korea,with 2 big leagues( GSL and OSL) co-hosting WCS Korea.

Anyway,if you fell like,please take a moment to upvote this and let them know that we support them to stay with SC2.

This is Clutch. Most people know me as the host for the MLG StarCraft 2 stage and arenas. I am a private contractor and open to host for other leagues. I would be thrilled to host for NASL for the following reasons.

1. Canada. I have never been past the border up north. I have met many fans from Canada. They have a special flare of passion when it comes to eSports. This is very apparent watching the BarCraft Montreal videos.

2. NASL. From season one to season three this league has grown immensely both in numbers and in production value. The playoffs alone were worth me staying up to 3am. 

3. The community. The people surrounding this league, both staff and fans, have been very engaging in chat and offering live events/fan interactions at their local BarCraft. I want to meet the people behind the chat monikers that have been so fun to watch SC2 with. 

4. Huk. The hero of Canada. I remember watching as a cameraman back in 2010 as he sat on a pillow and wore a hoodie during his MLG matches. He's come a long way, and to introduce him onstage in front of his Canadian fans would be a true honor. 

NASL knows of my desire to host for them. In the end they have to make the decision that makes the most sense for them, but I hope this dream can become a reality. 

*Edit* Response - WHOA! Thanks everyone for your support. First off, I want to apologize to NASL &amp; EMG. It was never my intention to place anyone in a potentially awkward position. Intention or not this post has generated a huge response. I will fully support NASL's decision whatever it may be and expect everyone that has supported me to do the same. I love the fans, the players, and the crews that make these events a reality. I believe in eSports with every fiber of my being.

We have a zoom in function, but it is virtually useless. 

However, watching MMA vs Mvp today, the large open, sprawling tank lines in the center of the map require the observer to circle around all over the area to give us an idea of what is going on. 

Adding a zoom out function would do so much to give us a better idea of the strategic positioning.

* This doesn't have to be allowed for players in game - that might make the game easier in some cases.

If this gets a positive response I'll post it to the BNet forums.

Today is my cake day!  I can’t believe I’ve been doing my schtick for a whole year-- I thought this account would last a couple of weeks and then I’d get bored and move on.  I never really anticipated the amazing response I would get from this awesome subreddit.  


To celebrate, I thought I would have some fun.   I thought I’d share: (i) My 12 favorite jokes in this subreddit over the past year, (ii) some lesser-noticed oddities about Starcraft that I find amusing, (iii) My biggest joke explaining fuck-up, (iv) My utterly terrible previous novelty account, and more! I remain in the bronze league of brevity, so this post is quite lengthy.  

***Favorite Jokes***

I decided to collect my favorite 12 /r/starcraft witticisms over the past year.  Note that these are for jokes that are, as far as I know, original to this subreddit-- so funny stuff said by casters, webcomics, hilarious interview moments, etc. don’t qualify.  Obviously, these aren’t objective and my own biases about humor are going to come into play.  

[12: Scanner Sweep](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/k0biq/scanner_sweep/)
Brilliant application of a hilarious scene featuring a nerd icon.  It also points out a foible of human nature.  I think almost everybody has futilely tried  to move their units outside of scan range despite knowing to a near-certainty that the scanner has already seen it.  This is, of course, simply an extension of behavior that one can frequently see in real life.

[11: Blizzard reveals new Zerg unit in Heart of the Swarm](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/l7kcl/blizzard_reveals_new_zerg_unit_in_heart_of_the/c2qg11v)

Absolutely brilliant.  I alluded to this in my explanation in the thread, but it bears repeating: Based on the timing (just after the real ‘Zerg’ unit was released), I knew in advance that it was a joke thread and clicked through, fully expecting to see the silhouette of a hydralisk.  Jokes facetiously suggesting that hydralisks/carriers/reapers aren’t even in the game can be funny, but not “favorite joke” funny-- the concept is both obvious and used quite often, meaning that it’s hard to build an expectation-subverting joke with that punchline.  Hence, when I clicked through, there was a moment of surprise, about five seconds of confusion, and then uncontrollable laughter.  


[10: Always good for a surprise](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ku5i6/always_good_for_a_surprise/)

I’ve played all three races in both brood war and SC2, to varying extents of seriousness.  SC2 Terrans are simply unmatched in their ability to deny scouting and accomplish devastating attacks off one base.  The comic captures the frustration of dealing with that perfectly, and the zerg’s facial expressions are priceless.  


[9: We can all relate to this kitten](http://en.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/i2cql/we_can_all_relate_to_this_kitten/)

Simple, funny, and epic novelty account free-for-all in the comments.

[8: If Dustin Browder designed bras...](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/j2j8s/if_dustin_browder_designed_bras/)

We’ve all been there.  Well, those of us who are sexually attracted to women, anyway.  

[7:I know a lot of you are new to SC2, so here's a unit name cheat sheet (work in progress)](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/j7wsx/i_know_a_lot_of_you_are_new_to_sc2_so_heres_a/?limit=500)

I don’t even know why this made me laugh so hard.

[6: EMP Rage](http://reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/h63pp/emp_rage/)
I’ve done this.  More than once.  

[5: Day in the life](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/il73j/a_day_in_the_life_of_an_sc_redditor/)

It’s quite funny how there’s a “karma lottery” when there’s a really obvious submission.   Sometimes the prize doesn’t even go to the first person submits.  I’ve given up trying to submit anything, ever.

[4: A game theory analysis of PvP](http://i.imgur.com/zyQTR.jpg)
I actually didn’t save the thread where this came from and now I can’t find it.  But, well, this is what it was like at platinum and above for months.  Any joke relying on a payoff matrix has my approval.

[3: Tales from the War](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jqu7t/tales_from_the_war/)

We don't think of our units much from a lore perspective, but it's usually hilarious when we do.

[2: Why did the colossus fall over? Because it was imbalanced](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/geor3/why_did_the_colossus_fall_over/)
[A marine walks into a bar and asks, where is the counter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/folc9/a_marine_walks_into_the_bar_and_asks/)


I include these together because they’re conceptually related.  I took some flak for arguing in the colossus thread that part of what made the joke funny was the inelegant and clumsy appearance of the colossus.  As I said, though, the two jokes above conceptually related. In theory, you could easily switch them-- why did the marine fall over?  Because he was imbalanced.  A colossus walks into a bar and asks, where is the counter?

It’s not as funny, in my opinion, because there’s no double entendre.  A marine doesn’t LOOK imbalanced and a colossus isn’t a person that might walk into a bar and order a drink.   Humor is a lot like persuasion-- the reason it works can be invisible to the target.  

[2: Fuck-yea Bronze](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/g6phy/introducing_fuckyea_bronze/).  I hesitated to include this on the list, because it’s the internet equivalent of a “you had to be there” joke.  But it’s just too damn funny to omit.

The copious backstory: “Forever Bronze” was one of those things that was funny, then unfunny, then funny, then extremely unfunny, and is now occasionally funny again.  For those who weren’t around for the Forever Bronze heyday, it was (if I may quote myself) “a phrase used by Starcraft players to refer to players who are perceived as lacking the skills to earn a promotion to a different league, and the practices that prevent them from receiving a promotion”.  The problem with the Forever Bronze meme is that people quickly ran out of legitimate “Forever Bronze” stuff (e.g., [doing a double extractor trick and letting both finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/fxidj/forever_bronze_extractor_trick_first_post_true/) and started just coming up with bad decisions that were far less plausible: (I could cite a few examples here, but that hardly seems nice).

Enter ""Fuck-Yea"" Bronze.”  It proposed a meme that put bronze level play in a positive light.  My personal favorite is the very first one-- somebody who can be happy about a game where they lost at the ten minute mark but had three fully saturated bases has the right attitude and won’t be bronze for long.  In the context of endless “Forever Bronze” submissions, it was a breath of fresh air.  What’s more, it’s relatable-- very few of us are forever bronze, but all of us have the moment of exhilaration when we improve, even in the full knowledge that we’re way behind what the professionals can do.    That, my friends, is the true spirit of Starcraft.


[1:This is not a void ray](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ghk1o/psych/).  Sheer and utter brilliance, in large part because the reference was so unexpected.  It takes a genius mind to watch that infamous IdrA match and decide it’s a great way to reference a Belgian surrealist painting.  I cannot imagine how this joke can be topped.  I freely admit that the inclusion of the other eleven jokes on this list was a matter of taste.  This joke, however, is objectively hilarious.  If you disagree, you are wrong.

Earlier today, 80 Starcraft players including QXC, RSVP, VER, and many of the best players in the Chicago area met for a free-admission, 200$ tournament. Here is the hype post on Reddit for this tournament: http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ohhoy/115_chicagos_biggest_tourney_barcraft_70_players/
  
This was held at, essentially, a ""gaming arcade,"" which was a wonderful place with tons of gaming systems everywhere, a stage for Rock Band/Guitar hero, a bar with its biggest monitors playing Starcraft streams constantly (even though football games were on), and people playing all sorts of games like Portal, NBA 2k11, and MW3. In short, it was an amazing venue and was really awesome for a gamer to hang out in.  
  
All of the participants arrived ready to play, some coming from hours away. We were all warming up on ladder, getting ready for our matches, when suddenly more than half of us were unable to sign into battle.net. For a couple of hours, only a couple of the nearly 80 players were able to sign on, and finally we learned that our IP address was sending too many login requests and had been blacklisted by Blizzard.  
  
Even though our gaming venue had registered with Blizzard and contacted them, the Blizzard support team was unable to fix the problem for more than three hours. According to the admins of the event, it would have taken the simple answering of a phone call by a higher up Blizzard Employee, approving the white-listing of our IP address and giving us the capability to play. 
  
While I could make this discussion about LAN, I would rather make it about the failure of Blizzard to provide ample support to this tournament. Because of their failures, dozens of gamers who had traveled hours to reach this tournament went home without playing a single game. Furthermore, by failing to provide support to our tournament, Blizzard made bunk the hours of work the event organizers put in to make this tournament happen.  
  
Because of the failure of the Blizzard support system and its employees, all of the hundreds of hours of work and travel that went into this tournament meant nothing. Today, Blizzard killed a tournament.

Info and updates in this thread.,1597,658,335,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/t2e3p/the_most_important_event_in_the_history_of/,"A press conference headed by GOM, Blizzard, OGN, and KeSPA is about to take place in Seoul.

The conference will discuss the transition of OGN and KeSPA from SC1 to SC2. This is a big freaking deal. Without the BroodWar-related work of KeSPA, OGN, and MBC over the last ten years, the SC2 competitive scene would be a shadow of its current self. In fact, Blizzard would probably not have designed SC2 to be a competitive title had BW not had such a healthy scene in Korea.

You can follow [TL's live report twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/TeamLiquidLIVE) for updates, or you can refresh this thread. I'll be updating as much as I can.

EDIT 1: It starts at 10:30 AM KST, apparently. That's 21:30 Eastern or 03:30 CEST.

EDIT 2: ""Boxer, Flash, Bisu, DRG, MKP, Leenock, Jjakji, Nestea, etc all present"" -- TL

EDIT 3: ""This event will be hosted by OGN Caster Ms. Jung and GomTV Caster Mr. Chae"" -- pgr21/ESFI

EDIT 4: The event has begun.

EDIT 5: ""KeSPA and OnGameNet have received official licenses to run and broadcast SC II leagues. SC II is now an officially recognized kespa game. KeSPA, Blizz, Gom, and OGN have agreed to work together to help SC II esports develop in Korea, etc etc. Next season of PL will have SC2. No official word on mixed with BW, or just SC2."" -- TL

EDIT 6: More concrete information doesn't seem to be forthcoming. edit: OK, I was clearly wrong about this.

EDIT 7: ""KeSPA rep speaking now. I think I read ""BW + SC2"" hybrid in betwee the lines, but I could be wrong"" -- TL

EDIT 8: Flash: ""I wish for the global fans to give support to us SC1 players so we can bring our best games.""

EDIT 9: SC2 Licenses have been extended from Blizzard to all parties.

EDIT 10: This OSL might not be the last BW OSL.

EDIT 11: Proleague next season will be hybrid BW/SC2. The season after that will probably be pure SC2.

EDIT 12: KeSPA: ""We will look into how to integrate the Gom/GSTL teams for the all SC2, October season of PL."" -- TL

EDIT 13: OGN: ""We're preparing foreign broadcasts for SC II, as we've done for other game leagues (League of Legends)""

EDIT 14: Estimated start time for OGN's SC2 league is early July.

EDIT 15: OGN: ""We haven't been able to talk to Gom in detail about cooperation, but we're going to talk soon. Though they're gone now, MBCGame helped us become who we are through competition and cooperation.""

EDIT 16: Rights to broadcasts will be held by the individual broadcasters.

EDIT 17: You'll be seeing ex-BW pros playing SC2 in the third week of May. That's when the hybrid Proleague will start.

EDIT 18: Boxer asked a question. ""Esports was too focused in Korea for the last 10 years, which limited it. Korean players need to go abroad more and compete internationally for esports to grow in Korea. What is KeSPA going to do to support this?"" Answer from KeSPA: ""The main reason we switched to SC II was to put Korea forth as the motherland of esports. We're working at cooperating with various international leagues.""

EDIT 19: Tentative OGN plan is to have KeSPA league, GSTL league, and amateur players compete in the July OSL.

EDIT 20: KeSPA is being asked a question about the KeSPA-like organization that has popped up for the GSTL teams. Will KeSPA work with them? I'm not going to read the answer that KeSPA gives to that question. The real answer is ""We will crush them utterly.""

EDIT 21: I suppose this means that Moletrap will be commentating SC2 games for OGN. Torch too?

The pages of LP have been invaluable to a Starcraft rookie like myself, especially when preparing for tournaments. 

Being able to find players, teams, tournaments, previous histories, little snippets of fun trivia and put it all together at an event to bring the players to life to the audience is such an essential part of being a host, but it's nothing without great information and somewhere central to find it all.

To all those who contributed, large and small, thank you for making my job so much easier in 2012.
