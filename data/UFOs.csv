1350573597.0,342,self.UFOs,11oxo3,"Have you guys heard about the 'meteorite' that 
supposedly hit NW Louisiana Monday night? It's 
kind of a big deal here, because it's being denied 
and covered-up... ",390,48,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/11oxo3/have_you_guys_heard_about_the_meteorite_that/,"Late Monday night there was a **HUGE** explosion in NW Louisiana, around an underground bunker at Camp Minden. The blast broke windows and shattered lightbulbs all around the area, and could be heard and felt more than thirty miles away. 

At the same time, witnesses from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas report there being a very bright, orange fireball streaking across the sky. 

The story I've heard around here (from people that usually take little interest in things like this) goes something like this:

The first reports from the media and law enforcement say that, based off of the calls received about the orange object streaking across the sky, a meteorite 10-30 ft in length impacted somewhere around Minden. 

By the time the morning news came on, that story had changed from metorite, to an explosion in a bunker at Camp Minden. However, the company that owns the bunker canceled a press conference scheduled for yesterday morning at the last minute without explanation, so *technically* it still (3 days later) hasn't been officially confirmed. 

The sketchiest part about it to me is that Facebook seems to be censoring users' posts about the incident. Several people have noticed that if they try and post anything about what happened, the post marks itself as 'private', preventing anyone else but the user who posted from seeing it.

This might sound like a ton of bullshit, and if it weren't happening directly around me, I would think it was, too. 

[This is a pretty decent article, with video of the impact site, that explains the theory pretty well](http://www.opednews.com/articles/Meteorite-Impacts-Earth-in-by-Joe-Quinn-121017-180.html). I'm not saying that I believe everything here, but it's an interesting read.

Craziest part of it to me is how many people here are talking about it. This area doesn't usually question things like this, but apparently enough people here saw something that didn't add up to the official story. 

Anyways, thought you guys might find this interesting.

EDIT:  here's a video of a first hand account by a man from Minden who explains what he experienced:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0WSKsQyV7w

**EDIT 2:  The morning after the explosion, this news report states that the Sheriff of Webster Parish has ruled out 'explosion facilities and natural gas facilities' as a cause...** a very good first report worth taking a look at:

For those of you trying to sniff out trolls, I just want everyone to know why this long-winded post is coming from a brand new account. 

Also, I want to say that the following is a lot of information I've collected over several years and I've yet to write down any of my findings before today. So, I apologize if this is a long, somewhat rambling read. I'm getting a lot out at once. 

Some back story:

My dad joined the air force in 1971 to avoid being drafted for the Viet Nam war. He was a brilliant man and quickly qualified to work in research and surveillance in several US and NATO air force bases. He was originally stationed at the base in Shemya, Alaska, but later worked at Keflavik AFB in Iceland, Patrick AFB in Florida, and finally Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs, CO, where I was born. He retired in the early 90's while I was still a young child and went to a technical institute and received his degree in Engineering. While stationed in Florida, he began working with AFTAC and after he retired, he found a job with SAIC in Colorado where he worked for about twelve years before retiring to Maine with my mom. For those who don't know, SAIC operates with NORAD at Peterson AFB, so even though he was a retiree, my father worked closely with the US Air Force and Defense programs for years after his service had ended.

In 2007, my dad began to suffer from an illness he thought was just a cold or a small bout of the flu. When the sickness didn't alleviate for more than a month, he sought help from his doctor. For months, the doctor treated for several different supposed causes to no avail. Finally, he was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer that had pretty much spread all over his body. He had been a cigar smoker since he was a kid, so our family wasn't exactly surprised, but his doctors did note the cancer was unusually aggressive and hard to detect from his outward symptoms. By mid-2008, he was dead. 

My dad was somewhat reclusive in his life. He had many hobbies, most of which involved his coming home from work and holing himself up in the garage. He always seemed to need distraction when he wasn't working, he would be doing something that used 100% of his attention. He was also a functioning alcoholic, and would pretty much drink from the time he arrived home from work until when he went to bed. He was by no means a bad father, but distant. I don't have a whole lot of precious memories of him and I together. However, one common interest he and I shared to an extreme level was in aliens and UFOs. Whenever A&amp;E or the History Channel had a weekend-long UFO show marathon, my dad and I were inseparable from the television. When I would ask my dad if he really believed in extraterrestrial life, he would give me the responsible response of ""it is impossible to know for sure, but I'd have to say that with the universe and big as it is, it's incredibly likely there's something out there that is smarter than us.""

In the early days of his career at SAIC, my father would take business trips to parts of New Mexico, specifically Carlsbad and Albuquerque. We never were allowed to know what exactly he did on the trips, or really what he did with his job in general, presumably because he was working with information sensitive to military defense. One time, however- and this memory sticks with me more than any other thought of my dad- after a weekend trip to Albuquerque, I asked him how his trip was and he told me that he had visited the giant city underneath down town Albuquerque. He told me it was a city built as a military base, but was quite similar to any normal city, with outlet stores and McDonalds restaurants for the military personnel's leisure.   

Now here's where things get weird for me.

A few years ago, a group of friends and I were talking about New Mexico for some reason that escapes my memory. I think a friend was heading that way on a road trip and was wondering what exactly one could do or see in NM. Without really thinking about it, I mentioned that they could visit the underground city in Albuquerque. Suddenly, everyone in the conversation looked at me like I was absolutely insane. ""What?"" I questioned, ""You've never heard of the underground government cities in New Mexico?"" My dad had spoken of his encounter so nonchalantly, I assumed that it was just general knowledge that the military had cities under New Mexico.

Somewhat embarrassed and curious, I went home and did a quick Google search for ""underground city Albuquerque"" and, to my surprise, found no official record of any such place. Furthermore, the only websites that said anything of said underground city were UFO and Alien conspiracy sites. 

Why did my father tell me he visited a place that doesn't seem to officially exist and is only speculated by alien conspiracy theorists?

At this point, I was scared, paranoid, and in need of more information. I looked at my dad's obituary to get a more detailed look at his military career. Here, I discovered his involvement at Keflavik AFB in the early to mid seventies. I did another quick search, ""Keflavik  air force base aliens."" One of the first results was an ""official"" account of a decorated military member stationed at Keflavik in 1969 saying that the Iceland base housed thousands of alien aircraft in silos. Of course, I can't find the page again, but it suggested that my dad may have been around alien-military activity while he was stationed there. 

Now, it's very easy to say I used a bunch of vague elements to come to a pretty specific conclusion, but I'm nearly convinced my dad had at least the certainty of knowledge of the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. This discovery has been a pretty constant source of stress and strain on my life. I am a fan of alien theories, but I consider 99% of ""evidence"" I see on the internet and television as ridiculous. Regardless, my experience appears very real to me. When I am at my best, I can accept that I'm probably just digging for answers with details that aren't really there but seem connected. When I'm at my worst, I believe my dad knew about alien life and was possibly killed because of it. Furthermore, I believe he was somehow trying to let me know what he knew or at least trying to leave me clues that he knew *something.* After all, my mom and brothers did not share the alien-mania that my father and I did. Maybe this was his way of passing something on to me.

Some miscellaneous notes worth mentioning:

-A few days after 9/11/2001, my dad and I were barbecuing steak in our backyard when he turned to me and said ""So, they've banned any air traffic for the next few days for obvious reasons, but listen closely. You can still hear plane engines, can't you?"" I hadn't noticed because we lived so close to the Air Force Base, the sound of planes overhead was something I had naturally ignored, but he was right. The sky was eerily quiet with the exception of two distinct rumblings of plane engines. I looked up and there was no evidence of aircraft in the sky.
""That's because Peterson is flying its experimental camouflage jets. This technology exceeds even the stealth bomber and basically makes the plane invisible."" That was all he said and he said it with the same non-chalantness he used when he told me about Albuquerque. To my recollection, these are the only two strange things he ever mentioned to me. This might not have anything to do with alien life, but it's just another weird memory to enforce that his work dealt with military operations the public doesn't know about.

-A friend of my father's that had worked with him in Iceland, Florida, and Colorado Springs died of a similar sudden illness. 

-The last few months of my dad's life, he was undergoing weekly chemotherapy treatment that made him irritable and almost crazy. He would apparently have arguments with characters on the television and was paranoid about many things. When he died, my mom told me it was probably best I wasn't there for a lot of his suffering (I was still living in Colorado at the time) and that near the end, he admitted some weird and disturbing things. When I implored my mom to go into more detail about what he said, she told me none of it made much sense and that she'd rather not have me think about my dad at his worst (though, she implied he talked more about experiences with his parents and immediate family rather than anything having to do with his work.)

-This actually just occurred to me as I was writing this, but I remember my dad saying he would try to help me get a job at SAIC sorting mail or something basic shortly after I graduated high school. i blew him off as I was a rebellious kid, but I wonder now if he was trying to reveal more of the truth to me.

I'm curious what r/UFOs has to say about this. I'd love if someone had questions to ask me to possibly jar a few memories loose I've yet to remember, or if someone has similar experiences or more information. Also, I'm wondering if there's a resource to find UFOlogist and the like in my area so I can recount this story to someone in person. Thanks in advance!

1347929779.0,148,self.UFOs,101xvh,I grew up in an aviation family. Here's a sighting that has haunted me for 30 years.,169,21,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/101xvh/i_grew_up_in_an_aviation_family_heres_a_sighting/,"I grew up in an aviation family. My father bought a farm before I was born to convert it into a private airstrip. He was obsessed with planes. He had a Cessna 195 which was a beast of a plane and leaked oil all over the windshield every time we went up. Every weekend we'd fly to an airshow or convention. Some weekends we'd just fly to a random airport in the middle of nowhere to eat brunch. My father was an aviation guru. My dad knew airplanes. Every plane that flew over he'd identify it ""that's an aeronca"", ""that's a beechcraft bananza"". I knew almost every plane by age 7 and could identify them from quite a range out. At any rate, one evening we were by the pool. I was round 8/9 years old. Remember, this was a 60 acre farm converted into an airstrip. Our closest neighbor was about 300 yards away. We notice a disc hovering above the house. It was clearly a disc, no sound, standing still, and dashed lights around the leading edge. My dad, who's very cool and a typical pilot, didn't get excited, but sat there and said ""i have no idea what that is"". It sat there for a minute or two and then went from zero to nth in less than a second. I recently asked my mom about it to confirm my memory wasn't faulty due to me being so young at the time (this happened nearly 30 years ago). She's an uber-fundamentalist christian. She said: ""that was the weirdest thing I've seen. It had to be the work of satan."" Based on that response from the type of person she is, I don't think it was a childhood delusion, and my father, who I deeply respect as an aviator, was perplexed as well. 

I know no conclusions can be drawn from posts like these. Take it at face value. This is a myth in my personal family. I saw it; my dad saw it; my mom saw it. I tell my kids about it, but when I do so the story becomes nothing more than myth. So I'm dumping this story on the interwebs.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_101xvh,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/101xvh/i_grew_up_in_an_aviation_family_heres_a_sighting/,

This doesn't seem have made the news anywhere since Greer has just been tweeting the updates. His twitter is https://twitter.com/DrStevenGreer and I thought I'd post some of his tweets regarding the little Alien they found in Chile that's gonna be in 'Sirius.' Tweets are in chronological order.

""Breaking News:Atacama humanoid has human DNA AND unmatched DNA! Skeletal form still unexplained. Who are we? What is this? Still a mystery.""

""@sparks3747 It absolutely is not a spider monkey or any other primate. It is human +. Whatever that is.""

""So this is human + - whatever that is. Definitely a child, not a fetus, not a spider monkey - and EXTRA DNA unexplained. Weirder than ever!""

""2 million base pairs of DNA DO NOT MATCH human DNA- and yet much matches human DNA. Hybrid? Much work to do yet. It is not so simple...""

""Next week: Major University report release on skeletal findings. Hint: NO known human mutation or form or dwarfism. World's top expert says""

""Scientists identity to be announced next week. Stay tuned. http://www.SiriusDisclosure.com""

""Breaking News: Atacama Humanoid: 10% of DNA ""not matching"" according to top scientists/labs. More than just DNA ""junk"": Reports next week.""

""FYI: Neanderthals are 99.5% identical to human; Chimps: 96-97 %. Atacama humanoid skeletal findings not matching w known human mutations etc""

""...Movie is locked- DNA results will take another 6-12 months for more- this is complex.""

""This will remain an unknown humanoid. We need an expedition to the Atacama desert, where I understand there may be more of these beings.""

""None of the genetic markers for the skeletal system we see (http://www.SiriusDisclosure.com ) are present in the DNA analysis to date. Strange.""

""The big story on the Atacama humanoid is the clinical medical one- much more so than the genetic one. The report is amazing- releasing soon.""

""We cannot state the Atacama humanoid is ET. But it is not any form of human ever seen. It lived for years on earth. It is not a fetus. So?!""

""I do not personally have the specimen. It is in an institute in another country outside of the US.""

""Claim the Atacama humanoid is a 15-20 week fetus: Nonsense - Google X rays of that and see the difference vs those in Sirius trailer. No way""

""CT Scan shows internal organs- specimen most certainly not a hoax- although we do not know WHAT it is! Humanoid, but no known human defect""

""It is NOT a fetus. The rest is partially true- found in Chile, now in Spain.""

""About a year of manual DNA analysis is needed and a proper expedition to the Atacama desert to see if there are more beings.""


So.. I like that Greer is staying factual here. It can't be said that it's an ET at this point, however, the medical report apparently concludes that it is unlikely human, plus there is the 10% of unknown DNA. That raises some possibilities, taking for granted that it's not a fake or a deformed human:

- hybrid
- extraterrestrial humanoids have DNA extremely similar to ours because that is how humanoids and life arise in the universe
- there is truth the ancient alien intervention theory, and they created us 'in their image'
- panspermia

**Update with my impressions**

**I posted comments with my full notes for each speaker.**

While I'd never been to a UFO event before, I assumed there would be some high strangeness people there. After I got my seat and set about trying to talk to the speakers during the reception a woman sitting near my group gave the unsolicited observation that redheads are the result of genetic experiments done by aliens. The friends I had dragged along with me found that quite funny. I counted two tinfoil hats in the room.

During the Q&amp;A many people would ramble at excruciating length about their experiences or ""the truth"" before trying to wrap up with a question. I was not at all prepared for the intensity and unruliness of the audience at this point. This was extremely frustrating for me. I would have preferred to see the speakers talk amongst themselves or take moderated questions. I strongly think that if a UFO event is going to take questions from the audience, those questions should be written down and a moderator should take the best ones. Far too many of the ""questions"" were really rants. At one point a woman even addressed her question to another woman who had asked a prior question! This to me was disrespectful and a waste of my time. I didn't pay to hear the opinion of everyone who bought a ticket. 

I also do have to admit that when I got called on to ask a question, I did not take one from Reddit. OP did not deliver. Most of the questions here were answered implicitly given the speakers' talks and answers to similar questions. Others could be answered by having a basic familiarity with the speakers. I almost went with the question about the Roswell chapter in the new Area 51 book because it was so germane. But I confess that the Q&amp;A session was so hectic by this point that I felt it would be irresponsible to bring up Roswell, given that thus far even with all the speculation and accusations getting thrown around it hadn't come up yet. 

The question I asked was, ""In an ideal world where you have the resources you want, what should a modern UFO investigation look like."" I wanted something open-ended, and I particularly wanted something that Col. Friend could answer. Col. Alexander got me for my wording, pointing out that it's unrealistic to expect anyone to invest serious resources in a scientific study of UFOs because the government simply doesn't consider them a priority. Col. Halt said, ""It already exists,"" referring to the control group he had discussed. 

But the attendees were pretty much what you'd expect. There were tourists who had happened into the Museum and stayed for the event, people who had personally UFO experiences and wanted a forum to voice them, many people who looked like current or ex-military, a few new age-y looking people, and some members of the UFO media. 

There were a lot of cameras. I was  wrong about the no videography rule being enforced, but because there were more than a dozen cameras and microphones I could see I didn't want to spend the whole time fiddling with my computer just to get a very low quality recording. I assume the audio and/or video will end up online, though I'm too exhausted to go digging for them now. I imagine someone can find a link in the coming days.

**TL,DR**

**It was a bit of a circus, but there were lots of interesting details in my opinion. I didn't directly ask all of Reddit's questions, but I hope you can agree that what I have reported more or less addresses many of the questions anyway.**",,False,self,t5_2qhds,1348510018.0,,,True,t3_10bevp,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/10bevp/in_three_hours_the_national_atomic_testing/,

It has often been referred to as the Nazi Henge or the Flytrap. Many debunkers have stated that it was simply the supports for a long demolished water tower. 

Fine that could be the answer HOWEVER look at the two google maps links below.

The Dugway proving ground has often been referred to as Area-52 as the security is just as tight here as at Area-51 in Nevada.

Zoom out to verify the locations. 

Not saying they are connected in any way, but just pointing out their existence. They even both seem to have the same number of verticals, if I am counting correctly.

I then said that i would love to be able to see a UFO some day and, out of nowhere, he comes out with a story of having seen one about 20 years ago, during his first marriage. 

He said they that he and his wife were driving home on a major highway when they, and a bunch of other motorists, saw something that was about the size of multiple football fields, flying very slowly and shaped like a ""backwards guitar."" I asked him if there were lights or anything else and he said no, it was made of something that looked like dark grey metal and there were no windows or lights, just this big metallic-looking craft shaped like a backwards guitar.

Then, of course, I asked him why he had never told me before (because I've definitely talked about UFOs before, at least a handful of times) and he said ""I've never told anyone."" I asked why, and he said something to the effect of ""I'm not sure. Something jogged my memory tonight. I never thought of it before tonight."" So I asked him what he and his wife said to each other at the time, and what the other motorists said. He said that nobody said a word. They all got out of their cars (he estimates between 30 to 50 cars were pulled over and they watched for about 20 minutes) and when it had finally passed, they all just got back in their cars and left, one by one. I asked how it was possible that nobody said one word, and he said that he felt he had seen something almost ""religious"" and that he assumes the others felt the same way, including his wife, and that words were not necessary.

I joined Reddit to share this story because I feel it's important. I wonder if any other people, maybe even large groups of people, have seen something and somehow ""never think of it"" for years until their memory is jogged. I also wonder if there is more to the story, and he just hasn't remembered it yet.
For the record, this is a guy with about zero interest (as long as I've known him anyway) in the subject of UFOs or anything that might be considered paranormal.

I was on the Skywatch International mailing list as well as other Internet forums. I wouldn't dare to count all the UFO-related books I've bought over the years. But after a while I just grew weary of of it all. You start to think one person might have some truth and then you find out he was debunked. This process repeats itself over and over. Bob Lazar is a good example. When you listen to him speak, he sounds totally legit. He doesn't in any way come across as someone who is lying, yet the science behind his claims doesn't add up. Then you run across someone like Boyd Bushman who seems absolutely legit, and he seems to think Lazar is the real deal. Does that mean both are off base?

For a while I was really into Richard Hoagland's stuff, but then he turned out to be a flaming nutball, too. The list of people I can't get a handle on is long: Colonel Corso, Steven Greer, Michael Wolf, Stan Friedman, John Lear, Boyd Bushman, J. Allen Hynek, Whitley Strieber, etc. 

It used to be that people could easily make up stories. With the advent of high quality CGI on personal computers, people can very easily create fake pictures and videos to go along with their fake stories.

You don't need *belief* to know that UFOs exist.  When you bring belief into it, what you are really trying to say is ""I believe UFOs are actually piloted by an unknown intelligence""  which, obviously, none of us can prove at this time.  You can *believe* that if you will, but you simply can't prove that the way UFOs have been proven to exist.  Small steps, people.  Small steps.

My mind isn't made up on the subject, but I'm fascinated by mysteries and have spent a fair amount of time in the past researching UFOs/Aliens. Good stuff.

So, for what it's worth - here's a story. I was with some extended family last week and talked with my Uncle-in-law and found out he used to be with the department of defense for a number of years (in aviation-related departments). So, naturally, I'm like ""this guy has to know some stuff."" I tried to probe him (pun) for information throughout the evening and came out with some interesting stuff.

First off he told me very absolutely that we're not alone.

He recounted a story about an occasion when he was at an air force base and witnessed a visiting saucer-ufo for several minutes along with 600 fellow military/DoD persons. It hovered at low altitude then took off. They were then debriefed and told this never happened (he said he was able to share this one story because the story about it broke out about 20 years later and it was ok to comment on it). 

He confimed that we have crazy interesting and involved underground bases dealing with this stuff (he's been to them).

He told me if I wanted to know where to look, research Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He said that's where the hub is, so to speak. 

EDIT: Just for fun... I wanted to let you know I even told him ""Well, if you were to tell me, for example, that there were Shmaliens from the planet Shmupiter... then technically you wouldn't be breaking your vow."" He wouldn't go for it.

Also, we had another totally unrelated conversation that's just as interesting to me regarding a family heir-loom that my uncle lost. My dad had told me about it a number of times, but this same Uncle-in-law Bob was actually around my grandparents house more often and knew more about it than anyone else did. I thought about adding the details here but it just felt like you guys wouldn't buy it coming from the same guy (like, ""who is this guy?""). I may put the other story on reddit later (it involves a very valuable Abraham Lincoln text).

There was a little more, but that's about all I could get out of him (he's not able to say much more). But he also very seriously told me that if he were to share all of what he knows that it would blow my mind/I wouldn't believe it.

The BBC interview, which isn't that much more illuminating than the article, can be found [here](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/wswf/wswf_20130104-1400b.mp3), and starts at 16.55 in.

I decided to do some digging and I came across [this](http://i.imgur.com/5LkSd.gif) clipping from the French newspaper Le Monde, published on page 16 of the October 29 , 1954 edition. Here is a translation:

&gt;""FLYING DISCS"" INTERRUPT A SOCCER GAME 
&gt;
&gt;From our special correspondant 
&gt;JEAN D'HOSPITAL 
&gt;
&gt;Rome, October 28. 
&gt;
&gt;For one week one has seen a little everywhere these mysterious machines with scintillating colors by day and night, in the clouds or at ground level. They seem to take pleasure particularly in the center of the peninsula. They pullulate between Rimini and Pisa, on Sienna, Perugia, Bologna and Florence. 
&gt;
&gt;Testimonys of people in good faith who saw them - sailors who do not daydream, professors who doubt the plurality of the inhabited worlds, middle-class and proletarian with solid nerves - amount per hundreds and are impressive by their agreement and their precision. Well, rather, they amounted per hundreds up to now. Since yesterday they are much more. 
&gt;
&gt;A friendly soccer game proceeded Wednesday afternoon at the stadium of Florence in front of an assembly of approximately fifteen thousand witnesses. In the full middle of the game, at 4 p.m. exactly, three people suddenly stood up in a platform and, pointing the finger towards the sky, exclaimed: ""discs!"" 
&gt;
&gt;Immediately, row by row, the noses rose. No mistake it was really discs. They passed very high and very quickly while projecting a yellow gleam. The entire stadium remained dumbfounded about it. 
&gt;
&gt;The two discs and others still, which were seen by many residents of Florence circulating in the streets of the city, left in their wake trails of threads of coton-like substance, extremely thin. 
&gt;
&gt;In Rome the Florentin episode caused some surprise. One interviewed scientists of all obedience there in their pointing out that as phenomenon of collective illusion - if that was all about - it is a record, at least with regard to the stunt-flyings of the supposed Martians. One of them stated to us: 
&gt;
&gt;""It is nothing. A million bipeds healthy of bodies and mind, gathered in a restricted space, are not safe from such an illusion."" 
&gt;
&gt;However, if you had been in Florence, you, and if, well, you had seen what they saw, would you speak with as much certainty? 
&gt;
&gt;Oh! As for myself, answered the man of science, is quite simple: I wisely decided, in cold blood, that if it sometimes happens to me to see that, I would not believe my eyes. 


[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpCXkB-dLP8) is an 8-minute youtube video from an Italian tv presentation on the topic from 2008. Sadly it's in Italian, but there are original images from around the 04:20 mark.

And here are [two](http://i.imgur.com/YWvZt.jpg) [scans](http://i.imgur.com/i7M6h.jpg) of an Italian magazine that ran the story in 2000. It's also in Italian, no translation.

This apparently came at a time when there were multiple sightings around southern Europe, and several more in Italy before this event. A poorly translated link I found talks about the silvery dust or angel hair which came down:

&gt;At 14.30 on 27 October 1954 in the writing of the newspaper came the call for an engineering student, Alfredo Jacopozzi that held view, along with others, several discs flying in the sky of Florence. At one stretch between the object and the dome of the cathedral there was another ""white balloon,"" faster than an airplane, then another ""disc"" and another still. Six objects left their strange passage of the ""flakes"" white like “cotton-like”. 
Then came the most glaring whose memory is still fresh in the minds of many witnesses who see the phenomenon. 

&gt;The substance was quick to disintegrate if held in the hand. Alfrede Jacopozzi, a student, was the only one who managed to pick up a few threads of it and sealed them in a hermetic test tube. Jacopozzi then handed the tube to Professor Giovanni Canneri, a director of the Chemical Analysis Institute under the University of Florence. Professor Danilo Cozzi, a colleague of Prof. Canneri’s, carried out a series of tests of the mysteries find. “It’s a fibrous material, which is highly resistant to tension and torsion. Once subjected to heat action, the material grows dark and evaporates, leaving transparent sediment that melts away. The sediment was found to contain boron, silicon, and magnesium. Hypothetically speaking, the substance may be some kind of boron-silicon glass,” said Prof. Cozzi. 

The images of the alleged silvery threads are found [here](http://i.imgur.com/Xh8vg.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/fn0kr.jpg).

An incredibly intriguing sighting that has rarely been spoken about. I hope more comes from this BBC article.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,1357482566.0,,,True,t3_1625ys,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1625ys/27_october_1954_the_day_ufos_hovered_over_a/,

It was around 9:15pm CST in Northwest Iowa - roughly around mid August, 2010. My colleague(also best friend at the time) and I were driving home from where we worked. He was driving, and as usual - I was gazing at the stars. I happened to notice two blinks of light travelling parallel to each other. For a split second, I thought they were satellites, but they were moving faster than the usual satellites that I normally would see, and as  I said - they were parallel to each other which is abnormal. Immediate speculation led us to pull over to the side of the highway to check it out. They crossed the entire sky span within a matter of about 3 minutes. Then they stop and start going back the way they came. I immediately knew this was my first UFO encounter- so I'm ecstatic. I then look in the distance to where they were traveling towards, and I see two more identical blinks of light travelling in the same parallel pattern going towards the first two. As soon as they meet up, it seemed as if they were very low in our atmosphere, about 500-800ft above ground level. They sit there and do nothing for about 1-2 minutes. Then it happened.... They took turns glowing an Orange/Red color. As soon as the first one would turn off its glowing light, the next one would start glowing. Each only about 1 second each. Out of no where, there were two more. A total of 6 UFO's hovering above the road we were on, taking turns emitting their welcoming light. I start freaking out - I'm literally punching my friend saying, "" ARE YOU FUCKING SEEING THIS?!?!?"". I call 911 and let them know what was going on, and he proceeds to tell me that I should report it to the county I am in - he gives me the number for the local PD, and before I hang up, he askes, "" How is it?"" I replied, "" Simply incredible"". The local PD unfortunately didn't take me seriously and most likely didn't even go on record. By this time, there was an older couple on a motorcycle with us watching these UFO's glow. In one final, brilliant moment - they all lit up with this beautiful color. They then started drifting away to the south, again taking turns emitting light until I could not see them anymore. We then drive back home going East. The motorcycle couple who were traveling in the same direction flashed their lights at us, so we pulled over. We see them again - but very far away south, doing their light show again. We sit there for about 15 minutes trying to see more. All of a sudden, we hear something. Which was strange considering we heard NO NOISE at all during this UFO encounter. There were now 6 fighter jets circling the sky in the exact areas where we saw the UFO's. Simply amazing, and I will never forget this incredible moment in my life.

Not exactly physical evidence that would satisfy a hardcore sceptic, but not something to be dismissed out of hand either.

So here's my question: What are some other examples of ufo sightings, contact, or abductions where the contactee was a trusted/reputable person with a lot to lose? (pilots, senators, high ranking military officials, etc). Are there any good examples where someone who was previously a hardcore sceptic was forced to reconsider their position through a personal experience? What about people who saw something they couldn't explain but refused to recant their story and lost their jobs, family, friends, etc?

**Travis Walton Abduction**

**When** 1975 (corrected)

**Note** Movie 'Fire In The Sky' was based on this event.

**Summary**
American logger who claims to have been abducted by a UFO on November 5, 1975, while working with a logging crew in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. After spotting the UFO in a truck, Walton leaped out and ran toward the disc. The others said they shouted at Walton to come back but he continued toward the disc. The men in the truck reported that Walton was nearly below the object when the disc began making noises similar to a loud turbine.

It was concluded after a polygraph test that the team were telling the truth, and the exam results were conclusive. Clark quotes from Gilson's official report: ""These polygraph examinations prove that these five men did see some object they believed to be a UFO, and that Travis Walton was not injured or murdered by any of these men on that Wednesday"". If the UFO was fake, Gilson thought, ""five of these men had no prior knowledge of it"".

It will be be backed by former members of Congress.,110,13,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1dch9m/there_is_going_to_be_a_un_resolution_drafted_to/,"It was suggested by one of the former Congress members running the panel in the Citizen's Hearing on Disclosure to Dolan, Sheehan and company to draft a UN Resolution request (?) to form a global group to study all aspects of the UFO phenomenon/interaction. Let's follow this story and see if the resolution gets denied. We may learn a lot about the United Nations. Remember, veto powers are the US, Russia, China, UK, France, and sometimes Germany - three of which have recently been outspoken on the phenomenon. 

Here is the link to the Hearing, I'll give 199 of you my code (I only have 200 views).

***HEY GUYS/GALS THANKS FOR THE ENTHUSIASM BUT I HAD TO DELETE THE CODE AS I HAVE REACHED THE MAXIMUM 200 VIEWS. I BOUGHT A NEW ONE AND AM SHARING IT AGAIN BECAUSE I AM JUST A GREAT GUY. THIS IS THE CODE: TDR82MLJK***

***Stan Friedman is now going over a slide presentation of physical trace evidence, with plenty of pictures I have never seen before. Very compelling. He is going beyond the craft theories and speaking more on evidence of the crafts' occupants. Now speaking on Barney and Betty Hill case.***

***Ok friends my 400 views were used up (great!) so If I do buy another stream I will post the code here shortly so you all can watch the primetime. I was at work all day so I have not been able to watch but there are some other great front page posts on this so I'll get recapped there.***

(yes, I paid 3.80 for the week-live stream and it is amazing) 


**EDIT 1:** FUCK WHERE THE FUCK DID GREER COME FROM (Let's try not to discount his presence and look past the conspiracy theories, albeit difficult.)


**EDIT 2:** Ok, Ok. Not talking about the EBE. I'll listen. He's talking about 911, defense contracts, important foreign cases, etc. Although he did just drop a small promotion under his breath for Sirius; ""Come see Sirius tonight at 8pm..."". IMO this National Press Club disclosure hearing blows his documentary out of the water in terms of professionalism and organization and Greer knows it. 


**EDIT 3**: Canadian researcher Grant Cameron is now speaking on multibillionaire Laurence Rockefeller's request to the CIA and American Gov't on the UFO phenomenon. This is getting very interesting. I have never heard of this case before. Apparently Rockefeller threatened to write an open letter to the Clinton Administration and have it run in large ad format in every public newspaper available if a report was not released.


**EDIT 4 (DAY 2)**: New Code for use. Another 200 views for r/ufos. Now Sgt. James Penniston and other former Military officers are talking about craft contact experiences. Stream is going well for me so far. Stanton Friedman sitting in the background looking stern and calculated! Great to see this event brought out some heavy-hitters.

**EDIT 5**: Friedman just finished his presentation and he was on point! Much more defiant than he usually is. After they cut the footage he left his plant mic on and was talking to someone. He was being asked about Phil Corso and basically stated that Corso greatly over-exaggerated his credentials and sources (until he realized his mic was still on!) Grant Cameron is on now. Cameron made a great point: apparently on the front page of the Washington Post today, the big headline is that one of the Wizards' players is gay. I think that goes to show that this has already been condemned from public press as this is clearly a huge event happening in the White Houses' backyard. 



 **Witness testimony goes from 7pm-10pm EST (Remember folks, this event goes until May 3rd - Stay Tuned). Let's try to look at this in a positive light! It is a big step, regardless of certain questionable attendees.**

He has practically no exposure to television, so it surprised me when his statements seemed to fit within some of the folk-lore surrounding UFOs. Here is our conversation as best I can remember:

-	he asked me, “Is there an airplane in our house?” 
-	“Are you talking about your toy airplanes?” I replied.
-	“No, a real airplane.”
-	“No honey, a real airplane wouldn’t fit in our house.” 
-	“But I saw one come through the window.”
-	“Really; what did it look like?” 
-	“It was a fire-airplane.”
-	“I never heard of a fire-airplane, what does that look like?” 
-	“It was an airplane with so much fire.”
-	“Hmm.. What color was the airplane?”
-	“White.”
-	“What color was the fire?”
-	“Yellow.”
-	“What shape was the airplane?”
-	“A circle.”
-	“What shape are other airplanes?”
-	“I don’t know.”
-	“Are they a circle?”
-	“No.”
-	“But what shape was the fire-airplane?”
-	“A circle.”
-	“Was it bigger or smaller than the table?”
-	“Smaller.”
-	“Was it bigger or smaller than your kids table?”
-	“Bigger.”
-	“And it was flying in the sky?”
-	“Yeah, but it came through the window into my room”
-	“Did it fly around in your room?”
-	“No, it just hang out.”
-	“Was there people in the fire-airplane?”
-	“No, there was too much fire.”
-	 “Was there fire in your room?’
-	“No, just outside.”
-	“Was the fire all over the airplane or did it come out of the top or bottom or sides?”
-	“It came out of the bottom.” 
-	 “Was it in your room for a short time or a long time?”
-	“A long time. I couldn't get it out.”
-	“What did you do to try to get it out?”
-	“I went like this” (shows hand gestures pushing away) “but it didn’t work.”
-	“So how did it finally leave?” 
-	“I blow on it.” (blows air)
-	“You blew on it and it went away?”
-	“Yeah.”
-	“Was it dark outside?” 
-	“Yeah.”
-	“Do you think you might have been sleeping?”
-	“No, I was awake.”
-	“Honey, sometimes when you are asleep you don’t know it, and you see things in your sleep that seem totally real. It’s called a dream, it seems real but it is not.”
-	“It was real.”
-	“What do you think it wanted?”
-	“I think it wanted to get into my bed but it couldn’t”
-	“Why couldn't it.”
-	“It couldn't move.”
-	“Why did it want to get into your bed?” 
-	“Maybe it wanted to play with my toys.”

In the second clip, a saucer shaped UFO is seen flying beside the plane, emerging from a cloud and then dropping down into another cloud. Skip ahead to 6:18

Following right after is an enormous cylindrical UFO that suddenly accelerates as the plane flies towards it. 

After that there is an interview with a Military Official that says that two Soviet MIGs were sent up to chase after a UFO, when they couldn't identify, they were given orders to shoot it down and then shortly afterwards, both MIGs were shot down by an unknown weapon.

Some of the other footage in this documentary is questionable including the footage of the Soviet Military investigating a crashed flying saucer and an Alien Autopsy.

1366596789.0,88,self.UFOs,1cu6ns,George Knapp's Update on Bob Lazar.,109,21,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1cu6ns/george_knapps_update_on_bob_lazar/,"I thought /r/UFOs would be interested to know what's been happening lately. Investigative reporter [George Knapp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Knapp_%28journalist%29) gave an update on the whereabouts of and his thoughts on the notorious [Bob Lazar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar) on last week's episode of [The Paracast](http://www.theparacast.com/podcast/april-14-2013-george-knapp/). Transcript runs for 27 minutes from ~1:15:00 to ~1:42:00. 

**Reader Question:** *Is Lazar still active in making his claims about his encounters at Area 51?*

**Knapp:** No, and he hasn't been for a long time. I mean, he did it with me, he did a couple of other interviews back there, it'll be 25 years next year. It was November of 1989 when we first revealed who he was. May of 1989 was when we did the first interview with him--blacked out silhouette as Dennis, and so twenty-five years next year. He did those interviews then, he did a couple more after that. But basically, he hates every bit of it. He didn't like UFOs before he got into the program, he doesn't like them since. 

I saw Bob two months ago, he came to town, first time he's been to Las Vegas in--I dunno, eight or nine years--and it was nice to see him. It was nice to talk about something other than Area 51 or S-4 or flying saucers. 

But he's quite happy to have left that all behind. Has no interest in talking about it at all. I think I'm gonna try to have to coax him into talking about it for the 25^th anniversary, but, with Bob, it always depends on the mood he's in, you know. 'Cause he is the most reluctant UFO messiah you've ever run into. 

**Q:** *Has Lazar shown any actual proof of his claims?*

**Knapp:** Well, I guess it depends on what you consider to be proof. You know, I've had that question before. If there was nothing to it, I can tell you that I wouldn't have spent 24 years working on it. But there's lots of proof. I don't know what proof people would need. I guess it's whatever would convince a reasonable person that something is true or real. And I think that Bob and his claims have met that many times over. 

Alright, the first thing that Bob knew was where the tests were gonna take place. He took people out on a Wednesday night, three weeks in a row, different groups of people--and each time, this saucer-like craft came up over the mountains in the area of where he said S-4 was, the place where he worked. This big glowing object that performed maneuvers, then it'd go back down. And you have to ask yourself, ""Well, there have been no stories about Wednesday night UFOs; how did he know?"" The tests were the last time they'd videotaped this thing, and I've shown the tape on the air a couple of times; how did he know?

Secondly, how did he know there was a place called S-4? There's no reported incidents of anybody referring to a place called S-4, and yet, it really is a true place; I've confirmed it with Dulles Air Force Base, it really did exist. 

Thirdly, he knew about something called the ""OFI"". He said at first, he thought he had a background investigation by the FBI, and then he found a card for the guy who had come to question him during his security clearance, and it was a guy named Mike Thigpen for an agency he called ""OFI"", which I'd never heard of, and I've been here a long time, but ""OFI"", in fact, is the Office of Federal Investigations. They do background checks for people who went to work at Dulles Air Force Base and (*at*?) the Nevada Test Site. And Mike Thigpen really turned out to be a guy who worked for them. 

How did Bob know? How did he know about the inner workings of Area 51, how you got there? And I've had a couple of people who worked out there, who put him through their cases, and asked him questions, not about, like, ""Where are the saucers?"", but they'd ask him questions about, ""Where's the cafeteria?"", ""What color's the paint?"", ""How do you pay for your meals?"", that kind of stuff, and he passed. He also passed a polygraph--four of them. We did one examination--and I'm just telling you, Gene, **[Gene Steinberg is a co-host of the Paracast]** I've lived near this stuff, and it was *weird*. It was a weird time, it was a scary time. 

We were being followed around, our phones were tapped. They were really messing with Bob. There were break-ins of his house--a couple of times when he'd come home, they'd been in, messing with his house, they'd wipe things off of his blackboard, move things around. One time he goes to the gym with a friend, he's got a *gun*, he was carrying a weapon in his glove-box. He comes out, the doors to his car are open, the windows are down, the glove-box is open, and there's the gun just sitting there. It wasn't a burglary, it was
somebody just messing with him.

I've been to his house when he'd get home, and he was all kinda freaked out, and there he is walking around with an Uzi, ready for trouble. This stuff was real--it was really going on, and it's hard to convey to people who weren't there, what it was like, but it was a really intense time. 

**Gene Steinberg:** *I gather from talking to you, very quickly here, George, is that you believe Bob Lazar.*

**Knapp:** Well, I do. I believe him to this extent. I believe he's telling the truth as he knows it. I don't know that it's an objective truth, I don't know that everything that he read in these briefing documents are real as opposed to something he was being fed, because they figured he would go ahead and leak it to somebody. I suspect that that might be it. I suspect that he, in a sense, might have been really qualified. He's not a PhD, he's not the most qualified scientist in the world, but he's a really bright guy, who has eclectic interests--hookers and machine guns and explosives and stuff--that's just quirky enough that he'd be easy to discredit. He had a financial interest in a brothel for a time. And then he got hooked up with an *illegal* brothel, so eventually, they were able to discredit him, get him in legal trouble, and push him down the road. 

But he knew a heck of a lot of stuff that nobody else had ever said before, that we now know is true. He also passed a polygraph. I took him to this guy, Terry Tabernetti--he's still the head of a major security operation for a major casino. He does polygraph tests on employees to make sure that they're screened and they're proper to work there. He put Bob Lazar through the ringer on the central questions: ""Did you see flying saucers?"", ""Were they in these hangers?"", ""Did you deal with element 115?"", and Bob passed. And it wasn't a close call, it was flat out pass. Four of these exams. How did he do it?

By the way, Terry Tabernetti, months later, had a break-in to his house, and the only thing they took were those polygraph test results. He's a former police officer, a credible guy, his name is well known here in this town, and I think his testimony goes a long way. So how did Bob know? 

And here's the last bit of proof. And I don't know if it persuades your listeners or not, but Bob got into trouble with these hookers. You know, he came to me one night, he said, ""By the way, I met this hooker and I helped her set some security gear and some cameras up in her little brothel, and by the way, this brothel's on the same street where you live."" I said, ""What?!"" I mean, my professional life is flashing before my eyes, I'm thinking, ""Oh my God, here goes my career, I'm gonna crash and burn,"" I said, ""You can't be serious."" I said, ""Let me see it, I don't believe it. Let me see it."" And he showed me this place. I said, ""You gotta shut this down now."" He said, ""The cops already know about it""--a couple of these vice-detectives know this hooker, she had been in business for years.

I said, ""You gotta shut it down anyway. You know you're being followed around. Somebody's gonna break this open."" You've gotta do it and I've gotta do it before they do, so I called the police. I told him, ""Look, it's gonna be shut down."" They decided to bust Bob anyway. Back in those days, not a whole lot of pimps got busted in Las Vegas, not a whole lot of hookers either, but they looked at Bob like public enemy number one! Parole and probation, grilled him about his background and this is the time, if you're the UFO conman, this is the time you come clean because he told them the same story he told me. Where he had worked, where he'd gone to school, who he worked for, what he did. And he was looking at serious time. They recommended that he do more than a year in prison because they were mad at him. They thought, ""This guy's lying to us. He's told us all this stuff,"" and then, gradually, some other things happened. 

Congressman Bill Bray *(sp?)* from Nevada, tried to help me get information that would help his case. He said, ""I've never run into a case like this. The FBI told me that he's a real guy, but I have no need to know about what his background is."" That's what they told the Congressman. You know, a lot of things like that. If Bob were a liar, that was the time to come clean, and in fact, he stuck to his story. I don't expect people to believe it. 

I have problems with some of it myself. For example, his educational claims. But do you throw the whole thing out? If you believe that he's lying about his education, do you throw the whole thing out? Do you ignore all the other kinds of proof that he came up with? You know, there's people like Stanton Friedman, who I respect a great deal, who did research on their own after the story came out, and, ""Aha! Bob wasn't at Los Alamos labs! He doesn't have a degree."" I reported that in the very first story--the very first story that mentioned Bob's name, we reported that, and let the cards fall where they may. 

I think he's telling the truth. As he knows, is it the absolute objective truth? I don't know about that. It's more complicated.

**Co-host Commentary:** Well, just the thing about the degree bothers me because, let me give you an example here, just I guess last year or the year before that, we learned that one prominent UFO paranormal researcher, Phil Imbrogno had fake degrees. His degrees were not real. We exposed that fact with the help of one of our regular listeners. So, that of course ended that guy's career. But the question being here, now we have Lazar, supposedly we can't verify his educational claims. And when you see things like that you have to say, ""Well, wait a minute, if this guy's not telling the truth about his education, why believe anything he says?"" And is it really possible, for example, for intelligence experts to wipe away a person's entire educational history? 

**Knapp:** Well, if you ask my opinion, I don't think those degrees are real. I've been his friend for a long time, I've given the opportunity to answer that, I said, ""Look Bob, this is a good time to come clean on this, if you a told a fib in order to get a job,"" and the fact is, he would not be the first person to exaggerate his credentials or background in order to get a great job. And he has never taken me up on the opportunity.

I always thought--the problem I have with Bob's claims about getting those degrees is--to get a degree at a place like CalTech or MIT, you have to take other classes, you know. You can't just take science classes, which is what he's good at. You have to take literature. I couldn't imagine Bob sitting through World Lit 101--

1363004431.0,85,self.UFOs,1a2tja,My experience with alien entity,124,39,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1a2tja/my_experience_with_alien_entity/,"It was at night. I was woken up ( don't remember that part ). I was standing in front of a barely open doors. They were made partially of glass so I could see through them.

I was staring at them and knew what was going to happen. He was going to visit me. Now I couldn't tell you consciously who he was but I've just felt his presence.

He floated or had this strange way of walking in a fluid way. It seemed like he just levitated to me. First I could see his big, white head which had a strangely flat profile.

He approached me. His face was no more than 30 centimetres from mine.

He was a typical alien grey. But he was not short. I am 185cm and he was slightly higher than me.

He approached me so close that I couldn't really see anything else besides his big, black almond eyes. He stared at me, or through me. With each passing second I've felt like I was getting closer and closer to him. 

Now, immediately when he approached my face, he started doing something. I don't believe in ghosts but what he did I can only compare to eating my soul. I've felt like he took the deepest part of my very being.

He started showing me things, displaying feelings to me. It was so intense I couldn't really process it counsciously. It was dozens of different sensations, pictures of ending earth. He showed me why I was insignificant. I remember hearing hundredths of souls screaming as they couldn't handle the experience. He showed me what he did to them.

I wanted to turn my head from him but I couldn't. His head was attracting my sight like a strong magnet. I could see vibrations coming from around his head

When he wasn't projecting feelings to me, he was saying something to me, or maybe communicating thoughts. It will sound strange but he did not talk to me in a language yet I could hear his voice. It was the most powerful thing I've ever heard and it was inside of my head. His thoughts were so extremely well put.

I've tried to fight this entry into my head but I've never felt so overhelmed. I can compare it to dueling a modern computer in arithmethics using only abacus. 

Now I don't believe he was evil. What he has shown me was that we as a humanity are really not worth that much. He showed me my struggles, what I care for and then made me realise it's really insignificant. He projected to me that we are a part of a bigger scheme but we are truly redudant. They have a need for us but it's  just a part of their plan and they know many other worlds?

Next thing I remember, I woke up in the morning. I've told everyone about it. I've got bad looks but I know it was real. It was no dream. 

That guy was real and he's the most powerful being I've ever met/heard about. I haven't even seen such a powerful creature in any movie. He projected omnipotence and a deep sense of knowing.

What I also remember is that there were other beings like him but they really weren't separate. They either were different avatars of him or they formed a collective consciousness/had one purpose in mind. 

What I don't understand is why would he visit me and do those things? What purpose would that serve to anything?

It was 4 years ago but I still remember it vividly.

Sorry if this is not organized but I thought I would share with you

People always say something like aliens would be too big to cover up, and they're right. It is too big. But it's not a matter of no evidence. Out of the millions of UFO reports and footage, if even 0.1% were true, that would be enough witness testimony to win any court case in the world. Ive spent hours pouring over footage over the years, trying to decipher how much is bullshit, and for 99.99% of it, who knows. But theres that 0.01% that has the documentation to back it up. Honest testimony from multiple reputable witnesses in a professional setting.
It really bugs me that people are waiting for CNN to broadcast a UFO landing on the White House lawn before they even think twice about it. Waiting to find a body or a craft. Yet were so easy to dismiss video footage. Now don't get me wrong, the amount of sheep who eat up conspiracy/alien/UFO garbage is staggering. But the amount of sheep who refuse to investigate is also staggering. We're a strange bunch aren't we?
The reality is that we may not even be capable of interacting with them. We may not even exist in the same dimension. We really have no fucking clue what these things are but it's a phenomenon that has been around a lot longer than x-files.
What it comes down to, is that if it is superior civilization, it likely has superior tech that would put our entire current system to shame. We live in a world that revolves around the use of fossil fuels and big industry. Cheap alternative energy sources would mean that a lot of rich and powerful men would would loose lot of money and a lot of control. I hear a lot of people ask, ""Why would somebody invest so much in a cover up?"" Well, personally, I couldn't think of a better reason. There's no denying the existence of a the military industrial complex. What you get is oil/steel/weapons companies lobbying (bribing, blackmailing etc...) governments and militaries around the globe. So long as they can cover up the few shreds of cold, hard, physical evidence that exist, the skeptics and general population will ridicule away the rest.
I'm starting to second guess why I give enough of a fuck to even post this. Because really, I'm not trying to persuade anyone. But I think I'll just submit this now before I delete it.

But I should think that if you feel it worth it, your upvotes on the comment in question could help spread awareness on front page for the UFO mystery.

Basically in 1974 Carl Sagan along with Scientists from SETI (The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) sent out a message from the Arecibo radio telescope explaining human life and our understanding of our solar system. Then on the 21st August 2001 two new crop formations were reported near Chilbolton radio telescope in Hampshire, UK which seemed to be a direct response to this message. Now the important bit in which I found quite interesting was the alien message description of their solar system. It shares an uncanny resemblance to the resent discovery of the gliese-667c-solar-system.... Well you decide. Although it could be a massive coincidence or a pile of bullshit, these are my mornings research. Have a nice day.

Dr. Eric W. Davis, formerly a contract research physicist at [NASA's Breakthrough Propulsion Project](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp) which ran from 1996 through to 2002, gave a lecture in 2010 where he responded to the question of UFOs as they pertain to potential physics for traversable wormholes, warp drives, and anti-gravity. Sponsored by the [Society for Scientific Exploration](http://www.scientificexploration.org/), the lecture was about a then recently published book, [Frontiers of Propulsion Science](http://www.amazon.com/Frontiers-Propulsion-Progress-Astronautics-Aeronautics/dp/1563479567), regarding discoveries from the NASA project. After the lecture, during a question and answer session, one questioner asked whether, ""...properties of UFOs had guided the thinking and research of that initiative."" In responding to the question, Dr. Davis said, ""Secretly yes and overtly no.""

In giving a reason for the secrecy, he stated that, ""UFOs don't have credibility with mainstream academic researchers,"" and that, ""...policy makers and decision-makers in charge of funding and programatics ... don't want to hear the topic of UFOs. So, for the purpose of doing this officially, [we didn't bring in UFOs], but we did consider it under the table.""

Dr. Davis was a technical consultant to the NASA project. He obtained a PhD in Astrophysics from the University of Arizona in 1991, was a cofounder of a joint NASA-JSC's Advanced Deep Space Transport Technology Assessment group studying advanced propulsion physics, and has authored several papers on zero-point vacuum physics for propulsion as well as the potential of traversable wormholes.

Delving further into the subject, Dr. Davis noted that some members had, ""...looked at all the physical events and physical descriptions [of UFO data] provided by researchers such as [Jacques Vallee, George Hathaway, and the unnamed questioner]."" He described two events that took place at the NIDS Utah Ranch of, ""...one scientist and one researcher seeing a wormhole, what looked like a wormhole, with a creature crawling through."" In the second event, ""...the ranch owners had seen an opening in the sky in broad daylight with a triangular craft that came through it. Dr. Davis then compared these observations with known wormhole physics. ""...that's an example of data that indicates a wormhole involved. Geometry tells you what a wormhole looks like when it intersects our space. It appears as [an intensely bright] point of light and then, as the intersection gets larger and larger, it opens up and you begin to see the hole."" At that point, he noted, objects could traverse the wormhole.

NIDS Ranch refers to the National Institute for the Discovery of Science, more colloquially known as [Skinwalker Ranch](http://www.skinwalkerranch.org). A property situated near Ballard, Utah, it's known for historical UFO, cattle mutilation, and other paranormal legends. Reclusive billionaire Robert Bigelow bought it in 1996 as part of an effort to fund a long-term study of these claimed phenomena.

Discussing the matter of UFOs and warp drives, Dr. Davis stated that, ""We haven't seen performances that adhere to the warp drive because ... basically it's just between stars and we don't see UFOs warping anywhere. We see then doing ninety-degree turns and rapid motions. They disappear and reappear. That is undetermined yet.""

He finally commented on the matter of anti-gravity, ""...we have anti-gravity in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. ... There are aspects of anti-gravity, the properties of negative vacuum energy, that would create a repulsive force that allows something to levitate up. And UFOs do exhibit that.""

In explaining how, he referred to Dr. Hal Puthoff's Polarized Vacuum Model where, ""...instead of space-time [in traditional Relativity], you envision space-time as a polarized vacuum of a quantum zero point fluctuations. And, if you exert a field on that medium, the fluctuations are polarized, [and] that creates a space-time bending effect similar to warp drive and wormholes. We see that in aspects of what's predicted.""

The Breakthrough Propulsion Project was disbanded at NASA in 2002 due to funding shortfalls. Dr. Davis is now a research physicist at the Institute for Advanced Studies-Austin, and is CEO of the company Warp Drive Metrics. He’s published scholarly and speculative literature on such matters [quantum teleportation](http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/teleport.pdf), [traversable wormholes](http://www.scribd.com/doc/78712753/Eric-W-Davis-Wormhole-Stargates-Tunneling-Through-The-Cosmic-Neighborhood), and [advanced propulsion physics](http://alnaspaceprogram.org/papers/advanced%20propulsion%20study.pdf), commonly known as warp drive. He is currently scheduled to speak at the [2013 MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) symposium](http://www.mufonsymposium.org/speaker/dr-eric-w-davis-physicist/) on the topic of recent warp drive and wormhole research.

FULL TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS:

37m30s

**Audience Question:** Is there any thought to using the known properties of UFOs as a guide to your thinking and research?

**Dr. Eric W. Davis:** The answer is yes and no. Secretly, yes and overtly no.  Because the mainstream academics don’t like the topic of UFOs and they really don’t have any credibility with them, especially with policy-makers and decision-makers in charge of funding and programatics. They don’t want to hear the topics of UFOs. So, for the purpose of doing this officially [we didn’t bring in UFOs], but we did consider it under the table.

And yes, there is a subset of us who have looked at UFO data. And we’ve looked at all the physical events and physical descriptions that have been provided by investigators from Jacques Vallee to yourself, and whatnot, and George Hathaway and so forth. And we’ve been able to use that data as input to give us an idea, and that data does drive the concepts that we did derive later on [when we did] the book and went into the original NASA program. Like warp drives and wormholes. For example, at the NIDS Utah Ranch, where I used to work for Bob Bigelow for six years, we had the experience of one scientist and one investigator seeing a wormhole – what looked like a wormhole – with a creature crawling through, and then the ranch owners had seen an opening in the sky in broad daylight with a triangular craft that came through it. Well, that’s an example of data that indicates there’s a wormhole involved. I mean, geometry tells you what a wormhole looks like when it intersects our space. It appears as a very bright – intensely bright – point of light and then, as the intersection gets larger and larger, it opens up and you begin to see the hole. And, things would be going in and out of it. So, that’s an example of two datasets that we verified at the NIDS Utah Ranch that match what I know as a physicist what a wormhole would do.

Warp drives. We haven’t seen UFOs do performances that adhere to the warp drive, because the warp drive… basically it’s just between stars and we don’t see UFOs warping anywhere or warping around. We see them doing ninety degree turns and rapid motions; they disappear and reappear. That is undetermined yet. I would think that wormhole is a big possibility still. I’m trying to think of anything else. I would think that anti-gravity – we have anti-gravity in Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity and I cover that in my chapter in the book; one of my three chapters. There are aspects of anti-gravity, the properties of negative vacuum energy that would create a repulsive force that allows something to levitate up. And UFOs do exhibit that. So there’s Hal Putthoff’s Polarized Vacuum Model. It’s a different form of Relativity where instead of a space-time you envision space-time as a polarized vacuum of a quantum zero point fluctuations. And, if you exert a field on that medium, the fluctuations are polarized, that creates a space-time bending effect similar to warp drive and wormholes. So, we see that. We see that in aspects of what’s predicted.

Yes, *you.*

You are the reason that we are - every single day - becoming more and more able to bring this topic into every day discussion. Whether you're the monitor-tanned, hardened UFOlogist; the new-to-the-game enthusiast; the I-believe-every-batshit-nutty-conspiracy theorist; the late night erudite; or are on the fence altogether, YOU are what drives the furthering of societal acceptance of this issue. Even skeptics play a major role of keeping our heads straight in the murky waters of UFOlogy. It's a sensational topic; we need a solid reality check now and again.

We all play an integral part of the discoveries and revealings in the times to follow. We blaze the path to true understanding of this quirky and elusive yet complex and intrinsically philosophical issue. Don't give up now, though - I implore you.

As any of you have probably witnessed by now, we are at an interesting crossroads; anything can and will happen if we allow it.

We're all here for the same reasons: our unanswered questions about an area of interest. One that, we feel, is a legitimate and valid area of inquiry when defining our existence in the cosmos.

With the underwhelming fruit bore from the Mayan Calendar misinterpretations, we're left at an all-time low in the assumptions that we'll see any true disclosure or even recognition of such phenomena in the near future. It's disheartening - I know.

But really, things have changed. Well, at least for me they did - I told myself that my world *would* end on Dec. 21st and it did.

It wasn't akin to some sensationalist's misinterpretation of an old tablet, not even close. It was founded on the idea that with constant vigilance, challenges are overcome ever single day, so why not ones that affect everyone? I chose to start by creating 'my' new world; one of encouragement, compassion. A world of unity, shared vision, and progress. A world where we might live long enough to harness the cosmos in ways that we cannot now comprehend: ways only visible from our places in the compassion-devoid, consumerist, head-down, always overwhelmed, too-few-hours-in-the-day trainwreck of an ideal.

There's no *fucking way* intelligences which are capable of their (alleged or otherwise) advancements would behave the way we do to one another.

This is where you come in:
1. Be kind to your fellow enthusiast. He/she,no matter how naive or 'green,' will have a piece of the puzzle to provide. 
2. Be patient with your 'elder-UFOlogists.' Some have a large ego in this community based on either a swelling as a result of vast factual knowledge or, more commonly, pure arrogance/ignorance. Either way, they've probably got something to show you that will add to your stockpile of 'evidence.'

TL;DR - be kind, guys. We're all here to further our knowledge and answer questions. No one needs to nerd/rage-rant here. We're all furthering the field of study just by continuing to ask questions and dig.

**Feel free to downvote, call me a liar, and do whatever else, I'm just glad to know I saw what I saw.
And again, sorry for the hype and no delivery.**



Okay so my friend and I were sitting in his car having a coffee in Milton, Ontario Canada. We see this light infront of us, way off in the distance just floating and flashing green, orange, and white. It stayed in one spot, not moving to any side, away or towards us.

So we get out of the car and go walking a bit to see if we can see it any better, as soon as we got within a good view distance from the thing, it started to fade and then it was gone. 

We stayed standing in this field for about an hour. Seeing things that might have been planes or something else. Then we see these two bright lights flying almost together in the same direction and at a very fast speed.

After these pass, we turn and look to our left and what I saw blew my fucking mind. I'm still in awe at what I saw, and will have the image of this ship in my mind forever.

It was huge. and close. and fucking huge.
A4, A5, and B7 from this chart are exactly what it looked like.
[EDIT]  http://i.imgur.com/F5Kv0.jpg

It had very bright yellowish/orange lights with a red light moving back and forth.

I have always been a huge fan of The X-files, and believed in aliens, but now, I can honestly say that I have seen a ship. It's weird because I feel the need to not talk about because people will think I'm lying, or it was just a plane, or...something.

But I know what I saw, and my friend saw the exact same thing.
He tried getting some pictures on his phone camera, but I have no idea if they turned out, we didn't really check, our night was filled with high fives and a bunch of ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT""'s being yelled out.

If any of the pictures on his phone turned out I will update this!

Thanks for reading people!


**[EDIT] Still waiting for my friend to either wake up, or look at his phone, not answering facebook msgs, texts, or anything, so as soon as I get the pictures, I shall share. I think he might even have some video from last night I'm not sure. I know this seems like I'm talking out of my ass and trolling you guys, but I promise you that I'm not. I want to see if these pictures are anything myself, the suspense is killing me.**

The last of them being lastnight. I've never had dreams so deep and involved before. Each dream is different in its own way, but what is consistent, is that I end up speaking face to face with an alien and I am asking all sorts of questions and they're emparting knowledge that I never thought possible. Its so strange. In the dreams, I feel as though I am begining to understand the meaning of our existence and why aliens have been watching us etc. but when I wake up I cant remember the conversations. Just bits of what Ive saw. They dont speak dialog. They talk to me through my mind. I speak and they answer me in my head.
Ill give you an idea of what I remeber from lastnight. The following is my dream as best as I can recall it. It probably wont make much sense as most dreams dont:

Its night time. I was on a boat with my girlfriend coming into a port. The lock gates had closed and the water was leveling. As we stepped off the boat we were arguing. I looked up in the sky and saw a UFO. I couldnt speak, I was amazed. I tried pointing it out to GF but she wouldnt listen (still pissed with me) I had a feeling the UFO had noticed us. I panicked and a ray of light shone on my girlfriend. I jumped on her pulling her down screaming for them to not take her. Thats when I could hear them in my head. They said its ok. Both of us will be fine. The next little bit I remember is sitting at a table with GF and an Alien and feeling so stress free and happy. I knew what they were telling me and it was like i was remembering it all...

The dream before this, All that I can remember is again being by water and sitting in the sun with an alien who felt like my best friend and he was teaching me the truth about everything. 

But when I wake up, I cant remember anything that was said. Alls I know is that it all made sense in the dream.

Ok, so let me have it. Theyre Just dreams I suppose but I just need to stress the feeling of importance and amazement I have during the dream. Once I wake up alls I can remember is that feeling of knowing if you get me.

Anyone else had any of these dreams maybe?

EDIT- Just a note to say thanks for all of the replies. There are some pretty interesting stuff and good points in here from you guys. Glad to see other people have had similar experiances and are willing to share them. But was Dissapointed in comments being downvoted just for people sharing their opinions. I thought people who subscribed to this sub would all be of a more open minded person but unfortunatly the skeptics form the majority in most places. Keep being awesome guys.

My opinion, and it's mine alone, is that if you don't like it here, then why even come here? Nobody forces you to come here. Sure, some stuff get's deleted due to spamming and other obvious reasons, but for the most part it is up to you to figure out what you want to buy into, or not.

SO, for those who have been complaining as of late, I'd say move on. I'm not going anywhere, and I'm sure most others are not going anywhere. I can't cater to every single persons likes and dislikes on this sub-reddit. Again, if you are unhappy, start your own and see if you have as much success or failure as this one has. Again, this is MY opinion. I'd rather have the option of having that opinion here and having the option of posting things I find interesting on this subject than having the thought police beat me with a stick.

1350137497.0,69,self.UFOs,11ex4d,The travis Walton story. Do you believe?,84,15,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/11ex4d/the_travis_walton_story_do_you_believe/,"Let me start by saying I am not a UFO buff, &amp; I take many of the stories and sightings I read and hear about with a very tiny grain of salt. However, I happened to hear about the Travis Walton story a few days ago and it really challenged even myself. I was watching the syfy channcel &amp; I happened to come across the show 'Paranormal Witness', I thought this show was going to be like Ghost Hunters, so I tuned in expecting to change the channel again in a minute or 2. I was surpirsed that this show was actually first hand stories from people.

After a few seconds of watching I found myself laughing at this silly story, until I really started to listen.

The story goes :

A group of loggers in the mid 70's are behind on a contract and are working day &amp; night to finish the work they agreed on. One night on their way back to town, &amp; happen to spot some lights coming from the woods. They thought it was a fire at first, but then they all quickly agreed to didn't look right to be a fire. So, they turned there truck towards the light &amp; went to look. It only took them a few moments to come across the source of the light. All 6 of them to this day claim it was a UFO.

This is where the story takes a different turn from every other story you'll hear about. This story has 6 witnesses that all agree they saw a UFO. It's extremly rare to have this much first hand account from an entire group.

As soon as they got to the UFO, Travis walton got out of the car and walked towards it. Everyone in the car was yelling at him to get back in, but he ignored them. ( In later interviews, he says he was trying to 'show off' to the guys) As soon as he got close, the UFO started making 'sounds', which they suggest was it preparing to take off. Travis Walton began to back off, but was struck by a 'beam of light' &amp; knock 10-20 feet away. All the men in the car were in a panic at this point, and took of in the car. Several miles away, they regained themsevles, &amp; turned back to get Travis. When they returned to help him, he was gone.

He didn't return for 5 days.

During the 5 days he was gone, the men went to the police &amp; told there story. Everyone believed the group had killed him &amp; were hiding the body in the woods. A large man hunt was formed, and they combed the woods searching for him. But were unable to locate him.

What makes me question this story even more was that all the men agreed to a lie test. Now some will say this is not proof at all to anything, &amp; you'd be right. It isn't. But what's amazing here is that all 6 of them passed. The test was given by a highly trained &amp; skilled worker, who put the odds of all 6 of them passing at a million to 1. He agreed, they all believed they saw 'something' that night.

I won't get into what happened to Travis during his 5 days gone, because it's something you really have to listen to. I first watched them talked about this on the syfy channel, then I looked up interviews on youtube.

The thing that grabs me the most, when they tell there story... you can see it in their eyes that they honestly believe everything they're saying. &amp; I've never had this feeling of wanting to believe their story more then anyother.

They weren't looking for '15 minutes of fame', &amp; they for sure weren't looking to be called liers for 30+ years. You can see the pain in their eyes that hardly anyone believes them.

I heard both sides of the story. I heard the loggers, &amp; I heard the people that said they made it up. &amp; I looked at all the evidence.

Travis Walton vanished for 5 days.

A search of the entire area left no clues as to where he went.

Every one of them passed the lie deactor tests.

From that night forward, core samples from trees on that site show extreme levels of background radiation that have effected their growth for the past 30 years. The rings on the core showed normal growth before this night happened.

Travis Walton returned with a single mark left on this arm, &amp; signs that he hadent ate or drank in 5 days.

They continue to stick to there story after 30 years. Not once had it changed.

Then I looked at the side of the arugment that said they all lied. 

They had even less proof then the loggers. The only argument they had was that they 'just made it up', offering no real valid reason why they wood.

From the interviews I watched, I was surpirsed at how intelligent Travis Walton was. He wasn't your average UFO claimer. He's a humble man, but very honest.

After weighing everything after hearing this story a few days ago, I've come to decide... that I believe this group.

There's no good reason not to believe them.

Even after saying that, I still have my doubts. &amp; I'm sure I. Always will. But this group, they're 100% positive that they saw something that night. &amp; Travis really did vanish for 5 days.

Before you brush this off, I really suggest you guys watch the interviews, &amp; listen to these guys talk. Listen to The short story Travis tells about what happened to him when he was gone.

It all seems crazy. But something did happen that night in 1975.

We were chilling on the porch of my house, which is located in a rural farming/college town. I've been lurking this sub and have always wondered if I would see my own sighting, and sure enough it happened tonight.

All of a sudden, there were 6 VERY BRIGHT orange dots in the sky, maybe 5-6 miles away and about 500 feet in altitude. I took a video with my phone, and as soon as I get it uploaded I will attach it to this post. I promise OP will deliver. The orbs moved very slowly and were visible for about 5 minutes. I jumped on my bike in an attempt to get closer, but as soon as I got on the road they just disappeared. 

I still have goosebumps and am in disbelief in what I just saw. If there was ever any doubt in my mind that there is life outside of Earth, it's gone now. There was NO WAY they were airplanes, balloons, or any other man-made object. Approx. 1,000 feet in length were the ships, and very, very bright.

1362803744.0,66,self.UFOs,19yfsg,black triangle hovered over me,82,16,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/19yfsg/black_triangle_hovered_over_me/,"My friend was hanging out with me and we were walking my dog. It was dark, I looked up and saw a weird shooting star. It was really big and moving rather slow for a shooting star. I saw it move across the sky for about 10-15 seconds, but I didnt really think anything of it.

Later on we had just left my house in the car. Shes looking out the window and asks ""Hey, what's that light over there?"" and I was thinking it was the top of the old granary building... but she said ""I don't think so""... so I suggested a plane because I live in the direct flight path to the Toledo airport, so planes fly over all the time. but she said ""No... seriously, look at this."" and I asked her if she was sure it wasn't a plane or helicopter (because she is kinda silly and could have just been screwing around with me) and she said yeah.... 
then she started freaking out.
So, I finally looked... and I saw a horizontal row of lights headed right towards us from really far away.... and I just said ""Oh my God... omgomgomgomgomg!!!"" and she was all ""I TOLD YOU!!!""  ...so we're watching it as I'm trying to drive... and it's insanely quiet... but moving quite fast because it reached the field next to my car within 1-3 minutes... it was the biggest flying thing I have ever seen. and we realized it was going to go right over us! So we're freaking out.... shes looking up out her window.... and says she saw 3 lights in a triangular shape and in the center was a ring of pulsating lights with a glowy center light and 3 s shaped lighted arms that extended from the center ring of lights to the lights at each point of the triangle... 
At this point I could see that the road had an illuminated circle on it... presumably from the center light because I could see the strength of the light would increase and fade again.... it moved incredibly slowly over my car... and once it had passed over I looked out my window and saw there was an upper deck thing to it and it had a red light either on top or on the back of it somewhere. I could see the row of light beams clearly in the sky pointed away from my car... and heading further away.... then suddenly it was moving fast again... then I couldnt see it at all, within like 15 seconds after it had passed over the car....
There was no sound at all.... nothing... not even wind. Honestly I dont even remember hearing the traffic... it was silent and smoothly going through the sky not even like there was wind resistance. We both felt really weird when it was right above us, and were both itchy and had slight nausea after we couldnt see it anymore....

i have never seen anything like that in my life. and it was so incredibly close to us. i could see the lights on the bottom of it glowing on the road.... it couldnt have been more than 50-150 feet above the ground (estimating by how tall the trees it passed over are).
and when i reported it on an online ufo ""tracker"" someone had also reported seeing the exact same thing like 2 hours south of where I live.... and they saw it even closer. They could see the heat waves coming out of the vents on the bottom of it

this is what the other people wrote:

&gt;""This 21 engine triangle at about 1000 ft altitude or lower with no sound at all. (Not even the sound &gt;of cutting air at the speed it was traveling) At the time about 1139PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME as &gt;it traveled over my house at aprox. 500mph I had 15 seconds of view time and my son had about 8 &gt;seconds of view time. We saw the craft so well we could identify a single power source attached to &gt;the 3 cylindrical housings containing 7 vents for directional propulsion venting blue flames or blue &gt;heat giving the appearance of 3 lights. Possibly a plasma engine? However I have no explination how &gt;something of such mass could maintain current speed, altitude and silence.""

now, they say they saw it at 11:40pm and i saw it at midnight.... and we are a 2 hour drive apart (115-ish miles)
and there is no way they could have seen all that detail if it was  1000 ft ... because I couldnt even see all that detail. i think they meant 100. and I am kinda doubting they know how fast 500 mph is lol... just making up numbers.... to do 115 miles in twenty minutes.... if continuous that would be approx 345 mph/555 kmh. and that doesnt count the times it was going slow.... or stopped or whatever else along the way.. also planes cruise at 500-600 mph... which is where i think they got their number from. and this thing didnt move or fly anything like a plane 
but i think that its the exact same UFO.
totally changed my outlook on the universe for sure! I never really discounted other lifeforms, but once you see proof with your own eyes, its a game changer :D",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_19yfsg,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/19yfsg/black_triangle_hovered_over_me/,

There is such a taboo to deviate from the accepted story of our existence, it's absolutely ridiculous to think that these ancient civilizations didn't have access to advanced technology that we absolutely do not give them credit for. 


There's two explanations I see here-

An Atlantian type advanced civilization that spread across the globe that we lost massive amounts of information about. (Library of Alexandria?)


Extraterrestrial intervention - The gods living among us in our early days, actually interacting with mankind and/or giving us technology/writing/mathematics and so on. 


It would be incredibly easy to choose the former just because of Occams razor, but there's something else we need to take into account here. Every.single.mythology of these ancient cultures tells tales of (space brothers, ones from the sky, descendants from heaven, Annunaki, Ezekiel) on and on forever. I think once we take into consideration what they are saying actually went down, the latter becomes way, way easier to swallow. 

I mean these people were obviously weren't stupid, they've built the pyramids, they've built fortresses on top of mountains (machu pichu), and they're telling us what they perceived to have happened. If it was one isolated event I would brush it off as myth, but there are far too many stories of practically the same thing.

Especially if one is a believer of the ETH for the tiny percentage of inexplainable current day sightings, it's incredibly naive to believe that ET has just started to take an interest in us now.

1365276769.0,64,self.UFOs,1bt7dg,Alien base in Alaska,86,22,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1bt7dg/alien_base_in_alaska/,"In his 1997 book Remote Viewers, Jim Schnabel told the story of the U.S. Intelligence community’s involvement in the controversial issue of psychic spying that largely began in the early-to-mid 1970s. 

Commenting on the skills of a talented remote-viewer in relation to matters of a UFO nature, one Pat Price, Schnabel noted Price was of the opinion that “…Alaska’s Mount Hayes, the jewel of a glacial range northeast of Anchorage, housed one of the aliens’ largest bases.” According to Pat Price, the aliens that lived deep inside Mount Hayes were very human looking, differing only in their heart, lungs, blood, and eyes. Ominously, he added that the aliens use “thought transfer for motor control of us.” Price added: “The site has also been responsible for strange activity and malfunction of U.S. and Soviet space objects.” Rather notably, despite the controversial nature of this story, we find that the U.S. military took a great deal of interest in tales of UFO activity in Alaska in the formative years of the subject. For example, formerly classified FBI files tell of startling UFO encounters in Alaska in the period 1947-1950.

 It was in August 1947 that a highly impressive account of a UFO incident involving two serving members of the military was supplied to the FBI at Anchorage. The report began: “This is to advise that two army officers reported to the Office of the Director of Intelligence Headquarters Alaskan Department, at Fort Richardson, Alaska, that they had witnesses an object passing through the air at a tremendous rate of speed which could not be judged as to miles per hour.” According to the official report, the UFO was initially sighted by only one of the two officers, but he soon alerted his colleague to the strange sight. “The object appeared to be shaped like a sphere and did not give the impression of being saucer-like or comparable to a disk.

 The first officer stated that it would be impossible to give minute details concerning the object, but that it appeared to be approximately two or three feet in diameter and did not leave any vapor trail in the sky.” Experienced officer that he was, in his first attempt to gauge the altitude of the object, and, from a comparison with cloud formations in the area, he determined that whatever the nature of the mystery sphere, it was cruising at a height of more than ten thousand feet. And it should be noted that to be at such a height and still be visible, in all probability the UFO must have exceeded by a wide margin the initial size estimate of “two or three feet.”

 When questioned, the second officer gave a substantially similar account, the only marked difference being that, in his opinion, he considered the object to have been approximately ten feet in diameter, and compared it to “half the size of a full moon on an ordinary night.” This discrepancy in size was apparently due to the fact that the second officer believed the UFO was more likely to have been at a height of three-to-four thousand feet, rather than at an altitude of ten thousand feet as had been suggested by his colleague.

 The difference of opinion over the altitude and size of the object may or may not have been significant; the important factor, however, was that both officers agreed that some type of anomalous object had most definitely been seen. And as the report concluded: “…the second officer pointed out that one of the remarkable features of this report was that it was definitely traveling against the wind.” Shortly afterwards, the FBI Office at Anchorage reported to Bureau Director J. Edgar Hoover that: “…

we have been able to locate a flyer [who] observed some flying object near Bethel, Alaska in July 1947.” The report to Hoover continued: “[The pilot] related that the occasion of seeing the flying object near Bethel was on a July day when the sky was completely clear of clouds, and it being during the early part, it is daylight the entire night. 

The time of his sighting [of] this flying object was about 10 PM and the sun had just dropped beyond the horizon. Flying weather was extremely good and he was coming into the Bethel Airport with a DC-3.”On approaching the airport the pilot was amazed to see to his left an unidentified craft “the size of a C-54 without any fuselage,” which seemed to resemble a “flying wing.” As a result of its unique shape, the pilot was initially unable to determine whether the object was heading towards his aircraft or away from it,

 and elected to make a 45-degree turn in an attempt to diffuse any possible chance of collision. The FBI noted that the pilot was certain that the craft was free of any external power source, such as a propeller-driven engine, and exhibited no exhaust as it flew by. 

The document added: “He called on his radio to the Civil Aeronautics Administration station at Bethel, asking what aircraft was in the vicinity and they had no reports of any aircraft. The object he sighted was some five or ten miles from the airport before his arrival and [he] stated that the path did not go directly across the airport. He, of course, could not tell whether the object was making any noise and stated that it was flying at a thousand foot altitude and estimated travel at 300 miles per hour.

 “It was traveling in the direction from Bethel to Nome, which is in a northwesterly direction. He noted no radio interference and is unable to describe the color other than it appeared dark but of definite shape and did not blend into the sky but had a definite, concise outline. [He] clearly observed the object at this time.” As the 1940s drew to a close and a new decade dawned, the FBI continued to receive and log high-quality UFO reports on a regular basis. Of those, one of the more credible related to a noteworthy series of encounters that occurred in Alaskan airspace over the course of two days in early 1950. Forwarded to the FBI by an official U.S. Navy source, the confidential three-page intelligence report paints a startling picture of multiple UFO encounters involving the military. Titled “Unidentified Phenomena in Vicinity of Kodiak, Alaska,”

 it concerns “a report of sightings of unidentified airborne objects, by various naval personnel, on 22 and 23 January 1950.” The author of the report noted: “…at 220240W January Lt. Smith, USN, patrol plane commander of P2V3 No. 4 of Patrol Squadron One reported an unidentified radar contact 20 miles north of the Naval Air Station, Kodiak, Alaska. When this contact was first made, Lt. Smith was flying the Kodiak Security Patrol. At 0243W, 8 minutes later a radar contact was made on an object 10 miles southeast of NAS Kodiak. Lt. Smith checked with the control tower to determine known traffic in the area, and was informed that there was none. During this period, the radar operator, Gaskey, ALC, USN, reported intermittent radar interference of a type never before experienced. Contact was lost at this time, but intermittent interference continued.”

A while back I broke down and told MUFON of what I live with. I was an abductee in my childhood. It's not something I tell anyone. My wife doesnt know, my friends do not know. My shrink has no idea. I have trouble sleeping, even though I'm almost 30. Anyway... 

My family and I lived in an apartment when I was young. We never watched any UFO tv shows, only the occasional Star Trek. When I was ,about 6 I started having problems sleeping. I'd wake totally paralyzed and unable to do anything, not even speak. I told my parents and we went to the doctor and he said it was sleep paralysis. For a few years the continued.

When I was 8 we moved north, into a rural town. I continued to have the same issues sleeping. For months I kept waking up frozen in my bed in a completely terrified state. If I could describe the fear I would, but I can't. Our language has no words that can describe it.

I never suspected anything until I started to remember what would happen the instant before I woke. There was a blinding light. Nothing else.

Eventually I started to realize what was going on. I would wake up before this light sometimes, as if I knew it was coming. I'd always wake up in the morning like it never happened though. 

Now for the reason I am writing this. I have a deep scar on my left palm that my boot camp doctor asked about, because there was a metal splinter in that scar.

Also I remember an attempted abduction. 

I woke up in blackness with that fear I wrote of. I knew something was coming. I stared at my door, which was cracked open so the cats could come and go. Then the white light flashed, like a camera flash. Three time. One. Twothree. Th door crept open a bit and a thin man sidestepped through the opening. It looked around, scanning slowly,NAND the walked to the right wall. It didn't notice I was awake.i tried yelling but nothing came out. My brother and I had bunk beds, I was on the top. It looked down at him after walking between the right side wall and the bunks. I tried to yell and it snapped its head up and looked my in the eyes. It then reached towards my face with its long fingers. I tried to yell again but couldn't. I then put all of my might into my right arm and lifted it. I swung my arm over and attempted to hit it, but I really just tapped it. It's pulled back it's hand stared at me for a second. Then, while watching me it backed out of the room.

Ask me whatever you want. I hope /r/ufos has some input or suggestions. Living with this is difficult.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_13jyrr,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/13jyrr/i_am_an_abductee/,

I was laying on my porch again, listening to the radio, I'd been watching for a couple of hours and I actually saw a LOT of stuff tonight.  I saw a red shooting star, I got such a good look at it that I almost heard it, and I saw the trail of ""smoke"" for a second or two after it was gone.  I saw a yellow shooting star too.  I saw one star that, I swear to god, just drifted away and disappeared while I was looking at it.  Then, I saw two separate stars, a good 10 or 20 minutes apart, blink about 5 times as they moved very slowly... blinking less bright with each blink... until they just stopped blinking... and they were gone.  I saw two of those.  


THEN, I saw 3 lights fly together into my view, and then basically do a beautiful dance for me.  It lasted about 30 seconds -- they danced all around the sky, circling around eachother, spreading apart, lining up,  twirling and jumping.... they were dancing.  They aligned into that VERY SAME TRIANGLE I SAW LAST MONTH at least 3 or 4 times.  

I swear on my life, hope to die... I am NOT lying.  I know with every bit of my existence that what I saw tonight was NOT from this earth.  I know a lot of you won't believe me, but I know some of you will, too.  

I have the strangest, most exciting, confused, exhilerated feeling right now.  I can't put it into words - I can't even think straight right now.

Though it sparked some interest, it was harshly criticized by some as ""moronic"" and ""unsupported"". Ultimately, according to comment upvotes, most people were able to settle on the proton radiation explanation provided by frid. The main argument was that LASCO had been damaged by the recent solar flare, and that what was shown in the images i posted were glitches. This seemed logical enough to me, but I still had a question: **if it was a glitch, why was the same glitch present on both the LASCO C2 &amp; C3?** NASA's [SOHO site](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime/realtime-update.html) couldn't provide a wide enough view of the sun (outside of the C2 &amp; C3) to say definitively that these glitches were *only present* on these two coronographs. So, I did some more digging.

Turns out, **these anomalies are present on other images of the sun.**
Both on [NASA's Stereo Science Center page](http://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/beacon/beacon_secchi.shtml) and on the [Mauna Loa Solar Observatory's site](http://mlso.hao.ucar.edu/). So, here i present two more images to be scrutinized, criticized, and seen by you guys. If someone could provide a legitimate answer as to why all these measuring devices are showing the same glitch, I'm all ears.

1366825608.0,63,self.UFOs,1d0u0n,An ostensible CSETI participant talks about the experience via Amazon review.,74,11,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1d0u0n/an_ostensible_cseti_participant_talks_about_the/,"Knowledge Seeker's review of Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge:

""During his CSETI workshop I was dismayed at the real Dr. Greer, November 15, 2009
By Knowledge Seeker (California) - See all my reviews

I followed Dr. Greer's activities with enthusiasm since 2001 when he established the Disclosure Project. I read his books, watched his interviews and listened to his meditation CD's. I liked everything the man seemed to be about and shared his views on the need to inform the public about the presence of extraterrestrial visitors on Earth, the importance of establishing peaceful contact with these visitors, in developing free or low cost overunity energy technologies that would clean the planet, eliminate conflict between nations, and bring about a dignified quality of life and abundance to people all over the world. I still share these goals.

So it was with great excitement that I signed up for a CSETI presentation and a one day workshop with Dr. Greer that took place on November 13 and 14, 2009 in Costa Mesa, California to experience and learn CSETI's contact protocol and to determine whether it would be worthwhile enrolling in a week long CSETI outing with Dr. Greer.

Surprisingly, my pre-conceived opinion about Dr. Greer's character began to disintegrate as I listened to his presentation. It was disheartening to discover he is excessively fascinated with himself, prone to indulge in name dropping and in bragging about his fantastic 'high end' and/or 'in the know' contacts and connections, not to mention the multitude of outlandish remarks he makes with a straight face, such as his impact on the rogue MAJESTIC secret government. So much so, that according to him, he ""rejected a TWO BILLION dollars payout to shut up and abandon the ET disclosure issue"".

Needless to say, that night I left the auditorium less enthusiastic about what Dr. Greer is all about. But it was not until the workshop and the outing next day that my opinion about him really changed - unfortunately for the worst.

Again, during the workshop Dr. Greer devoted some time to self admiration while attempting to appear humble by saying, ""I'm just a country doctor from North Carolina"". By then, I was becoming quite uncomfortable about him but as the workshop progressed my discomfort turned into dismay as I watched how rudely he treated some attendees who asked valid questions or made harmless remarks but whose timing or subject he deemed ""inappropriate"". I was truly shocked and could not believe my ears and eyes as I watched him lash at them with such scornful contempt. It was so bad that I wondered if this man was consciously trying to chase these people away. Dr. Greer claims to have experienced meditative Samadhi or oneness with all. If so, one would think he would have achieved a certain degree of enlightenment and a sense of kinship toward his fellow men. Why then was he so harsh and unkind? Did he forget these people paid a significant amount of money not only to listen but to ask questions as well?

The worst and most disheartening part of this experience was witnessing the CSETI's field contact protocol. At the site, a number of devices such as a radio transmitter, magnetometer, radar detectors, infrared scope, etc. were arranged. Even though I don't doubt Dr. Greer may have had several ET experiences in the past, what I observed in the field that night is inconsistent with his hyperbolic claims suggesting he can vector ETs and make them appear. His actions and the facts demonstrated that at the very least this is a bold exaggeration. Not surprisingly, to cover up for this assertion Dr. Greer made sure to bring out a series of possibilities for a 'no show' prior to the field excursion. According to him, sometimes the ETs might not appear because, ""there is someone in the group without good intent and a clean heart"" or ""the ETs feel threatened by US military"" or ""even though they won't fully materialize they will manifest in a thousand other ways"".

Conveniently, there were plenty of people at hand, mostly staff, who would come forward to state that while meditating they saw this or heard that. Most amusing though were Dr. Greer's remarks at the beeps and sounds made by his electronic equipment. You see, according to him an ET he named Walter communicates via one of these electronic devices and Dr. Greer is able to recognize which beeps he makes. Additionally, the large quantity of ""WOW!"" and ""Oh my God!"" remarks coming out of Dr. Greer's mouth over unseen or imaginary nonevents was sadly hilarious. Often times he would point his mega laser beam at some spot in the sky and claim he was seeing a partly materialized ET craft. Of course, any one else saw nothing even though, according to him, many significant events were taking place that night because ""we were such a great group"". To make matters worse, Dr. Greer supplemented the lack of any occurrence with information he received via ""remote viewing"".

I found this charade insulting to my intelligence, intuitiveness and psychic sensibilities. I know ETs were not present that night and I would have respected Dr. Greer if he had been forthright and acknowledged the fact that there was no activity. I would understand; it happens.

Because I experienced first hand Dr. Greer's tendency to fabricate, exaggerate and embellish nonevents at the CSETI field trip, it then follows that the accuracy and validity of everything he claims in his books is in question since it's evident that, at the very least, he stretches the truth to the point where it becomes short of being an outright lie.

In the past, whenever I would read negative reviews about Dr. Greer, especially ones describing him as a self centered narcissist, I would reject them and conclude they were made by people who couldn't handle the truth. But based on what I saw and experienced first hand, it appears Dr. Greer is in love with himself, and because he sees himself above others, he dislikes most people. However, he desperately craves attention so he created this ET disclosure platform to attract as large an audience as possible in order to obtain the recognition and adulation he sorely needs. In essence, regardless of the message, this messenger is so flawed one must question the purity and true nature of his motivations. His books, conferences and CSETI outings may be more about the money they bring than the message itself.

Furthermore, unless you enjoy watching people being mistreated by Dr. Greer and don't mind embarking on a pathetic farce, I recommend you put your money elsewhere instead of spending it in any of his CSETI's excursions.

UPDATE 12/4/2009: In a letter sent to Dr. Greer, CIA director James Woolsey, his wife Suzanne, and two others, refute Dr. Greer's claims regarding his alleged ""briefing"" to them. To read this letter in its entirety please google: greer woolsey ufo watch dog.

Also, astronaut Ed Mitchell refutes claims made by Dr. Greer in Jeff Rense's website. To read Mitchell's statement please google: ed mitchell unhappy with greer.

Several of the places I have heard this information refer to this mystery as the 'Hall of Records'. They also reference what is known as the mystery of the missing cap stone that if placed in it's appropriate spot on the top of the pyramid that something amazing will happen, idk what exactly.


Anyway, has anyone heard of this, what do you think about it?


Here are just a few videos referencing what I'm talking about with timestamps on when they talk about it.

There are several so to make this post not so large I'll stop there and you can continue researching yourself if you wish.


What do you guys think about this?
If there really could be something in or around the Sphinx why hasn't someone thoroughly investigated it yet?
This second video even goes as far as to claim how to enter this hidden area via an entrance behind the ear of the Sphinx.


Whether or not any of this information is credible, do you believe that there are secrets being held in the ""Hall of Records"" or anywhere around/below the pyramids/Sphinx?

He wrote a book called [""Unconventional  flying objects, a scientific analysis""](http://www.amazon.com/Unconventional-Flying-Objects-Scientific-Analysis/dp/1571740279) which he had published after his death due to his security clearance.  This book is pure gold if you're into the analytic and/or phenomenological perspectives.  He had a bunch of cases that he noted the sound was emitted. One neat one was with a musician who was able to tell the frequency went up an octave so he reasoned that it had doubled it's field frequency during acceleration.  From this and other unusual cases he was able to deduce what kind of propulsion system the craft was employing.   I've read probably 20-30 boks on ufos, abductions, usos, etc. This one is my favorite,right next to some of John Keels books, although they are polar opposites in terms of perspective.

This past weekend I went to San bernadino, CA for a concert that I have attended the past 3 years, and have been doing this exact drive to and from AZ countless times, but when I was driving back this past Sunday, I saw something different. I was driving home with two friends (Who do not believe in this phenomenon at all) and one of my friends points to something in the sky, asking what it is. Its about 2 PM, sky is clear and its sunny, so me and my other friend look over and it is a light grey cigar shaped object a few miles off the highway around White water, CA. About the halfway between Cabazon, CA and Palm Springs, CA. The object does not move at all and we are all very interested in it, but after about 2 minutes, it completely vanishes like it was never there. No movement, just disappeared into thin air. After all this me and my friends kinda joke to lighten the mood but we all get silent then I break the silence admitting that I'm kinda scared and they both say the same too. So we just dont talk about it the rest of the drive but today it came up and we all get chills talking about it now. 

I already believed, but this just gave me the proof I needed because I know what I saw and I know nothing of human origin can just disappear like this did. There are always going to be skeptics, but even my friends are believers now after this. It honestly scares me even though I've been looking for years, but it finally happened and I just wanted to tell someone without looking crazy to my other friends.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_1akx0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1akx0t/after_all_the_years_of_reading_and_researching/,

No, I am not suffering from any mental illness. No, I am not nor was I under the influence of any drug or medication. 

Edit (again): No, the ""communication"" wasn't in English, or any language. Rather through thoughts and feelings. 

If you're here merely to mock me for having what was probably a dream, you really need to either find a new subreddit or find a hobby. 


(Sorry about the shitty grammar! I typed this up on my phone right after I woke up. I know it sounds unbelievable, and I'm not claiming to have definitely had an experience. I'm not looking for karma ((which is why this is a throw away)) I'm just looking for feedback)


It started as a normal night sleep, though I'd been having weirder dreams than normal. 
I suddenly felt very awake, and was strapped to a cold metal surface. I wasn't very afraid, but this was due to the grogginess. 
I was staring around in a brightly lit room, and a creature came into view. He (I was sure it was a he) leant over me, and I stared back. I tried to talk, but I felt like he couldn't understand me. He was greyish blue, with massive almond eyes and a tiny mouth. He was joined by another, who was physically bigger, and I felt as if I could understand their silent conversation 

""She's awake"" 

""She won't remember."" 

""I don't think we should start."" 

""We're doing the surgery now."" 

The one who insisted on doing the ""surgery"" seemed to be higher in rank, though the other seemed to be the ""surgeon"". 
Upon feeling that they intended on doing some sort of surgery I freaked out inwardly. I tried to keep calm, however, and think about what I knew of abductions, ETs, and UFOs. They obviously communicated telepathically, and people who'd been abducted often reported feeling as if these creatures had no empathy towards them, like humans to cattle. I thought that maybe if I tried to mentally communicate my anguish, they'd see me as a being closer to their level. I tried to project my thoughts, pain, fear, anger, and understanding. The surgeon seemed distressed, and he appeared to ask his superior to come closer. The superior leant over me and I projected my anger and understanding with more effort, trying to ignore my fear. 
He seemed unsure also, and pulled back from the table. I then blacked out, and can't remember any more.

Creatures.",76,17,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15o4bz/have_you_guys_ever_heard_of_the_theory_that_ufos/,"I cannot remember where I remember reading this theory. It was an idea that perhaps these ""UFOs"" we see may actually be creatures..biological...animals of some sort. They are bio-luminous thus the lights. The theory goes on explainning that they may be creatures that live/thrive in space and atmospheres. They can go back and fourth from space to an oxygen like atmosphere. They would be similar to the deep dwelling creatures of our ocean. I found it to be an interesting theory becuase it is so different. 

On a personal note, I suppose it might be possible. As humans and humanity, when it comes to biology and science in general, all we know is what we know and thus we preceive things based upon what we know. What if we didn't know that life could exist in space. Rather not exist in space but get from one area of the Universe to another (such as coming into our planet). What if the planets are like our continents and the ocean is the deep empty space between these planets. Like as if each planet is an island and in between these planets/islands is space/ocean. 

But what about the metallic, electormagnic ufos that turn off cars and mess with our electronics? Okay. What if some of these UFOs were actual metallic ships and in a sense where much like our submarines on how they dive deep into our ocean to observe life? These ""Space submarines"" may contain extraterrestrials that observe us as we do with creatures in our ocean. They can mess with our electronics because it's a defense mechanistic, much like how ocean life has defense mechanisms and how do on our own ships.  

As to how these UFOs accelerate so quickly and seeming jump from one part to another may be similar to how quick our ocean dwelling creatures may be. Get near a fish and it quickly moves away.

Anyways, it was a unique theory and it's something I play with in my head. Interesting nonetheless. I'm going to go search the internet for said theory. 

EDIT: Another thing to think about...some of the creatures that live in deep within our ocean actually look like flying saucers in a sense. Doing a search on Google Image yields pictures of UFOs yet they look extremely similar to ocean life on our planet.

Here is my story. ,93,34,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/18ouuq/i_think_i_was_abducted_as_a_child_along_with_my/,"I have always been curious about what has happened to me. so I would like to tell my story,and get see what you guys think about it. There was two points in my life where I think this may have happened. When I was about 7 I remember having a really vivid dream. It started with me laying on what looked like a metal table in a very bright white room. I was unable to move and unable to speak. Two creatures I can only describe as your classic grey aliens appeared above me. They had what looked like a stamp or needle like tool in a triangle pattern that they stamped on my left leg. I remember how much it hurt, but not being able to scream. Once they were done I heard my mother tell me everything was going to be alright, and to stay calm. I looked to my right out of the corner of my eye and there was my mother laying there. That's the last thing I remember. I woke up,and checked my leg and sure enough I had a triangle scar on my left leg. I asked my mother if she remembered anything from the night before,and she nervously said no and then went into her room for most of the day. I still have the triangle scar on my leg  each side is about an inch long. If you are interested I will take a picture tonight and leave a link here. The second time was a little stranger. I was about 13 years old. I was sleeping in my room in the down stairs of our house. I remember waking up to a bright light outside my window. It was so bright I though it was morning. I had noticed that the ligh was not the sun. I looked out my window and it was like someone had a giant spotlight on the house pointed from the sky. It was too bright to tell what it was coming from. It was strange I remembered not feeling panic or being scared just curious to what was going on. At that point I layed back into my bed, and I noticed a light coming from under my door. The last thing I remember is my door starting to violently shake like someone was trying to get in but didn't turn the knob. The next morning my dad had asked me if I saw that bright light outside I told him I did and I asked him what it was and he just replied it must have been a plane. I just wanted to share this with you guys. I don't talk to anyone about this because I fear that people will think I'm crazy. Even when I think about it I feel like a crazy person, being that I am a natural born skeptic of everything. Thanks for taking your time to read this I'm interested in hearing what you think.

Changed my opinion. ,65,13,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/pv97l/my_sighting_in_06_changed_my_opinion/,"Since I was 9 years old (20 years ago), I have been into ufo's, paranormal, ghosts, etc. It started when I was in catholic school, and found what looked to be a children's book of ufo stories. Travis walton, the Sorocco incident, Flatwoods, Hopkinsville goblins, stuff like that. It started my journey into ufology. Since then, I had hoped to see something, my reading intensified. 

Flash forward to 2006. My buddies laugh and scoff at my ufo ideas, reptillians, theories about ancient aliens (before the show of course, I had gotten my first Erich Von Daniken book at 14), to where I don't mention anything, but they know I'm a ""UFO nut"".  Me, and a couple of uberskeptic buddies decide to go out on a boat late at night in Lake Erie. I was 24, We were partiers, but I had gotten out of work late, and it was around 11pm/12am, We had snuck on the boat( was my friend's father's boat, a little motorboat, that fit three people snugly.) 

We get into the middle of the lake, where we couldn't see where we launched the boat, and couldn't see the canadian side, just water around us, with faint lights on either side. 

We sit with the engine off, enjoying the serenity and quietness of the lake. After 20 minutes, we were ready to leave, when we saw a glow a quarter of a mile away from where we were, in the water. A little wierd, but my friends didnt say much. They thought it was a bouy with a light on it that flipped or in the water. 

Without so much as a sound, the big light starts to ascend out of the water. At this time, the lake was so quiet, all we could hear is the water splashing down off of this thing, as it rose out of the lake, slowly going up above our heads. Words can't describe the beauty of this big bright light, with the water running off of it. Breathtaking. 

This thing was as big as a tractor-trailer; length-wise, and it elevated to where it seemed as small as the moon in the distance. 

I continued to watch in awe, as it got higher, it stopped in place, hovered for what seemed like forever (probably a good 20/30 seconds) , and blinked out of existence. (My idea is, it went up/into space with such speed and velocity if we were to blink, we would have missed it totally.

I think to myself, Ok, i'm not drunk, i havent done drugs or anything. I was completely sober, and I still did not believe what i saw. I looked down at my friends, and they were wide-eyed, mouths opened in awe. 

They were dumbstruck, they had not believed in any of the ufo stuff on television or the internet until that day. I was told that they had a newfound respect for me and what I read about, because that night they realized I wasn't just crazy, these things seem to be real. Needless to say, we immediately fired the motor back up after our experience and got the hell back to land and went our separate ways-

I had waited a few days, then called my friends and confirmed the event, and after writing down our stories, we submitted it to MUFON, where we spoke with an investigator, and never heard anything else about it from them. 

I just wanted to share this with you. I once posted this on the fantasticforum, but felt reddit needed to hear it too 

TL;Dr? I saw a ufo rise out of the water of Lake erie in 2006 with two friends, reported it and wanted to share.

Some of the stories are compelling, some of the witnesses seem credible, but there's nothing in 10,000 *stories* that equals proof.  When it comes to pics/vids I mostly come across shaky and blurry lights, points of light in the distant night, blurry silhouettes, insects flying in front of the lens (""I didn't see it until I played it back!""), poor CGI, satellites, camera artifacts, RC toys, balloons.  Nothing is ever as clear as you could tape a 747 going across the sky.

Does anyone on this whole planet have a tripod, and is there some unwritten rule that people add 45 seconds of aggrandizing text prelude and [that song](http://youtu.be/OerRJHblnvc), along with superlative titles of ""undeniable proof""?  I'm sick of looking at stupid shit!

There hasn't been a whole lot of coverage on Bob or his story for the last few years, [other than the trouble United Nuclear encountered in 2006](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/chemistry.html). I was wondering if anybody has caught wind of any news or if maybe any Michigan Redditors heard/hear anything?

I also posted [this AMA Request](http://redd.it/1c0xm0) and sent an e-mail to United Nuclear to see if he would respond or show to answer questions. (I highly encourage you to post questions on the AMA request in the event he does)

Now, as I said before even if you think his story is BS, well, here is your chance to put him to the test and help prove it. OR, here is your chance to pose questions about an interesting event in UFOlogy. Either way, I think getting information into the open and letting communities pour over and discuss it is the best way to get to the bits of truth floating around out there waiting to be shown. 

**EDIT (4/10/13):**

* **Received a reply today stating that my request has been given to Bob, however they stated that he has little to no interest discussing UFOs, and now that he and his company hold active government contracts, that there is quote; ""an unwritten agreement to not rock the boat"".**

* **Created an additional [AMA Request](http://redd.it/1c35rg) for [George Knapp](http://www.8newsnow.com/story/175403/george-knapp) and I'm attempting to get in touch with him to see if he would be interested. I'll keep you posted.**

* **Spoke with George Knapp. He said he is happy to do the AmA and should have some free time in the next week or so. He mentioned wanting to talk about [Skinwalker Ranch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinwalker_Ranch) and said some of the weirdest stuff he has investigated has to do with that place. This is going be good! Stay Tuned! I'll keep you posted!**",,False,self,t5_2qhds,1365643668.0,,,True,t3_1c0yv5,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1c0yv5/whatever_happened_to_bob_lazar/,

I have had dreams where I was abducted...three to be exact. Now normally when I wake up from a dream, I realize it was just a dream, but when I woke up from these dreams I felt that they had to be real. If you dream you got shot and you woke up with a bullet wound, what would you assume?
My first and second dream they had me attached to IVs or something and when I woke up I had a IV mark (bruising similar to having an IV) in the exact spot that they had it in my dream. I pushed this off as being a coincidence until my third dream. In it, they had been messing with my right arm but there were no IV's or anything that I could see, but I was so out of it I couldn't exactly tell what they were doing. When I woke up from this dream I didn't see any marks on my arm so I felt it was just a dream but when I moved my arm pain radiated throughout it. Upon rubbing where the pain originated from i felt a lump about the size of a grain of rice. Researching this I think they might have implanted me with something but I am not completely sure. It is very noticeable by touch though and last night it was burning/stinging pretty bad and when I looked at it, it was red and raised (its normally not red you can only normally tell it is there by feeling it). I don't know if I am just going crazy or if this is really happening to me.

So my brother and his fiance were leaving my dads house last night when he looks up to the northern sky and films these lights. They both claim there were about 20 total lights and they were really bright. Unfortunately he recorded this with the last of his phone battery. They said shortly after this was filmed the lights individually blinked out.

Just for reference, my dad and I used to DJ weddings and have seen a sky of Chinese lanterns on numerous occasion. He swears these were not Chinese lanterns. I also called the Luke Airforce Base command center and they stated there weren't any flare tests tonight that they were aware of.

Not sure what they are (unfortunately I wasn't there), but I was just curious if anyone else saw these?

35) ok appparently the non-payers stream has ended. Right now I am watching footage Ive seen of Greer talking in the theater. I have not recieved the promised Yreka email that would give me my 'pass' for the stream I paid for. TAD ANNOYED.

36) The Yerka support page is down. LOL. I think their shit is busted. Is anyone else who paid actually watching the movie?

37) Well I'm not sure what to do. Yerka customer support is down. They said they would send an email which would  - I dont even know, give me a passcode? -which would allow me to access the content I paid for two days go, and it has not arrived yet. There seems to be no other option for me to watch this fucking movie unless I pay again. I am willing to do it if I have to, but I will do it fucking angrily.

38) Welp. Paid again. Was hoping that it would recognize my paypal account and say 'oh hey you paid' but nope. Guess I will be writing some very fucking angry emails to these Yerkas. 

39) Now watching the 'dead man's trigger' opening again.

40) Twats better give me my goddam $10 back or I'm gonna get internet tough guy on ;em. Holy shit stream is just paused. Are you kidding me.

41) Yekra can suck five thousand cocks covered in motor oil. What the fuck kind of name is Yekra anyway. Twats.

42) You get about a minute and a half into the film and the shit just STOPS. Oh and there's an ad above it asking you to buy the DVD or gift it to folks on facebook. I would send them a flaming bag of dog shit first, you fucks. Seriously it would be more useful.

43) 'the implications of this are so profound ... they may actually enable us to successfully stream a fucking movie. ZERO POINT ENERGY SEEMS TO BE REQUIRED.'

44) aRE THE FAMILIES OF BANKING REALLY CALLED 'THE FOUR HORSEMEN'? REALLY? is that an actual thing?

45)  1945 - 1998 . 2053 nuclear bombs detonated on this planet, US detonated half. Oppenhiemer claimed that 'we have done this before'. Was he talking about the ancient sankrist texts? (vamanas etc -they're quoting it, conatins all the key indications of radiation sickness -it's actually really crazy if you look into it.) When the civilizations saw that we have nukes the species watching us said we were going off the reservation, etc.

46) Doing some ancient aliens stuff now....sankrit / japanese / earlu civilizations / art etc

47) Ok archival footage of UFOs, clips of people with impressive titles talking about thier experiences

48) Ooh nice song, wonder who that is

49) Wow a dude from the Vatican. Some nice clips.

50) Ok now we have some hippies out in the desert, CSET's I think. broadcasting tones. oh i think this is his ""let's make contact with our BRAINZ thing"" Oh tey developed it from a vision quest.... ok

51) CUE CE5. 

52) Basically if there is only one big universal mind we should be able to make contact by tapping into it - send a signal about where you are to the aliens and they'll come chill and toke a bowl with you

53) Craft are not visible to the human eye so they use infrared.

54) They're showing footage captured during CE5 stuff, your basic lights, etc

55) OKAY apparently this thread no longer shows up on r/ufos???

56) More CE5 hippies talking about meditation, yada yada yada....the ETS pick up on your intentions. Yeah ok. Can we have some alien bodies and antigrav tech now?

57) THIS IS GAY GET ON WITH IT

58) ARE YOU REALLY HAVING CHEESY INDIAN MEDIATION MUSIC

59) LONG SHOTS OF LIGHTS IN THE SKY

60) oh my gaaaaaaawd this was not the way to go Greer, all this woo woo

61) Greer had an NDE at 17 where he found himself out in space and super peaceful and at once w the universe. got all into meditation. thats why he's all woo woo now. JUST FYI

62) Oh now he's talking about the little humanoid body and showing it and talking about testing it. It was found in the desert. There is a fracture behind the right eat caved in, is how it died. is being tested at stanford aniversity.

63) Gary P Noland PHD - is the guy studying it

64) HE IS GIVING STEVE THE TUBES AND MICROSCOPE TO USE TO DO THE ANALYSIS ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS. BITCH YOU BETTER NOT  - DID YOU LET GREER GIVE YOU THE FUCKING SAMPLES????? YOU DIDN'T TAKE THEM YOURSELF?????

65) JESUS FUCK I REALLY HOPE I HEARD THAT WRONG

66) BECAUSE WHO FUCKING KNOWS WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE PUT IN THERE

67) okay god now he's talking about the energy machine thing he built - Tom Valone PHD engineering pjysicist.

68) Yeah you better get that tesla coil money shot bitch

69) Ok zero point energy basically - ufos have figured this out apparently

70) Chief officer of 'morngingstar applied physics' not tofu foods

71) machine keeps failing and they're trying to troubleshoot it FUCKING FASCINATING. talkig about changing angular momentum to linear momentum, or they are somehow absorbing ? gravity waves?

72) FUCKING GRAVITY HOW DOES THAT WORK. Gravity moves faster than the speed of light maybe? gravity of black hole is stronger / faster than light? 1920's discovered electric charge and gravitational mass are coupled and by building devices that harness these interactive forces we could create advanced propulsion. rewwound that a couple times to get it right

73) Tesla was a baddass. Proved electricity could travel wirelessly. His work Henderson and Moray - they used some engine? that could extract energy from a zero point field.

74) Moray and Hendershot died of 'natural causes' and 'suicide' after having their machines destroyed

75) in order to extract energy from a vacuum you must out in more energy than you put out

76) electrogavitics was a big deal, but once they found out they could control gravity in 1954 it went black.

77) Stanely meyer rwith water running engine - dude applies for a patent, gets a visit from dudes in the pentagon about it. in 1996 he was sued by hsi investors claiming it was not revolutionary - no evidnece allowed at trial and his testimony was not recorded due to a 'mess up' in the recorder. he was found guilt of fraud, had to repay investors. he had a dinner meeting with his brother and 2 NATO officials at a dinenr meeting. took a sip of cranberry juice and died, said 'ive been poisoned' and collapsed. it is on the police report. cause of death: anueyrism. YOWZA, greer tried to buy that guy;s science estate and was outbid by a silent bidder.

78) Laurence Rockafeller wants this info out i.e. disclosure apparently.

79) OFFICER X WITH A PIXELATED HEAD SAYS - there is a cover up, but the higher up i.e. probably the president don't even know there is one.  Had a meerting with some big NASA people, Edgar Mitchell, appollo astronauts. edgar mitchell helped Officer X do this? they talked to people in the pentagon and CIA -no one had any info. They met with CIA director with R James Woolsy.

80) CIA director said he had been denied access to these projects. Greer hands him ciopies of Bill Clinton's letters asking to be told about this, to no avail I guess. Woolsey denies the meeting ever took place.

81) Voice of former CIA director Willaim Colby says people react violently to these kind of charges and that lives have bene endangered. in 1996 he was found dead of drowning in the potomac, offical report claims suicide. He whistleblew on walls street investors in the magazine Startegic Investment as well so maybe thats why they got all murdery

82) Greer is in his thirties??? Christ he looks old as fuck

81) In 1997 Greer was in AZ preparing a video to show to congress, so he was there for the phoenix lights. cue phoenix lights phenomenon.

82) area Navajo tribe claims to have seen these lights for centuries -apparently the night before the phoenix lights they saw 6 - 7 lights circling along the horizon. whole tribe saw it.

83) Like a metric shitload of ppl saw these lights and fife symington was a dick about it on a press release, shit was not cash, we know this story. symington eventually retracted his statement and admitted to seeing it.

84) flying to barcelona to look at the little body with a woman with a TERRIBLE FACELIFT OMG

85) Doing a cat scan of it, but honestly I think Facelift is the alien, holy fuck her skin is stretched tighter than 

86) ok cat scan confirms this is a living creature beyond a shadow of a doubt, i think we knew that

87) standford scientist says he colleagues are giving him shit but he's taking it for the team. same for RoberT Jacobs but they give no fucks. Adam Curry also talking a bout the pressure from thier peer group not to do this kind of research - jesus everyone is talking about it.

88) MUFON interview ... tons of PHD's in MUFOn who want to do rigorous research. 

89) Greer tried to show congress members his evidence in 97 - but greer and his partner shari and the other people on his team were suddenly diagnosed with malignant cancer.

90) freaky.

91) guess she died not sure what happened to other team partners. aw i think he was in love with her aw this is sad. 

92) He says his NDE is what drives him to keep doing this despite obstacles.Of the three teamates diagnosed with cancer all at the same time, only Greer survived. Would love to know if that's true, because motherfucking freaky weird. Full name of partner was Shari Adamiak, died on Jan 20th 1998 at 9:50 AM MST. Someone  google that shit

93) GREER HAS NO FEAR OF YOUR SILLY SHIT GOV'T

94) okay now we are talking about consciousness - consciousness is external, brain is just a receiver. talking about random number generator experiments where ppl try to effect it with thier minds, they found it correlates to these tester's intention. works even if person is across the planet. consciousness is non local. dalai lama said some confusing shit about it

95) John Searl - had a circular magnetic device w energy and propulsion built into one unit. sued by electric company -he went to jail -his house with all his work burned.

96) Huge military involvement in the dept of energy - they have sequestered over 5000 patents taken out of the public domain, for ""nat'l security."" claiming this is supression of technology and is bullshit because it interferes with the free market system.

",66,16,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/dq16a/reddit_ufos_i_am_so_wrong_to_be_thinking_this_way/,"This is partly a response to the recent increase of nonsensical submissions to this sub-reddit. This sub-reddit, by its very nature, goes against the grain and roots of the Reddit community in general. However, I know a lot of us here are still critical thinkers. I also know a lot of us are here because we've seen something, or had a general interest in the subject matter. Yet there is still a consistent submission of garbage material and comments that only leads to the destruction of what little legitimacy the *serious* UFO community maintains.

I personally don't appreciate the infiltration of conspiracy theory material and its supporters on this sub-reddit. I am no moderator here but this sub-reddit is about UFO's, and we all know what that stands for. It is NOT about greys, reptilians, pleiadians, 2012, Alex Collier, raising our ""vibrations,"" or moving into some new density of human consciousness. 

To claim you know more than anyone else knows only puts you in the realm of the psychotic. Yet you still hold yourself higher than the rest. Thinking you have some ""secret knowledge,"" and if you can only get people to open their eyes to it they will see it too. But the problem is you know nothing, just like the rest of us.

I feel it is vastly important to maintain somewhat of a skeptical and logical outlook on these matters. Part of the validity that the media has in ridiculing the UFO community comes from so many of these outlandish claims. Sure, there may be a few individuals out there that know whats going on, but for every one of them, there is a countless number of people making this rubbish up. And countless more taking it at face value, and hive-minding in it. 

Now I am most certainly not opposed to thinking that UFO's are extraterrestrial in origin, or even something so far out of our understanding that we are without comprehension in regard to it. I am also not opposed to a majority of witness claims, of all varieties. But to claim right off that bat, that you, or the bat-shit insane blog you read has the insight that no other has, has the story, has the truth, is exactly what it is, insane. And it is giving us rational sky watchers a bad rep. 

So make your way over to abovetopsecret.com if you'd like to investigate and involve yourself in these far less than formal subjects. But please keep it out of here, and please, if you do go there, go with a few pinches of salt. As soon as you start assuming you ""know whats really going on here,"" or allowing the words of self proclaiming contactees or sages to infiltrate your thought process, you enter a wildly fantastical rabbit hole with no exit in sight. 

Not that some of that stuff isnt fun to read and think about, but come on guys, come on...

If UFOs had been viewed simply as things in the sky that are outside our scientific knowledge, Science would have been more apt to jump on the issue from day one and I believe we would be living in a much different world had the sensationalism been separated from the issue at the beginning. 

UFOs are simply things in the sky that are unidentified. When studied carefully, about 90% percent of reports are found to have earthy origins. This is not to downplay the significance of that other 10%. How much more credible would the extraterrestrial hypothesis be today if it's proponents were physical scientists who originally studied UFOs in hopes of discovering new atmospheric phenomena, but were forced to lean on the ETH after ruling out every other possibility? 

Come on reddit. Help get this idea out! 

It is sad that when a person says they saw something strange in the sky they are considered to have a screw loose. This mentality prevents talented Scientists and reporters from taking the issue seriously, and is massively successful at furthering the **plausible deniability** that shrouds this topic and keeps people laughing.

**A shift towards taking this issue seriously, I believe, would be greatly aided by fixing how we communicate in regards to it.** While it may seem too late, I believe great progress could be made in separating the extraterrestrial hypothesis from UFOs - both in furthering the ETH itself and in fields of atmospheric/meteorological/aerospace science.

""I believe in UFOs"" = ""I believe there are objects moving through our skies that are unidentified"" 

""I saw a UFO"" = ""I saw something in the sky that I have no explanation for"" 

**If you think you saw something under intelligent extraterrestrial control, say so! But don't assume to know, and instead, note the reasons why it did not fit in with earthly explanations you are familiar with**

The field of UFOolgy is plagued by the struggle for and against the ETH. Let us step back and start anew, let us not assume to know, and let us investigate this enigmatic phenomenon with as clear a lens as possible. For those that simply ""know,"" recognize that the greatest support for whatever your knowledge may be will pop out at you as you play the role of the scientist (investigator/enthusiast/etc.) who knows nothing.

I decided to share with you some of my personal experiences.

**Experience 1**

Date: October 1999  
Time: Approx 11:00pm EST  
Location: Burlington, Ontario, Canada  
Summary: At age 15, I experienced my first of 3 sightings. This sighting is of a black triangle shaped craft, moving rapidly in a North by North west direction. The triangles sides appeared to be equal with 3 orbs of light emitting from each corner.

The altitude of this craft is hard to state at this time I would have to say it was flying at or below commercial traffic levels, as it was not difficult to discern the edges of this craft.

This craft was moving silently through the air with no visible contrail or exhaust.  The vehicle moved across the sky and out of view in under 10 seconds at a high speed. I at this time an unable to provide a solid estimate of approx speed of the craft, but I would suggest It was travelling at a higher speed then a terrestrial craft known military/commercial.

***This was my first experience with unknown flying objects***

**Experience #2:**

Date: May 2001  
Time: Approx 3:00am EST  
Location: Burlington, Ontario, Canada  

This experience shook me to my core. I am going to summarize as succinctly as possible.  

At this time, I was 17 and had not had an experience since my initial sighting in #1. This was a frightening and disorientating event. It was early in the morning ~2am. I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache, which at the time I attributed to being up late. I decided to go to bed, my bed at the time and is a loft bed, which sits next to a 4'x2' window. I usually fell asleep with sports center on just for some white noise and sleep in just a T-shirt and underwear (this is imporant).My parents, due to bad grades had taken my remote for my television, which is why I would just leave it on over night......I am completely conscious,  I am completely aware...I had not fallen asleep, I do not believe I was suffering from sleep paralysis...as I lay down in bed my nausea and headache become less severe.    

This is when it happens...My room fills with radiant bright light...there is no sound, but I feel uneasy...I am able to turn my head just enough to see out of my window and the light is completely blinding me. I hear no noise and smell nothing...I can still hear sports center. My mind is struggling to understand what is happening, it feels like seconds. I am now unable to move but the hair on my arms begin to stand on end...the last thing i remember in my bedroom is looking down at my goose-bumped right arm.......    

I regain awareness in a supine position. I am unable to move but I am alert. I am not able to open my eyes but my eyes are still functioning under my closed eyelids...there is an intense and blinding light shining directly down on me. I am able to make out movement and shadows moving around me....silently...the only noise is a slight hum. I am laying on what to my sense of touch a metal/smooth apparatus. I am still unable to open my eyes, to move except my senses are fully functional. There is no smell...it smelt ""sterile"". I had a sharp pain near my left kidney, this is the last thing I recall before waking up...in my own bed....    

I woke up, startled, confused and pain-free. I rub where I had felt the sharp pain, it is not sensitive to touch with no obvious signs of foul play. My first instinct was to check where I was injured...I did not even realize that my Television was turned off and the T-shirt I wore to bed was gone until a few seconds after becoming aware...I get out of bed and it is well after 4am.     

The next morning, I ask my parents if they turned off my television in the night...they both said no. ~2 Months later I developed a scar over the area of my left kidney, this was not present prior to this and I did not have an injury which would cause it. 
This was so frightening to me that I only recently told my wife, it really caused me to reassess life and my own personal paradigm. I still struggle coming to terms with everything.    

I took a photo of my ""scar""...Its not easy taking a picture of your own back so sorry if its not too clear, but I circled the area for clarity....here is the link http://imgur.com/u3Q56q0   

TLDR: Saw Triangle UFO-2 years later had what I would describe as an abduction experience.

**I am just trying to share my experience with people with the best intentions, I struggled whether to post this or not but, If you have any Questions please ask**

I was smoking so my window was already open, I got up, watched for a minute, and then grabbed my Canon.

I have no idea what these lights in the sky were but I was hoping maybe someone on here could help me identify them.



Note: They did not move in position and I don't really remember watching them leave. If anything I just remember them fading away. I honestly forgot about the incident until earlier this year when I was browsing through my camera files.
I then uploaded it to YouTube and let it be, but have had no responses.

I have showed the video to close friends and family and they have no idea.

Hopefully someone in this community can help identify this UFO(s)

Thank you.

Throwaway account. Take this account or leave it. I don't have pictures or a video of this light in the sky so if thats what you're here for, keep moving. I'm not here to win the internet.

Here are the FACTS: I am a commercial pilot in the United States with almost 6 years of employment with my current company &amp; 4000 hours flighttime in my career. Last night (6/9/2013) at 2330 eastern time while flying westbound roughtly 40 miles south of Columbus, OH at 25,000 feet. We had been flying through high-overcast from the east coast all night and crossing into Ohio we came out of the clouds and the stars revealed themselves in the clear sky. Always a gorgeous sight at night when you turn down the insturment panel lights and take in the view of the night sky. 

Anyways, the sighting. The UAP was about 60-70 degrees above the horizon right off our nose (to the west &amp; HIGH in the sky) moving northwest. It was a glowing white light about the size of Venus and almost as bright as Venus. Having seen countless satellites cross the night sky from the cockpit and the ground in my life, I first thought this was just another satellite sighting. It wasn't ""zipping"" through the sky like you see in some UFO videos, but going at about the rate you see the ISS move through the night sky. (easy to follow with your finger if you point and follow.) I checked our TCAS to be sure it wasn't an aircraft, even though no standard identifyin strobes/anti-collision lights were displayed. No aircraft above us registering. THEN, it got weird. The light started to pulse as it moved across the night sky. And I only noticed this when it faded to black, then 3 seconds glowing white, followed by 4-5 seconds of ""off."" This continued until it faded into the sky to the northwest somewhere WNW of Colombus, OH. 

It's impossible to say at what altitude this object was. It was ABOVE us. The other pilot with me observed the UAP as well and we chatted about it, preserving our minute by minute accound on the cockpit voice recorder, should that ever get dug up in my company archives.

An Explanation? Well, I thought all night after we landed and decided that the best explanation was that I observed a rotating satellite. Perhaps a satellite was high enough above the earth to catch the sunlight (sun had set roughly 210 minutes prior) and as it rotated (like a football in a tight but slow spiral) the sunlight was glinting off panels/whatever makes up those satellites as certain sides of the satellite faced my direction thereby giving the illusion of a pulsing light overhead as it traversed the night sky overhead.

Now, the skeptic in me can't be certain of anything. I just know what I saw, and that in 4000 hours or flying (1000 of it at night) this was my first witness of something unexplained in the night sky. Perhaps someone here has a thought?",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_1g1kx0,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1g1kx0/sighting_over_ohio_us_692013/,

When I was about 9 years old (Currently 20) I woke up once in the middle of the night and went into my kitchen/ family room to get a drink. I looked out the window and there was a figure standing on the parkway, (the part of grass between the side walk and street) about 20 feet from the window I was looking out. He wore what appeared to be a cloak or something and was just standing there. About 3 minutes later I heard the sound of something hit the ground ( outside) and I ducked. When I looked again I saw a 2nd figure standing there, but he had a full set of wings , with about a 15 foot wing span (both stood about 7 foot tall) which he folded into a cloak, and they ""talked"". They didn't have mouths. They have a ""mouthpeice "" similar to the Bane Mask, large almond eyes, that were human like (white with pupils). They weren't making  any noise but there body made it seem that they were speaking. After about 5-10 minutes they unfolded they're wings ( the cloaks) and flew off , and they're was a bright flash in the sky, similar to heat lighting, and they were gone 

I know there wasn't a dream because the flash woke up my mother and brother and we all remember the flash , which they think was a freak lightning strike. Also, I think its important to say that while watching them I felt a we rid emotion. I felt unnaturally calm and safe. Like I was being watched over in a protective way. It was very odd and hard to understand 

I'm not sure what show exactly but some cartoon has a a character that resembles the creatures I saw , but the cartoon I assume is modern and I'm not aware of it. This happened in the summer of 2001. 

I just wanted to tell a community that wouldn't judge and lend a helping hand in understanding what I saw. ",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_11mxug,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/11mxug/aliens_or_angels/,

It followed them for a long while until the officers became uneasy/suspicious. They pulled over to let it pass, but instead it pulled up on them, parked, and two men in black got out. The officers noticed that van had special government plates. From what I remember they were harassed by the men in black, who were asking about the UFO incident that they'd been called to.

Finally the officers were let go, but one of the officers got the plate numbers and called in to see what the business was. Apparently the vehicle registered under that number was already parked outside a government office... in another state.

He also refuses to rush to conclusions about anything without some evidence first. A class act all the way; probably the most important researcher today in the field of ufology. His research is nothing short of exhaustive.

As he says, it's easy to jump up on a soapbox and give an opinion about various aspects of this phenomenon, but unless you've actually done the research that opinion holds little actual value.

I believe it was early Summer so it would have been roughly 9pm.  I was outside to feed my dogs which had an indoor/outdoor pen attached to a barn on our property.

On my way back to my house, which was approximately 1000 feet from the barn, I heard a hum.  I looked up and seen a perfect cube gliding across the sky very low to the ground, as in just above treeline.

It was traveling at a strange speed for aircraft, only about 30 mph or so.  It was covered in orange lights that weren't exactly blinking, more of fading in and out.  I immediately started bolting for my house so I could get my parents to see it but the craft suddenly gained speed and was far gone by the time I could reach my house.  When I say it gained speed I mean it jumped to well over 100 mph.

I can still remember every detail as if it were yesterday, mostly because I am still so intrigued about that night that I think about it all the time.

I found an article about an incident that is somewhat similar to mine about a British actor who claims to have seen basically the same thing.

So the general feeling I get from the responses, is that there is not any logical reasoning (as far as a human understanding of logic, however I would question there being any different type of logic to fathom, as all logic is math based and math is universal) for the behavior of being visible in the sky yet not making any obvious attempts at direct communication.

Years ago, Royce Myers started a website to track the people who are doing more damage to the field than good, and that website is;

http://www.ufowatchdog.com/

This website, which is no longer being updated, was run for quite some time by R. Myers and later on David Biedny, of Paracast fame.  They did their best to catalog those that are more interested in producing static than signal, they can be found here;

http://www.ufowatchdog.com/hall_of_shame.htm

They also made a much shorter list, their Hall of Fame, which gives credit to those that ARE interested in contributing value and reason to this field.  That list can be found here.

http://www.ufowatchdog.com/hall_of_fame.htm

Though this site is no longer worked on, it still holds a lot of useful information on people that cannot be trusted as well as those that can.  I think that these lists should be used to cut down on the amount of ""noise"" that we have to sift through in order to find ""signal"".  It may even be worthwhile with those with a deeper interest to contact either Myers or Biedny about picking up where they left off.

1356346391.0,41,self.UFOs,15dbx7,“People have been killed. People have been hurt. It’s more than observational kind of data.” -- Robert T. Bigelow,60,19,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15dbx7/people_have_been_killed_people_have_been_hurt_its/,"I'm sure most or all of you know who [Bigelow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bigelow) is but I'd never seen this quote from him so I figured I'd post it.

Here's a [link for the NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/science/space/08space.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) he's quoted in and here's an excerpt with some broader context:

&gt;His space stations are not his only interest in space. “I’ve been a researcher and student of U.F.O.’s for many, many years,” Mr. Bigelow said. “Anybody that does research, if people bother to do quality research, come away absolutely convinced. You don’t have to have personal encounters.”

&gt;He added: “People have been killed. People have been hurt. It’s more than observational kind of data.”

I was reading [Jack Sarfatti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Sarfatti)'s website and there was an [entry](http://stardrive.org/stardrive/index.php/blog/former-governor-jesse-ventura-cites-me-in-show-on-robert-bigelow-s-skinwalker-ranch.html) talking about how he was cited in an episode of *Conspiracy Theory* concerning Bigelow. I watched the episode and that's what led me to the NY Times quote.

Personally I thought their portrayal of Bigelow was pretty unfair and over the top but the show was interesting nonetheless.

Another interesting thing in that [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQVZ-4PCIA#t=9m35s) was that they say Dr. Sarfatti claims he was told by ""reliable sources"" that some of Bigelow's people who were investigating the [Skinwalker Ranch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinwalker_Ranch) were attacked by extraterrestrials.

In Sarfatti's entry I linked to previously he says ""*have no objection. What they summarized is completely true.*"" He goes on to say, ""*I was told by a CIA officer in 2004 to lie low on the story, which I did. So there is something real about it after all*"". 

One more thing to note is that in that episode of Conspiracy Theory they say that Bigelow was referring to the [Colares UFO flap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colares_UFO_flap) not to his own investigators when he referenced people being injured/killed to the NY Times.

Thoughts?

There are about 45 total hours of calls, and they are very very compelling. 

I'm actually really blown away how many well-documented multiple-witness accounts there have been. Pilots, military officers, air traffic controllers, police... amazing information that anyone interested in UFOs should review.

There are those who refuse to call witness testimony 'proof', and I personally think that this can be a very foolish conclusion to come to. I didn't hear a single witness in those reports who wasn't dead serious about what they saw, and I find the idea that they are just 'attention-seekers' absolutely ridiculous. These people were all very reluctant to be calling, and were both embarrassed and fearful of being seen as crazy thanks to years of ridicule from our society.

I can only guess that the people who dismiss these eyewitness reports as non-evidence are just really bad at understanding people's motives and at understanding human behavior in general.

You will hear some amazing hallmarks of valid accounts: fear, confusion, the desire to know if anyone else saw the UFO; immediate responses to pointed questions without any hesitation, the strong desire to get answers, and weirdest of all, their confusion about why nobody in government or military institutions has any interest at all in hearing about these sightings. Every single caller had basically been dumped on the NUFORC, and Robert Gribble just takes it all in stride and tries to reassure them.

I was thinking about perhaps uploading just raw unedited, original quality footage to some YouTube channel, if we could find some of them. But getting hold of the non-destroyed by re-rendering or editing is hard.

(this morning, actually, 3:17am) I had no idea what to do but I figured reddit probably had some subreddit for it and hey, here I am! I filed a report with the National UFO Reporting Center, since that's in the sidebar... 

But it was scary! I had to do something other than sit there and wonder. I already couldn't sleep. Might as well distract myself, right? 

I'm assuming you guys might appreciate reading my report and if you have any questions or you think I should do anything else, speak up! And I think it's safe to say some of you might have seen UFOs as well, right?

If I shouldn't in fact be posting this here, please show me out. Anyway, here's my report!

I couldn’t fall asleep, so I looked out my window and saw what looked like a star. It moved out of my sight, so I sat up in bed and split my blinds to see. At that point I realized this object was below the clouds (right at the bottom edge of the clouds because a few times it crossed into them slightly.) I kept watching and thought to myself that it must be a plane or helicopter, but no, then another appeared and I realized they were moving very smoothly in different directions. The movements were very subtle but I could tell they weren’t moving in a straight line like an airplane would because I compared their position to my blinds. They were kind of just white lights. I kept eye contact on one and realized it seemed to have one bright light (or big light) in the center and many small lights circling that, like a stereotypical flying saucer I guess. I think since it was so dark the lights were all I saw, and I really didn’t see a distinct body or shape, but because of the placement of the lights I could assume they were somewhat disc shaped and more convex at the top and bottom. They weren’t flat discs. (more like lemons from the side view.) I was the only observer from my point of view, but I hope that other people in my area saw these as well. [I took out the first sentence of background info because I don't want to give out that info here.] I suppose it might be useful to know that I’m perfectly healthy, physically and mentally. I also happen to have 20/20 vision, so that’s pretty nice. I also haven’t taken any drugs or medication, and I’m not dehydrated or starved. (I think that might be enough to rule out a hallucination, right?) I’ve always had an interest in UFO stories but seeing one right above my home was extremely nerve wracking. At this point I’m half-curious and half terrified, but I’m sure these visitors weren’t trying to harm us (Earth residents). They looked like they were observing us or taking note of something. The way they moved reminded me of the way someone would scan their eyes over their suitcase to make sure they had everything packed. (hopefully you can imagine that.) One last note, thank you to whoever keeps track of this site and thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. I had no idea this sort of service existed and right now I’m glad it does. 

I tried my best to be concise! And one last note, it was seen over southern NJ.

**Preliminary results:**

* Almost a half of the sightings are of lights in the sky;
* 1/4 of sightings is of a singular objects; 
* 5/6 of the sightings happened at evening-morning time;
* Half of the sightings lasted less than one minute;
* 70% percent of the sightings had one or more witnesses to the sighting except for the person reporting;
* In more than half of the cases there are no nearby military or civilian airspace installations;
* About 15%-20% of the sightings included unidentified objects performing maneuvers that our conventional aircraft aren't capable of;
* About 1/3 of the sighters reported that objects were either glowing or blinking or had other light effects to them;
* Observers couldn't correctly identify the size and distance to the object in most cases (this statement needs further investigation);
* 1/3 of responders had more than one sighting.

The results posted above or the ones in the end report won't be 100% accurate, as these are reports from regular folk and I'm not a professional. And as my current analysis shows, the reporters aren't much reliable on exact data (distance, speed, size of the objects) which impedes the analysis. I am currently half-way subjectively identifying all the reports. If someone wants to help me subjectively peer-review them, that would be great. There is much more work to be done before the results can be published in some info-graphical sense.

I wasn't expecting for such a huge reply, and I wasn't expecting that it would take so much time to run through all the data I gathered in a couple of days (because you have to imaginatively analyze every case). Thank you all for participating! Stay tuned for updates.

**Edit** Ok relax guys, when I refer to skeptics, I mean people that believe e-t's don't exist and won't have an open mind to the possibility that they have been in our planet. Also I'm referring to TROLLS that seem to be all over this subreddit. Also, I mind it mind boggling that so many of you subscribed to /r/Ufos are saying that ET's are bullshit.

1357249482.0,40,self.UFOs,15wstq,My brother saw a UFO in Rome Georgia. This is what he told me.,52,12,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15wstq/my_brother_saw_a_ufo_in_rome_georgia_this_is_what/,"My brother is 44 and doesn't believe in UFOs at all, but he and 2 of his friends just saw one and told me about the experience. 

He has never cared for science fiction, doesn't believe in aliens and doesn't pay attention to UFO sightings, abductions or anything in the realm of popular UFO culture. I was absolutely shocked when he told me what he saw. He is a sports guy with his head firmly on the ground.

A few weeks ago he was in Rome with some friends and they saw a cigar shaped UFO moving completely silently over a nearby road while they were sitting on the tailgate of his truck. He said it was so close he could have hit it with a rock, it was in sight for about a minute, but he has no idea what it was.

He described it as a ""long black tube with 2 lights, one on the front and one on the back."" He said the lights were tiny and dim, but if the lights weren't there he probably wouldn't have even noticed it going by. He said it was completely dead silent and moved steadily, there was no swaying movements from wind or anything to make it seem light like a baloon and it wasn't windy at all so it wasn't just floating on the wind. He said it was following the road going kind of slow, maybe 10 mph and was only about 20 feet off the ground. If there were power lines or street lights it would have run into them.

He said it was about 75 to 100 feet long and about as wide as the road. He said there was something on the sides like stubby wings or engines or something, but there was no noise so he doesn't think they were propellers.

He thinks it must have been some type of military blimp or secret aircraft. What's really annoying is that he is a photographer. But he said it was fully dark outside and even if he had his camera out it probably wouldn't have captured anything.

I figured I'd find a subreddit dedicated to UFOs and maybe find some kind of interesting discussion about this. Maybe someone has seen something similar?

My personal takeaway is very mixed. I used to love UFO stuff. I used to believe in the Roswell crash and I've researched the UFO phenomenon extensively. After years of searching I've come to be very skeptical of the whole thing. There are certainly strange sightings but i never thought someone so close to me would have such a bizarre sighting. 

I've rarely ever heard of someone being so close to a UFO. Most of the sighting are somewhat distant, just lights in the sky. He saw this thing right up close, with 2 other people and for a good length of time.

Or maybe the really crystal clear ones get left alone by the powers that be, because people will think they are just CGI these days - including myself.


Anyway, love to read other peoples take on this.


Edit:
OK, at time of writing I have had 66% of responders asking what my experience was, and I guess I should have started off with it, but I have stated it so many times on Reddit (and before that Digg) that I felt I would just be repeating myself... and I dare say after reading it, a few of you will remember it. Anyhow, here is a whole repost, from 2010.. with a few changes:


Everyone's a skeptic until they have seen one with their own eyes, and I'm sure some are hoaxes or mistaken celestial/man made objects.

There are a multitude of pilots, air traffic controllers and police officers who have filed reports, but that barely scratches the surface of sightings that go unreported. I know quite a few people who have seen objects in the sky that cannot be explained - this is far more common amongst the people i know in rural areas.


**Here is my own UFO experience:** Around Christmas 2006 (summer here in Australia), a friend and I were star gazing with my telescope at 3AM (its a good one with an 8"" mirror in it.) We decided to lay on the big mattress I has dragged out, so we could just gaze at the stars for awhile.

The object appeared from the SSE, traveled directly over us in an arc, and headed off in a NNE direction. (Heh, it was shaped pretty much like a Imperial Star Destroyer from underneath http://www.obh.snafu.de/~madley/starwars/dataimg/imperial_star_destroyer.gif ) , extremely massive, completely quiet and appeared to be at a very high altitude. There were lights underneath and some were flashing. Unfortunately, due to surrounding trees and and a nearby cliff, the object - which to us seemed to be moving super fast - was only visible for a short time, maybe 10-15 seconds/

 We don't know where it was from or who made it, but i'll tell you what it wasn't, it wasn't a fucking weather balloon, a normal plane, and it wasn't Jupiter.

My friend was convinced it was about 6-10Kilmeters long, while I thought it was only about 1-2kms... and a guy in this subreddit the other day saw something he described in the exact way, thought it was only 500meters long. I any case, thing was fucking huge.

At the time we thought it was a top secret military craft - to chunky for aliens IMHO - I reckon reverse engineered stuff.

I don't own this property anymore, but I did at the time of the sighting. For anyone interested, these are the co-ordinates, you can put it straight into Google Earth, and it'll show you our sighting location: 28°41'57.74""S 152°41'29.85""E

Edit 2: OK, I'm off to bed. Hope I find some interesting stories when I get up, and if anyone has left any questions for me, I will answer them then. o/  

Edit 3: Thank you to those who have shared or are sharing experiences/opinions. I know a lot of people feel their own sightings sound lame, or  that they can be easily debunked, but one day we will be vindicated. One day this shit is going to see the light of day - I'm giving it 5 years max before the cat is out of the bag.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,True,,,True,t3_jdcg8,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/jdcg8/dea_who_subscribes_to_rufos_because_of_personal/,

She was walking our dog and she looked up to see a very large v-shaped flying object flying very slowly. There were no lights, and she says she could barely see it. The only reason she saw it at all was that it passed near the moon and the light helped make it visible.

She says it moved very slowly, which raises some questions for me. She says the thing was BIG. If it was moving at a speed fast enough to fly like a conventional plane, then it would have to be far away from her to look to her like it was moving slowly. That would mean that it was HUGE, because it still looked big to her. The other alternative is that it was closer, but was moving slow. In which case it was utilizing some alternative technology.

A woman she works with says Luke Air Force Base runs drills at night with planes running with no lights. She says that many of the planes are very large, and are v-shaped. This is definitely a plausible explanation, but I wanted to shoot it out onto this subreddit to see if anyone had any thoughts/experiences. Does anyone have any possible pictures that I might be able to show my fiance to see if it looks like what she saw?

One last thing, she said it was silent. No noise at all. This could be because it was too far away to hear, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_109503,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/109503/large_vshaped_ufo_with_no_lights_over_phoenix_on/,

Stockholm, Sweden",45,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/17097y/saw_my_first_ufo_stockholm_sweden/,"I live in the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden, right next to the lake Mälaren. Planes fly above the house all the time, and in the distance, and have done so for as far as I can remember. So I'm quite familiar with how vehicles in the sky look and behave.

Yesterday, Sunday, I saw something during the evening (22:30). I was in the kitchen, with its windows to the south, looking over Mälaren. There was a bright red light, going from the west to the east, very quickly. At first I thought it was a helicopter, since it was flying very low. You could tell because it was cloudy, and the light was below the clouds (I'd say it was about 70 - 100 m above the ground). The lake froze recently, which means there will be accidents and therefore helicopters. This is not unusual, happens every year. But something didn't seem quite right about the light. I didn't recognize the way it behaved. The light (there was only one, very bright red light) didn't blink, which they always do as far as I know. Also, it was going so fast, and so straight! It looked odd. Aircraft usually don't go in a straight line exactly perpendicular to my view like that, especially not at that altitude.

Anyway. I decided to get out to the balcony for a better look. As soon as I got out, I was surprised I didn't hear any noise at all. I figured the only way it could've gone at that speed in my view, and with such a bright light, would be if it was close. But no noise what so ever. Also, if it was that close, I would've seen the body of the aircraft. I didn't. (Even though it was evening, it is quite bright at evenings because of all the snow, especially when it's cloudy since light is reflected from the city.) It was just an extremely bright, red light.

I just stood there, confused and trying to figure out what I saw. And then as it kept going east, it went out of sight. The whole thing maybe took 15 seconds. Depending on the distance, that may or may not be impressive in terms of speed. It was hard to judge the distance as the only thing I saw was a [rather big, as if close] point of light.

Not that I think it would have mattered, but unfortunately my cell phone was at the floor below. It didn't occur to me that I was seeing a UFO until afterwards, so I don't think I would've taken a photo in any case.

Absolutely not saying it was aliens. Just a strange craft I couldn't identify.

Any ideas?

TL;DR

sustained bright red light, no blinking, going from west to east at seemingly high velocity, no visible body, no sound, going in a straight line at maybe 100 m from the ground

edit:

looking at google maps, measuring and making calculations, a rough estimation of its velocity is 960 km/h (4km / 15s). If it was farther away than I think it was (500 m), that number would grow.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,1358844208.0,,,True,t3_17097y,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/17097y/saw_my_first_ufo_stockholm_sweden/,

The part I remember vividly is a scientist speaking about an experiment he was involved with where he went onto a ship with a blue light. It flashed and the next thing he knows, he's back in his lab with the other participants. the conductor of the experiment asked if everyone remembers where they went. The scientists claimed to have never went anywhere. The conductor then instructed everyone to reach in thei r pockets. When they did, they each pulled out rocks from a site many miles away. They were also given pictures of them putting the rocks in their pockets. It turns out the blue light was the source of energy that the ship ran on. It bent space and time, launching them many miles away. When they returned, a side effect was memory loss. 

This is the most I can remember. Please help! I'll also xpost on r/tomt.

1347560930.0,39,self.UFOs,zu1we,"So in June I had my first official sighting.  Anyone available for tech help from my video?  Also, there is some really interesting stuff in regards to frequencies I experienced during the sighting...",42,3,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/zu1we/so_in_june_i_had_my_first_official_sighting/,"I am happy to answer all questions and I really don't care what haters or skeptics have to say.  I have no reason to lie and I am here looking for help, not criticism.

If you are still reading this: I took a video (that doesn't do what I saw justice, of course) with my iPhone and was wondering if someone can somehow enlarge the ship or take screen shots from the video or whatever. 

I was sitting outside my house one night this Summer going through some texts in my phone and waiting for a friend to get to my house for an evening walk.  Suddenly I became aware of my iTunes or Pandora being too loud on my phone and-- even though I mentally reminded myself that I hadn't been listening to music I turned my phone over in my hand to address the volume button.  Immediately my ears picked up on the realization that the noise wasn't coming from my speaker as soon as I rotated my phone and in that instant I was physically disabled by such a high pitch frequency that I was left in crippling pain.  

Since I live on a main road, I looked around to see if anybody in a car or any pedestrians were also aware of what was happening.  At this point, I had assessed that the super high frequency was wholly alternating between my right ear and my left ear and it was so loud it seemed as if people were blasting speakers playing idiots blowing lifeguard whistles right into the mic.  The next second my eyes focused straight in front and to the sky and I saw a ship that appeared to be engulfed in orange twisting flames.  At times it looked like it was diamond-shaped and other times it like like a triangle or even a 
merkaba.  It was in between my house and a shopping center on a hilltop that is a few miles from my house.  I watched in disbelief until an inner voice screamed to grab my phone and film it.  Which I did.  As the craft glided through the night air it seemed to illuminate quickly and then get dim.  Upon it getting closer to me I realized that it was a surface of orange flame, and would actually get dim as the craft moved and it left behind a fiery tail and when the craft stopped in it's new location the flame tail would catch up and illuminate the spinning object very brightly before evening out the flames and appearing to go dim again. 

Another really interesting thing is that I was aware of two frequencies resonating during the time.  There was the ultra-abrasive high pitched one and there was a lower tone that reminded me of morse code and was not as consistent.  And the millisecond my eyes locked onto the ship, the painful aspect of the high-pitched frequency disappeared entirely.  I sent the vid to a friend who checked out the audio and listened to some different frequency ranges but who is oddly enough not really interested in UFOs.  

I had some mishaps trying to save the file to my computer and send the file to a friend.  A few other things have happened involving different times of day and other methods of contact.  If there is any way someone can do a screen show or look more into the audio of it I would greatly appreciate some technical help.  Also, I know that I have stumbled across some amazing subReddits that were really properly referenced for small but still relevant/helpful communities and if anybody knows of any that can help with tech stuff I would greatly appreciate it!

They would likely know who Jon Stewart is, the status of our economy, and would likely read our literature and such. I feel like most people don't keep this in mind. Extraterrestrials would likely understand human behavior very well, and might even enjoy the same music as us, or root for a specific soccer team. Kind of makes you feel like we may be a sort of extended community.

Who knows, they might even be redditors? They would likely be able to find a way to tap into our broadband and interact with us through the web. Although, with that in mind, I would imagine there would be a lot more ""Pro-Extraterrestrial"" type media and opinions being perpetuated rather than trying to slowly reveal themselves through sightings like we hypothesize. I think the fact that we don't see it is sort of a bullet point for disbelievers... and it's hard to argue with that.

Regardless, there's still a lot of unexplained stuff out there, and I lean toward being a believer. I'll note, though, that I'm agnostic on the subject.. and I could never say that aliens are 'definitely' visiting us, but there is very compelling anecdotal evidence to keep in mind.

1343662974.0,39,self.UFOs,xe8l4,Why attribute ancient structures and complex crop circles to extraterrestrials?,55,16,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/xe8l4/why_attribute_ancient_structures_and_complex_crop/,"Some of the below has excerpts from previous posts I've made, only because it wouldn't make sense to retype what I've already formulated. My hope is that we could all have a measured discussion about all of this in a way that helps to either eliminate old falsehoods or reveal new truths.

From the [Crabwood crop circle](http://mmmgroup2.altervista.org/e-crab.html) to the Egyptian pyramids, I often read posts here in /r/UFOs making claims that some structures and crop circles are ""too complex"" to be attributed to human beings. I don't understand this claim, and I'm going to describe why as succinctly as I can without sacrificing source data.

I trust we can all acknowledge that there have always been mathematicians, astronomers, engineers, and supernatural beliefs in our known human history. They had, biologically, the same brains that you and I do, and they were capable of thinking about the same concepts that you and I think about today. Despite this, some claim that there's *no way* that we had the knowledge to achieve what we've achieved without extraterrestrial interference. I maintain that this suggestion severely underestimates the intelligence of our predecessors, and dismisses what we know human beings can accomplish when they are focused, inspired, and in groups.

Eratosthenes, an ancient Greek who essentially invented geography, guessed the diameter of the Earth with 75% accuracy in one measurement and 98% accuracy in another. He did this several hundred years before the time of Jesus, and [he did it by referencing shadows on the ground during the summer solstice and using a bit of math](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Eratosthenes.27_measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference). Seriously! And even before that, Anaximander (who got many things *very* wrong) suggested [an early form of evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander#Origin_of_humankind), placing the origin of human beings in water. He was right.

Just because we understand how the pyramids ([Egyptian, Aztec, and Mayan](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080328104302.htm)) were built doesn't make them any less impressive. Still, not too long ago, a carpenter [built his own Stonehenge in his backyard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCvx5gSnfW4). No assistance needed. Sometimes I wonder if the only reason that the Taj Majal isn't connected with ancient alien theories is because it was built in the 1600's!

These weren't premature humans building the pyramids, accurately guessing the circumference of the Earth, discovering the digit zero, figuring out that willow bark helps with pain, or observing the skies to create extremely accurate calendars. They were just like you and I. However, most explanations of observed phenomena in the old texts are very clear: we really, *really* had no idea what was going on around us. Consider that until [Germ Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory), illnesses were still widely attributed to punishment from God and/or demons. This was *less than 200 years ago!* Incredibly, some people still believe this. Exorcisms still actually happen.

Consider this, as well: as late as the turn of the 18th century (the 1690's), human beings were being tortured and executed in the Americas because people really, truly believed that witches, warlocks, familiars, hexes, demons, and magic existed. What was their evidence? Well, crops died sometimes. A cow would fall ill. A person would have a mole or birthmark. Epilepsy meant demonic possession. Can you imagine being lit aflame in your town square just because there was a lightning storm after you had an argument with a neighbor? Or hog-tied and tossed in a river to see if you sank or swim, the results of which would prove or disprove your mystical powers? And it didn't stop in the 1690's! People are still executed for these things today in parts of the world. Conspicuously, they mostly take place in less-educated cultures.

So everywhere we look, we see astounding feats of engineering and mathematics, and we also see astounding ignorance fueled by intuition and superstition. The kicker is that most of these feats of architecture were undertaken in reverence of and because of these superstitions. They are intertwined.

And now, in 2012, we are looking at various types of geometric designs pressed into wheat fields and stating that they're too complicated, too encoded with mathematics, too expansive to be designed and discreetly implemented by us in the dead of night. It makes no difference that [we already know how they're created](http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/unexplained-phenomena/crop-circle.htm). It makes no difference that we can look around at all of the amazing, earthly achievements that human beings have made all by themselves. The supernatural penchant of our predecessors remains in us, and much like a stagnant pool of water to mosquitoes, this is a perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories.

I don't want to discuss conspiracy theories, and here's why: conspiracy theories are not confined by supported evidence. The arguments available to support a conspiracy theory are only limited by the theory-holder's imagination. In this world, complexity is heaped upon complexity without an afterthought in order to preserve the theory. It's endlessly circular. Conspiracy theories are impervious to reason, and that's why they can't die.

Sometimes it seems as if discussions about UFOs are akin to fussing about the details of the 10th floor when the first floor isn't even finished being constructed yet. There are countless books and internet posts making claims to knowledge that depend upon us *not* being alone in the universe, even though we have no idea if there is life elsewhere in the universe. I'm not talking about what we believe, or what we think, or what we wish to be true, or what we assume or surmise or deduce. I'm talking about what we *know*.

With all of this considered, I'm interested to hear why some feel that the most eloquent and likely explanation for ancient structures and complex crop circles is extra-terrestrial intervention.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_xe8l4,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/xe8l4/why_attribute_ancient_structures_and_complex_crop/,

1331770891.0,41,self.UFOs,qx0ad,"The government's ""Fear of mass panic"" excuse has always been nothing but a total manipulative lie.",52,11,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/qx0ad/the_governments_fear_of_mass_panic_excuse_has/,"Quite a while back I realized that it's a complete lie on the government's part to site mass panic as the reason why nothing has ever been officially disclosed on ET and UFO activity on this planet.

Disclosure or ET visitation wouldn't cause the kind of ""mass panic"" that the government has gotten everyone to believe is the reason they can't say anything about it.  Constant fear has been drummed up in the population for generations, as the establishment and the MSM have done almost nothing for decades but paint ET existence in either an overtly negative and evil light, or in a light of confusion and mystery - which invites fear as well.

The *actual* reason that nothing has been disclosed, of course, is not because of fear of mass panic, but because SO much other hidden bullshit would have to be explained relating to government manipulation and literal *culling* of the masses that the people would once and for all realize just how evil and against everyone the government and establishment really is.  Everything the MSM has presented is nothing but covert brain washing that the populace has been conditioned to accept.  As a result, everyone has bought into it and has sad ""Yes!  There WILL be mass panic!!""

Nothing could be further from the actual truth, however.  It has nothing to do with ""fear of mass panic"".  Granted some people and groups will indeed freak out, but nothing warranting any sort of ""national emergency"" will happen.  Even if people *didn't* know much of anything about ET existence and their reality were disclosed, there wouldn't be sufficient public panic.  Now that a good portion of the population DOES know about the phenomenon, however?  Even less so would there be any panic over it.

The fact of the matter is that everything has been drummed up and manipulated into the people by the establishment so that the people don't question any further past the government's excuse that the reason nothing's been disclosed is because it would cause ""mass panic"".

It's time that everyone break out of the lie and the illusion and realize that the real reason is because of all the very real questions the government would be asked and would have to answer if they were to reveal that they've been covering everything up for so long.  The entirety of society - of civilization, for that matter - will be shown to be a construction of lies manipulated by a select few to control everyone else.

THAT'S what disclosure will reveal.

The ""mass panic"" that would occur wouldn't be mass panic as the population reacts to the existence of extraterrestrials.  It would be mass panic as the population reacts to how much of a complete and utter fabricated lie their lives and everything they've been taught to believe as citizens had always been at the hands of the government and the elites.

For this reason, the government of it's OWN accord will likely NEVER disclose anything.

Granted, the truth of E.T. existence and visitation on this planet is on its way out all the same, but it will not happen via the establishment/the government.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,True,,,True,t3_qx0ad,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/qx0ad/the_governments_fear_of_mass_panic_excuse_has/,

I have sleeping disorders and shit that keep me awake until like 4 am every night... so one night around 1am I was out on our dock, watching planes come in with my friend.

I've always been able to notice helicopters coming long before actually hearing them. Anyways.. I heard a helicopter coming towards us, so I started looking around for it. I turned around, and there were these lights moving north over my house.

It was triangle shaped and fucking massive. I know it's really hard to get a size reference of something that's in the sky... but really this thing was enormous. I would guess the size [height] of a 2 story building. One white light on each corner, and a large red pulsating light on the bottom. The lights on each corner were pulsating too, but the red one would actually fade out and come back on, while the white ones just kinda brightened and faded. It was moving towards one of the points of its triangle. After we watched it move over the house for like 20 seconds, it stopped, and froze in mid-air, and began moving in a completely DIFFERENT direction (it's orientation never changed) - headed off in a kind of easterly direction, in the direction another one of it's points was facing. It didn't turn, just straight lines towards it's points. Hard to explain :/ 

Anyways, about that time the helicopter I heard came over the trees/river from the same direction as the object on an almost identical flight path. All that time I thought this thing was creating rotor pressure, and I realize it's completely silent and this helicopter is following or chasing it... 


---


It was the strangest night of my life. I'm really glad I had another witness with me, or I would probably think I made it up :/

I saw a white, rod shaped light in the sky, and it was just hanging there vertically.  I watched it for about 3 minutes, trying to explain it away as possibly a jet and its tail... but during that whole time it did not appear to move from my perspective.  There were 4 jets in the sky, all of which had clear tails and long tails.  The tails of the jets appeared longer than the craft.

At first I really thought it could be a jet going upwards and the tail trailing it but it didn't look like that.  During the whole time I watched it, what I thought was the tail did not fade or grow longer.  It was just **hanging in the air**.  2 of the jets in the sky were flying straight towards it, one significantly behind the other but still going the exact same direction.  I turned my back on it and started walking home because I was very close to my home and wanted my Mom to have a look at it.  I kept looking over my shoulder every 15 seconds or so to make sure it was still there.  But within about 90 seconds, it was just gone.  The jet had caught up to where the rod shaped craft was, but it seemed as though it disappeared before it got too close, and the jet eventually overtook the position of where it had been only seconds ago.  

It looked like one of those bar shaped UFOs that had been seen flying into the volcano, or the ones people have been seeing that are just floating in the sky.  But I was further away from it than in those videos.

I can't explain how it appeared not to move the whole time I was looking at it.  I can't explain how it suddenly disappeared without leaving any trail.  This was right at dusk, just about ten or fifteen minutes before the sun fully went down.  I have seen lots of satellites, even seen the space station at night.  This was definitely not that.  I don't think it could have been a flare, because of the bar shape.  It was brighter than the remaining light coming from the sun.  

If anyone has any way to explain this away what I saw I am open to suggestions, but I truly have no idea what it could have been.  It just hung there, brightly illuminated, and just seemed to disappear.  One last thing is that as I watched it, all of a sudden it seemed to have a faint pinkish glow, but I think that has more to do with the way the setting sunlight was hitting it.  It was hanging over the Ozark Mountains, in an area where there are no structures around.  

Thought I ought to report it.  This is the first one I have ever seen. And before someone asks, **No it was not a freaking meteor**.

Sorry for being long winded, I was trying to include as many details as possible. ",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_14tari,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14tari/just_saw_something_in_the_sky_i_cant_explain/,

I really think it is haunting him or something, as he watches UFO docos all the time.

It is the late 1970's (he can't remember the exact year) and he is in his 30's. He is living on the Central Coast with his wife, and one day he walks outside and sees this disc in the sky. The first thing he says is ""So that's what a UFO looks like?""

He describes this 'disc' as big as a house, about 500 metres from him over a hill. He said the sun was glinting off the side, it is pure silver and made no sound whatsoever. It hovered there for about 20 mins, enough time for his wife to come home and see it as well. He called his elderly neighbour over to show her, and they stand there stunned. 

When the 20 mins is up, it starts to slowly move. He says ""Look, it's starting to go! I wonder why?"" He said it moved slowly at first, and then seemed to hit the accelerator and it was like warp speed. Within around 4 seconds it is a pinprick in the distance. He is flabbergasted, as nothing human made could go so fast. 

Then, around 5 minutes later, a plane flies overhead, right where the UFO was sitting. My father in law deduced that the UFO took off knowing a plane was coming, and would go right past its location. 

When he tells this story, he says it is as fresh in his mind as if it happened yesterday. 

This has made me question everything. I never was a massive UFO believer, but I do believe something is out there now. My mother in law has had her own experiences as well.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,t3_y94ld,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/y94ld/a_ufo_experience_from_my_father_in_law/,

I believe there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that proves there are unexplained phenomenon in our skies.  I accept as fact that governments around the world have expended great amounts of resources investigating and researching UFOs and to complicate matters some of these governments are simply fronts for the military industrial complex and the controlling elite.  

Obviously this is an over-simplification but it's a good approximation of how I feel about the matter. But once someone starts talking about hypnosis I get suspicious.  When I hear that someone has interacted with an alien species I am down right incredulous.  Not to say it's impossible.  Not to say it hasn't happened.  I'm just saying that I am extremely skeptical.  That is where I draw the line.

She was two years ahead me, a senior about to graduate, while I was a sophomore, still obsessed with partying and was quite happy to have bagged a sophisticated senior blond. As part of the normal courtship process we naturally told each other about random events in our childhood. At one point during the courtship she told me a story about her childhood (and I quote verbatim here to the best of my memory): 

""I was in my bedroom. I was trying to fall asleep when wolves circled my bed. I was terrified. But then a light came through the wall it seemed like the light was a fairy to me trying to distract me from the wolves.""

So I overlooked this, thinking it was just a feverish nightmare. I placated her and told her I believed her and we moved on and eventually married. After all, this was basically us telling ""ghost stories"" around a camp fire. 

Fast forward 20 years. We've been married long enough that we could pick each others' buggers and not flinch. Neither one of us is religious or really thought about UFOs. At any rate, for some reason I stumble upon a John Mack documentary about children in Zimbabwe. I was slightly intrigued, but I'm a natural skeptic so kind of ignored it. But I clicked a few more of the youtube videos about John Mack. At one point there was a video of him talking about greys circling the bed and a light coming through the wall. I don't know why but it triggered the 20 year old memory of my wife's story. When she got home, I showed her the video without telling her why I was showing her. She freaked out and made the connection immediately.

The ONLY thing in this scenario that differentiates this from the other stories I've read is that she was a child, told the story to me in childish terms she best understood the events to have happened in before alien abduction was a media story, and before either of us had heard about alien abductions.

Honestly, I'm a skeptic, but I thought you guys could deal with this better than me. My wife is still uneasy about the idea that it was greys, but she likes the idea better than her previous explanation that it was some demonic being stalking her bed. Whatever the case, if it is greys they better not be tracking her because I sleep next to her and I'm not keen on having ""grey wolves"" circle my bed in the middle of the night.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,1357700551.0,,,True,t3_16842r,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/16842r/i_noticed_there_were_a_number_of_greys_posts/,

Last night I told my friend who spent nearly 20 years in TE air force about it and he said the only base in California that can house a craft that large is Travis air force base, the direction it was headed when I saw it.


Anyways he called his friend who is stationed there and this is what he was told

They took a B-52 and filled in the space between the wings to make it a triangle, the cool part is the reason it is so quiet is it actually flies with it's ENGINES OFF! It uses electric fields lined up in 45% striations in the front it is positively charged and the striations in the back are negatively charged. It creates a ""Mountain shaped"" field with the peak in the back and low point in That pushes the aircraft along. The reason they fly it over residential areas and so low is they are testing how different terrains and electric fields from houses and such affect it's own field.

Wondering if anyone else saw it, where to report it.",47,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/130lzd/i_witnessed_a_ufo_in_st_charles_mo_wondering_if/,"Hey everyone - first time poster in this sub, but I figured it would be the best place to go.

On Friday night (11/9) at around 7:30-7:45 local time I stepped outside to have a cigarette before getting ready to go to a movie at 8:30. My girlfriend and I were standing on our back porch which looks out to the Northeast. Just as we were about to go inside, I noticed off in the distance a string of four red/orange lights in the sky.

I stopped for a moment and then pointed them out to her. As we stood and watched, the lights began to move from East to West, keeping the same distance from each other and moving the same speed.

We have several trees in our back yard and a several houses behind ours, but these things were just in the perfect spot where we could see them clearly. As we watched for a few seconds, we noticed the one that was farthest West went behind a tree and we could no longer see it, but as they continued to move, it never reappeared. At the same time, another light appeared from the East side moving in formation with the rest.

This continued for a couple of more minutes. As one would disappear to the left side, another would appear on the right. It looked as if these lights were all part of one giant thing that was rotating in the sky. The lights themselves were moving in a semi-circle, but would never leave the path.

After a couple of more minutes, my friends who I was going to the movie with came out to see what was taking me so long and I pointed the lights out to them. The immediately agreed that it wasn't normal and stood with us watching for another five minutes. 

Before long several of the lights never returned. Soon it was just one light moving across the path until that one disappeared as well.

The lights themselves were just a solid red-orange color. They did not change color, blink or change size.

Where we live we see planes going in for a landing at the airport all the time and it certainly was not a plane or a helicopter. Just taking a stab in the dark, based on the fact that planes were flying through the sky, I would say it was probably a good 10 to 15 miles away from us. Based on where we were looking and how far away I think it was, it must have been near the [Marais Temps Clair Conservation Area](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Marais+Temps+Clair+Conservation+Area&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9uGfUIi6K4eq2QWyzoD4DA&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAA).

Has anyone heard of anything like this in the area over the weekend? I would also like to report this to someone who would care (MUFON, any other groups I don't know about) but not sure how to go about it. Any tips?

1345048747.0,37,self.UFOs,y9o0i,On the probability of extraterrestrial visitation and the astronomical distances between stars,49,12,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/y9o0i/on_the_probability_of_extraterrestrial_visitation/,"I think, sometimes, astronomical distances are lost in our dialogues when considering extraterrestrial visitation. I'm hoping we could all bounce some ideas around.

Let's start with some basic arithmetic to figure out how far away the next closest star is. We know that the closest star to Earth, Sol, is approximately 8 light minutes away. The next closest star is Proxima Centauri, which is approximately 4.24 light years away. Light travels at a speed of 299,792 kilometers (or 186,282 miles) per second. This is approximately equivalent to 9.46 trillion kilometers (or 5.87 trillion miles) per year. This places Proxima Centauri, our next closest star, approximately 40.1 trillion kilometers (or 24.9 trillion miles) away from Earth.

Instead of star-to-star, let's go galaxy-to-galaxy. The Andromeda galaxy is 2.54 million light years away from Earth, and is our closest galactic neighbor. As we can only see [about 10 other galaxies with our naked eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies#List_of_naked-eye_galaxies), nearly everything that you can see in the night sky is a tiny little sliver of our local Milky Way galaxy. Our immediate solar neighbor, Proxima Centauri, is only [one of approximately 200 billion stars](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980317b.html) in our Milky Way galaxy, which stretches approximately 100,000 light years in diameter and about 1000 light years thick. When the Hubble Deep Field image was returned to us in 1996, covering [a speck of the sky only about the width of a dime 75 feet away](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01), we could observe about 1500 galaxies in this one image. When the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field image was returned to us in 2004, covering an area in our night sky [smaller than a 1mm by 1mm square of paper held at 1 meter away, and equal to roughly one thirteen-millionth of the total area of the sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field), we could observe about 10,000 galaxies. Using these measurements, the amount of galaxies in our observable universe hovers in the hundreds of billions.

We'll take the fastest, furtherest man-made object and compare. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 is currently traveling at a speed of about 61,479 kilometers (or 38,201 miles) per hour, and as of March 2012, was about 17.9 billion kilometers (or 11.1 billion miles) away from our sun. It is now traversing through the heliosheath, and is expected to be the first man-made craft to leave our solar system and enter interstellar space [within a decade](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html). If Voyager 1 were to travel the 4.24 light years to Proxima Centauri, it would arrive in approximately [the year 74012 A.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel#Interstellar_distances) If Voyager 1 were to travel the 2.54 million light years to Andromeda, it would arrive in... well, it doesn't really matter. The numbers are nearly inconceivable. And that's just travel to our nearest galaxy. It boggles the human mind to consider such distances when we only evolved to perceive the speeds and distances one would see on foot in the African savannah.

In order to accurately measure distances between the Milky Way and even further galaxies, we have to factor in the [metric expansion of space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space), which is a term used to describe our observation that distances between all fixed points in the universe are increasing. This is measured in parsecs, which is a unit of length used in astronomy. A parsec is equivalent to about 3.26 light years. For every additional megaparsec (or one million parsecs, or 3.26 million light years) that a galaxy is from Earth, said galaxy appears to be traveling 265,680 kilometers (or 165,086 miles) per hour faster [away from us](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/cosmic-expansion.html). Andromeda falls short of a megaparsec by about 220,859 light years, and it's actually moving towards us. In local measurements (like the 0.77 megaparsec hop-skip-jump from the Milky Way to Andromeda), gravity always wins. In astronomical measurements, it's much different, because in the big picture, everything in the universe is moving away from everything else. This means that if we were to leave Earth right now and start traveling to a galaxy 5 megaparsecs away, it will be traveling away from Earth at the rate of 1,328,400 kilometers (or 825,430 miles) per hour at the start of our trip, and we'll have to factor that in if we're to estimate the length of our journey with any accuracy. The first problem would be figuring out a way to catch up to it!

To paraphrase Neil deGrasse Tyson, to claim that that there is no life elsewhere in the universe is like walking up to the ocean, dipping a pint glass into it, holding the glass up to the sun, peering through the saltwalter contents, and exclaiming with certainty that there is no such thing as whales. Based on our most recent measurements, our universe is [flat and infinite](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html). That's infinitely more than enough space to accommodate other life forms. Yet [we haven't found life elsewhere](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_life.html), and thanks to the truly astronomical distances between solar systems, it's genuinely possible that we never will. Perhaps one of the universal unanswerable questions for all life forms to ask for eternity is: Are we alone?

So, without invoking knowledge-gap speculation regarding theoretical space-time wormholes or black hole travel or ""extra-dimensional entities"" unrestricted by the laws of physics, how do we rectify the issue of distance when considering the possibility that life forms from elsewhere in our universe are visiting us?

**EDIT**: If any of my math is wrong, please correct me!

To be fair I have always believed in Aliens, but during high school I watched a UFO documentary one night (Seeing is Believing) and sketched out some pictures of people pointing at the Triangle shaped UFO that was seen over Belgium in the late 80's, during the Belgian wave. I decided to include these sketches in my portfolio that I sent off to many of the art colleges I was applying to. I got a reply from the Northwest College of Art in Poulsbo Washington, and set up my interview time.

The interview was with 3 older people, two women, and one older man, all were between the ages of 50 to late 60's, the man being the oldest. The interview was going well, going over my paintings, and sketches, when the man (who had been holding one of my sketches the whole interview) flipped it over. The sketch of the Triangle UFO from the ""Belgian Wave"" layed in front of me.

""I am curious about this one..."" the older man said. I looked at him and smiled, and began in on the back story to the ""Belgian Wave"". I continued and about mid way through the story he interrupted and said ""It never happened"" I just gave him an odd look and said ""Ok"" and we were all quiet for a little bit, until he said ""At least that is what we were supposed to tell people. I was stationed there during the years of 1987-1991."" I was a little shocked by his answer and said ""Oh' really?"" and he replied ""I did see it, and it was big, it was able to hover and move slowly without a sound."". One of the older ladies looked at him and said ""You never told us this"" and he said ""I wasn't supposed to tell anyone, but this sketch reminded me of it, and UFO's aren't really a secret anymore."".

The interview went on, but I was so side tracked and couldn't get that out of my mind for the rest of the interview. I do not remember his name, but thought it was an interesting share.",,False,self,t5_2qhds,True,,,True,t3_mdtim,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/mdtim/what_got_me_interested/,

When I was about 16 years old my mother told me about seeing a UFO following her car. I was pretty dumb back then and made fun of her. Tried to explain it away as a light ray of some club/disco moving across the cloud, or whatever. Today I'm 22. Over the last months reddit made me very curious about the true nature of UFOs. So today on a car trip, 6 years later, I questioned her about it. I didn't expect anything, just her talking about some light moving across the sky... but listen. The first thing I noticed was that she was afraid to be made fun of again, but she kept going. She told me she saw a light traveling in some distance along her car. First it looked like some kind of plane to her, but then the object accelerated very fast and stopped in front of her. I asked her how far away it was, she said about hundred meters. I asked her how high but she didn't answer. I asked her once again how high it was flying and she said it was on the street... I thought to myself ""HOLY SHIT, THE OBJECT LANDED/HOVERED ON THE FUCKING STREET HUNDRED METERS IN FRONT OF HER!"" Holy shit, my mind was blown away from that point. But I was very calm on the outside and I wanted to keep asking her questions. I asked her if it was hovering above the street but didn't got an answer. She was kind of lost in thoughts like someone who's reliving an experience. I asked her what happened next. She told me she stopped her car out of fear because she heard about people who got abducted by UFOs. I asked her how long she stayed there and if other cars were around. She didn't answer and asked once again, then she said half an hour (and only gave me some vague answer to the other question). And I thought to myself once again ""holy fuck, she waited half an hour in front of a ufo"". I asked her if she experienced missing time but she didn't really answer, I asked her how it flew away but she was really lost in thoughts from that point on. We started talking about UFOs in general and I told her they are most likely here in order to observe and protect the evolution on earth. She said people are afraid because they don't look like us but they are most likely afraid of us too because we don't look like them, I asked her if she has seen an alien (in the UFO) but she denied it (I'm not 100% convinced that she's telling me the whole story, just like 6 years ago). I told her then that we should focus on what we and them have in common and not on the differences, they may have families, just like us. And that's it. She had to do some business and got out of the car. I don't really want to start another conversation right now because she didn't seem so comfortable talking about her experience. But my curiosity can't be stopped and I'll ask her later/within the next days more questions, like for example: Was the object hovering above the street or did it land; how big was the object; how did it look like; how did it flew away.

1372973508.0,33,self.UFOs,1hnnf4,I am almost convinced I witnessed a UFO last night on live television and have captured video evidence.,52,19,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hnnf4/i_am_almost_convinced_i_witnessed_a_ufo_last/,"Let me quickly debrief and explain what you are about to see.

At approx 10:15 pm est, July 3rd, Columbus, Ohio:

I was watching the fireworks on television, Columbus' annual Red, White, and Boom. Here is a picture of the Columbus skyline at night. LINK for reference as to its position. 

http://imgur.com/M00Xss2

As the fireworks were finishing up and beginning to make their way into the grand finale, I noticed what appeared to a very bright star above the skyline. This struck me as odd right away because one cannot see stars when you are watching from a t.v. In addition, the light from the fireworks made the sky glow so the stars were definitely out of any eyesight and other people watching can clarify that. So I guessed the object to be relatively the size of a small commercial plane. Why? It was first hard to perceive its size but there were two commercial planes that crossed directly in front of the object. When they passed, they were flying what appeared to be at or near the same altitude because the plane would block out the light when passing. Then obviously the object would reappear after it the plane passed by. What made it strange to me was it was completely motionless and stationary. The LeVeque tower is the tallest building skyscraper in Columbus with the patriotic colors displayed It appeared to be directly above the skyscraper from what I could tell. In full speed it was literally just a hovering light. So I decided to turn back my DVR and recapture the moment in slow motion or what im guessing to be half the speed. THIS is what I captured. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFgy8EqdnLk

I apologize for how shaky and out of focus the first video is, the second video you will see with much more clarity. I really wanted to include the skyline for reference though for ya guys!

What you are witnessing is lights that are pulsing in which almost looks like a pattern if you view it a couple times. The little quick flashes of lights I am convinced are constantly being emitted from the object. I questioned whether (since it was on t.v.) or not the television feed/frame was catching up and manipulating or refracting the main light, as if it was becoming pixelated. None of the frames, the dark space/sky around the object, or lights became distorted in any way. Not once. 

I posted the video on Facebook to see what people thought. Someone suggested Chinese lanterns but that we can certainly rule out. The only other explanation I can come up with is it was a helicopter. Here is why it could be a helicopter: Helicopters can become stationary and emit consistently blinking lights, yes? Someone suggested that the blades from the propeller of the helicopter were slicing through the lights creating a reflection from the helicopter and because it was in half time you could see the lights. I think this is the most plausible explanation for just viewing the video for the first time.

Here is why I do not believe it is a helicopter: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhMeZ7oEEO0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=150s 

(hopefully it goes to 150s. If not skip to 2:30 for a shot of a normal helicopter)

In this video taken from red white and boom, 2010 you can see in the last 15-25 seconds a helicopter flying in the frame. Try to see if you can spot any similarities or differences between the natural helicopter from the video and the object in the other video including altitude. The lights from the helicopter are always in the rear. No helicopter in Columbus emits a giant white light from the bottom of it either unless it is a police search light, which we can rule out. In regards to the altitude, the object does not necessarily match that of a helicopter. I read that helicopters can only fly at altitudes of up to roughly 10,000 feet because of their unpressurized cabins. models probably have a lot of variation. Well I have played enough flight simulator to know that the two planes that crossed the object were probably at least 10-15,000 feet. Much higher then the fireworks and a news/columbus pd helicopter or news helicopter would fly at      

Here is the final video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14mmJAhm7cA

Some final thoughts to consider. I interviewed several people on the scene. Two people I interviewed were standing 1/4 of a mile north west of the tower. Two other people I interviewed were standing probably hundreds of feet from the tower. Now without being biased and showing the video I asked them AFTER the grand finale if they had seen or heard a helicopter above the tower. Now it might have been noisy with 250,000 people in the area but a helicopter should have distinctly been heard from the the description of their location. When I eventually revealed the videos to all 4 people they were blown away. VERY IMPORTANT: I also interviewed two Columbus police officers this morning riding in a car. One was on duty last night, the other was not. I have seen the blue police helicopter a million times bc I live in a rough area. I asked if they could Identify it as one of theirs. Both officers gave good looks to the video and I quote, ""I cannot identify the object. That is NOT one of ours."" So there you have it. I still try to remain skeptical but I have shown a lot of people this now video and everyone has agreed that It is ""weird"" and ""very cool"" I would love to hear your opinions. A lot of people mentioned that it too resembles a shape of maybe a saucer?

So I have a simple proposal: each week, I would like to select some case from the past (not a really famous one: I'd like to introduce some semi-obscure classics), find the best links on the web for you, post them here, and then we can discuss away.

If enough people think this is a good idea, then I'll select and post the first one this Friday, and then every Friday afterwards.
