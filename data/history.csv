Tomorrow, I'll be returning it to his great-great-granddaughter Susan. I didn't even keep the cash. Crazy cool story inside, lots of pictures.",1813,489,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/197w9s/tldr_i_found_an_150_year_old_wallet_belonging_to/,"This is a really long story, but trust me: you're going to want to read the whole thing.  

I'm a collector of [things that are awesome.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/sets)  A few months ago, I was in Fredericksburg, VA for the sesquicentennial of the Civil War battle.   I wandered a few blocks from my hotel and into a local store called The Picket Post, which specializes in Civil War memorabilia.  I'm from California, so it's all pretty new to me-- I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Off in a corner (where, in my experience, the best of things are usually waiting to be rediscovered) there was an [old wallet, containing a set of Civil War documents](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/sets/72157632278087814/detail/) pertaining to a man named John L. Coleman, a Confederate agent during the war.  It wasn't cheap, but I found myself returning to the store to gawk at it for 3 straight days, and I realized I'd be furious at myself if I failed to buy the set for [my collection.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/)  And so, somewhat poorer but pleased nonetheless, I walked out with my prize.

My favorite collectibles are often the things that come with badass stories.  Assuming an 150-year-old wallet of a Civil War Confederate agent would make for a fairly interesting story on its own, I decided to share it with /r/civilwar.  A sterling individual named [roland19d](http://www.reddit.com/user/roland19d) jumped into the conversation and whipped up a family tree with all of John's children.  At some point, he realized he's actually related to one of the people in the documents: John's Coleman Sr.'s  law partner, J. D. Tisdale.  Crazy!  So  I started to ponder... wouldn't it be interesting to track down this guy's family and blow their minds?  Yer damn skippy, it would!   If [roland19d](http://www.reddit.com/user/roland19d) hadn't put that effort in, none of this would have happened.  I don't wanna get all meta here, but people like him are why Reddit is neat.  I took the head start he gave me and passed the info to a professional genealogist with the instructions to find me a living descendant-- ideally one who isn't gonna hear this and be all ""Cool story, bro.""


A few weeks later, I had the name and phone number of John Lewis Coleman's great granddaughter Judith and her adult daughter Susan, who both just so happen to be obsessed with John and have been for most of their lives.  Susan saw pictures of the documents and recognized his signature instantly.  She told the genealogist she wanted to cry; both she and her mother have been studying John for decades.  The Coleman name remains so important to the family that Judith gave her son the middle name of Coleman, who then passed it on to his own son.  They still have John's old furniture, copies of his brother's will, documents freeing his slaves, and gobs of other stuff they've been diligently accumulating for most of their lives.   Judith even has his bed in her guest room!  These are *exactly* the people I wanted to find, so I was utterly overjoyed.


What they don't have, and have never seen, are any of these documents. Sometime in 1966-67,  [West View](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8505116391/in/photostream)-- the family estate in Lunenberg, VA-- was broken into and thoroughly looted.  West View belonged to [Audie Coleman](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8505366226/in/photostream), John Coleman's granddaughter, a recluse who may have been [just a little bit crazy.(Bonus kitten!)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8505365876/in/photostream)  She was often seen toting a shotgun around the property and sometimes used it to greet visitors.  Later in life, she locked herself away in one building on the family's 500 acre estate where she lived without running water or electricity; everything she didn't need was stored in one of the two main houses.  Susan's family was very close to ""Aunt Audie""; Susan remembers vacationing at West View as a child.  Judith's mother Irma cared for Audie in her later years and subsequently [inherited all of Audie's possessions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8504273929/in/photostream) when Audie died in 1967.  

So anyway, these thieves... they stole *everything*, right down to the baseboards and the railings on the marble staircase. They took anything that might be of value, including many of John's belongings and documents.  The family ultimately recovered a few muskets, but none of John's documents were ever found.  

Until now.

Wow.  I love a great story, but this is also one of my favorite possessions, and it wasn't particularly cheap.   But it doesn't belong to me, not really.  It belongs to John's family.  In Judith's guest room, she still has the bed John made with his own two hands.  They have muskets that belonged to his son John Jr.. They have a ton of other info on this guy, they live and breathe John Lewis Coleman. Yet here I am, holding this wallet filled with Confederate cash and irreplaceable documents that were stolen from their dear old Aunt Audie 45 years ago.  

I'm of the opinion that things that are old often have interesting stories behind them.  It's that story that makes collectibles compelling to me.  I was looking for that story when I began this little escapade, but I never expected it to turn out this well.  I'm actually holding an 150 year old wallet that was stolen 45 years ago-- and on top of that, it's still got the cash inside.   I've found living descendants of the guy who owned the wallet, and they're nuts about John.  I have [John's picture.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8500907775/in/set-72157632278087814)  I've learned an amazing amount of information about him and his family in the process.  Clearly, I got the story I was looking for... and more.  It's not just a lost wallet story, it's *THE* lost wallet story.  As I learn about the wallet and the family, I get a bit of a sinking feeling, because I know deep down that there's only one way I can give this story a satisfactory conclusion.  I have to give it back. 

So, it hurts a little, but that's exactly what I'm doing.  Tomorrow morning, this cache of documents is getting overnighted to Susan and Judith in Greenville, North Carolina.  I took the liberty of bringing in some local media, this being an amazing human interest story.  It looks like there will be a piece about this on WITN, WNCT, and in the Daily Reflector of Greenville.  Ideally, they're gonna be there to film Judith and Susan's happy awesomefaces as they open the package on Wednesday morning, but that will be up to the respective news organizations.  One of you people out there in the Greenville area needs to do me a solid and record that for me, since I live in California and won't be able to witness any of it.  

I'm giving up something precious and irreplaceable, but that's ok.  The story about the time I returned a 150 year old lost wallet is priceless and forever.

Since you've read this far, you get a bonus: Rosser M. Coleman's [""My Experience in a coon fight""](http://www.flickr.com/photos/insignificantnobody/8505034745/in/set-72157632278087814), in which Rosser and his father John attempt to remove a raccoon from a tree.  Those tldr people will miss out, but that's ok; they wouldn't read it anyway.  You, on the other hand, are just the kind of discerning individual who'd like to know all about that time Rosser and his dad hunted down a raccoon on the Sabbath.  Don't worry, you have my solemn promise that the dogs don't die at the end of this one.  The raccoon doesn't fare so well.

TL;DR:  I found a 150 year old wallet belonging to a Confederate agent in the Civil War named John Lewis Coleman Sr..  It was stolen from his family 45 years ago.  I'm returning it to his living descendants, Susan and Judith.  I didn't even keep the cash. 

Edit:  2/26/13.  Just got back from the post office, it's been shipped, and will be in Susan's hands tomorrow morning.

You'll never take a digital photo for granted again.,1116,226,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1hp4vd/first_hand_experience_with_having_your_photo/,"Last week, my Lady and I were lucky enough to visit Gettysburg, Pa. We had our photo taken by a wet-plate camera, which is the same photography process used during the Civil War. Photo link at the bottom.

Here are some of the things we learned from this amazing experience:

 1. The subject can not move while the photo is being taken, 30-60 seconds. This does make smiling very hard, but NOT impossible. Blinking is okay since it happens so fast. In fact, a person could quickly walk past the camera and it wouldn't affect the photo.
 2. Metal brackets were attached to the subject's head from behind to prevent movement. This did not feel comfortable to me, but it did help me not move my head.
 3. Parents often drugged their children to insure they wouldn't fidget. Also, postmortem photographs of children flourished during the late 19th century.
 4. The processing of  the wet-plate involved many harmful and flammable chemicals. Photographers had to be diligent. 

I hope that if you're ever given the opportunity to experience this you'll go for it. Cost us $70 at Victorian Photography Studio. Thank you!

Also one of the handful of stories he would ever tell us was a story of luck. One day they were on the front line and they were running out of ammo and whoever was in charge asked for volunteers to go back behind the line to get ammo. My grandpa and another guy volunteered and they went to get ammo. By the time they got back the whole platoon they were with was slaughtered. Throats slit, among other gruesome things.

One more was when he was in a fox hole, up to his neck in blood and gore, he watched as a plane dropped a bomb. He thought he was a goner, but luckily the bomb was further away than it looked he said. I couldn't imagine sitting there and watching that.

If anyone has any more info about the 76th or where to go about looking, I would appreciate it!

But there are plenty of other reddits that specialize in that stuff like /r/politics, /r/news, /r/conspiracy, etc.

When I come here to this reddit, I want to read about history, be it German tanks, Buddhist shrines in Afghanistan, Abraham Lincoln, Spanish Armada, the dietary habits of Romans, or what have you.

We all rant here about the history channel showing things about Alien visitation, UFO's, Nostradamus, and other things, and it's valid here too.  Many of us read this reddit as an aggregate of websites and discussions on history.   Everything from someone showing off a really cool minature of a Roman centurion and pictures of uniforms from an Osprey book, to reviews of books, discussions on events, questions answered, are all wonderful and why I think many of us come here.

However, lets be practicable.  9/11 conspiracy stuff attempted to be shown as fact doesn't belong here.  If you want to compare it to Kennedy conspiracy stuff, great, but this is not the forum to prove your theory that the Rosicrucian Zionists did it.  This is not the forum to convince us that Alien sub-contractors taught the Sumerians language.  Attempts to convince us that the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan are gigantic oligarchic Wall Street conspiracies by the Military-Industrial complex are better served somewhere else.


Mind you, I'm in no way trying to act like a moderator or a reddit regulator and telling you you cant.  That's not my place to say, ""No, you can't post that.""  However I do feel that I do have the right to ask for courtesy.  I know I can easily just click hide, and move along, but that doesn't address the larger issue, it merely hides it.  If I don't speak up and say anything it might begin to occur more and more, and eventually become more the norm and not the exception.  

As history fans, and some history professionals here, as I know that many of you have your degrees of various levels, we should maintain, or at least attempt to maintain, a level of historical reasoning here.  Our links should be relatively decent, such as decently resourced wiki pages or trade publications, and not delve into blog spam and sites such as prison planet or Alex Jones.

Again, I'm not saying you can't submit the stuff, but please, let's keep this reddit about history, and historical fact.  If you present politically charged stuff, or items of historical dubiousness such as Aliens building the pyramids, please at least try to present it as dubious material, and try to back it up and not scream ""it's fact! wake up sheeple!"" 

Thank you.


TL;DR - Please keep this reddit about history, and post historically dubious material in other more appropriate subreddits.",,False,,t5_2qh53,False,,,True,t3_f5vcw,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/f5vcw/could_we_please_keep_this_reddit_about_fact_based/,

""Apion and Epimas declare to their dearest Epaphroditos: if you allow us to fuck you in the ass and you’re cool with that, we won’t beat the shit out of you anymore (if you allow us to fuck you in the ass). Farewell! Farewell!""

The drawing is labeled “cockhead” and “asshole,” in case the written message was not clear enough.

EDIT: to consolidate some of my responses in the comments, here is a link to the transcription of the Greek text in the Papyrological Navigator (which gives free access to almost every published Greek documentary papyrus, many with translations and images): http://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.oxy;42;3070.

A nice discussion of this text and its cultural context can be found in Montserrat's [Sex and Society in Graeco-Roman Egypt](http://books.google.com/books?id=5RuDDZvZ4gAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (google books preview of the relevant section).  Cribiore, in [Gymnastics of the Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Gymnastics-Mind-Greek-Education-Hellenistic/dp/0691122520/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360194421&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=gymnastics+of+the+mind) (p. 219), doesn't take the text as seriously as Montserrat, interpreting it instead as a school-boy joke: ""after learning how to phrase a letter and by practicing their skills in conventional epistles sent to their families, Apion and Epimas felt confident enough to compose a mock literary letter and addressed it to Epaphroditos, who may have been only a few benches away.""

EDIT 2: I'm quite excited to see so much interest and conversation about this Greek papyrus!  Then again, Reddit loves sex and I suppose /r/history is little different.  Anyway, I've been asked about general works dealing with this material.  Parsons' [City of the Sharp-Nosed Fish](http://www.amazon.com/City-Sharp-Nosed-Fish-Peter-Parsons/dp/0753822334/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360207210&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=parson+city+of+fish) is a great introduction to the world of the papyri through the lens of Oxyrhynchus, the best-documented city of the Roman period.  Lewis' [Greeks in Ptolemaic Egypt](http://www.amazon.com/Greeks-Ptolemaic-Egypt-Classics-Papyrology/dp/0970059124/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360207472&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lewis+greeks+egypt) and [Life in Egypt Under Roman Rule](http://www.amazon.com/Egypt-under-Roman-Classics-Papyrology/dp/0788505602/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360207487&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=lewis+glife+in+roman+rule) cover more ground and are also quite lively, while Bowman's [Egypt After the Pharaohs](http://www.amazon.com/Egypt-After-Pharaohs-332-BC-AD/dp/0520205316/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360207738&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=bowmna+egpyt+after+pharaohs) is a bit denser, but quite insightful.  Finally, a shout out for the [Michigan Papyrology Collection](http://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection) (news and updates on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-University-of-Michigan-Papyrology-Collection/275678525787973)) -- groups are welcome to arrange (free) tours of the collection and anyone can view and learn about the papyri on rotating display.

It was then passed down to my grandfather, and kept locked in the back of a safe for many years until he passed away. It was recently rediscovered while cleaning out the safe a few years ago.

From the beginning of production until WWI, there was only one significant military order for the Model M. It was a 200 gun shipment ranging in serial number from 227226 to 260924 on September 29, 1917 to the U.S. Navy Yard, Washington, DC...These pistols had no special government ordnance, inspectors or acceptance markings applied at the factory.  **This was the very first military order for the Colt 1903, a firearm which since then has played such a big part in American history.** There were over 500,000 produced from 1903-1945 and were used as General Officer pistols up until the 1970's when they were replaced by the M15.

According to the ""Colt Pocket Hammerless Automatic Pistols II"" collectors guide by Brunner, of the 200 Colt 1903's that were issued to the US Navy in this shipment, only one was ever known to be in private hands...

You can check the serial number on the gun (257406) with [this list of serial numbers](http://www.coltautos.com/mmnavy_ww1.htm) of the 200 Navy contract pistols to verify that it is indeed on that list.

**EDIT2**: Some cool American history of the 1903 in general (wikipedia):
 ""It is said that Al Capone kept one in his coat pocket and Bonnie Parker used one to break Clyde Barrow out of jail after smuggling it into the jail by taping it to her thigh. Bank robber John Dillinger was carrying this model of pistol when he was shot by FBI agents outside the Biograph theater on July 22, 1934, and another famous bank robber, Willie Sutton kept one when was captured by police in Brooklyn on February 18, 1952.""

Up until the mid-20th century, the accepted answer was ‘one’: and this Whiggish narrative underpinned a number of works that celebrated electrification and the march of progress in light-bulb changing. Beginning in the 1960s, however, social historians increasingly rejected the ‘Great Man’ school and produced revisionist narratives that stressed the contributions of research assistants and custodial staff. This new consensus was challenged, in turn, by women’s historians, who criticized the social interpretation for marginalizing women, and who argued that light bulbs are actually changed by department secretaries. Since the 1980s, however, postmodernist scholars have deconstructed what they characterize as a repressive hegemonic discourse of light-bulb changing, with its implicit binary opposition between ‘light’ and ‘darkness,’ and its phallogocentric privileging of the bulb over the socket, which they see as colonialist, sexist, and racist. Finally, a new generation of neo-conservative historians have concluded that the light never needed changing in the first place, and have praised political leaders like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher for bringing back the old bulb. Clearly, much additional research remains to be done.",,False,,t5_2qh53,False,,,True,t3_g6p78,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/g6p78/how_many_historians_does_it_take_to_change_a/,

Think the modern drug war was launched by Richard Nixon in 1973?  Not quite...  My new book tells the story of how the government's punitive and prohibitive approach to illicit drug use evolved in the two decades prior, and was prompted at least as much by dilemmas of governance as it was by a desire to manage drugs or addiction.  

The political and intellectual intervention of my book can be summed up as follows: the government is addicted to the drug war, and it is time for an intervention.

Around 1760 scientists realized thanks to Edmond Halley (Halley's Comet) that during the passage of Venus across the face the sun - you could use triangulation to work out the distance to the Sun and from that you could calibrate the distances to the other planets in the solar system.

... Guillaume Le Gentil set off from France a year ahead of time to observe the transit from India, but various setbacks left him still at sea on the day of the transit—just about the worst place to be since steady measurements were impossible on a pitching ship.

Undaunted, Le Gentil continued on to India to await the next transit in 1769. With eight years to prepare, he erected a first-rate viewing station, tested and retested his instruments, and had everything in a state of perfect readiness. On the morning of the second transit, June 4, 1769, he awoke to a fine day, but, just as Venus began its pass, a cloud slid in front of the Sun and remained there for almost exactly the duration of the transit: three hours, fourteen minutes, and seven seconds.

Stoically, Le Gentil packed up his instruments and set off for the nearest port, but en route he contracted dysentery and was laid up for nearly a year. Still weakened, he finally made it onto a ship. It was nearly wrecked in a hurricane off the African coast. When at last he reached home, eleven and a half years after setting off, and having achieved nothing, he discovered that his relatives had had him declared dead in his absence and had enthusiastically plundered his estate.

I found a really moving and depressing letter a young german soldier wrote to his father a few days before the end of the battle of Stalingrad (sent in januar 1943), describing his feelings towards his death. Here is the letter, translated to the best of my ability:


Dearest father! The division is cannibalised for the great fight, but the great fight wont happen. You will wonder, why I write you at your work address but what I have to say in this letter is something only for men. You should pass it to mother in your own way. We are allowed to write today they said. This means for those knowing the situation, it is the last time to do so. You are colonel, dear father, and part of the general staff. You know what it means, and it means you save me the explanations which might sound sentimental. It is over. I think it will take around eight days, then it is definitely over. I do not want to search for reasons to argue for or against our situation. These arguments are no longer important and without use, but if I have to say something about it: We are not responsible for our situation, search the person acoountable over in Germany. [...] Bei cautious, so no more harm overcomes our fatherland. The hell at the Wolga should be a warning. I ask you to not set this insight at nought. [...] And now to our current situation. Only 69 soldiers are left useful of our divison. Bleyer is alive and so is Hartlieb. The small Degen lost both arms, he will be in Germany soon. [...] All that's left are two MG and 400 bullets. One grenade launcher and 10 grenades. Otherwise only hunger and tiredness is left. [...] Berg... broek out with 20 men, without order. It is better to know how it ends in three days then it is in three weeks.[...]

At last the personal affairs. You can be sure that everything will end respectably. It is a little bit early with 30 years, I know. No sentiments. Handshake for Lydia and Helene. A kiss for mum (be careful old man, the cardiac defect), kiss for Gerda. Greetings for everyone else. Hand at the helmet first lieutenant ... I check out of yours.


I tried my best to translate it the best I could, but there will obviously be some wrong words/translations in it. The last part makes me feel really sad, a human, knowing it is going to end soon. The original source is a citation of: Christoph Studt(editor), Das Dritte Reich. Ein Lesebuch zur deutschen Geschichte (1933-1945). Munich 1995, p. 261,262

Here is the original german source I translated for everybody to read and to correct my translation:

During height of Japanese invasion of Korea (Imjin War)A Japanese officer(who served under Katō Kiyomasa) defected immediately because of what he has witnessed, the crimes the Japanese perpetrated against the Koreans. (Ex. Mound of Ears http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimizuka) And so wished not to kill the innocent people of Korea. In addition,  he had a fascination with the lifestyle and culture of Korea. Soon later, he joined in the Righteous Korean army; with his leadership and experience in warfare, he drove away the Japanese forces, and taught Korean soldiers how to use the arquebus (gunpowered matchlock muskets) and military tactics. (During this period, Koreans were unfamiliar with the arquebus and were poorly trained, preferring the bow and arrow, also lacking in battlefield experience and discipline.  In contrast, the Japanese were armed with the arquebus in addition the Koreans faced an army with extensive combat experience, men already bloodied from the many campaigns of Japan's Warring States period.) The Joseon government recognized his efforts and was given the Korean name 김충선 (Chungson Kim) and the rank of general.  

After the Imjin War ended, Kim continued to serve in the military. He participated in the Second Manchu invasion of Korea in 1627 and was posted in the frontier until he retired. Was credited with the death of some 500 Qing troops at the battle of Ssangnyeong. Kim had devoted his body and soul to protect his new home. He also married a Korean woman. He and his men lived in a small village called Urokri 우록리(友鹿里) 1 hour drive away from Daegu city. Many of the Japanese defectors displayed great courage and loyalty. Gen. Gang Hong-rip (1560-1627) mobilized the Japanese defectors when he commanded an army to help Ming forces against the Later Jin in 1618. There is a legend that all Japanese defectors who served under Gang’s command refused to surrender to the Manchus and died with honor. 

During the Japanese colonial era in the 20th century, Japanese officials and scholars tried to deny Kim’s existence. Some scholars visited the village and personally investigated the records handed down in his family. However, they did not recognize him as Japanese. Rather, they considered him “half Korean and half Japanese” or just a fictional figure.  In 1930, Hidetaka Nakamura of the Japanese colonial government’s Korean History Compilation Committee conducted an investigation and confirmed that Kim Chung-seon was indeed a Japanese defector. Recently, a monument in memory of Kim was built in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. (http://wbs-ceo.sblo.jp/article/41707035.html)

Nowadays, their about 150 descents family members still living. Even with Anti-Japanese sentiment, they are treated as normal Koreans by other Korean villagers. His shrine, Nokdong Seowon, Korea remains a popular destination for Japanese tourists in Daegu.  This is the story covered by Japan's TBS TV news. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKgltTFf7HI) What's more interesting is the idea of turning the village into tourist destination for Japanese/Korean visitors for promoting peace and friendship between two countries. Kim Chungson fought for the innocent, appreciation for other cultures, and opposed a unjustified war. Despite the troubled history between Korea and Japan such as the comfort women and Dokdo issue. His story should be a lesson for all of us today. The real story of ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Dances with Wolves"" 

Imjin War is well known in Korea, Yi Soon Shin and the Turtle Ship.

Tonight, at 8PM, I will commemorate their actions, and with them those of many others.",598,159,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1doa57/my_greatgrandparents_actively_took_part_in_the/,"My grandparents and great-grandparents are the kind of people I consider heroic. They actively took part in the Dutch Resistance in Amsterdam (and Edam). They risked their lives to help save the lives of others.

My grandmother was once sent out in the winter with a sled, with just one assignment:
&gt; Deliver this to the usual adress

As she got to the adress, the sled was hauled in, the top load was removed and underneath was a stash of machine guns. My grandmother was furious at my grandfather for letting her transport such a risky load. My grandfather simply said he knew she would bluff her way out if she would get apprehended.

---
Another instance was when my grandfather was on the move, distributing resistance propaganda. He had the bags on his bike stuffed with the gazettes, his pockets were stuffed to the brim. While he was riding his bike through Amsterdam a German officer stopped him, demanding to take his bike (Yes, stereotype, but this actually happened to my grandfather). My grandfather simply refused. At this point, he realized he made a mistake. He should've just handed over his bicyle and walked away. Now, he was in an argument with a German officer, demanding his bike, probably wanting to search him in the end. If this would happen, my grandfather would get shot. Giving in now would imply he all of a sudden had something to hide, this being searched and getting shot. My grandfather couldn't drop his act now, so he kept on argueing. The German officer then decided to call in a Dutch Police officer. The Dutch officer had better stuff to do and told the German to find another man to bother. My grandfather got away, with his propaganda.

---
My grandmother got lucky more often. It was 1944 and she was carrying food stamps in a small jar intended for marmelade. She had to cross a river using a small ferry. Just as the ferry left she noticed a group of German officers on the opposite side of the river bank, performing searches on everybody leaving the ferry. She started to panic, knowing that a search would imply certain detainment. As she is getting closer and closer, somebody all of a sudden taps her on her shoulder. It is a local police officer. She had talked to him once in a while, but never released anything on her activities in the resistance. The officer looked her in the eyes, and asked her if he could have her marmelade. Figuring this gamble is a better shot than getting apprehended and detained, she rapidly gives the police officer her jar filled with food coupons, expecting the coupons to be lost.

She gets off the ferry, gets searched and makes it out. 1 Kilometer down the road she sees a man standing there. It is the police officer. He did not get searched, because he was a police officer. As she starts to walk past him, basically denying everything that happened on the ferry, he walks up to her and says the following:
&gt; Excuse me madam, I believe you forgot something on the ferry.

He hands her the jar with food stamps, and walks away saying nothing.

---
This however is nothing compared to the dangers my great-grandparents put theirselves through. They ended up taking a Jewish family in hiding. One story I will always remember is of when one of the guests of their bed and breakfast, a Dutch Police Officer (They seemed to have helped my family a lot), suggested that the other guests might appreciate a walk in the woods today. My great-grandfather wasn't stupid, took the hint straight away and told the Jewish family to go and take a walk in the woods adjacent to their backyard and not come back until dawn. About an hour after the family left for their walk, the Germans knocked on their door, performing a Razzia...

You can read about my great-grandparents (Jane is my grandmother) [on this entry in The Righteous Among The Nations](http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4039355). They got awarded the Yad Vashem in 1992.

---

These people are the reason I am alive. These  people contributed to the well-being of tens of people with their heroic activities in the Resistance. They were brave people, with brave acts. They did not die in the war, however many people did doing the same or even more heroic acts.

Tomorrow is the 5th of May, it will be 68 years since the Netherlands got liberated. Today is the 4th of may. Tonight, at 20:00 sharp the entire country will be silent. Roads will be empty, trains will stop going. 

We will commemorate all those who have fallen, trying to achieve liberty for the Netherlands in World War two. 

We will commemorate all of those who gave their lives to protect our country, not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. 

We will commemorate every single Dutch victim of War.

But most of all, I will be commemorating the heroic deeds of not only my grandparents and great-grandparents, but to all of those who risked their lives in order to protect others.

There are a few lank spots where I couldn't make out the word. 


Gave talk to WW2 flyers: 7/12/00

Donald Baker-Bombardier and Enlisted army air force at Camp Grant Nov, 1942.After basic training sent to radio school at Sioux Falls South Dakota.Applied for Air Cadets and was assigned to Bombardier school at Roswell NM.Commissioned 2nd Lt. and sent to Salt Lake City for crew assignment on B17.Assigned to 2nd Lt Earl Armstrong crew as Bombardier. He and I were from Rockton and both graduated from Honanegah He in 1937, me in 1942.Our crew sent to ______ city for overseas training as a crew.Some gunnery practice,some navigation practice.

In January 1944 on a practice bombing mission we lost 3 and 4 engines on fire.Couldn't put fire out so we bailed out over South Dakota. I had a problem with my chest pack and had to help flaps open to release the chute.I landed in an open prarie after some time I was picked up by a farmer in an old pickup truck.We traveled several miles to plane crash. Some of our crew were there keeping people some distance from burning plane as we had live 50 Cal and practice bombs aboard.We were all awarded the Caterpillar Club Membership and Lapel pin to go with it.

After completing combat training we picked up a new B17 G in Lincoln Nebraska.We flew to England the Northern Route. Bangor Maine,Goosebay Labre Dore Prestwick Scotland and on to group at ____________. Two of the longest and most difficult missions were to Berlin. Railroad Stations I think lots of fighters lots of flack-even rockets, I think.

June 5 1944 on our 13th mission,Target a bridge near Abbyvillle France we got hit by flack,inside caught fire. Knocked out intercon finally bailed out after going down to around 10,000.Landed in an anti-glider field and was captured right away. I learned later from the wounded radioman that the pilot,ball gunner and tail-gunner were killed.

 
Finally taken to Stalag Luft III at Sagan about 40 miles south east of Berlin.This POW camp was onlyfor Airforce Officers, American and British Officer status and Lufewaffe Buards accorded us better treatment than most other POW camps in Germany.

 

Camp made up of 6 compounds, 3 American, 3 British.I was assigned to the South compound in a room with 5 other POW about 10 months later we had 12.Four triple bunks.Over crowding was typical for the whole camp. Over 2,000 in South compound when we left Sagan.

North compound was place of Great Escape, 3 months before I got there. 80 men escaped thru tunnel. 50 shot,3 made it back to England others were captured within 24 hrs and returned to camp.Big search for other tunnels resulted in several being caved in and filled up.We still had tunnels but only for use if Hitler gave execution orders.Tunneling required shoring so our bed boards were split and re-split in order to have tunnel material.Only a select few of qualified men did actual work-REAL secret operation

 
Red Cross parcels were real important to our survival. When they were available each POW got 1 approximate 10lb parcel of food each week. Each room up to 15 men pooled the food and took turns doing the cooking. One cook stove per building for 100 to 150 men so stove times were staggered.

 

Had a good library,some musical instruments,balls and bats etc. mostly supplied by Red Cross (mail 3 letters,4 cards per month)Roll call at least 2 times a day.

 
We could hear big bombs the Berlin at night. British 4,000 and 6,000 lb.Because of the possibility of mass execution we were kind of trained to pile mattresses,tables etc. against the fences,hoping that some could get out and overcome guards.

 
Guards were called Goons and we were called Kreigies. Last week of January 1945 we were told we had to leave Stalag Luft III because Russians were getting close.We were kind of prepared to take only clothing and food as anything we were going to take we had to carry.Started around midnight, 6 inches or so of snow. Walked 80 kilometers in 2 1/2 days and then 2 days and nights in freight cars to Stalag Luft VII at Moosburg. I don't know what happened to Kreigies too sick to leave Sagan or fellows that couldn't walk anymore and dropped out on the long march.

This camp much more crowded and no parcels for awhile. German food very limited.

Last of April General Pattons 3rd Armored liberated us. Saw General Patton when he came thru our area to check things out I guess.The Army gave us fresh bread and bean soup,we all over ate and suffered and had to stand in line to go to the latrine.

Flew by C47 to La Harve and got deloused,bather and got some new Army clothes.Home by ship and sent to Florida for rehab. Was there when Japan surrendered and discharged November 8, 1945.

Visited 390th Bomb group Museum at Pima Air Museum in Tucson. Found out we were shot down on the 123rd of 321 missions flown by 390th. We were 1 of 2 lost on that mission.Pilot-Red Armstrong and me from Rockton.

1355454992.0,363,self.history,14tnob,History Podcasts out there worth our time,449,86,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/14tnob/history_podcasts_out_there_worth_our_time/,"Hello there, /r/History.   

I've been a little sick of late.  So, I got into tracking down some history podcasts I was into, and seeing what else was out there.  

The standard history podcasts we all seem to mention from time to time are:

* [The History of Rome](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) by Mike Duncan.  He finished it about six months ago.  He ended up doing 179 parts that detailed Roman History from the founding of the city to the fall of the Western Empire in 476 AD.    This is something I normally tell people is the best podcast in on the Internet.  
* [12 Byzantine Rulers](http://12byzantinerulers.com/) by Lars Brownworth which is about Byzantine history.  It was the podcast that gave Mike Duncan the idea to do the his History of Rome.    
* [Norman Centuries](http://normancenturies.com/) is another podcast from Brownworth.   It's been ongoing for the last three years, and is only on 16 parts so far.  So, it's a little slow in coming out.   But it's worthwhile. 
* [Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh) by Dan Carlin is also a highly thought of by most people.   It comes out in longer formats (90-120 minutes normally), and normally seems to come with higher production values. But it's not about one-history topic.  Carlin jumps around a bit.  
* [In our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/iot) with Melvyn Bragg is a BBC radio show that lends itself to the podcast format very nicely. 

There seem to be several podcasts that took their cue from Mike Duncan's History of Rome and are trying to do their own podcasts. 

* [British History Podcast](http://thebritishhistorypodcast.com/)  by Jamie Jeffers.  So far he is 79 episodes in. 
* [The Ancient World](http://ancientworldpodcast.blogspot.com/) by Scott Chesworth, covers the beginning of human civilizations to ~500 BC.   In short, history before Roman history.  He projects he will do 20 episodes total, and has completed 17 so far. 
* [The History of Byzantium](http://thehistoryofbyzantium.wordpress.com/) by Robin Pierson, picks up the close of Duncan's podcast and continuing on from 476 AD to 1453.  Which means it's much of the same ground as 12 Byzantine Rulers.   But more in depth.  So far it's 15 eposides, and is up to Justinian.  At this rate he has another 200+ episodes to go.  

So, all that said.... what else is out there that is worth listening too?  There are lots of bad podcasts out there.  So, I'm hoping others here can point out other good history podcasts that are worth our attention.   Especially since the above is very Euro-centric, and hopefully people know of good podcasts that cover India, Chinese, South East Asia, and African history, as well as those topics closely related to history like Archaeology, Linguistics, etc. that often offer major clues about history.

Example within.,417,47,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/hiza8/why_did_the_english_language_change_so_much_from/,"I've always liked reading about history but only recently discovered the joys of reading primary source material. During my search for original writings I discovered something perplexing and was wondering if any more learned readers of English history might share their insights.

I noticed I can pickup a 18th century document and read it with relatively little difficulty. But if I go back just one more century and read something from the 17th century, I cannot understand most of it without re-reading it 10 times. Why did the language change so much from 17th to 18th century when from 18th to 21st century it doesn't change much?  And what good history books are out there that describe this presumed cultural shift from 17th to 18th century?

Examples:

Beginning of Thomas Paine's Common Sense. 1776

&gt; PERHAPS the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favor; a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defence of custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.

Beginning of William Bradford's Of Plimouth Plantation 1647

&gt; IT is well knowne unto ye godly and judicious, how ever since ye first breaking out of ye lighte of ye gospell in our Honourable Nation of England, (which was ye first of nations whom ye Lord adorned ther with, affter yt grosse darknes of popery which had covered &amp; overspred ye Christian worled,) what warrs &amp; opposissions ever since, Satan hath raised, maintained, and continued against the Saincts, from time to time, in one sorte or other.

""FROM: 

Pfc. K. Vonnegut, Jr., 
12102964 U. S. Army.
 
TO: 

Kurt Vonnegut,
 Williams Creek, 
Indianapolis, Indiana. 

Dear people: 

I'm told that you were probably never informed that I was anything other than ""missing in action."" Chances are that you also failed to receive any of the letters I wrote from Germany. That leaves me a lot of explaining to do -- in precis: 

I've been a prisoner of war since December 19th, 1944, when our division was cut to ribbons by Hitler's last desperate thrust through Luxemburg and Belgium. Seven Fanatical Panzer Divisions hit us and cut us off from the rest of Hodges' First Army. The other American Divisions on our flanks managed to pull out: We were obliged to stay and fight. Bayonets aren't much good against tanks: Our ammunition, food and medical supplies gave out and our casualties out-numbered those who could still fight - so we gave up. The 106th got a Presidential Citation and some British Decoration from Montgomery for it, I'm told, but I'll be damned if it was worth it. I was one of the few who weren't wounded. For that much thank God. 

Well, the supermen marched us, without food, water or sleep to Limberg, a distance of about sixty miles, I think, where we were loaded and locked up, sixty men to each small, unventilated, unheated box car. There were no sanitary accommodations -- the floors were covered with fresh cow dung. There wasn't room for all of us to lie down. Half slept while the other half stood. We spent several days, including Christmas, on that Limberg siding. On Christmas eve the Royal Air Force bombed and strafed our unmarked train. They killed about one-hundred-and-fifty of us. We got a little water Christmas Day and moved slowly across Germany to a large P.O.W. Camp in Muhlburg, South of Berlin. We were released from the box cars on New Year's Day. The Germans herded us through scalding delousing showers. Many men died from shock in the showers after ten days of starvation, thirst and exposure. But I didn't.
 
Under the Geneva Convention, Officers and Non-commissioned Officers are not obliged to work when taken prisoner. I am, as you know, a Private. One-hundred-and-fifty such minor beings were shipped to a Dresden work camp on January 10th. I was their leader by virtue of the little German I spoke. It was our misfortune to have sadistic and fanatical guards. We were refused medical attention and clothing: We were given long hours at extremely hard labor. Our food ration was two-hundred-and-fifty grams of black bread and one pint of unseasoned potato soup each day. After desperately trying to improve our situation for two months and having been met with bland smiles I told the guards just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came. They beat me up a little. I was fired as group leader. Beatings were very small time: -- one boy starved to death and the SS Troops shot two for stealing food. 

On about February 14th the Americans came over, followed by the R.A.F. their combined labors killed 250,000 people in twenty-four hours and destroyed all of Dresden -- possibly the world's most beautiful city. But not me. 

After that we were put to work carrying corpses from Air-Raid shelters; women, children, old men; dead from concussion, fire or suffocation. Civilians cursed us and threw rocks as we carried bodies to huge funeral pyres in the city. 

When General Patton took Leipzig we were evacuated on foot to ('the Saxony-Czechoslovakian border'?). There we remained until the war ended. Our guards deserted us. On that happy day the Russians were intent on mopping up isolated outlaw resistance in our sector. Their planes (P-39's) strafed and bombed us, killing fourteen, but not me. 

Eight of us stole a team and wagon. We traveled and looted our way through Sudetenland and Saxony for eight days, living like kings. The Russians are crazy about Americans. The Russians picked us up in Dresden. We rode from there to the American lines at Halle in Lend-Lease Ford trucks. We've since been flown to Le Havre. 

I'm writing from a Red Cross Club in the Le Havre P.O.W. Repatriation Camp. I'm being wonderfully well feed and entertained. The state-bound ships are jammed, naturally, so I'll have to be patient. I hope to be home in a month. Once home I'll be given twenty-one days recuperation at Atterbury, about $600 back pay and -- get this -- sixty (60) days furlough. 

I've too damned much to say, the rest will have to wait, I can't receive mail here so don't write. 

May 29, 1945

1335832382.0,338,self.history,t0p4z,I interviewed an American WWII veteran who was taken prisoner by the Germans. It was the most interesting story I've ever heard.,402,64,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/t0p4z/i_interviewed_an_american_wwii_veteran_who_was/,"Last summer I had the opportunity to interview a local WWII veteran who wanted to share his story.

His name is Luther Smith, but he goes by Smitty. He is 89 years old. He dropped out of high school in Maine to join the air force when the US entered the war. 
He was in the 8th AF stationed in Grafton-Underwood, England, and was a ball turret gunner in a B-17. He said that the worst part was the cold - his breath would turn to ice in his mask, restricting his oxygen. It was easy to get lightheaded and pass out while he was curled up alone in the tiny space around the machine gun, and he had to be careful to break the ice often and not lose his concentration.

He flew numerous missions over Germany, but it was during Big Week - the last week of February 1944 - that his plane was shot down over Germany.

Smitty was shot in the hand by enemy gunfire as his crew was preparing to parachute from the falling plane. He right hand was entirely useless, and he realized that he wouldn't be able to pull the cord to his parachute. Unwilling to let his friend die, a fellow crew member risked his own life by pulling Smitty's parachute cord for him as they fell through the air.

They landed in a field and were immediately greeted by German soldiers. Smitty's crew was led to a POW camp, where he was imprisoned for the remainder of the war.

The Germans wanted to keep moral up in the camp, and did so by having the prisoners put on amusing skits. Smitty, normally quiet and shy, was asked to join in, and did so reluctantly. He used to play the guitar before the war, but wasn't able to do so with his now missing right hand. The Germans matched him up with another prisoner who was missing his left hand, and gave them a skit where they played the guitar together.
Smitty showed me a photo of the group that participated in the skit. There were about twenty men in ridiculous costumes, half of them dressed up as women. Apparently they even shaved their arms and legs to look the part. Smitty sat at the front with his guitar, and they all were smiling.

He was reluctant to say anything else about his experience as a prisoner, and kept his stories light and funny.

When he was released and sent back to America, he recuperated in a veterans hospital. His family didn't know about his missing hand, and he tried to keep them from knowing for as long as possible by having other soldiers write his letters home for him so it wouldn't be obvious that he was using his left hand. 

Smitty told me his story in six hours. They were the six fastest hours of my life. I've never been more inspired and awed. I think he is the bravest and most humble man I've ever met.

If any of you get the chance, interview a veteran. You won't regret it.",,False,,t5_2qh53,True,,,True,t3_t0p4z,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/t0p4z/i_interviewed_an_american_wwii_veteran_who_was/,

**The frequency of urban combat**

Pitched battles are usually very rare in the history of ancient warfare. Such battles require that two opposing armies both want to fight each other in the same place at the same time. If the armies are distant or one side doesn't see the benefit of fighting, a battle will not take place on the field. Skirmishes are sieges were *far* more common. In ancient Greece pitched battles were more common due to the proximity of city-states and the military culture of the time. Sieges and city assaults were still twice as common as pitched battles in the Peloponnesian War.

Greeks generally preferred to avoid urban combat at all costs for several reasons. For one, walls were very economically and psychologically important to Greek cities, and they loathed to abandon them. Urban combat involved women and slaves, which upset the traditional hierarchy of ancient Greece. Houses were supposed to be a secure private space, not a battleground. Urban battlefields favored the poorer, lightly armed, and largely unarmored troops in the army, upsetting the hoplite's dominance of warfare. To top it all off, urban battles were brutal, bloody, and uncertain.

Still, there were a number of noteworthy urban battles in ancient Greece. The Peloponnese War started with an urban battle, in fact. There was a great deal of urban violence from internal struggles in city-states (*polis*), and also because the city was so important in inter-state warfare in Greece. However it's not mentioned nearly as much in classical sources because the Greeks simply preferred to think of warfare in terms of pitched field battles, which were more ""honorable"", easier to romanticize, and easier to prepare for.

Once a city's walls were breached in a siege, either from treachery or a dedicated attack, the defenders didn't just roll over and say ""Well, good job, you got us!"" Sometimes the defending force would surrender, retreat, or just fall apart if they were surprised, demoralized, or starved into submission. Other times they'd fight on in the streets. This would frequently involve struggles for a few strategic points, perhaps a series of ""mini-sieges"", and house-to-house fighting in the most desperate battles. Additionally, internal fighting between powerful families, political groups, or rebels and occupiers could lead to intense urban combat. Some city-states saw prolonged civil war where opposite sides controlled different parts of one urban center and fortified key points.

**Walls**

Most *polis* in ancient Greece included a walled city surrounded by farms, pastureland, and outlying suburbs or villages. Some cities could extend their walls out enough to cover at least some of these outlying areas. At one point Athens even built the ""long walls"" to connect the city with its nearby port. At first walls were simple piles of stone, but by the Hellenistic era they would be pretty magnificent. Controlling gates was very important for prolonged urban battles because whoever had the gate could allow reinforcements in and prevent enemies from escaping.

Building walls was something that the whole city would do. It was a major undertaking that the city's rulers would organize and the bulk of the population would participate in or support in some way. Walls became a symbol of a city's unity, community, strength, and autonomy. The presence of an enemy force within the walls could easily cause the population of a city to absolutely panic. Defenders would almost *never* choose to abandon their walls and fight within the city unless they absolutely had to.

**Strategic points**

Most cities had a central acropolis, a defensive citadel housing temples, public buildings, and other such important facilities. The acropolis could be used as a fortress within the city for holding up or preparing counterattacks. Markets (*agora*) were also major city centers where people would gather to do more than just trade. Markets were always located near the city's center at the junction of at least two major roads within the city. Important administrative buildings could be located within the market, too. The market was usually the rallying point of defenders and the goal of attackers. Controlling the market usually (but not always) meant controlling the city.

Other important areas within a city were based on what allowed large masses of troops to assemble and form up for attacks or counterattacks. Theaters, temples, gymnasiums, and warehouses could all serve this purpose. Sometimes a losing faction in urban combat would try to turn these areas into fortresses, using barricades and digging trenches. Sometimes it worked, other times they became deathtraps.

**Roads**

Older cities had irregular, confusing streets resulting from the city being built piece by piece and growing naturally. These mazes of streets and neighborhoods gave a massive advantage to defenders who knew the area and could fight as skirmishers in broken ground. Attackers would easily get lost and ambushed. Both sides would have to split their forces to command control of such cities, and communication would be difficult between divided armies in these mazes.

Newer cities and cities that had seen major expansion since the mid-fifth century usually employed systems of straight, broad roads laid out in grids. These cities were easier to attack since a commander could be relatively confident that he knew what the layout was. Communication was also much easier there.

**Houses**

Homes faced inwards, arranged around a central courtyard, and windows were usually high off the ground. They usually had stone foundations, mud brick walls, and pitched, tiled roofs. Homes in older cities were small and irregularly laid out. In grid-planned cities, houses were usually built in small complexes surrounded by common walls, perhaps with alleyways between them. Either way, houses were a massive pain for attackers. They could serve as a series of mutually-supporting micro-fortifications. By cutting holes in walls and barricading certain entryways, an entire residential block could be turned into one fortress. Attackers faced a herculean task in clearing houses, since every room could potentially hold a desperate defender, and there were so many places defenders could hide. Attacking and taking residential areas required methodical and brutal tactics.

**Tactics**

Typical battlefield formations were useless in urban fighting. Commanders could draw up a phalanx in certain areas such as a market place or wide roads, but even in the roads they'd have to use unusually deep and narrow formations. In more confusing areas and residential neighborhoods, larger formations would be broken down into smaller units - something lade difficult by the lack of officers below company level. Heavier equipment might have to be abandoned to allow a soldier to hop over walls, duck into houses, and otherwise navigate the urban landscape, but when you're coming through a doorway in a house protected by dedicated defenders you want all the armor you can get.

Heavier hoplites would act as assault troops within a city, attacking along major roads, staying together, holding strategic points, and assaulting defended buildings. Poorer troops with lighter gear, including some lightly-armored hoplites and dedicated light infantry, would act as skirmishers. They could better maneuver in the urban environment to get around obstacles and attack from unexpected positions, including from rooftops. Never forget that urban combat is three-dimensional. Fighting from a rooftop with missile weapons gave a much more decisive advantage than fighting from a hilltop. cavalry is rarely mentioned in sources on ancient urban warfare. This could be because cavalry was almost useless in such cases or simply because the Greeks didn't use much cavalry to begin with.

Defenders could block off streets with barricades and trenches. They could also demolish smaller buildings, punch holes in house walls, and generally burrow through residential areas to out maneuver their enemies. Broken up buildings, loose tiles, tools laying around in the market, and various household items could be used to equip local residents as skirmishers. Phyrrus, the famous king of Epirus, general who bested Rome in pitched battle, and would-be king of Macedon, died when a woman hit him in the head with a roof tile during an urban battle.

It might be difficult for attackers to maintain discipline during urban combat. After all, the loot is *right there* for the taking! Once you get into markets, neighborhoods, or temples, there's just so much stuff lying around for a soldier to get distracted by, not to mention some of the first women a soldier might have seen in a little while... There are a few records of attackers being routed after a counterattack was mounted simply because they were too busy raping and pillaging to effectively defend themselves.

But, obviously, not for those of us that major in the study of History. 

Of course, i get asked this all the time. And i never find myself being 100% sure of my answer- because often times, there are many. So i'm curious as to see what any history majors out there might have to say to justify a degree in History. 

I'll start. 
My most common answer, and the one i believe most whole-heartedly, is that studying history has given me a lens with which to view the entire world. It has affected every article i read, every news story i hear, absolutely everything- dinner conversation, online chatting in forums, you name it. Whereas many of my friends who are engineers have paid thousands of dollars in school for information that they will almost never use outside of an office/lab, (at least, not outside of work discussion), my money went toward something that changed my view of the world in a fundamental way. 


*edit*: since some people are just far to sensitive and completely stupid to see what i mean here, i will elaborate. I do NOT mean that all doctors, engineers, etc. do their job just for money
I do NOT believe that even most of them do (see how i used the word ""many""? Cool, huh?! It doesn't mean most!! Go on....look it up....i'll wait..................SEE?! Crazy, right??). 
I do NOT believe that teachers made tons of money, (as stated in a comment i posted below, i come from a family of 6 teachers, i'm well-aware of their incomes).

I DO believe that going to school for education, medicine, or engineering is a *more* secure way to have a job, (Jobs = money, whether a lot or not much at all, it's still money) than is an undergraduate degree in History by itself. 

I'm sorry if your inability to have a nuanced view of a topic has restricted you from seeing this.

The counter arguments appear to be

* Europe dominated because of its superior culture
* Europe has/had an imperialistic culture
* Political determinism (sub set of Culture IMHO)
* Technology determinism (sub set of Culture IMHO)
* History is more tangled and random, it has too many factors

I'm open to hear counter ideas. But I do see things that seem to imply geography, such as the relationship between national poverty and distance to the equator.

I hear some criticism that his ideas on germ transfer are wrong and that diseases did not transfer to Europe due to the oceanic journey being too long for virulent dangerous diseases to make the journey. This counters only the detail but maintains the overall theory of geographic determinism.

1304471811.0,291,self.history,h3maj,Hey History Reddit. I found some old photos from WW2 at a Garage Sale this past weekend. I scanned and uploaded them just for you! ,342,51,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/h3maj/hey_history_reddit_i_found_some_old_photos_from/,"Hey history reddit! I have a treat for you today! 


On Saturday I went out to a garage sale that an older couple in suburban South-Western Ohio had open. As I sorted though the mass of random household goods and clothes, most of which were left over from the 1970‘s. Garage sales are very hit or miss, but they are one of my favorite activities to go out and explore and you occasionally can make amazing finds. I started talking to the older lady and her husband about the crazy weather we had recently. It was then I noticed several packs of older looking objects on a table in front of her. 

They had a few artifacts from WW2 laying in plastic storage bags.. Mostly Pictures, stamps and Nazi memorabilia that her younger brother had brought back with him from Europe after the War. I asked her about them; she did not have much information about them and her husband interrupted her and started talking about a photo of a judge from the Gilded Age. From what I could gather her brother passed away years ago and he did not go into too much detail about them, nor did she remember much of the detail he did go into. 

From what she told me he was in Air Force during the War and served as a crew member abroad a B-29. He was stationed in Florida,  the UK, and later in France and Germany after the war. There were three items in particular that stood out to me. The first plastic storage bag was a pack of photos, both matte and glossy, that had from what I could tell 30 photos. The second was a smaller storage bag of German stamps, I could see a blue Hitler staring at me from below. The next was another bag with a Nazi lapel pin, or hat pin, I’m not entirely sure which it is.  The last was a set of prayer cards and random ads from 1941.

So I buy the lot for roughly $15, a steal considering the history that I had stumbled upon, the older couple were amazed that someone as young as I am would be interested in the history of these objects. I think I gave her faith in my generation. When I got them home I realized that it was three sets of different photos. The first was a pack of matte photos from the Liberation of Paris, the pack was obviously French, with a English insert for English speaking soldiers. The second was a set of six glossy photos of from an Air Force command training center in Miami, Fla. They look personal, but I’m not sure. The third set was a set of monument photos with descriptions in both French and German.

 I upload a few of the photos and check if I can find another source of them online with Tin Eye. A few I have, a few I can find no record of. So I decided to upload the whole sets for all my fellow History buffs on Reddit and save all the photos for net posterity. I scanned each and saved them as high quality .PNG files. 

Should I save these and hide them away in vacuum sealed bags and away from the sun or is there somewhere I should donate them for preservation? They are all quite old and I don’t have the resources to maintain them forever. I am not even too sure of their real historical value. So help there would be cool.

So here are the albums of the 30 or so photos that I have uploaded. I hope you guys and girls enjoy them!!! If you would like to see the Pin, the Stamps, or the Catholic prayer cards just let me know and I will take photos or scan them too.

**TLDR:**
I went to a garage sale and found some amazing old photos and memorabilia that a US Air Force soldier brought home after World War 2. I scanned and uploaded the three sets of photos I found. I hope you enjoy!

This subreddit got it's 45,000th subscriber sometime today.     Woot!   Woot!   

About 4.5 months ago [I said something](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/esk7b/history_reddit_got_to_35000_subscribers_today/) when  our friendly user based passed 35K.   And now in ~4.5 months we have added another 10,000 of you.   

I would also like to point out the [r/History Reading list](http://jottit.com/fyrxb/) -- and you should be able to edit it.    Please though, I would ask that you only add things.  I don't want people to get into fights about a book they don't like.  Inclusiveness for the book list is probably best in most circumstances.

Also, about a week ago I silently added a new Mod.  So, please welcome [Anutensil](http://www.reddit.com/user/anutensil) to the r/History mod staff.    Anutensil has been a long time contributor to this subreddit, and I should have added this most fine example of a good Redditor as a mod 2.5 months back during the events of the  [Great History Modding](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fiukn/let_us_sit_down_and_have_a_discussion_about_what/).    This oversight on my part has now been corrected.  

Next,  r/History is a supporter and member of the [DepthHub](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/) which is Blackstar9000's attempt to reform the Reddits back into what it once was  --  Heavy on good logical discussion and less weird with the pictures of people doing things to cats.    

I am still not sure how we got drafted into that.   But as a user I frequent several parts of the Depthhub, and I find some of it to be among the best parts of Redditown. 

And that leads me to bringing up the Sidebar,  over there -----&gt;  

There are a lot of smaller subreddits listed there.  Places, for example, like [r/Geology](http://www.reddit.com/r/geology/) and [r/MedievalHistory](http://www.reddit.com/r/MedievalHistory/).  They each are very nice smaller communities that some of you may well be interested in participating in them.   If I missed any other subreddit that should be added to the listing, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23history) and if it truly applicable to history or a closely related topic, one of us will add it.  

And if you have ideas for things r/History should be (or shouldn't be) doing, please let us know via a comment here.  We crazy Mods are always interested in what you think we are doing -- both the negative as well as positive.   Your feedback can help us in figuring out what you want from this community.  

And remember, don't take medical advice from DonutsCureCancer.  That guy had some odd opinions about biology and how those chemical reactions work.  Remember, this is r/History and his claims about the amazing curative powers of Donuts are, at best, greatly exaggerated.  

Lastly, I would like to know who got a-hold of the TARDIS and caused all those problems in 1914?   Just look at the damage you did!  

Thank you for participating in r/History! ",,False,,t5_2qh53,False,,,True,t3_h5acb,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/h5acb/history_reddit_got_to_45000_subscribers_today/,moderator

I have a question here for you guys. For the past couple of days I've been trying to find some reliable resources about Che Guevara; more particularly, sources that have some clear examples on why certain people view Che Guevara as 'evil', or 'bad'.

I am looking for rather specific examples of what he did that justifies those particular views, and not simple, ""he was anti-american revolutionary"". Mmm, I hope that I am being clear enough. So far, what I've seen from our glorious reddit community is ""He killed people, therefore he is a piece of shit murderer..."" or some really really really bizarre event with no citations etc. 

Not trying to start an argument, but I am really looking for some sources, or books etc.

Edit: Grammar.  
Edit: And here I thought /r/history would be interested in something like this.... Why the downvotes people? I am asking for sources, books, newspaper articles. Historical documents. Not starting some random, pointless, political debate, fucking a. :P 

Edit: Wow, thanks everyone! Thanks for all of the links and discussion, super interesting, and some great points!

Here it is.",324,71,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1fxgsa/my_greatgreatgrandfather_was_a_carpenter_born_in/,"So I was going through some old family records that my dad photocopied from my grandfather's files back in the 90's. Among them were a brief autobiographical sketch of my great-great-grandfather, John Paige Kennedy (edited by his son), one 7-page autobiography written a few years before he died, and a 1-page summary of his lifelong National Guard service. I've scanned the accounts &amp; put them in [this album](http://imgur.com/a/86Ufg#0).

A lot of it is a laundry list of buildings he worked on or built, but his military record has some interesting things (all typos are [sic]):

&gt;Military record of J.P.Kennedy. Enlisted in the National in Co. D. 13th regt. in aug. 1875. Was appointed Let. Seargt early in 1876. Camped in philadelphia for two weeks in aug 1876 at the centennial celebration.

&gt;Served as 1st Seargt in the Railroad riots in pittsburgh in p 1877. for 35 days. This co. mustered out in 1882.

&gt;Organized Co.D Fifth regt. N.G.P. in Blairsville in 1887. was elected Capt.. Had the Honor when the H.G was called to suppress the Mob in 1892 at homestead to command the advance on and disperse the rioters. This was the great Homestead strike.

&gt;Was Promoted to Major of the Fifth regt. in 1893. Commanded the first Batt. of the Fifth regt. In the Punxuutawney coal strike of 1894 

&gt;Volunteered os Major of the Fifth Penna. Volunteers for the war with Spain. Sworn in april 27th 1898. Musteres out Nov. 11th, 1898.

&gt;Commanded his Battalion in the Grand review in Philad. at close of the Spanish-American War.

&gt;This ended my Military service to the State and Nation.

I'm kind of shocked that I would have an ancestor who was directly involved in some of the most notorious labour disputes in American history; it's like he had a front-row seat for the Gilded Age.

The other, longer account is what gets me: It's about 7 pages long and is much more prosaic. His military record is almost nonexistent:

&gt;On the 19th of July the great r.r. strike occurred and there were great riots in several places but Pittsburgh was the worst anI with my brotherinlaw John.A.Mc.Kesson we went with the company almost a month.

&gt;In 1892 we had the Homestead Riots when the writer served in the same for a period of 32 days.

&gt;On the 15th of feb. 1898, the Battleship Maine was blown up in Havana harbor, resulting in a declaration of war with the Kingdom of Old Spain on the 27th. day of april. Yours truly spent the rest of that year as a volunteer soldier, being mustered out on the 11th day of november of 1898.

As for the laundry list of buildings, most of them are pretty standard wooden buildings (churches, houses, businesses et.al.), but there was one that stuck out:

 *Andrew Carnegie's summer home*

&gt;In the spring [of 1885] we got a contract to build a cottage for David Stewart of Pbgh. at the then summer resort of Cresson. In went on the Job and had the work done. Stewart was one of Carnegies partners in the steel business, and *before we got through we did a small piece of work for Andrew Car Carnegie on his summer home. I met and talked often with Carnegie, of course he did not at that time have the reputation he got soon after.*

It's one of those weird coincidences of history; a carpenter who worked on Carnegie's summer home was also one of the National Guard captains who helped suppress some of the biggest labour disputes in American history.

There's other stuff too, like a childhood memory of meeting a Union soldier, seeing ""blanket indians"" in Kansas, and his multiple attempts to volunteer for WWI (he was turned away for being too old).

Hope you enjoy!

I find this topic fascinating, thought maybe some others would as well.

[Here](http://unitedcats.wordpress.com/2008/01/08/the-worlds-first-eyewitness/) is another contender for earliest born to be photographed.


As for film, I've not found a great deal of info about that yet. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai8DEWmZF34) is a video of Pope Leo XIII, born 1810. Of course there is the [Roundhay Garden Scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1i40rnpOsA), the first ever motion picture, which features Sarah Whitley, born 1816, and Joseph Whitley, born 1817. And while not a true film, Michel Eugene Chevreul (1786) is shown [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erT2W5sxaFY) in a very early photo interview. 


I'm interested to see videos or photographs anyone else has been able to dig up. Apparently there is a woman named Rebecca Clarke who was born in the 1790s that there exists a video of, though I've not been able to find it.

Given time for more digging on Moche island in Chile I feel pretty certain it will be confirmed. 

The questions that develop from there is how long was the period of contact and whether there was 'waves of dispersion"" as some have theorized. If the beringian migrations were the primary way in which the Americans were people with the modern American Indian, then Austranesian origins may explain some S.

Visit to Verdun, to the hospital and wounded camp to see if there is some news about Paul.

When coming from England to America in 1755 to fight what became the Seven Years War, General Edward Braddock said that American natives ""may indeed be a formidable enemy to you raw American militia, but upon the King's regular British troops, Sir, it is impossible they should make any impression.""


His army of 2,200 British and colonial troops were ambushed by 251 French/ French-Canadian soldiers and militia with 600 native allies.


The casualties: of Braddock's force, 500 were killed (including Braddock), 500 more were wounded or captured.

Of the French/Native force only 23 were killed and 16 wounded.

When they were written out, they gave directions to a location in the Wicklow mountains in Ireland, which conveniently are an hours drive south of where I live. So one weekend we decided to follow the directions to see where they went and if whatever had been buried was still there. So after a day of trapesing across valleys and streams (it was sunny at least), we got lucky and found a small wooden box buried under a rock right where the note said it would be. Inside the box we found a number of coins, mostly from Britain around the turn of the century and a Franz Josef medal from 1849. Was a pretty cool experience all in all.

tl:dr: Followed directions in book to buried treasure in the mountains. I suck at writeups.

**Update for anyone who cares (sure as hell know I don't):** After talking to my dad today, when dug up the box was covered in a think coat of wax. As for how long it was buried there or who buried it, I don't fucking know. Does this go anyway towards mollifying Reddit's self-righteous indignation?

A horrific detail from the WWI battle of Passchendale,285,71,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/10o5d0/this_was_a_hit_in_rnosleep_a_while_back_i_think/,"I came across this horrific story while reading Adam Hochschild's excellent history of WW I **To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion**. Actually, the book is not a general history of WWI, but rather a history of the tiny but important opposition to the war in Britain. Hochschild follows the lives of several families who were torn by the war, with opponents pitted against their family members who were very much in favor of continuing the inter-imperial slaughter. It s a beautiful and moving book, and I highly recommend it. 

In one chapter Hochschild tells of the disaster at Passchendale. I summarize, and Hochschild's quotes are indented:


This was a brutal battle, typical of WW I battles. Here, British Empire troops (including Britons, Indians, and Canadians) launched an assault against the German lines beginning July 17, 1917. While the battle was scheduled to be only a few days, it turned into several months. British forces would begin with a barrage of artillery shelling from in front of the enemy lines, then aiming farther back to cover the lines and the area behind them. Then soldiers would march forward, cutting barbed wire and enduring return shelling from the Germans. If all went well, they would push the Germans back and regain Belgian territory. Both sides had used this technique in  battles farther to the south.

However, the ground where the battle took place - near the Belgian village of Passchendale - was at a low altitude above sea level. This made for effects that neither side had anticipated. The water table was only a few feet below the ground. When the shelling began, the ground was dry, but after the artillery assault and return fire from the Germans, the land between the lines was cratered like the moon. Meanwhile, it had begun to rain.

The rain, combined with the high water table, turned the ground into a soupy mud. Men, horses and equipment became stuck in the mud. From the book:

&gt;""I cannot attempt to describe the conditions under which we are fighting,"" wrote John Mortimer Wheeler, later a well-known archaeologist. ""Anything I could write about them would seem an exaggeration but would, in reality, be miles below the truth.... The mud is not so much mud as a fathomless, sticky morass. The shell holes, where they do not actually merge into one another, are divided only by a few inches of this glutinous mud.... The gunners work thigh-deep in water."" Some British artillery pieces dug themselves so deeply into the mud with their recoils that they dropped below the surface; the crew would then put up a flag to mark the spot.""

Injured men would crawl into shell craters to shield themselves from gunfire, only to find the crater filling up with water. Untold thousands drowned.

&gt;Private Charlie Miles of the Royal Fusiliers carried messages as a runner—a misnomer in this season: ""The moment you set off you felt that dreadful suction.... In a way, it was worse when the mud didn't suck you down...[then] you knew that it was a body you were treading on. It was terrifying. You'd tread on one on the stomach, perhaps, and it would grunt all the air out.... The smell could make you vomit."" And when shells landed, they blasted waterlogged, putrefying corpses into the air, showering pieces of them down on the soldiers who were still alive.

Meanwhile, the combination of censorship and state propaganda meant that a rosy picture of the battle and its heroism and victory was being pumped out all over Britain:

&gt;British, Australian, and Canadian troops inched ever closer to the little village of Passchendaele as newspaper headlines triumphally announced, ""Our Position Improved; Heroism in the New Advance"" (the Times); ""Complete Success in Battle of the Pill Boxes; Haig's Smashing Blow"" (the Daily Mirror).
&gt;In the sanitizing language of newspapers and memorial services, these Canadians, and all the British Empire troops who lost their lives in the three-and-a-half-month battle, were referred to as the ""fallen."" But in the mud of Passchendaele, falling dead from a bullet wound was only for the lucky:*""A party of 'A' Company men passing up to the front line found ... a man bogged to above the knees,""* remembered Major C. A. Bill of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. *""The united efforts of four of them, with rifles beneath his armpits, made not the slightest impression, and to dig, even if shovels had been available, would be impossible, for there was no foothold. Duty compelled them to move on up to the line, and when two days later they passed down that way the wretched fellow was still there; but only his head was now visible and he was raving mad.""*",,False,,t5_2qh53,1348934578.0,,,True,t3_10o5d0,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/10o5d0/this_was_a_hit_in_rnosleep_a_while_back_i_think/,

1334140815.0,206,self.history,s45cr,Misconception on the Vietnam War. ,279,73,262,http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/s45cr/misconception_on_the_vietnam_war/,"It always surprises me that most of the Western World views the Vietnam War as the war between Vietnam and the US. My impression is that the general opinion on the matter usually surrounds how the US should not have been in Vietnam in the first place and Vietnam was relieved to be reunified. The Vietnamese communists are portrayed in a positive light while the US and South Vietnam are not.
I admit that I'm a little bit biased because of my family history but hopefully I can offer a different POV into the Vietnam war so everyone out there would know that not all Vietnamese are happy with the reunification process.

My mom's family was originally from North Vietnam but they were small business owners so they were considered to be bourgeois by the Communists, who harassed and threatened them at various instances. After the Geneva Treaty was signed, the country was split into two parts, her family emigrated to the south to escape persecution from the communists. My paternal grandparents were small landowners who were brought to trials by the communists but thanks to the villagers who testified for them, they escaped punishment and eventually moved down South. According to my parents, South Vietnam enjoyed relative freedom and prosperity due to the presence of American culture and products. Even though many people would say that the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem (South Vietnam's first president) was full of repression, my parents would say that it was the most stable period of the South Vietnam's relatively short life because the country was relatively safe from the North's attacks due to his strict policies toward communists. Freedom wise, people went on protests and were able to criticize the government openly. However, his regime was only viewed negatively by the American public and the world since with the presence of the American press in the south, no protests could escape public sight. Thus most people came to the conclusion that Vietnamese people are unhappy with the South Vietnam government. Meanwhile, what's going on in the north is heavily shielded from public awareness, including famine, persecution, and lack of freedom. My parents often said that although they were poor, they still had the privilege of cinemas, music concerts, and listening to the Beatles. All of these privileges disappeared once the Communists took over the South.

I do not deny the fact that South Vietnam was full of corrupted and incompetent leaders but I want to emphasize that we did not welcome or rejoice the presence of North Vietnamese Liberation Army in the South. If we did, there would not be an exodus of 2 million Vietnamese people to other countries, at the risk of being attacked by pirates, getting lost at sea, or being arrested by the Vietnamese communist soldiers and being put in jails. The war ended around the time my dad was getting ready for his college applications. He was barred from attending college for several years due to discrimination against his family history (he had two brothers who were drafted into the South Vietnam Army, who were then put in reconcentration camp, i.e a form of prison for ex South VN soldiers, and who came back with no teeth and had to face discrimination when applying for jobs). My parents spent their early 20s being malnourished from the lack of food (just like North Korea today) and being deprived of every privilege that I now get to enjoy. In Vietnam nowadays, if anyone ever makes any statement on sensitive issues concerning the lack of freedom or government policies, that person would be put to jail without any hope of seeing his/ her protest being covered by the press. 

A lot of people are surprised at the fact that there is a large Vietnamese population in the US (because Vietnamese supposedly hate the US for invading their country). I want to clarify that this population is mostly composed of South Vietnamese refugees, who ran away to America to escape the persecution of the Communists. Not all Vietnamese people have a resentment toward the US. That resentment was created and promoted by Communist propaganda. In fact, the founder/ leader of North Vietnam Communist, Ho Chi Minh, originally petitioned to Woodrow Wilson to help in the Vietnamese revolution against the French colonization. Wilson was not interested so Ho Chi Minh turned to communist Russia for assistance instead and his ideology became radical then. A lot of South Vietnam people however felt a little bit betrayed by the US's sudden withdrawal of troops, which left South Vietnam in a defenseless state (thanks to the South Vietnam incompetent army leaders) against North Vietnam+China+USSR. Most of the South Vietnamese do not hate the US and we feel grateful that the US offered us a safe haven over here so we could start our community all over. In California, the only Vietnam flag that can be seen is the old South Vietnam flag (before the end of the war). If the current Communist Vietnamese flag is ever raised for any reason, the Vietnamese community would gather together to stage a protest until the flag is taken down. Some people think that we are pathetic for losing the war to the North and not being able to fight for our country back. However, I do hope with time, the Vietnamese Communist government would be dissolved and replaced with a democratic one.
