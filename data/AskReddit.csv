The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight).*** College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars.|

Dump some in the toilet and wait about five minutes and flush again. The soap lubricates the nasties so they'll flush away. If its still clogged, find a way to dump hot water in the toilet, as it can have the same effect. Use the trash can or something. If its still clogged, kick the door open and run like hell.

Instead, tell her to ""dress for a first date with a guy she really likes"". Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date! EDIT: Men: You're going to wear a pair of CLEAN, NEAT jeans, a pressed stylish LONG sleeve button down shirt, nice shoes or boots (try to avoid tennis shoes of sneakers). Works for ANY occasion!|

Ever wondered just how Angelica could talk to the babies? Angelica is the only one who can talk to the babies because they are a figment of her imagination. She is spoilt, sad and lonely, because her Mother is constantly working and has no time for her. Her relationship with her Dad is superficial and unsubstantial, no real love is ever shown to her.

So how did it come about that Angelica would have to imagine these babies? Tommy died soon after child birth, a fact reflected by Stu never leaving the basement, inventing toys that his son will never play with. Chuckie died in the car crash along with his Mum, also reflected in the actions of his father; the crash has made him a pathetic nervous wreck most of the time. 

Most interesting is Phil and Lil. There never where any twins, there was just one baby. However this baby was a still born, and Angelica never knew the sex of the still born, so she invented twins of different genders.

Sadly, Angelica never uses her imaginary friends to comfort or entertain her, instead she is mean and nasty to them. She has invented this relationship with these babies so she can vent her frustrations of being a spoilt, lonely brat who has seen much hardship from these unfortunate parents; frustrations that can't be satisfied by a typical childhood relationship with a doll, albeit a Cynthia one.

Back in highschool i dated a girl for 6 months before she decided it wasn't working out anymore and she cheated on me with about 6 guys and stole my iPhone and wallet to buy drugs. I wanted to report her to the police like my parents encouraged me to and to prevent me from doing such her brother jumped me while I was walking home with his friends and busted open my lip pretty badly and threatened to kill me if i reported him or his sister (this is South Florida, so i believed he would do it).

My dad got a new job and we moved to a new city but i was still pissed about this whole situation so i did the next best thing. I created two fake facebook account of a random hot girl and guy, spent some time making it look legit with friends and such and added her brother on facebook with the girl and my ex with the guy. 

It wasnt too long before he started flirting ""me"" up and tried his best to get in this girls pants. on the other hand, having already courted my now ex i knew exactly what to say to charm her to the point that she was in love with me. This is where it all begins to get fun.

I started a sexting relationship between the brother and sister with me as the intermediate thanks to google voice. Both of them had fairly typical south florida bodies so nothing really gave anything away and i did a fair amount of photoshopping to remove identifiers in the room that may give away anything. 

This went on for about a month and a half totaling about 200 or so nudes between the two of them when i decided to reveal the curtain and send a group of unedited pictures that included key identifiers (face and rooms). 

Oh holy jesus how shit went down. I only wish i had some way to see how they reacted. Friends who still lived there told me her brother moved in with his dad that week and that they no longer spoke.

All in all, about 4 months till i got my revenge but it was amazing.

2. Whenever you're sautéing, frying, or wok-ing don't crowd the pan.
3. Prep all of your stuff before starting to cook.

Awesome steak technique from ironicouch

""My friend's mother taught me how to cook steak a few months back, so far it has not failed me. You have to make sure your steak is dry, use a paper towel to dry it off. Heat the skillet before putting the steak on, you want to hear it sizzle when you place it in the pan. Rub the steak down with just a little olive oil and some sea salt and then place it in the pan for until it starts browning, so it doesn't take long on the stove, then put in the oven at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes or even less depending on how rare you like it.
Everyone has their own method, but this was the simplest way I have heard it being made, and it always tastes fantastic.""


Another great steak cooking tip from FirstAmendAnon

""Alright, this is a great method, but leaves out a few important details. Here's the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at home:
Buy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse. If its more than 2"" thick it's usually better. Look for a lot of marbling (little white lines of fat through the meat). The more the better.
Stick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight (watch out for cross-contamination! make sure your fridge is clean). This ages the meat and helps dry it out. Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge, pat it down with paper towels, and leave it out until your ready to season.
Preheat your oven to really hot, like 500F, and stick your (ovensafe!) pan in there. That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quickly.
Season both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil. I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesn't really make much difference.
Pan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt. Stick your steak in there, it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly. This is the goodness. 2 minutes on both sides, then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the oven.
after about 3 minutes, open the oven (there will be lots of smoke, run your fan), and flip the steak. 2 or three more minutes, pull it out. If you like it more on the well done side, leave it a little longer. Do not leave it for more than like 5 minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers. Take it off the heat. Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak. Baste in all its glory.
Let the meat rest for about five minutes. I use that time to make the plate prettified. Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom. Brussel sprouts on the side. Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak. Be creative.
This method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak. Like, blowjob-inducing 100% of the time. It's really high-heat and ingredient driven though, so be careful, and spend that extra $5 on the good cut of meat.
EDIT: As a couple of people below have mentioned, a well-seasoned cast iron pan is best for this method.
Also, the 5th bullet is slightly unclear. You take the hot pan out of the oven, place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat, and sear the steak for 2min ish on both sides. Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven.""",,False,,t5_2qh1i,1356736983.0,,,True,t3_15ivs8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15ivs8/chefs_of_reddit_what_are_some_some_tips_and/,

Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed).  I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week).

I also [donated the money](http://i.imgur.com/DZhKK.jpg) I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels).  

I'm interested in doing something similar next summer, but on a bigger scale/actually organized.  Something where you could vote on where to send me a on week to week basis.  In the mean time I'm going to work on turning the footage I took this summer into something (short documentary or music video or something).

I just wanted to thank everyone once again,

Let's say we go back in time with a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), since the numbers of members and equipment is listed for our convenience in [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Expeditionary_Unit), could we destroy all 30 of Augustus' legions? 

We'd be up against nearly 330,000 men since each legion was comprised of 11,000 men. These men are typically equipped with limb and torso armor made of metal, and for weaponry they carry swords, spears, bows and other stabbing implements. We'd also encounter siege weapons like catapults and crude incendiary weapons. 

We'd be made up of about 2000 members, of which about half would be participating in ground attack operations. We can use our ~~four Abrams M1A1 tanks, our artillery and~~ mechanized vehicles (60 Humvees, 16 armored vehicles, etc), but we cannot use our attack air support, only our transport aircraft. 

We also have medics with us, modern medical equipment and drugs, and engineers, but we no longer have a magical time-traveling supply line (we did have but the timelords frowned upon it, sadly!) that provides us with all the ammunition, equipment and sustenance we need to survive. We'll have to succeed with the stuff we brought with us.

So, will we be victorious? 

I really hope so because I really dislike Octavian and his horrible family. Getting Atia will be a bonus.

**Mustard-Tiger**

Wow! Thank you for gifting me Reddit Gold! I feel like a little kid who's won something cool, like that time my grandma made me a robot costume out of old cereal boxes and I won a $10 prize that I spent on a Thomas the Tank Engine book! That might seem as if I'm being unappreciative, but watching this topic grow today and seeing people derive enjoyment from all the different ideas and scenarios that have been put forward by different posters has really made my day, and receiving Reddit Gold from Mustard-Tiger is the cherry on the top that has left me feeling just as giddy as that little kid who won a voucher for a bookshop. Again, thank you very much, Mustard-Tiger. I'm sure I will make good use of Reddit Gold. 

Thank you to all the posters who've recommended books, comics and movies about alternative histories and time travel. I greatly appreciate being made aware of the types of stories and ideas that I really enjoy reading or watching. It's always nice to receive recommendations from people who share your interest in the same things.

Edit - In my head the magical resupply system only included sustenance, ammo and replacement equipment like armor. Men and vehicles would not be replaced if they died or were destroyed. I should have made that clear in my OP. Okay, let's remove the magical resupply line, instead replacing it with enough equipment and ammo to last for, say, 6 months. Could we destroy all of the Roman Empire in that space of time before our modern technological advantages ceased to function owing to a lack of supplies?

Edit 3 - Perhaps I've over estimated the capabilities of the Roman forces. If we remove the tanks and artillery will we still win?

Okay, the past month and a half has been insane. Like I said in my last post, the code was originally signed to only run on the desktop that I was assigned, and also required a password upon starting. I felt secure in that they couldn't steal and rip the code and fire everyone. I then went to my manager and told him what I was doing. He asked me (In Dutch...) ""Is the program still on the work desktop, and did you do it on company time?"" I replied yes, and yes. I was promptly fired and expelled from the building. Once I left, I called my bosses superior (? or inferior?? the one higher...) and left him a voice mail saying what happened and that my boss fired me for it, but I thought he was being close minded and not open to advancing the company. I also got a call from my manager, telling me I have to give him the password... I told him I am no longer employed and am not required to any longer.

I get a call from my bosses boss, and he asks to have a meeting with me to discuss what actually happened and if it is true that it could save money, he would listen. but I was hellbent on refusing to give out the password. Not to be mean/defensive, but the code was not designed for anyone to use, it was very primitive in the way it had to be setup. I didn't want to be liable for someone using it incorrectly.

I met with him a week later, we discussed over tea about the program. I asked if I was doing anything wrong or immoral, and he said that the only issue was that I coded it on company time when I wasn't supposed too, and that the app not only was fine (no requirement to have it done by a person), but also saved the money lots and lots of money and they never even realized it. (They would have had to hire more people to handle the load, but didn't because everything was getting done.) 

Once we talked about it, he said I was very talented and asked why I worked in the line of work I do instead of software engineering, I replied that I found this job first and was making such great money-- which he didn't expect, and asked me how much I was making, me telling him the true amount. He was floored and cracked up laughing, I made more than my boss (but not the guy I was talking too). He told me he would love to give me a job doing software engineering for the entire companies systems. I agreed only if that the current employees wouldn't be fired and would be put into different places in the company. We came to a compromise that some of the useless people (There were a few...) would be let go (these people are morons beyond belief), but that he could find jobs for the rest (Translation was a big one, since us Dutch people have a culture of learning others languages, sales, HR and other departments, and a few of them were offered training for the jobs. A handful was kept on the original team but their job was changed from manual input to now they work with the tool I built. As far as I know, the bonus program was slashed a lot, but they're still making more bonus than before I bet since I was taking it all)

So now I am a lead software engineer over my own department, making the same base pay as I was making base+bonus previously. (No bonus, unfortunately haha) Most other workers moved departments or changed jobs in their department, so most people got a good deal.

Except my boss. They were upset with him before this, and were even more upset after him. He was notoriously a bad manager and he was fired over this. Oh well. They hired one of the previous people on my team to take over his job :)

This one totally takes the cake for me though.

I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes.

While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer (bobtail) so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. The dance for the organ grinder kind. I think they are called Rhesus monkeys perhaps. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least.

The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. In retrospect I think eagerly aggressive may be a more appropriate description for his disposition. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog.

The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way (I told you he was a jerk didn't I?). Says that his dog ain't bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around. 

Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand.

The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers ""Last chance to save your dog's ass man."" In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap.

Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store.

That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that. I am both fortunate and humble to have been so privileged to be present for such an event.

So Reddit, please do tell. What's your craziest thing you have ever seen in public?

14 thousand comments and counting.

I'm humbled and grateful for every one of the comments, upvotes and the endless amounts of music suggestions.

Currently the most upvoted comment isn't a song suggestion but rather a suggestion to listen to the music from the beginnings of its orgins. Here's the original comment below as submitted by GiraffeKiller- ""This is like introducing an Alien to the music of Earth. I wouldn't know where to start. Once you're through your kick on Classical, I might start with music from the 50's and progress through each decade. You can really see the growth of modern music like that.""

I think it's a wonderful idea, and will be blogging about my journey into the world of music. As many of you have pointed out; music didn't start in the 50's, so I'm going to start with the earliest written form of music… I'm going to start with Guillaume de Machaut's Agnus Dei. (Composed sometime between 1313 and 1365)

I am still posting my top 5 next week... It will be a difficult task considering all the submissions.

This week I am going to re-watch my favorite film of all time, Baraka. This will be my first time being able to hear the soundtrack of the film. I will be posting about that as well.

Also for all of those asking- the hearing aids I got is the Phonak Naida S Premium.

Again, thank you for all the kind words and shares!

Even if you’re not hearing music for the first time ever, I suggest looking through the suggestions and expanding your musical tastes. You never know how much more days you have left to hear.... Trust me on this one, you don’t want to miss out on a great song.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

I've never understood it.

My whole life I've seen hearing people make a fool of themselves singing their favorite song or gyrating on the dance floor. I've also seen hearing people moved to tears by a single song. That was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around. 

I was born profoundly deaf and all music sounded like trash through my hearing aids. 

That is until a couple days ago when I put on a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years. 

The first thing I heard was my shoe scraping across the carpet; it startled me. I have never heard that before and out of ignorance, I assumed it was too quiet for anyone to hear.

I sat in the doctor's office frozen as a cacophony of sounds attacked me. The whir of the computer, the hum of the AC, the clacking of the keyboard, and when my best friend walked in I couldn't believe that he had a slight rasp to his voice. He joked that it was time to cut back on the cigarettes. 

That night, a group of close friends jump-started my musical education by playing Mozart, Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Elvis, and several other popular legends of music. 

Being able to hear the music for the first time ever was unreal.

I realized that my old hearing aids were giving me a distorted version of music. they were not capable of distributing higher frequencies with clarity, instead it was just garbled gibberish. 

When Mozart's Lacrimosa came on, I was blown away by the beauty of it. At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Tears rolled down my face and I tried to hide it.  But when I looked over I saw that there wasn't a dry eye in the car.

I finally understood the power of music.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Obviously, I did the only sensible thing and went on a binge of music. 

Below are my top 5 favorites from my limited exposure to the world of sound.

1. Mozart's Lacrimsoa
2. The soundtrack to Eleven Eleven… I can see how this comes off as narcissistic, it being my own film and all but it's such a personal work that when I listened to it for the first time I broke down. I felt like I was truly seeing the film for the first time ever. I'm grateful that Cazz was able to capture the tone perfectly. We discussed the film and specific scenes with essay-sized reasoning/deliberations on what should be conveyed. The critical response to the film surprised me and I still didn't quite get it until seeing the visual images coupled with the soundtrack. 
3. Sig Ros's Staralfur 
4. IL Postino-Luis Bacalov 
5. Minnesota's A Bad Place

Ironically enough, I'm turning my hearing aids off more often than before because most sounds are even more annoying and the only times I have it on is when talking to people or listening to music/birds. 

Silence is still my favorite sound. When I turn my aids off my thoughts become more clear and it's absolutely peaceful. 

I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence. 

What exactly changed between my old hearing aids and my new ones? 

My previous hearing aids were only 4 years old but technology has gotten cheaper and better at an exponential rate since then. 

Before, I could almost hear the low frequencies at a hearing person’s level, but not as crisp... higher notes on the other hand, I didn’t hear at all. 

I never realized how little of a range my hearing aids picked up compared to hearing people until a telecommunications class in college. We were learning about radio equipment and the guest professor told us about how high human ears can hear and also compared to various animals. 

He turned around and turned the dial down to the lower pitches. I could still hear nearly all the low frequencies  like rest of the class. When he turned the dial in the opposite direction, I blanked out at about 40% and the rest of the class stopped between 90-100%. 

It’s an odd feeling learning something so profound about yourself at twenty one... But it’s not as odd as the things I can hear now.

It was during Lacrimosa that I realized I was truly hearing pitches I’ve never experienced before. It was like seeing a color I’ve never seen before.

I honestly never thought I would really be able to hear my own soundtracks because I have accepted my deafness, I have always been and still am grateful for all I've been blessed with so it was never a big deal to me.

Now... I'm overwhelmed and beyond grateful. 

But this is just the beginning. That’s why I’m asking you to give me the name of the most beautiful songs to you. 

I’ve posted the question on reddit and will listen to the top 30 upvotes and then post my top 5 from that batch.

1336013594.0,2937,self.AskReddit,t4gyp,Update: In the middle of March I was sitting at a red light and was rear-ended in a hit-and-run where the other car left an imprint of their license on my bumper and reddit figured out the plate number.,19735,16798,2109,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t4gyp/update_in_the_middle_of_march_i_was_sitting_at_a/,"[Link to original](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/r0e88/)

So, amazingly, *crustlessmist* and *jwild98* determined the correct license and created a damning visual aid to show it within hours of my original submission. I gave the information to the police, who took over a week to respond to me, but said that they located the owner of that license and served papers to them.

Meanwhile, I had given the same information to my insurance provider: Geico. They ended up telling me that the other party was also insured with Geico and had submitted a claim just after the accident happened, claiming that they were involved in a hit and run(!). I asked and the agent told me that they claimed the car was parked and unoccupied when it was hit. The other agent got a recorded statement from me over the phone, which was extremely formal. She was all business until she asked if she could stop recording and I said yes, after which she said, ""Woooooow. I haven't had one like this in a long time!""

After some talking and investigation by Geico, they determined that I was the innocent party and I finally got a car rental from them (after a month of sharing a van with my wife and three kids, which is a pain when you need to get to work early). They didn't want to give me the rental earlier because they didn't know whether MY uninsured motorist insurance should pay for it or if we would find the other party and make their insurance pay for it.

Geico found out that the insured person's son had been driving that night and decided to lie about the accident when they got home. I still figure he must have been doing something illegal at the time since he had insurance and still didn't stop. I don't know, though. The police never told me his name and haven't contact me further regarding the issue.

Yesterday, they finally inspected and estimated the repairs my car would need. Today, they told me that they were declaring it a total loss and they will give me $2,800 (and change) for my 2000 Buick LeSabre Ltd. I'm not a car guy, but I remember him saying something along the lines of the ""rails"" being warped and the quarterpanels being bowed out and some other things. They were just looking at body damage and it was over the value of the car (it's not counting the mechanical damage that was done). I have until Friday to determine if I want to accept the offer for the title.

Geico also said they would pay for my medical bills, but it's a one time payment after treatment is ended. I have to give them HIPAA permission to get my bills from my medical providers and they will pay them. They also mentioned something about ""mental anguish"" and ""suffering"" but never mentioned a number. I guess a month without my normal convenient mode of travel and initially not being able to walk without immense pain after the accident count as anguish and suffering... so how much is that worth? I can't really think of an amount that I'd be happy to take if it were going to happen to me again.

So one day I'm sitting at a red light, minding my own business and a month and a half later I've lost my primary vehicle for an amount of money that can't cover a comparable vehicle. 

Still, it was exciting to hunt down the offender and at least get him to be held accountable for his prevarications and douchebaggery. Thank you for all of the help, reddit!

*Edit: saw the wall of text after I submitted and determined I should add a tl;dr*

**TL;DR**: Cops found ass who hit me and ran. Geico also found him. Ass had claimed hit-and-run on his own vehicle. Geico determined I was right and he was wrong. Geico says it will pay for my medical bills. Geico totals my car and offers me $2,800 (I have until Friday to accept). I now have no car.

**Edit:** It is amazingly difficult to keep up with the waves of people crashing into this thread. I just want people to know that I'm doing my best to read the comments, even if I'm not responding to all of them. And I'm totally getting the feeling that I need to speak to a lawyer. :) Thank you.

**Edit:** Wow! The number 1 spot on the front page! And I didn't even misspell anything in the title or make any glaring grammatical errors!

We have a breakfast laid on at work every morning, just a simple buffet of eggs, bacon what have you. Nothing huge and it's really only to feed about a dozen people or so. I am usually one of the first guys from my team to get to work and the kitchen was deserted as usual. I walked into the little kitchen, there was a ceramic egg tray thing with 12 eggs in it, like the bottom half of an egg carton with a socket for each egg. All spaces are filled with warm freshly boiled eggs. 

I take one, walk over to the garbage bin, shuck the shell then I walk back over to the food and stop dead. There are 12 eggs in the tray again. ***No one entered the room while I was peeling the thing***. I touched the mystery egg it was the same temp as the other eggs around it.

Not a big thing, nothing major, but something very strange. Given one does not get presented with strange eggs from a parallel universe every day I peeled and ate that one too.

**TL:DR** - Found strange quantum egg at breakfast. Ate it. Did not gain super powers.

1274792439.0,2687,self.AskReddit,c7wby,Ok reddit lets make it...The List of Real Life Cheat Codes!!!!,5595,2908,7673,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c7wby/ok_reddit_lets_make_itthe_list_of_real_life_cheat/,"got the idea from this: http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c7osn/so_i_rented_a_movie_out_of_one_of_those_redboxdvd/c0qoplp.

Post your codes and I'll add them to the list!

cheat list:

1. Stop: Stop: Play. Skip advertisements in movies and go strait to the movie.


2. Dial 0 during most automatic menu phone systems to be taken to operator to route your call. also, mashing buttons may work as well. Whenever you have a voice automated phone system, typically saying ""representative"" gets you someone right away. **Update** In regards to Cheat Code # 2 I recommend this site: http://gethuman.com/


3.  keep a spare car key in your wallet/purse. If you have a bulky Key that won't fit in your wallet, get a key made that doesn't have the electronic chip on it. It will still unlock the car, it just won't start it. ***changed by popular request*** **Risk Update:** if your wallet is stolen they have your car key. All they need to do is go to your house some time later and take your car out of your driveway.

4. Riding a bicycle will save you lots of money on gas, parking, medical bills, and gym memberships.


5. If you are speeding and suddenly up ahead see a cop that clearly just tagged you, slow down and wave to him/her. Your odds of being pulled over are quite a bit reduced.


6. Don't be rude, but NEVER answer any cops questions when they call you in for questioning.


7. when getting lectured into voice mail, hit 1, pause momentarily. If you aren't put through immediately, hit *, pause. Finally, hit # if neither 1 or * worked. It is called the 1-star-pound technique, and it works for all cell carriers.


8. If your credit card magnetic stripe starts to get worn from use and being in your wallet, and doesn't always read in the card reader, you can use the plastic bag trick. Put the card in a plastic grocery bag and then swipe it. Not sure why it works, but it does.Taking it further though, you can simply apply a piece of quality cellophane tape over the mag stripe for a ""permanent"" plastic bag trick.


9. At the end of your shower turn the water really (or all the way) cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. **Update** update 9: It also closes your pores to allow for less dirt and bacteria to get in to help reduce acne problems.



10. Macy's credit cards usually have a 20% discount on purchases. I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card. I just got 20% off my purchase and I never get a credit card bill. - this also works with JCP and kohl's cards.


11. **im replacing the free movie rental cheat because its unpopular...mostly with movie rental clerks :-/ heres a new one!** When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase. Google the promo codes. They're out there - you can get anything from free shipping to 25% off the purchase.


12. Turn it off, then on again.


13. Buy things out of season, this can save you money. Unless its food, then buy it in season.


14. When you have forgotten someones name, simply say : ""I'm sorry, but what was your name one more time."" They may act offended, but when they give you there first name you simply reply ""No, I meant your last name."" (more socially acceptable to forget). Bingo. First and last names.


15. When eating buffalo wings, the flat portions. You can detach the smaller bone on one end very easily, then twist it a bit and it will just slide out. You're now left with a big hunk of meat and only 1 bone, you can just bite it off into your mouth in one piece, flintstones-style. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcOY-PvOC8


16. Gently work an orange in your hands to loosen the peel from the fruit. This makes it easy enough to get the whole peel in one shot.


17. Can't find your car in a parking lot? hitting the lock button trying to get it to beep? Extend the distance of key-less entry by putting the key under your chin. The signal will resonate in your skull increasing the range dramatically. I swear to god this works, and I'm told it's safe because the radiation is non-ionizing. **verification notice** from ddrt via AskReddit sent 20 hours ago 9 is called the scottish shower. Just sayin' EDIT: I just tried #17 holy shit it works!


18. If you get a ticket on the windshield of your car, you can potentially get away with parking illegally in the same lot for the rest of the day by keeping the ticket on your windshield. **edited** reduced from a few days for a single day.

19. Most tinfoil and saran wrap boxes have little push-in tabs on the sides. If you push them in, the roll won't fall out when you try to rip out a sheet of it.

20. Keep a list of all of the credit card phone numbers (1-800) in your cell phone. This way, if your wallet is ever lost, you can call them immediately to have them disabled. It's also a good idea to place all of the cards in your wallet on a copier and print a page to keep at home. This will give you access to your License #, etc. **Update:** You should update 20. If you lose your wallet.. as in misplace it.. put a hold on your credit cards. Do NOT cancel. If you cancel it can later show up on your credit report. If you believe you are going to find it later, placing a hold saves you the red mark on your report.


21. If you are driving an unfamiliar car and you don't know which side the gas tank is on, just look at the little pump icon next to the gas gauge on the dashboard. The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. ***Update:*** saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. **Second Update** 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. **Third update** if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side


22. **this tip was unpopular, so im changing it** This one changed my life. If you're at home/work/party or GOD forbid your girlfriend's house and the toilet starts to overflow, take the lid off the back reservoir part and lift the long handle as far up as it will go. The water will stop rising and then you can quietly mutter curses at it till it goes back down (which it does, more often than not...) link to a Diagram: http://superhomeideas.com/images/toilet.gif 


23. to peel a boiled egg, roll it around on your plate for a while until all of the eggshell is cracked evenly. Then it's easy to remove the complete shell at once. After you boil eggs immediately place them in ice cold water for a few minutes. No vinegar or salt or oil or whatever people use. Shells slip right off

24. you spill any liquid that will stain on your carpet (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet - just rub it in with your hands. Leave it there for a few hours (for serious stains, up to a day) and vacuum it out. Voila, stain gone.

25. If you park in a large parking garage/shopping centre, get out and take a photo on your cell phone of the nearest parking sign (Area B2, etc). You will never lose your car again.

26. If you drive stick and the battery s dead, get some friends, put the key to the on position, put the car in 2nd and push the clutch down. have your friends push your car. when you get a decent speed going let the clutch up. (this is called ""Popping the clutch."" your car with start and you can drive around for a while to recharge your battery(provided nothing is wrong with the battery or the alternator). **Update** thanks for the input guys, i switched it from 1st geear to 2nd gear.

27. Tapping on the top of a beer or soda can will make it fizz less!

28. Peel a banana from the bottom, *which is one of /r/sciences 2nd highest scoring link of all time!* http://www.reddit.com/r/science/top/?t=all

29. 4,2,3,1 -- Vending machine cheat code. (As in, the vertical buttons machines, like this one http://www.enterprisevending.com/Images/vending.jpg ). will grant access to vending machine's diagnostic menu. most times the fun features are disabled, but i've gotten a free powerade and a couple cokes in the past.


30. **use this at your own risk *Re: #30, I worked as a parking enforcement officer during college and we can tell when it's fake. The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight).*** College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars.

At one point I look up from my table and I see a twenty dollar bill laying at the feet of an attractive blonde making an order.  I assumed it was hers since her wallet was open, so I walked over, picked it up and gave it to her. She took a look in her wallet and had all her money accounted for, so she told me it wasn't hers and said something along the lines of 'finders keepers'.  So without thinking I handed the twenty to the cashier to pay for her order and walked back to my table. A few moments later, the blonde walked over to thank me and give me the change.  I said ""I know that normally guys are supposed to introduce themselves first and then take a girl out for coffee, but since I did this all backwards, how would you like to sit down and give me a chance to introduce myself?"" She sat down. We talked. I got her phone number AND a date this weekend.  In no way could I have scripted it any better.

I was in seventh grade, and my older sister was in ninth. She was having a bunch of friends from school over. I thought I'd be hilarious, and hide in her closet before they got to her room with the intention of popping out and scaring them. So I'm in the closet just waiting, and my sister comes in the room with about four or five of her friends. They are all just talking for a few minutes, and I start to get bored. I decide it's time to make my move. 

I jump out, and I see something I had never seen in person. Boobs. Boobs everywhere. My sister and all of her friends are standing or sitting around topless and in their panties. I couldn't believe it. They all covered up and yelled at me to get out. 

Don't ever let girls try to tell you they don't do this when they hang out. I've seen it with my own eyes.

Almost immediately I went over to her and started kissing her, doing things I know get her hot until we spent the rest of the night doing the dirty together. Afterwards, I remarked at how random that was -- I had a lot of work to get done and wasn't really in the mood before. She then informed me that she was horny and just used her ""trick."" 

What was the trick? For the past several months, whenever she did almost *anything* sexual with me, she made sure to put her hair up. Slowly but surely, she built up this connection that whenever she reached back to put up her hair, I would expect something sexy to happen. She had done this so effectively that apparently she could get me horny by just putting her hair up -- no foreplay or anything up to that. I was floored. I immediately remember her doing this to me in public all of the time, and I would never have made the connection if she hadn't fessed up.

You're welcome :)  I could use some more brand recommendations.

-**TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS**-

**High Speed Internet**: if you live within a FiOS or Cable footprint, get it.  If your only option is dial-up or DSL... I'm sorry

**PC Hard drive - Solid State Drive (SSD)**: It's quiet and with it your PC could boot in just 6 seconds.  Nothing too large is required, when you see a 128G on sale at newegg.com pick it up.  You only really need to put the operating system on it and all your other data can go on a normal hard drive.

**Mechanical Keyboard**: (brands)

**Dual Monitors**: I can speak to this one, I can't function well without looking at two screens.  Have an extra lying around? Use it.  Or buy an extra one you won't regret it.

**Headphones**: Audio TEchnica ATH-M50, these seem to have some great reviews for under $200 bucks.

**Pens**: Pilot G2 Pro, Platinum Preppy Fountain Pen (gouletpens.com)

**Backpacks**: SwissGear (I've had mine for years, use daily still looks new)

**Tools**: Craftsmen, Snap-On

**Real Maple Syrup**: Kirkland Maple syrup

**Parmesan Cheese**: Buy it in a block and grate it yourself.  Avoid the stuff in a can.

**Cheese**: Don't buy anymore Kraft American singles.  Visit your deli and ask for some Muenster or Havarti.

**Sausages**: aManescape says you have to buy Sausages with weird shit in em!

So here's the story. This guy set up a facebook event for this party at this big hall and over 120 people RSVP'd. 700+ invited. So it's not like no one knew about it. Considering the amount of people that would know about it and come, even if they hadn't clicked attending, was that high this guy booked a massive hall that could cater for such a large event. This cost him around $1500 which included food, security etc. Then he decided instead of using an iPod, which would probably get lost/stolen on the night, he'd hire a DJ. That cost $400. All of this the host had spent months working his ass off so he was able to actually afford it and hold the 'best party ever!'

Come the night of the party, weeks of preperation money and organisation, this party is expected to go off! My sister heads off to this massive venue, 'fashionably late' aswell, and no one else is there. Much to their surprise, It's just an empty hall with lights going on and a DJ doing his thing. Then she finds the host and asks the normal questions; 'where is everyone' etc. He is as baffled as my sister was. Not even his best mates had shown up which was even more surprising. 

Now this is just the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing. The host then calls his friends. He asks them 'where the hell are you guys?!' and, obviously on loudspeaker an uproar of laughter comes from the person speaking and you can also hear it in the background. 

He starts crying and everything, absolutely devastated about what has happened. Not only is he out of pocket at $1900 least and knowing that all your friends possibly organised a boycott for this event . When I was told this story i couldn't stomach how harsh and horrible people can be. I never even though this happened, especially on such a large scale as this. 


**TL;DR** *Host works for months to be able to afford expenses for a party which was expected to have over 120 people in attendance.

EDIT: To clarify, I couldn't care less what the general opinion of Chris Brown is.

Do they get to decide now?

**EDIT 8:** Working with Zymic to get the site back up

Last week I setup a survey on a ""free"" survey account.  It was ""free"" until I tried to retrieve the results.  So I promised to make a new one. Here it is.

I've been on reddit for a while, and I really enjoy the community. I always wondered who the people of reddit are. So I make a [quick survey](http://redditsurvey.zxq.net/index.php) to find out.

This is not a scam. Every single question is optional, you don't have to answer a single question if you don't want to. It's 100% anonymous, I don't ask you a single question about your name or account.

You can look through my [reddit profile](http://www.reddit.com/user/JavaLSU/) and see that I've been here for a while, and am not just a bot trying to steal data.

If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. If you think of any new questions I can add them easily.

Now, here's the best part....INSTANT RESULTS!!!!  I've created a [real-time results page.](http://redditsurvey.zxq.net/results.php).  That's updated every time someone takes the survey!

**EDIT:** Please upvote if you take the survey, so that others can see it. Thanks!

Funny thing is that only five of the six people who actually cheated responded. One kid never came to class again, and ended up getting severely punished by the university.

He was carrying a suit case, the big ones like we take on international vacations and it seemed as if he had been walking for a some time. Judging from his appearance I figured he was prob 20-21 years old. He asked us if he could get a ride to ""Grayhun"". We both looked at each other and understood that he was saying Greyhound, and the only Greyhound bus stop in town was at this gas station a few miles down the road. It was cold and windy out and we had some spare time so we told him to jump in. 

Initially thoughts run through your head and you wonder... I wonder whats in that suitcase...is he going to put a knife to my neck from behind the seat... kilos of coke from Mexico because this is South Texas?... a chopped up body?...but as we began to drive I saw the sigh of relief through the rear view mirror and realized this kid is just happy for a ride. When we got to the gas station, my friend walked in and double checked everything to make sure it was the right spot but to our surprise the final bus for Houston left for the day. The next bus at 6:00 p.m. was in a town 25 miles over. We tried explaining this to him, I should have payed more attention in the Spanish I and II they forced us to take in High School. The only words I can really say are si and comprende. My friend and I said fuck it lets drop him off, and turned to him and said "" listen we are going to eat first *making hand gestures showing spoons entering mouth* and we will drop you off after"" but homeboy was still clueless and kept nodding. 

We already ordered Chinese food and began driving in that direction and when we got there, he got out of the car and went to the trunk as if the Chinese Restaurant was the bus stop. We tell him to come in and eat something first, leave the suitcase in the car. He is still clueless. When we go in, our food was already ready. We decided to eat there so he could eat as well. When the hostess came over, she looked spanish so I asked her I was like hey listen we picked this guy up from the street, he missed his bus and the next one is 25 miles over can you tell him that after we are done eating we will drop him off its ok no problems... and she was kinda taken by it and laughed, translated it to the guy, and for the next 10 mins all he kept saying was thank you. After we jumped into the car, I turned to him in the back and was like listen its 25 miles, I'm rolling a spliff, do you smoke? He still had no clue, but when we sparked it up, and passed it his way he smoked it like a champ. He had very broken English, but said he was from Ecuador and he was in America looking for a job to make money for his family back home. Like I said he was prob 20-21 years old. Shorly after, we arrived at our destination, and said farewell. Dropped him off at some store where he would have to sit on a bench outside for the next hour.. but I did my best. I hope he made it to wherever he had to go.

Back when I was about 13 or 14 my cousin and I were walking out of a restaurant in central Washington. It was late in the evening and already dark. There was a very large river nearby us and I saw a light in the sky that appeared to follow low above the it. Now there was a small airport across the river so I gave it not another thought to being anything other than a plane. But instead of turning left to the airport it suddenly increased in speed and appeared to shoot upwards and quickly across the town. Then it flew off to the right towards a smaller town about 10 miles away. It then stopped and hovered above it for just a few seconds before a smaller light came up from the ground, appeared to hit the first light, and then both zoomed away in the distance. 

I turned to my cousin and he just looked at me and asked ""did you see that too?""

Does anyone out there have the skill to decipher the guy's license number from the imprint it made on my bumper?",8631,6208,1653,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r0e88/last_night_i_was_rammed_while_stopped_at_a_red/,"[Here is an album](http://imgur.com/a/HzYJT#0) of some pictures taken the night it happened and pictures taken this morning in the daylight. The officers tried figuring it out, but none of their guesses brought back any drivers. I live in Virginia, but this happened in a small city that has a university with ~13,000 resident students, so the license could be from any state (or even Canada, I suppose).

I have liability insurance on this vehicle. Geico told me that if they can't cover me that I can at least get coverage through the Virginia Uninsured Motorist fund (or something to that effect). My concern is that my back is very screwed up from this (it was a massive jolt). I've had moderate trouble walking, sitting, and moving today because of the pain. My car also started cutting off while driving to where I suddenly lose power steering, breaking, acceleration, etc while driving. Shifting into neutral and starting the engine fixes it for a while, but I only did that enough to get home. 

**TL;DR**: Got rear-ended while stopped at a red light and the guy drove off. My car is broken and my back is pretzeled and my only hope to find this hit-and-run class act is to decipher the license plate smudge he left on my bumper. Please help!

**EDIT 1**: Remember that the imprint is backwards from what the license actually says.

**EDIT 2**: The Virginia DMV [has an app](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/dmvnet/plate_purchase/select_plate.asp?PLT=&amp;PLTNO=) for trying out different license plate messages, if it helps. It seems to tell you if a license number is available, too.

**Edit 3**: Thank you, to whomever gave me a month of Reddit Gold!

**Edit 4**: Oh, my goodness. I just crawled out of bed and saw that the comment count has risen from 53 to 975! Time to start reading! Thanks, everyone, for looking!

**Edit 5**: crustlessmist [figured out the plate number](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r0e88/last_night_i_was_rammed_while_stopped_at_a_red/c41xem0) and jwild98 made a [convincing graphic showing how that plate number matches up with the impression on my bumper](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r0e88/last_night_i_was_rammed_while_stopped_at_a_red/c41y1tb)! Following that amazing stuff, the following unexciting update: I attempted to leave a voicemail for the officer on my case, but the voicemail system was not letting me in for some reason, so I called non-emergency and talked to an officer there who offered to give the officer a message for me. I'm going to try later today to call again. With this being a smaller city and it being the weekend, I'm thinking I might not have luck until Monday, but I'll keep trying.

**Edit 6**: No updates from anyone yet. I figured I'd go ahead and put the part number from the pieces I found on the ground here. 

One of them says: 

* 52127-06050    ITW    \^UP
* TSOP-1G    &gt;PP+E/P-T15&lt;    R
* TOYOTA

and the other one says

* \^UP    52128-06050
* TSOP-1G   &gt;PP+E/P-T15&lt;
* TOYOTA

The ""ITW"" on the top one looks funny... like it was scratched in by hand. ~~I'm trying to get a picture up, but imgur is having problems.~~ [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/F9kS4.jpg)... had trouble focusing with the cellphone.

**Edit 7**: Update: The officer on the case called me and I gave him the information that I've gotten here. He told me that he is actually off this weekend, so he's going to run the tag information on Monday and see if he finds anything. So, I guess I'll have to wait until Monday to learn anything new. I did give the same information to my insurance company, so maybe they'll get back sooner? I don't know.

**Edit 8**: Update: The officer on the case works nights, I believe (I was hit at night), so I don't think he's going to run the plate number until tonight sometime. My insurance company wanted to wait until today to see what the police came up with (although I've let them know about all of the work you guys did, too). I haven't heard anything today. The officer said he would try the plate number and see if anything came back. Obviously, we all know something's going to come back because the report someone ran came back with a VIN number, and I've had some anonymous reports PM'ed to me that point that license back to a town that is only 8 miles away from here, so I'm confident that 5MRTNS is the guy. Now I just need to keep the officers and insurance agents on it. I'll report back once something more significant happens.

**Edit 9**: Didn't hear back from anyone Tuesday. Wanted to give the officer a chance to call me (I believe he works nights) and wanted Geico to get a chance to do their own thing and call me back. I called Geico and the office on my case today around 11am. Left a message with the officer telling him that I'm following up on the lookup he said he was doing, because there's a felon out there and I've been going to the doctor and my car doesn't work, so I'd like to get insurance rolling. I'm going to call again later this afternoon. I think I need to be annoying.

**Edit 10**: I've been calling. Haven't gotten a call back from the police yet, and I can't get the officer on the phone to speak with (only voicemail). Geico let me know that they got the guy's address from the plate number and sent him a letter telling him to contact them. I told them, ""He's the offender in a hit and run. What makes you think he'll call you?"" My case worker is currently trying to get permission to run a report cross referencing their entire database to see if the guy has been involved in other claims and who his insurance provider is. I feel like they're probably doing what they can.

I just left another voicemail for the officer and told him that Geico was able to get the guy's address from their database, so I would assume that he should have been able to as well and to please contact me to let me know what's going on (and gave him 3 different phone numbers he could reach me at). I'm going to keep calling and am considering the current advice of getting the local news involved.

**Edit 11**: I left a voicemail a few days ago with the Investigations Office informing them that I was not getting any calls back from the officer on my case and could someone please let me know what's going on. That night, a Sergeant called me at home and told me he would be leaving messages with the officer and the officer's training officer, letting them know that I need to be contacted. This morning, I finally got a call from the officer, letting me know that they found an address for the plate, but haven't been able to contact the person yet. He said he's hoping to be able to charge the person by this afternoon and that he'll let me know either this evening or tomorrow.

Possibly humorous sidenote: He started his message to me (I was at work and he called my house, yay online voicemail) with: ""I just wanted to shoot you a message..."" the first part of which caught me off guard. :-P

**Edit 12**: The officer called my house again a few minutes ago. He said he served papers to the guy and (according to my wife) said that ""the individual"" seemed like he was just going to plead guilty and get it handled (of course, speaking to a lawyer may change his mind). The officer said that I probably wouldn't be needed in court unless the guy went for a trial, in which case I'd be subpoenaed, but for now my insurance company should have enough to be able to pursue the guy's insurance.

*An anonymous billionaire is privately funding this.  You will never meet them.  They are not filming or recording any aspect of this; they simply enjoy knowing they have this kind of power.*

Each day you are woken up by a man peeing on you.  This man has been hired by the billionaire to pee on you.  They are regularly checked by doctors to make sure they are healthy and infection-free.  Regardless, urine is sterile.  Stinky, but harmless.  

As soon as the pee hits your face (and oh yes, he'll aim for the face) you can jump out of bed and go to the shower.  While you are showering the man who pees on you will switch your mattress, put on new sheets and leave $300 in cash on your dining room table.  

The above situation will happen every single day for the rest of your life until one evening you decide you do not want to be peed on the next morning and cancel.  Then it can never start again.  Ever. 

A few conditions:

-You may have as much or as little interaction with the man who pees as you want

-The man who pees will act as an alarm clock/wake-up call.  You can tell him to begin peeing at 6:30am and that's exactly when he will start.
  
-If you share the bed with someone he will be aiming for you.  Spashback onto the sleeping partner is a possibility.

-If you go on vacation he travels as well.  He will typically stay in the hotel room next to yours.


**The question is:  How long would you let this go on?**


edit:  Apparently R.Kelly likes to pee on people 

edit:  Obligatory ""Holy crap! Frontpage?!"" 

edit:  Now the follow-up question ...  **For $300 a day, would you rather be the man who pees?**  
Same restrictions would apply (but obviously in reverse).  This means that whoever you pee on you are bound to.  If they travel, you travel.  You will have to live in their city (or at least a sensible commute).  You will have to wake up early for your alarm clock function  It will be you to picks up the new mattress the day before and disposes of the soiled one.  Roughly an hour or work a day for $300.  Is this preferable to being peed on given the mobility restrictions?  

edit:  To address a common question:  Barring a once-in-a-lifetime emergency(""My water broke!""), you must be peed on in the morning.  This means if you wake up a few moments before your alarm was to go off you must lay there until the first drop of piss hits you.  You can have a conversation with the man who pees if you like.  Or simply maintain the world's most awkward eye-contact.

Thanks for sharing your stories, and for the kind words as well. I'm not even exaggerating when I say this makes up for my shitty evening with Mr. Revolutionary Lifestyle. So now I just popped open a beer for all of you wonderful people and going through the comments.. I feel almost lucky! Fucking hell, some people are awful!! Hope you've all had better luck since then.. As for myself, I just chalked it up as a lesson.. part of my 'screening' for dating now would include asking the guy if he's into health supplements haha! Really, thanks to all of you.. last night roughly at this time I was moping around after getting home from that 'date'. Now I have countless hilarious stories to read through while drinking and kind messages from you awesome bunch.. worth it!


Story-time (warning: wall of text)

So I've known this guy for almost a year now, not really good friends or anything, more of casual acquaintances (we have a bunch of common friends and see each other from time to time, parties etc). A couple of months ago he started messaging me, first on Facebook, then by text (he got my number from a friend, he didn't ask me for it) and most of the time I responded just to be polite. He's nice enough, but not really my type.. so when he started dropping hints about 'meeting up', I just turned him down and said I'm busy, or we'd just catch up the next time there's a gathering with our friends, that sort of thing..

Fast-forward to last week and he asked me out again, which IIRC is the 6th time in the past 2 months. I finally decided to at least give him a chance, cos hey what could go wrong anyway, and who knows what I'm missing and all that jazz.. Worst-case scenario it would be awkward, but we've talked more than a few times so I was thinking it can't be that bad and we could actually have a pleasant time.

Date night comes and we meet up in the city after work. We have dinner; nice, cutesy Japanese place.. conversation was okay.. I was certain at this point that it's really not going to take off, he really isn't my type.. but I was having a pleasant enough time and he was a total gentleman and not bad to talk to.

The bill comes, and I was going to suggest a quick coffee before heading home. However, he said that there's something he'd made an appointment for us for and we need to rush off to make it in time. I was a bit intrigued and excited; was it a movie, or a show, a play (he knows I'm into theater)? So we hurry off and he took me to a high-end luxury mall with an attached wing for offices.. we went up.. wait, this is an office lobby.. what the..

It was a fucking weight-loss center.

So he explains that he's part of this company (he works for them on a part-time basis as a distributor) and he wanted to introduce me to their products which would 'revolutionize' my lifestyle and make the healthier I've ever been in my entire life. (FYI I'm 5'5"" and 135lbs). I was totally stunned at this point so I was just nodding like an idiot the whole time we were walking inside. He then left me with his smarmy 'teammates', who proceeded to give me an orientation about their company and a run-through of their health supplements (when he got to the part where the weight-loss products are, the smarmiest one said, ""Oooh now this is what you've been waiting for, I saved the best for last!"")

I just sat through it because I knew that if I started to say something, I was definitely going to burst and make a spectacle of myself (there was a seminar ongoing and we were at a little table to the side). After I flat-out said that I'm not interested in any of the products and frankly don't believe that I need health supplements (I eat well and exercise regularly), they started on the 2nd phase: introducing me to the 'business' aspect of it. Basically, it was a networking model of business where you not only sell the products, you also recruit people to sell them and they would be under your 'team', and you get a commission for every sale they make. They rhapsodized about the wonders of the product, how easy it is to sell, and how much money I could be making because they could tell I have the right kind of 'personality' and 'network' for it. Registration was 'only' $1,000, and it was consumable in products.. which I could either use or sell to get my registration money back immediately.

I wish I could say I flipped the fucking table and screamed at them to fuck themselves with their health supplements and hope they overdose on their products, but no.. right after the 'talk' I just said I should head home since it was getting a bit late.

The guy actually messaged me to say that he had a good time and he hopes to see me again.. and that I would reconsider their products and the 'business opportunity'. 

I called some friends up and went out for drinks because fuck your health supplements that's why

TL;DR Went on a date, guy brought me to weight-loss seminar, tried to sell me $1,000 worth of weight-loss products, and then tried to recruit me to join their networking business.

There some dialogue about how universal policy didn't matter as much to humans because of their significantly shorter lifespans compared to other races (I am probably misquoting, but I believe that was the general sentiment).  This got me thinking about the following questions:

* If the average human lifespan was significantly longer (e.g. 200+ years), would our morals, philosophies, choices be different?

* What kind of effects would it have on our governments, economies, or religions?

I guess two different ways one can approach these questions:

* If humankind had evolved to such a long lifespan thousands to millions of years ago.
* If in the next decade, significant technology allowed for humans to live much longer.

Thoughts?  Comments?

Edit 1:  A good point was made on how the body should age along with the increased lifespan.  For the sake of the post, let's assume it's relative.  So for example, the amount you would age in one year currently would take three years instead.  Of course this is just one viewpoint.

1262216375.0,2337,self.AskReddit,ak2b8,Update: My sister is now out of the hospital and the best Christmas gift of all? She doesn't hate me. Reddit was right once again.,3423,1086,525,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ak2b8/update_my_sister_is_now_out_of_the_hospital_and/,"I posted [this here originally](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9prfk/so_i_stumbled_across_some_nsfw_pictures_of_my_kid/) and then [this update](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9sw9t/so_my_kid_sister_was_put_in_a_mental_hospital_by/) back in October.

Summary: I innocently stumbled across naked pictures of my little sister on the Internet. From advice I received here on Reddit I confronted her about them. I found out after spying on her that the issue was much larger than it first seemed. She ended being put into a mental hospital because of me and I hated myself for that.

Okay, so my little sister (""Julie"") was in the hospital for almost two months. During that time she refused to see me. My mom, my dad, even two uncles and one aunt? She saw them at visits. But she refused to see me.

I was convinced the entire time that the reason she didn't want to see me was that she hated me. I must have re-read my second post about this a hundred times, just to re-enforce my belief that I had done the right thing by telling our dad about the situation. Believe me, the comments in that second post really did sustain me. I've never loved Reddit so much as I have during some of the worst sleepless nights I've gone through, nights where I felt like the shittiest brother ever. Reading your assurances that I had done the right thing really helped me get along through this very difficult time.

We were told two weeks ago that she was scheduled to be released on the 21st of December. This had nothing to do with money or insurance (my parents were paying out of pocket for her stay there but cost was never an issue). Apparently she has adjusted well to her new medications and is in much better, more sober state of mind now. 

I was thrilled to learn she'd be home for Christmas. I dreaded seeing her only because I have not seen her since the ""intervention"" that led to her being hospitalized in the first place. I was so worried she hated me that I even told my mom, upon hearing the news of her release, that I would gladly crash at my friend's house for a while.

My mom's response? ""Are you crazy? She wants you to be the one to pick her up!""

...

Sorry, I still get teary-eyed when I remember that.

So it turns out that the reason my sister didn't want to see me that entire time (two months!) was that she was embarrassed. She didn't mind seeing our parents or our uncles and aunt but she just couldn't handle seeing me. She felt like she'd let me down or something.

I drove nearly 2.5 hours out to the hospital last Monday (only the second time I'd ever been there), alone, and greeted her in the reception area. She literally ran over and jumped into my arms when she saw me. I cried like a baby, Reddit, and I'm not embarrassed to admit as much.

We talked a ton during the drive home. She has a much firmer grasp on her condition, now, then she did before. Best of all, and Reddit was right about this, she does **not** hate me for ""turning her in"".

She's healthy. She's safe. She's on medications to deal with her Bipolar disorder. And she actually thanked me for intervening before she did something stupid, like meeting up with that one guy (aka ""Asshole"").

I worried so much, for so long, for nothing. My little sister still loves me. And I did do the right thing. Thank you, Reddit, for all of your thoughts and comments during this time. I've been feeling miserable for so long, because of all this, but your thoughtful comments and suggestions helped me from going into despair.

This is why I love this site. Thank you again.

**/edit** A few things. First, to all of you well-wishers, thank you so much for the kind words and good wishes. They mean so much to me you have no idea.

Second, to the anti-meds crowd? Get a job. Sure, meds are sometimes over-prescribed. I won't argue that. But my sister didn't have an ""episode"" or a ""temper tantrum"" that was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Type I Disorder. While I'm sure that happens sometimes, you are in absolutely no position to gauge what my sister was going through. You don't know her, but I do, and trust me the girl who was posting those long, crazy messages on those image boards? The girl who confronted me and threatened me with all kinds of crazy nonsense the day after I talked to her? The girl, in short, who was off her medications? That was **not** my sister. That was my sister in a manic episode. If you have to ask the what the difference is between a manic episode and typical teenage angst/temper, you've never seen one. I hope you never have to, too, because they are scary. Scary scary. 

Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a tirade about that. It's just... frustrating to read some of the holier-than-thou, ""you do realize Bipolar is the ADD of the 2000's, right?"" type of messages this post has garnered. So fucking annoying. Go give L. Ron Hubbard some money but STFU on this post, please.

Again I'm sorry. The vast majority of the responses here have been so supportive and uplifting, but the few trolls who managed to get a bunch of upmods for being contrarian did sort of piss me off.

Done being angry, Reddit. 

Oh, as for her long term care? She's going to be in IOP (Intensive Out Patient) for the foreseeable future. That means, starting in January, daily visits to a local clinic where she'll receive both group and individual therapy. She's also going to see the psychiatrist she took a huge liking to at the hospital once a month until she finds a new doctor to replace her. She's fine with all this, and is actually excited about it. She has this journal she keeps showing me that she writes in when she starts to feel ""unbalanced"". She says it's like her own private ""group therapy"" but she can't wait to be in the real thing again.

Our dad took away her computer but he set it up in the living room, right next to the television set, and she's free to use it whenever she wants. She has absolutely no privacy on it but she seems to be okay with that. 

I think the biggest test will be when she goes back to school. She lost an entire semester because of her hospitalization and she'll be needing to go to summer school to make up for it and while she says she's fine with that, I know it sort of bums her out. Plus, school is usually a ""trigger"" (so I've noticed) for her bad depressive and manic periods. But I really believe she's ready this time. I've never seen her so strong and resolved to handle her condition as she appears right now.

Well, that's it. This is most likely the last ever thing I type using this account. As I mentioned in my original post, I have a real Reddit account that I often use and I simply created this one for this particular issue. I am very glad that I did, too. 

Reddit came through for me in a big way. I hope that others out there who are in any kind of strange/heart-breaking/etc. type of situation look to this experience and find inspiration to share their own story, whatever it is. The trolls and the assholes try to grind us down but Reddit is good at fighting back. I so fucking love this place. I love you all... yes, even the trolls and the assholes.

Adieu, adieu from blind-with-worry.

**edit the last** Okay forgot to mention... as to the Asshole:

Believe me, like most of you, I want to go after this prick. I really do. I actually had a huge argument with my father about this about a month ago. When I calmed down, though, I realized that the legal advice he was getting was correct: fanning flames risks spreading fire. What my sister needs now, what our family needs now, is time to heal. Would it feel good to crush that motherfucker? Sure. Would it draw everything out, though? Definitely. That would not be a good thing. Sometimes what feels good is actually bad or at the very least can make a situation worse than it already is. 

Let me put it like this. Say I posted his Gmail username here. And Reddit went to town crushing him in all sorts of ways. So he decides, ""Heck, that bitch ratted on me. I'll show her!"" and he ends up reposting the obviously self-shot images to every site and image-board, maybe even here on Reddit. Not only would that humiliate her but it might have legal ramifications for her.

What's done is done. Trust me, I know it's a bitter pill to swallow. I'd like nothing better than to meet this asshole someday and do things to him that would get me 20-life in a state prison. But when you think on it logically, what good does that do for my sister? For myself? For my family?

As tempting as it is to send his wife an anonymous letter, too, there's just one problem... I don't have his address. 

In short, I'm just going to have to leave my revenge fantasies to my imagination and Tarantino movies. This asshole/douchebag will likely slit his own throat one of these days anyway. In the meantime, no fanning the flames. Doing so spreads fires.

",18111,15789,2868,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/,"The barista at my local Starbucks didn't tell me until I handed him my card to pay for the car behind me that 8 of us had done the exact same thing. He and the other workers could not stop smiling! All of them seemed really excited about what they just witnessed, and honestly--I was really stunned that 8 of us had ~~independently~~ decided to pay for the car behind us.  

After the madness that was Black Friday, and the horrible behavior that usually accompanies it, I just couldn't help but be amazed at what I had inadvertently been a part of. I've paid for people's meals/groceries/coffee before (especially around the holidays), but I've never been on the receiving end of a ""pay it forward"" chain or somebody that helped keep one going! **I know the 8 of us didn't solve any major world crisis this morning or *really* help anyone out, and the woman behind me may not have actually liked having her drinks purchased by me**--but the semi-anonymous gesture of buying your neighbor's coffee on a cold Sunday morning just...moved me. I just couldn't stop smiling. It was as if kindness was contagious this morning! :D And just thinking about a possible ""pandemic"" of kindness leaves me breathless. 

I'm sure this isn't even the most impressive ""pay it forward"" scenario that people have encountered, so I want to hear your tales! Maybe some of us have all been a part of the same chain of kindness. :) 

**Edit:** So far it looks like drive-thru cafes and tollbooths are common places for this type of masked-goodwill! haha Though I'm really impressed with how u/Drunkdillweed may have started a pay-it-foward chain at a [Little Caesars](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76v4uf).  

**Edit 2:** Alright, coffee is definitely the current leader in the ""thing to anonymously pay for"" category haha. I have included a semi-visual explanation of how this can happen in a drive-thru in a later edit bellow!

**Edit 3.5:** (I've added some **NEW** stories at the end of the list!) While I'm in love with all the coffee stories, here are some hidden gems in case you miss them! [Love flows as much as the liquor in this bar tab story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13stgf/the_car_ahead_of_me_paid_for_my_coffee_this/c76wrz3?context=3); Paying-it-Foward can happen in courthouses too!

*Most common drive-thru locations for kindness-chains*: Starbucks, Tim Hortons, McDonalds, and Taco Bell. 

**Edit 4:** I just wanted to do a better explanation for how this entire thing occurred, for those of you who've never seen a drive thru cafe. So, in a typical American drive thru you will pull into a driveway that wraps around your favorite cafe/restaurant. Shortly after pulling into the driveway you will roll up to a [giant menu with a microphone](http://blogs.kudl.com/files/2010/03/starbucks-drive-thru.jpg) and this is where we place our orders. Then you pull up to [the window to pay and pick up your beverage/treats](http://pulse995.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/drive-thru.jpg). Once you or any other car pulls away from the giant menu, the barista/window worker has the orders totaled up. So, if you notice [a long line of cars behind you](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JI3v7GDgSTU/TUwNVt1ghDI/AAAAAAAABKU/CopWCapfZZs/s1600/Starbucks_Drive_Thru_012408_fs.jpg) and you'd like to do something nice for the person behind you, you can tell the worker that you'd like to buy the other driver's order too. No guess work is needed about the amount since it's already been totaled. Hope that clears some stuff up!


**Edit 5:** While I'm still planning on updating the above list to help folks navigate around this incredible thread, this will likely be my last ramble. First, thank you for sharing your wonderful stories! I enjoyed reading all of them. :) Second, thank you to the anonymous gifters for the reddit gold!

Now, I know several of you are still critical of this kind of behavior (and I definitely apologize if you've ever been a recipient of one of my errant coffeecup gifts!) and just don't get ""the point"" of all this. I think the biggest concern is that this type of act conflates helping *people in need* with giving a superfluous gift to someone who doesn't need it. I never wanted there to be a weighing of the two types of acts, especially since one is obviously more significant than the other, but I don't believe the latter is totally inconsequential... I mean, one can never be 100% sure that the person standing next to you isn't suffering somehow. That they aren't trying to cope with a terrible loss or struggling through a horrible bought of depression. But still, a coffee cup doesn't do any substantial good for those folks either, but it may just brighten their day a bit, which I think does everyone a bit of good. At the worst, it was a free annoyance. 

What ultimately makes this experience (and others like it) so beautiful for me, and why I think so many others love the concept, is that no one was harmed, nothing was solicited, and the only thing that connected a bunch of strangers for a brief moment in time, was a piece of shared kindness in the form of a cup of coffee. :) These moments are also poignant reminders of just how important it is to give to those who are struggling! If a pre-paid cup of coffee, toll charge, carwash, bar tab, or meal can make such an impact on so many of us, I can't imagine how life changing having someone providing for your actual needs can be. 

Thank you again for these wonderful stories, and I'll still try to add new/hidden ones to my list above. Take care Reddit!

1337381174.0,2314,self.AskReddit,ttya2,"reddit, I've answered a lot your questions about being deaf, and I'd like you to return the favor. I have some questions about hearing. (Also, you can AMA about deafness)",9940,7626,2695,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ttya2/reddit_ive_answered_a_lot_your_questions_about/,"I've been deaf since birth and there are lot of ""sound words"" that I read a lot but don't really know what they mean, and dictionary definitions often just refer to other sound words. It's never mattered to me before, but now I'm trying to write a novel with one hearing narrator and every time I use a sound word I'm not sure I'm using it right. I posted awhile ago to /r/writing about ""scream"", ""shout"" and ""yell"" but I've generated a list of questions so I thought I should take it to a larger audience.

* People crying in sadness vs crying out in anger, I know there's some gray area in between where they can be used interchangeably, it's hard to get
* ""shriek"" and ""ream"" are both words that seem to imply emotion more than any specific sound. Is that right?
* Can any sound be described as ""piercing"" if it's loud and annoying? Like thunder for example.
* apparently people use ""ejaculates"" as a dialogue tag?!?! It seems to mean ""to say suddenly or without warning"" (or does it just mean ""interrupt""?), but the more normal use of ""ejaculates"" doesn't imply that at all. I don't know if this is a deaf thing or maybe I'm just dense. Does sound have something to do with this?
* What does ""jive"" mean? Does ""he speaks jive"" and ""he speaks AAVE"" and ""he speaks Ebonics"" all refer to the same thing? I was raised by black parents but I can't understand any dialogue written in black dialect. I know not all black people talk like that but is there a way to mark that in a novel? Do you know of a webpage that would tell me how to translate dialogue into dialect like that? 
* Are ""stammer"" and ""stutter"" synonymous?
* What about ""chat""? Dictionary says ""to speak informally"" but I feel like it implies something I'm not getting. Is it speaking fast? Can you use ""chat"" as a dialogue tag? (like ""What are you doing tonight?' he chatted""), I don't think I've seen it but the dictionary makes it sound like you can.
* ""mumbling"" sometimes implies apathy but other times hostility. Is that right? That's weird because it connotes opposites. What does it sound like? Is it synonymous with whispering?
* I know cats ""meow"", dogs ""bark"" and cows ""moo"" but what does these words mean when used in other contexts? Sometimes other animals are described with the same sounds, like I think foxes bark which makes sense because they're like dogs but I think I've heard dolphins described as barking too. That's weird. Does a dolphin and a dog really make the same sound?
* ""howl"" is just for animals except ""howling in pain"" right? Is a dog's howl just a long bark or does it sound different? Do different dogs sound different? What if they're the same size and breed?
""Chirp"" and ""squawk"" were originally animal noises but are now used in other contexts right? I don't know what they mean really. Birds and mice do them both interchangeably, that's as specific as I know. And I think bats chirp but never squawk? Is there a chart somewhere showing which animals make which sounds? Like, can a weasel growl? What about bears? Bears look like the kind of animal that should ""growl"" but I feel like I've never seen that written and Google doesn't show a lot of usage.
* Do all doors creak? Can all doors be slammed? Windows? Does ""slam"" always imply loudness? Do you always slam doors when you're mad? Do deaf people slam doors when they're mad? (I don't think so, but if it's just a function of being mad I might do it and not notice because I'm mad). People say ""he slammed that beer"" to mean chugged, that's silent right? Or does it mean ""gurgle"" in that sense?
* ""Gurgle"" is another hard one. And ""gargle"", that means something different right?
* ""Ring"", like ""ringtone"" is hard to get. What else ""rings""? Cell phones sound different from landlines, right? People sometimes describe them as ""chirping""?
* Dictionary says ""click"" is ""A short, sharp sound as of a switch being operated or of two hard objects coming quickly into contact."" but I feel like I've seen it in other uses, it's hard to remember exactly what I'm thinking of. But could I use it to describe cymbals, pennies or pencils hitting each other?
* If a voice is described as ""tender"", what does that mean?
* ""moan"" can be painful or sexy right? Anything else? Is it possible to moan joyously or humorously?
* ""cooing"" What is that? Is there a difference between a woman ""moaning sexy"" and ""cooing sexy""?
* Apparently it's possible to ""whisper"" loudly and ""shout"" softly? WTF!?

**EDIT:** Holy crap I was not expecting this big of a response. These stories are awesome and disheartening all at the same time.


**EDIT 2:** Thank you to who ever gave me the 3 months reddit gold. Was not expecting that :D

**EDIT 3:** I promised to post some stories from working at McDonalds, so here it goes.

I was working the afternoon shift and this lady comes to register asking for some grilled snack wraps and some other things. I ring her up, get her food to her, and she's on her way. 5 minutes later she comes back storming in claiming I gave her a crispy snack wrap not grilled. So I said to her ""Oh I'm sorry let me get you a new one."" I check the wrap, and it's grilled! She's getting pissed over nothing. I explain to her how I did give her the right one. She insists I didn't so I explain to her how crispy is breaded and the chicken I gave her was not breaded. She get's really loud and start's screaming ""I have my fucking kids waiting in the car, THEY ARE ONLY 3, I don't have time for this bullshit!"" And that's when she throws the snack wrap at me! My manager tells her to get the fuck out as I'm standing there crying covered in snack wrap.

This other story is actually a story about my manager. During the interview at McDonalds, I told them that I would need 2 weeks off in 2 months because I was going to Germany. They said that was okay. So when I was hired, I put the request off in the folder. I also reminded them 2 weeks before I was leaving. So I get back from Germany, and my first day home I get a phone call and it's my manager bitching how she's been trying to contact me for a week because I haven't been showing up. I told her I was away for 2 weeks and that I told her when she first hired me. She started cursing saying how I never told her and how I needed to get my ass to work or I'm fired. I told her ""Go check the fucking request off folder, my paper is in there. Go fuck yourself I'm never coming back."" and I hung up. In retrospect, I could have handled the situation better, but I was jet lagged and cranky from an 8 hour flight.

We have called the local environmental agencies, but they will only be here tomorrow.

The poor little thing does not seem to be doing well.

Is there anything we can do until tomorrow?

The kids just named him Gunter  :-)

I am in the extreme south of the state of Bahia in Brazil. It is very rare to find penguins this up north, but this week alone, 3 washed up on the beaches. This is the first one that is alive. 

We are in a very small town, far away from any major cities, so there are no zoos or vets who can help around here. The people we called were not much help (it was the end of the day and the specialists were not in) but we were told that they will come by tomorrow. 

I would just like to know if any biologist here knew if there is anything we can do to help keep him comfortable (and alive) until tomorrow. Anything we can give it to eat? Where would he be most comfortable - in a cool place or not? He is not getting up, but he is moving a lot more now.

[Video of Gunter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snTO2dKcgmU) when we found him

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 2 - Gunter made it through the night!!! He is resting in his towels, and was following me around curiously with his little head when I walked in to check on him. He is sooooooo cute!! We checked him for dehydration and to see if his temperature was ok (as per instruction of a biologist specialized in penguins) and he seemed just fine). He drank and also ate a little. I called the people who will come and pick him up, and the good news is that instead of keeping him the small center until they had more animals for the trip, they will try to drive him off today to the really big center 4 hours north!!  I will take more pics before Gunter goes, and ask the people in the center to keep me updated. Thank you all for the help!!! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 3 - Gunter does not seem to be doing well at all!! :-(   :-(  He is not responding to when we walk in, and when we touch him, he does not move his head much. He is sleeping and his eyes are closed, but he is breathing heavily. I think he is dying... :-(   :-(   ARGH!! And they called saying they won't be here until the afternoon. It will be too late!! I did not want him to die here  :-( 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 4- Well, maybe he was just sleeping really deeply? Because he woke up and ate TWO live little fish!! He was not interested with the dead stuff yesterday, but he gobbled up the live fish! He also had water!  I am afraid to hope, but how can I help it? Fight Gunter!!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 5- They called again, and should be here soon.

Ok so, she walks out..  and like the guy that I am, I finish saying goodbye to the colonel of love, and continue browsing the web like it's no big deal... right ?

I start hearing SOBBING outside the door, I go outside and she goes OFF on me. She goes APE SHIT, ""how could you do that, that's disgusting, thats not normal, you have a fucking gf, why do you do this to me, do you not love me, am I not attractive anymore, do you want me to be some porn slut""? 

She then left the apartment, and I have not heard from her yet ( it's been 7 hours ). **I love my gf dearly**, but i'm not sure what just happened.... Is it really that big of a deal ? Like, am I a douche for wanting some self diddling time ?  WTF DO I DO REDDIT, I'm afraid when she comes back I wont be able to say anything to say, should I apologize ? Say it'll never happen again ? 

**HELP ME REDDIT**

**EDIT** Please don't make this a front page post, my gf is a redditor too. I just wanted some quick answers.

**EDIT2** She called me, was sobbing a little. I told her we ""need to talk"" She said ""ya"" and said she'll be home in a couple of hours, shes with her mom ( IS SHE GOING TO TELL HER ? )

**EDIT 3** I just received a text from her ""my mom is coming over with me, clean up a little.."" I'm leaving going to a friends house, I do NOT want to deal with that if she told her. ( I smoked a little to calm down, and I don't think I'm ready for a parental confrontation )

**EDIT 4** I'm at my friends house now, and you guys made this front page... wow FU. Ok to clear some things up though between us, We have an AMAZING relationship, we NEVER argue, we have fun together just her and I. I love this girl to death, I hate seeing her unhappy. To clarify ""our sex life is amazing""; Whenever she's in the mood, I'm down. And yes there are times when I'm in the mood and she's not that I give her the space needed. This is normal though ? Guys do generally want it more then women ? It doesn't bother me, and we've been together for about a year and a half, and I have Waxed the Winnebago before but she has NEVER caught me. This is actually the first time I've ever been caught.

And Ashley, since I know you'll read this: ILY, I know you'll hate me for doing this, but please read some of these comments. I'm sorry that you felt it inappropriate and im sorry for not talking to you about it, ever. I think you're the most amazing girl in the world.. and again, i'm sorry.


**EDIT 5** She read this, the stupidest shit gets to the front knews, so now I have to go over there. Today /r/gonewild/ gets me in trouble, then reddit finishes me with a front page fatality.

**EDIT 6** Guys, the whole ""FU , reddit getting me in trouble, stuff is not serious. I just say stuff like that to lighten the topic, I'm saying it sarcastically. I love reddit, and agree with most of you.

*I understand she's overreacting, which is why I am going to talk to her, but you guys need to understand as well that it's someone I care about. Someone I care about felt hurt due to something I did. Sure it might have been an overreaction, nonetheless someone I care about felt hurt. Also, I'm not apologizing for making the cyclops fight a 5 headed monster, I'm apologizing to her for posting it here. ( Even though logically to you guys it's a story, you don't know us so it shouldn't really bother her because it's not like I'm going to my moms house....Pun intended.*

Also, this conversation just has never really been brought up personally between us. I never thought about bringing it up because I've seen it normal since i was 10 years old. And she just never brought it up either.
I am 25 years old, she is 23.

**EDIT 7** I have not read all of the comments posted, to many for me to keep track of, but I know It pisses me off when I read a story that is happening, and the author doesn't update it, so i'll do my best to update it and keep it private at the same time. So, I go home, unlock the door, try to open it. The little chain is on the door. Her mom comes towards the door and says hi with the stupidest, smuggiest look I have ever seen in my life. ( Her mom never liked me to begin with ) and says ""that's disgusting"" straight away, and walks away from the door, leaving the fucking chain in. I'm not the kind of guy to lose my temper, specially when it's regarding women, but me and her mom have never had good blood between us so the way she said it pushed me over the edge I guess.... Well anyways, she walks away and I kick the door and break the stupid little chain and I told her in a louder then average voice that it wasn't her fucking business, and I needed to talk to her daughter in private... ( to clear things up between us ), sooooooooo she gets her bag, calls Ashley over and she calls me an aggressive sex deviant. Then she tells Ashley "" we're leaving "" and I look at Ashley, then ask her if she's actually going to let things get to this point over nothing, after everything we've been through. She say's ""you didn't have to kick the door open like that Dom, you need some time to calm down "" and they leave.


And that's where I now draw the line. I'm done with this, you, and your mom Ashley. I've done nothing but be nice to you, treat you with respect, ALWAYS go out of my way to make, and keep you happy. You should honestly let her read this thread so she can realize what a fucking CUNT she is. Tell her to stop using the fucking tanning bed because her skin looks like the leather off of an Alligators asshole. I kicked the door open because it's MY FUCKING APARTMENT. Honestly I'm glad you caught me making my baldie puke, because if it wasn't for this I wouldn't have realized how much like your mother you are. My phone is OFF, don't call, or text me. I'm going to SMOKE AND MASTURBATE ALL NIGHT.

**PRE-8 Update**
For all of you who say this is fake, I would like to help you guys out. Tomorrow morning I'll take pictures of the door incident and post them here as update 8. I still have my phone off, so no updates on her. I haven't even touched gtalk or msn either. Now, I would also like to say that if she does message me tomorrow, I am definately going to consider what she has to say, because we have been together for a long time and I have never seen this side of her, shes still someone special to me. As mad as I may get those kinds of things don't change overnight. But don't get me wrong, if she tries to defend any of her actions I will, as you guys say, masturbate on her things, while looking directly in her eyes,** like a boss**. (joke)
Maybe she will realize it was an extreme over reaction and come to her senses. If not honestly the thought of being single is not that bad of a thing. 

Good night for now redditors, and reddettes. Thanks for everything, if this post is still going in the morning i'll make sure to post an update on the situation. If it gets boring i'll just leave it be.


**Update 8, and probably the last update**

I did as planned last night, even though I felt like shit about it. It hit me that I could seriously lose someone I care about, over something miniscule.. It's just eating at me, even though YES I know she's at fault, she may be immature, she's over reacting, she's socially uneducated about the general populations ( including my own ) beliefs in certain things, but she's also an amazing talker/listener, fun person to be around, she's smart, witty , and i'll stop now before this gets too stupid.

So yea, I turned my phone on, and there were 5 messages. The first two we're ""we need to talk please call me ""
the other two were ""call me now Dom I'm serious "" and the last one stated that if I can so easily turn my phone off and vent about our relationship on reddit instead of talking to her then we need to take some time apart to re-evaluate things. ( Now I know most of you will say ""See, you shouldn't have been immature and turned your phone off"" but the truth is, had I not done that I would have said things I probably would have regretted, she may have as well in return. I wanted to wait for me to calm down before talking to her.... evidently that was a mistake, and now she will be coming over on Saturday to pick up some of her stuff with her mother. Maybe it's for the best, and maybe you guys are right and I did dodge an emotional trainwreck of a bullet ( which I still find hard to believe due to how our relationship was prior to this incident )  but it still feels like SHIT. It feels like theres a blender inside of me. This is it Reddit, you have just witnessed a relationship go to hell due to an overly obsesed piece of shit mother who will ruin her daughters life if she doesn't realize what she's doing.
I feel helpless right now... I'm still kind of like ""wtf... ?""
I'm tempted to publicize her mothers contact information so that you guys can have a go at it. But after reading some of the comments left here, I will indeed take the high road and let it be. No work today, and i'm single.. So I'll just smoke away my *stupidity* of feeling bad and play the 2 shitty games I have on steam ( CS and CS:S I think ? ) :/.  IF any of you redditors would like to join me in steam, don't hesitate to add me if you don't mind playing shitty games to pass time, my steam account name is; Fjufju


And I bid you farewell, from this post at least. I'll always be amongst you redditors upvoting and spending 69 sleep hours a week on reddit. Thanks for everything, the insightful posts, the comments that made me laugh, and even the harsh-reality posters. I guess I need to *open my eyes.*

One last time, for reddit.

**LIKE A BOSS**

I do not know what happened I messaged mods about it a few hours ago when 1/2 my post disappeared along with 2000 comments...... I just woke up from a nap and checked my phone, luckily my browser still had the page open so starting now I am going to start transcribing the info from the phone to the post.** DONE. Everything reposted.

---------

So I may just be paranoid.... but I came home last night after being gone all day to find my exterior garage door keypad was left open, my remote then would not close the garage door, the garage door remote when I clicked the close button would just flash the light on the garage door opener three times. The door did close when I pressed the wall opener.

Now this alone is not that big of a deal, weird stuff happens with electronics. But then my mind started racing with all of these things that have happened over the years so I started thinking about those things and went to investigate around my Town House. 

I present to you my list of evidence to you, convince me I am crazy or tell me I’m not. Regardless give me some ideas on how to test if there is someone in the attic.

* I have never been in the attic, I tried to open it once.... I had a step ladder and I could not get enough leverage to lift it up, it seemed stuck so I just put the box in my extra bedroom.
* I investigated the attic entrance last night and noticed 3 scuff marks on the wall, a finger print on the door below the attic entrance (There was also a fair amount of dust that had dropped from the attic entrance onto the door that is where the fingerprints were.
* I have never noticed anything out or place or food or drink missing.
* The only exception to this is the door knob on the door that goes out to the garage. I noticed on day that it was coming apart. I had assumed that I had simply slammed the door while leaving and broke it myself but I have no recollection of anything like that. Yesterday when I come home the door handle looked more broken. I rarely lock this door. 
* Twice that I can think of I have heard a loud noise upstairs, when this happened I slowly found a big knife and went upstairs to look around, each time something had fallen down, a closet door once, and some boxes the other time
* I live alone, and work crazy hours. Often 7 AM to 10 PM and another 8 hour days on weekends (I love my job) So there is plenty of time for a person to exit and enter the house.
* I never did a home inspection when I purchased the property because of time constraints with a tax credit. As such since the last person moved out the attic has never be accessed....
* Speaking of the previous resident. The property was a short sale..... and was being rented to someone for $100 a month. When I went on a tour of the house the house simply had a sleeping bag and some clothes in a bedroom.........
* I have lived here for 1.5 years.

Holy shit I think my have just convinced myself, but I feel crazy calling the cops cause all of the evidence can be explained in one way or another. But there is no way in hell I am knocking on the attic door. What can I do to prove someone is in my attic?

I just ordered a Wireless IP camera system but it will not be here to Tuesday.

**Update #1 Just called the Cops, So yeah....... This is either going to make me feel like an idiot or make me freak out cause someone is living in my attic**

**Update #2 Well this sucks. I only own a step ladder. As such the Deputies listened to my story, stood on the step ladder and could not climb into the attic....... Then they told me its probably nothing and suggested I replace the locks, reset the garage keypad entry, and put tape on the attic door or nail it shut.**

**So...... I guess I am where I started........ but feeling more like an idiot. The deputies did appear to understand my concern that was nice.**

**Now to tape the shit out of that door, close the door the bedroom, and build a fort of boxes in front of the door. And I guess I am borrowing a ladder from work tomorrow.**


* **Update #3 1:19 AM ----- I finally went back up stairs, taped the door, closed the door to the room where the attic entrance is, taped that door, and positioned a bunch of heavy stuff that will fall if they open it. I am not trying to trap the person in, I just want to know if they left. I also setup a USB webcam on my computer downstairs that will record to a online location if it detects movement. I also deactivated the keypad on the garage door. I am now going to my workplace, I will be returning after work, with a ladder and coworker with a handgun, and a tripod with a videocamera and a led strip to provide lighting.**

* **Update #4 2:07 AM ----- I am now at work, in my locked office, with the door looked and the building security system on and honestly kinda still freaked out about this whole thing. I'm going to try and get some sleep......... **


* ** Update #5 12:07 PM ----- I am at work right now, but since so many people are asking for an update..... I got here at work and sat in my office locked with the security system on and I was honestly still freaked out and could not sleep. I took that time to get a tripod setup with a flashlight and video camera so I can look up there without having to put myself in much danger. I am going home early today so expect the next update to be around 6 PM CST. **

* ** Update #6 5:33 PM ---- Going upstairs to check this out.

-------------------
Update #7 6:12 PM CST (Sorry for not including this before). I headed up stairs with a ladder and camera attached to a tripod and light attached. I was honestly too embarrassed to ask a co-worker to come and help me look so I took the advice of my fellow Redditor's and I manned up. I went up stairs and used the ladder to move the hatch, and then I used the camera to look up there without having to stick my head up there. **And....... There was nothing** I climbed up the ladder and had to stand on the 2nd to the top rung to see over the ledge(I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall).......... **And there was nothing.**

So end of the story is there is no one in my attic. Would I have done anything different if I could redo this entire experience? YES.

I tell people all of the time to stop letting fear hold you back and cause you to be inactive. So why did I not just act? Call the cops earlier? Get a ladder sooner? Find a Camera? Do something but give in to my fear........

Thank you Reddit for your jokes, your distractions, your honest advice, and your motivational rudeness. I think in some way, shape, or form I needed all of it. As my Thank You to each one of you I promise to read each and every comment and take them to heart, but even more so I promise to be a man of action, not inaction.

Short stories, or poetry or even songs, even though that wasn't the purpose of the site.

This one kid of seventeen would post these comedy zombie stories, and while the melodramatic horseshit posted by prominent users would have endless comments of adulation and love, this kids stories went unnoticed except by me. I would always post a little comment to let him know someone appreciated it. 
Others started commenting in time, but he would always send me a PM letting me know he posted one, and thanks for reading when no one else did.

In time I began to get busy with life. I found a job I hated but paid exceptionally well. More I worked, more I earned. I also met my now wife. I stopped commenting. 

I still got the PMs, but generally either ignored them, or replied with a thanks for letting me know. Read the ones I missed soon. 

One day I log on to the site after about a two week absence. In my inbox is a message from the kid that's unusually plaintive. Asking if please could I please read the latest story, as it might be his last and he'd appreciate the feedback, and if he didn't see me, thanks for reading it meant a lot to him. I ignored it, and didn't log back on for another good while. 

Eventually I log in one weekend, and think fuck it, ill read and stop being a dick. So I read them all and enjoy them immensely (they were genuinely good). So I PM the kid, letting them know how good they are, and keep writing. I don't hear back. 

Couple days go by, and I see someone he spoke to on the site chatroom and ask if anyone's seen the kid. There's one of those chatroom pauses where it goes from lines and lines of new text to stop. I get a private chat pop up with a Link to a post. I read through and its a post by the kids mum on his account saying he passed away a few days ago in his sleep after succumbing to cancer. I suddenly remember a while back he posted saying that his cancer had returned, but he was doing okay, but at that point he hadn't posted any stories, and he was just another username to me.

I felt shit. I still feel shit. I still don't watch zombie things because it reminds me of how if I'd have spared an hour I'd have probably made one of that kids last days.

This happened not even a half hour ago, as I'm typing this from an airport terminal with my heart still pounding and a grin on my face. Before I passed through the checking I decided to take a bathroom break. Number two. Inside the stall there was a distinct lack of hooks so I instead draped my jacket over the door and thought nothing of it. Now, I was just wiping up when I *felt* somebody enter the bathroom. Then I heard a pair of feet walk in front of my stall. Then I saw someone peek under the door. My legs snapped closed but the face was gone as soon as it was there. Then my jacket was gone as well. The man had pulled it from the door. Now, had it just been my jacket, I might have cursed the guy to seven hells, finished my shit and reported the offense. But my boarding ticket was in the pocket. This changed the game completely. Pants still around my ankles, was up in a second and shouldering the door open in even less time. The door caught the thief on either the back of the legs or the ass, no matter which one, he stumbled into the sink. I followed suit and caught him around the neck with one arm, the other reaching over his shoulder to snatch at my jacket. He was wearing gym shorts. I was wearing no shorts. My dick was flopped against the back of his leg. We seemed to both realize this at the same time, but I reacted first. Taking a gamble that could have resulted in myself using the female restroom from that point on, I neither retreated nor adjusted, instead squashing myself against the guy all the more and, mouth very close to his ear, began shouting **""YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.""** over and over again. He choked out the bastard child of ""what the fuck"" and ""jesus christ"", cast my jacket upon the floor and tried to shake me off. His hostage free from harm, I allowed him to do so and he ran out. I managed to retain my decency before anyone else came in and, half an hour later, here I am.

After that, we just decided to ignore him, since we had bigger problems to deal with. But, in my mind, I was just thinking ""Why does it matter who I am or why I pulled into your driveway?

Edit: My mom just called me telling me to go take a picture of the ice patch she slipped on. I think he's gonna be paying

The passengers begin glancing nervously, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming. The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and people at the windows realize that they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport.

Sesame Street debuted 42 years ago today.  But like most other TV shows, we had a test pilot.  We created it in the summer of 1969, just a few months before the first episode aired.  The actor who played Gordon on the show, pictured on the above-linked page (or if you that page goes down, [here's an imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/Ov6vr.png), was replaced by an actor named Matt Robinson (who, by the way, is Holly Robinson Peete's father).

Two years ago, we put together a huge anthology of our then-40 year history... and realized that we do not know who played Gordon in the test pilot.  We've asked everyone we could think of -- actors, actresses, and puppeteers who have been on the show since its inception; Sesame Workshop's founder, Joan Ganz Cooney; and of course, dug through seemingly endless boxes of documents and photos.  

Any clue would be great, even if it's seemingly esoteric or mundane. You can email it to us at wheresgordon@sesame.org, drop me a message here, or if it doesn't involve someone's personal info, leave it in a comment.

Oh, and one other thing: [Here's a clip of our mystery Gordon from that test pilot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHiEvVK5D-0).

Right now I find I'm constantly defending myself when people ask why I download all my shows. I personally do it for the convenience of being able to watch them at my leisure.

As a consumer, I would happily download a torrent straight from the broadcasting company's site since I know it would be coming from a good source, that it would be high quality and would be helping them pay their bills. 

Advertisements make the entertainment industry go round, I'm not oblivious to that. I'll happily be pitched to if the companies are willing to meet me and my lifestyle halfway. Chances are, if I'm vegged out on a couch watching a show, most of the time I'm not even going to fastforward through the commercials either. They simply just aren't a big deal to me.

The question is, would everybody else download torrents with ads in them for ""the good of it"" when there would inevitably be alternative options WITHOUT ads?

EDIT: For what it's worth, I am in Canada too. With Bell I pay $55 for 65 GB. I'm not sure how that ranks against American downloaders, but it's not the only way Canadians get the raw end of the deal with major broadcasting companies. Most of the streaming sites aren't available in Canada, not Hulu, not NBC, etc. If a Canadian wants to stream a show legitimately they'll have to do so through a Canadian syndicate (like Global TV, in a lot of cases). The stupidity doesn't stop there, though. I, getting excited for the TV season, tried to watch a preview of NBC's Fall lineup from NBC.com but couldn't because I was geographically restricted.

Now, I am a student myself but I still want to give her something special. So I searched for a great used laptop , and I found a decent Toshiba Satellite. I sold my PSP and some other things so I can afford it.

So there we were at the dinner table opening presents. She opened mine and has this grim look at her face.
""This is it? I thought you'd buy me a brand new one""

""You know I can't afford it. It's the best I can do.""

""I want a brand new one, not this. This sucks! Worst present ever!""

She then shoved the laptop and box across the table and fell down the floor.

I picked it up, and walked out. My cousin tried to stop me, I just said ""I would never give her anything again.""

She even had the nerve to call back and asked for the laptop. Apparently her parents punished her for her behavior and she will now have to buy her own things. No hand-outs or gifts. 

My friend bought it as a favor. He helped me pick it out, and knows how much I bought for it. The profit was only $10(roughly)

What's the most ungrateful thing you see someone do?

Dear Jack,

I am 24 years old. I am not the little boy who cried when you left. I am a man, with a son and daughter of my own. I've never spent more than a weekend away from them. I am a father and a damned good one. I don't need you anymore.

Once, I needed you. When my mom died, I really could have used a dad. I could have used anybody. When she died, there wasn't even anybody there. No one cared about us. I spent three days in that apartment, eating toast and just waiting for her to wake up. 

And then they called you. Because you were my dad. You were twenty three, young, but not so young really. If you had came and gotten me, you would have had a son. I would have loved you forever. 

But you didn't. So I went to a bunch of people who didn't love me, but liked the check they got with me. It didn't make them treat me well. I have burn marks on my arm and I still can't spend time in closed in dark spaces after being shut in closets. An afternoon is a long time when you can't count. 

I didn't count on anybody. I used to pray, the way mom did with me when I was little. But after praying for someone to come and rescue me, long enough, hiding under my bed and praying that my foster dad wouldn't come in and would leave me alone for just one night. Just one night. I stopped believing in most things.

I lived in seven different homes from 4-16. And even the decent ones, I was never family. I didn't have real birthdays or christmases. I wasn't allowed to go in the fridge and just get food when I Was hungry.

When I was 16 me and my foster dad got in a fight over a ham sandwich. ""Boy, what are you doing in our things?"". And so, I left. Sixteen, with nobody to call, and 40 bucks. I just walked away with a backpack. Anything could've happened to me.

But I made it. I'm a man now. And I don't need you. I don't want you to feel bad. I just want you to know why I can't be your son. I'm 24 and have never been any one's son. I don't know how. And I just don't have it in me. 

Jackson

So, the true dates we were on Ngesebus was the 28th and 29th of September.

See, we made another amphibious assualt from Peleliu to Ngesebus to neutralize that island, as well.  After we handed off the rest of the island to the army, there was a film crew right on the beach filming us getting into the amtracs, on our way back to more fighting on Peleliu.

When Seymour Levy and I saw the film crew, we broke rank for about a minute and started cutting up for the camera.  The dance?  It was called ""Truckin'"" in those days.  It was probably the last ""fun"" moment we had before losing it all forever.

I think the film exists because someone claims to have seen it a long time ago.

At any rate, the film would be worth a lot to me, to see myself again at 20 years old with a very good pal of mine.  I've looked at the Critical Past and various other internets, but I have not found it.

This would be a **friendly** place to ask questions, when Google and Wikipedia still don't make it clear. A place to ask questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored. While r/askreddit sometimes has submissions like this, the VAST majority of the subs there are more in the vein of asking for advice [like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j1rsq/i_just_found_this_piece_of_artwork_sitting_on_top/) or questions that are rhetorical in nature [like this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j25pj/soare_we_over_google/) I want a place specifically for asking the community questions about current events or other topics you'd usually be afraid to ask.

A great example of a question here would be: ""Can someone explain the deal with the debt ceiling?"" A lot of us may have heard a lot about it in recent news, and despite being fairly well-educated, might not really understand the basic concept. Here's a place to get an answer -- OR, show off your knowledge! 

The number one rule here would be simple: Respect. As a submitter (asker), you need to respect the subreddit by being honest and asking good questions. While there are no ""dumb"" questions here, please don't waste the space by asking questions that are clearly rhetorical in nature. As a replier (answerer), please remember that no matter how simple the question may seem to YOU, the spirit of this subreddit is for people to come here without fear of being condescended to (despite the catchy name of the subreddit.) All parties should politely contribute to the discussion.

All science-related questions would be kindly directed to the awesome folks at r/askscience (from whom I got the inspiration for this idea.)

I really think this could be a great place that would enrich our conversations on Reddit as a whole -- and, possibly even our own personal lives as well. This can be an opportunity to really expand your knowledge so that you can have more enriching discussions with the people in your life. That's the whole idea behind r/explainlikeimfive.

I'd love to hear feedback, thoughts, and suggestions -- and of course if anyone would like to help me moderate, that would be awesome. Thanks for checking it out!

**EDIT** Wow, thanks for the great response! I'm grateful for all the terrific feedback, and the couple of folks who've offered to help moderate -- we'll need you! ModMail me over at the new subreddit to let me know if you're interested.

As per your suggestions, I'll be adding a couple more rules for the sub:

**No Politics in your answers.**  DISCUSSION of politics is fine, but the blatant advancement of your political agenda (whatever it may be) is not for r/explainlikeimfive. Any such posts will be STRICTLY filtered. Take it to r/politics, please.

**No bias.** Like the above, there's no real place for this here. This includes religious bias, gender bias, or any other kind of personal bias that detracts from the sole purpose of this subreddit - to spread basic knowledge. These responses will be filtered also.

**Please, no blatant speculation.** It's okay not to be the world's foremost expert on a subject, but please, if you have absolutely no knowledge on the question at hand, please don't guess. 

**The above rules will apply to question-askers, too!**


**Submissions should be tagged something in the subreddit such as (LI5), so we'll know exactly what kind of post we're looking at.**

I'll be adding more of your suggestions as they roll in. In the meantime, if you do think this is a good idea, please subscribe and maybe fire off a submission if you feel so inclined.

flavor syrup to taste (Sam's club will have these, or a coffee warehouse will sell you them for $6-7 for a whole .75L bottle. DaVinci flavor syrup is the best.)

""Just playing Megaman at Bill's, mind if I hang out a little longer?""  ""Thanks for calling in, be home by 2, no later and don't expect another extension.""  ""No problem""

Now that I'm in my 30s I can not possibly be late to an appointment, and when circumstances arise where I'm going to be late I have to call well ahead to let everyone know I'm running late.  Its almost a compulsion, but its a trait that has made me extremely reliable in my job and personal life.

I totally blame my dad.  His rules were very relaxed and he wasn't strict, but when he said he expected me to be home or check in with him by a specific time, he damn well meant it, and every time I did I was rewarded with equal respect.  ""Ok you got a thing going on, thanks for checking in, finish your thing and then come home.""  The mutual respect made it work, it made me want to follow his rules.

Now I just moved to the U.S from Ireland and the TSA has stolen thousands of dollars of camera equipment from me. Is there anything I can do to get it back?,8354,6144,1699,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12fy6j/i_heard_all_of_the_horror_stories_about_the_tsa/,"So I moved to the U.S a few days ago. We were originally supposed to go from Dublin to London, then on to LA where we'd spend two days seeing some sights then head on to Austin, Texas. Our flight from Dublin to London was delayed and we ended up missing our connection. After standing in line in London for about 6 or 7 hours we were put on a flight to Paris leaving the next day and then went on to LA. Our bags were never returned to us and we were told we'd get them in LA. When we arrived in LA we were told they were missing. With the delay we then ended up having to fly out to Austin (our final destination) a few hours later and couldn't do much about it. Finally after 4 days in Austin our bags were finally found and sent to Austin airport. 

When we arrived to collect them we noticed there was a huge hole in the side of one of them, the one which held our camera equipment. We checked it immediately but everything was gone. The guys at the baggage desk told us it was most likely the TSA who were responsible. We've tried contacting the airlines, but so far we are just being bounced around by all of them because of all of the different airlines we flew with because of all the connections we were on (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and United, plus American Airlines who delivered the bags). We're also trying to get in touch with our insurance company in Ireland but we haven't had any luck with that yet. Even if they do let us make a claim theres no way they'll come close to covering the replacement costs. 

The biggest problem though is that we are in the U.S on 1 year work visas which require us to get a job asap. Every day without our equipment is a day we can't work. We can't afford to replace it and we just don't know what to do. 

Is there anything we can do to make this process go faster? Do we have any chance of recovering our stuff? Has anyone else been through this and can offer some advice? Do any redditors who work in the airline industry or with the TSA have any suggestions?

Any ideas or suggestions at all would be a huge help. I know it Halloween so I'm not expecting a huge response but we're just really worried since we put all of our savings into this trip and getting ready for it and its turning into a disaster. We just don't know what to do.

**EDIT ONE**

My comment got kind of buried, so here it is.

&gt;I read a ton on my iPad.  Mostly Sci-Fi stuff.
&gt;
&gt;I just read A [Soldiers Duty](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0441020631/) which was very good.
&gt;
&gt;[Wool - Omnibus Edditon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469984202/) was probably one the sickest books I've read in a very long time.
&gt;
&gt;Both are available in the Kindle and iTunes stores

**EDIT TWO**

What book would you recommend?  I'm always looking for new books to read.

**EDIT THREE**

My all time favorite book is *[Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah](http://www.amazon.com/Illusions-Adventures-Reluctant-Messiah-ebook/dp/B008IU9ZXW/)*, by Richard Bach.  417 of 538 reviews on Amazon.com are 5 stars.  Followed closely by *[Replay](http://www.amazon.com/dp/068816112X/)*, by Ken Grimwood.  Also very highly rated.

**EDIT FOUR**

1331687999.0,2195,self.AskReddit,qvgi5,The cyber bullying has gotten to the point where the school will not take any action unless I kill myself. Reddit- how do I get my story out and make this stop?,14570,12375,5679,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qvgi5/the_cyber_bullying_has_gotten_to_the_point_where/,"He has been suspended until the school decides what to do with him. Thank you for your support and emails, but **THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANYONE TO EMAIL THE SCHOOL ANY FURTHER!!!!** The matter is being taken seriously now, and everything can move a lot quicker if the school isn't being flooded with email and concern. I promise you, action has been taken. Thank you!

I am not asking for therapy, but help in gaining momentum.

Since the beginning of the school year, I have been harassed both in-person and online by the school's ""bully"". It is hard to use the word because almost everyone knows and loves him. I tried not to let it get to me, until it escalated.

""Go kill yourself. No one would care if you died. Why aren't you dead yet?"" This was said to me multiple times online, and in the middle of class. As a teenager dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, I could not laugh this off. I went straight to the office and demanded to see a vice principal. I was sobbing uncontrollably and visibly a danger to myself, but they just sat me down and had me fill out a form. I called my Dad, who cancelled his flight out-of-town to come be with me. He was furious that he was not called in a situation like this. We had a conference with the vice principal, and we were told there would be consequences if it happened again.

It has been months. Multiple people have gone to the office with complaints about his bullying, and absolutely nothing has been done. Not so much as a detention. He is now attacking the leader of our school's GSA, members, and myself through twitter. Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided that I needed to go through his history to get hard evidence. Here are a few gems I found- some submitted by other people. There are actually over 20 screen shots.

""Life has its ups, and you have the Downs. Please do us a favor, and fucking drown"" -- A poem dedicated to Sarah.

""I have AP Lit in the morning. Sarah, if you say a single word, you are getting choked"" (I am the only person in the class who will participate in discussions without being forced).

""I was to roofie Sarah""

""Sarah has a boyfriend and I'm still single? Time to die""

""Sarah for biggest slut. Go die""


It is hard enough for me to want to be on this planet, and people are taking time out of their day to wish that I would die. I think this has passed what the school can do. They lost my faith when they didn't help everyone else who begged for some sort of relief after me. I live in Anne Arundel County. How can I get my story (and the others') out there so that we can see some real change before it is too late? 


TL;DR: The bullying isn't worthy of school attention unless I die. 

Edit: It's not just me. I have screen shots of him saying things about a TON of people who I am sure have no idea it exists. 

Going to bed for tonight! I will NOT let him stress me out to the point where I miss class. The other girl involved talked to people at PFLAG tonight, and they suggested board of ed. I might show her this page later. Thank you everyone, and I will be back reading your suggestions and updating you on my progress on this yet-to-be-named operation.

Edit 1: Front page? It was amazing to wake up to all this support! I'm on my way to a meeting with two other girls who feel equally trapped in this situation. We will have our proof with us, and we are demanding to speak to someone. I will let you know how it goes!

**Edit 2: HOLY S%&amp;^ YOU GUYS! I get off my bus this morning, and I see an unusual amount of cops around the school. I find the group who was going with me into the office, and we sat in guidance, waiting for the counselor to see us all (There were about six of us). Next thing I know, someone asks me if I'm Sarah. They had been looking for this ""Sarah"" all morning, and had even called down another girl by the same name. I get taken into one of the counselor's rooms, and a BOOK of these comments is placed in front of me. She tells me that she has gotten a ton of emails, and that the page has been forwarded to several teachers and the principal. I was shocked. Thankfully, she was not upset about the emails, though some of them were a little nasty. I learn that my Principal has been up all night trying to deal with all of the emails she has been getting. Though she seemed a little mad at first, we quickly settled everything. I was taken into a room with the principal, the counselor, and an administrator to share my story again. I printed off every tweet and the cops collected any threatening ones. They might be able to do something about it, which is amazing, because I wasn't expecting it at all. I'm still shocked that many of the school officials were just now learning about this kid, but I know now that they know: every body knows. Nothing can happen immediately, but the process is starting and consequences will happen.**

**I am slightly scared about the possible backlash, but I feel amazing knowing that even if people dislike me for it, I stood up for my own safety. I have a ton of support- both from you guys and my friends. Thank you everyone who sent an email (they kept mentioning some guy from Montana). There is no need anymore to contact the school or the county about this issue. I will be checking in every morning with the counselor, and she will give me a pass to see her if I ever feel like I'm being harassed over the next few days. You guys made this all happen overnight and sped up the process ten-fold! I don't think I can say thank you enough for helping me, and everyone else, finally deal with the school cyber bully. I love you, Reddit!!!**

I know you're all getting tired of the modposts, but I have a very important message for everyone in askreddit. 

Over the past few weeks, there has been a person (I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that there's only one person sick enough in the world to do this) creating new accounts and spamming child pornography in links on askreddit. 

To the users who have had the misfortune of clicking these links, I want to offer my sincerest apologies. It's not fair to you to be exposed to that, and **it's not fucking funny.** 

If you happen to stumble onto one of these links anywhere on reddit, please notify the mods of the subreddit and the administrators, and just be aware that this is happening (i.e. be *extra* careful when clicking links in askreddit.)

Thanks again everyone who has been letting us know and for your patience. Once again, i'm sorry for the excessive modposts.

A lot of you have been asking about laws. I can't answer them for sure, but [slicklizard](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ur7n6/modpost_child_pornography_warning/c4xt49w) posted this article related to the topic. http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/08/11602955-viewing-child-porn-on-the-web-legal-in-new-york-state-appeals-court-finds?lite. (I Promise, this isn't CP.) 


***


Also for full disclosure, we're all going completely on the honors system with this. If you see it, tell us. We're going to be shooting first and asking questions later on these kinds of links.

We know that there's a problem because enough different people have let us know about it, but none of us are actually clicking these links to verify that it's CP. So please just continue to be honest with us about it. I'm sure you all can understand why we wouldn't want to make sure someone isn't lying about this kind of thing.

***


The question was asked if the offenders were using a typical image host. No, they look like they're using uncommon hosting (the last one was imagebanana).


***

I'm seeing a lot of blame going around to 4chan, SA, 9gag and even SRS. 

There's no reason right now to believe that this is anyone except one individual who needs treatment. Any accusations only serve as meaningless speculation, so let's please not demonize any of these groups.

***

Family involved, details inside.",11188,9003,6557,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/epw4f/reddit_im_livid_just_got_engaged_with_the_gf_and/,"There's been a joke floating around Reddit/the Internet for ages where the husband-to-be is asked to come over to the bride's house for a favor. The bride isn't there but the little sister is, little sister tries to seduce him, he runs outside, and the whole family is outside congratulating him on not succumbing to her temptation. The joke being that he keeps his condoms in the car and was just going to get them...




Guess what? This shit HAPPENED to me today.

My girlfriend calls me over to help her friend (who is definitely not unattractive and I've known quite well for some time) with some computer problem. I show up and the friend tells me the GF ran out to do some quick errands. I ask about the computer and she starts bullshitting about how it's been ""running slow"" or some other non-point issue. 




Suddenly, the friend asks if I think she is attractive. I hesitate. Not wanting to upset one of the future bridesmaids I tell her ""of course, you're pretty."" She then starts telling me all this shit about how she has always had her eye on me, and how nice I was, and how hot I was...



I was kind of just floored. After that she fully came on to me. Went for the embrace, tried to convert to kiss. I pulled away, excused myself, and went out the door.




Head count: Mom, 3 other friends, my girlfriend, and her sister are outside waiting for me. They all laugh and cheer, the girlfriend runs up and jumps in my arms like I'm some sort of hero, and the mom has tears running down her cheek. They all kept saying how glad they were I ""passed the test"" and how ""good I was"" for her, etc. 




I smiled a bit, was really shaken up. In the middle of all the celebration I quietly said I wasn't feeling well, and excused myself. Got in the car and drove off (small burnout, it's what the Camry could manage), and have been hitting ignore on the countless phone calls I've gotten since then. As of this post (6:13AM PST), it's been about 12 hours since the incident and I still can't place my thoughts.




On one hand, I feel deeply and utterly betrayed. On the other, it's ridiculous to the point that it's funny and my girlfriend has never done *anything* even close to this before. Reddit, talk to me. What are your thoughts?




**EDIT:** (6:50AM PST) Wow, the initial feedback is huge. I guess this struck a chord with many people. I e-mailed her a little note that basically said I needed ""some time to think about what happened today."" I haven't slept at all so I think I'm going to see if I can get a few hours in and then go from there. Thanks for all the kind words so far.

1294951982.0,2157,self.AskReddit,f1saj,My mom recently sat me down and told me the truth about my childhood friend. Can you help me research her story?,9540,7383,849,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f1saj/my_mom_recently_sat_me_down_and_told_me_the_truth/,"When I was four or five years old, there was a girl in my class who had very few friends. My mom always told me to try to make friends with everyone at school, so one day I walked up to her and and asked her if we could be friends. I would play with her on the swings, and sit next to her during class. I remember her being very shy, but a great friend. I had so much fun playing with her, and we would make believe about swinging all the way out into outer space - we even made up a song. One day, suddenly, she stopped coming to school - our teachers told us she moved away to another state. I was sad to know I couldn't see her anymore, but I accepted that she had left.


Recently, while talking nostalgically about the past, my mom was able to tell me the truth about what happened to my friend.


Her name was Olivia, though we both cannot remember her last name. She attended Dallas International School, and was in the same class as me in pre-K (this must have been circa 1996-1997). I couldn't remember this, but my mom told me that Olivia always came to school in tattered clothing, looking very unkempt. My mom remembers that, when attending birthday parties, her mother would drop her off and only pick up her daughter many hours after the party had ended and all the other children had been picked up. These were little things that the other parents noticed, but that could very easily be concluded as an unfortunate financial situation where the mom worked, and therefore could not pick up her child on time.


However, one morning my mom was watching the morning news, and she was shocked to find out that Olivia's mother had murdered her children/family, and then killed herself. 


Reddit, I know that this happened over a decade ago, but it still deeply, deeply saddens me to find out that my friend died. I tried to research her story online, but I figure there must not be very many reports from the 90's. Also, because these are only my mom's memories, we cannot remember how she killed her children, how many children she had, etc. I know this is an extremely long shot, given how little information there is to work from, but I wanted to try my best to pay my respects to Olivia after all these years. If you could help in any way to figure out what her story is, I would be incredibly grateful!




** EDIT **: Reddit, I cannot thank you enough - within fifteen minutes of posting, Olivia and her story were found thanks to jacques45 and a few other posters several moments later. You have proven to me once again that this is a truly wonderful community, and I am very grateful! I am not sure where to go from here - I feel as though I am mourning a loss many, many years after the fact - though I know I can finally rest knowing that she will never be forgotten. Once again Reddit - thank you!


** EDIT 2 **: 2 hours and this thread has reached the front page of Reddit. I am overwhelmed with emotion, and am so happy that Olivia and her story have incited such a response from this community that never ceases to amaze me. I apologize for my lack of replies - I broke down after reading her story and have sought some immediate solace in the company of very close friends who have made this easier to bear.

**Monday:**

1.  I had to go to work before confronting her.  I think it was better anyway, since it gave me time to think about what to say instead of rushing to anger.

1.  I asked my assistant to go to the 7-11 next door and see if they have Shiner Bock.  If they don't, I'll ask him to go as far as Publix.  For science!  (Edit:  we didn't find any)

1.  She finally texted me at work, and said that her (girl)friend stayed over.  I didn't respond.  (3:00PM EST)

**Tuesday:**

1.  I left work last night and went to dinner with one of my work partners.

1.  I didn't say a word to my wife when I came to bed.  In the morning I mentioned the text after I woke up.  I told her I was surprised she would use that language with a girlfriend.

1.  She broke down and admitted that she had a (platonic) girlfriend AND an (not-so platonic) ex-boyfriend over while I was away.

1.  She admitted it wasn't the first time.

1.  I calmly told her I would have to think about how I feel about the situation and let her know whether we should seperate.

Thanks, reddit, you prepared me for the worst, way in advance.  It's nice to get the hivemind's opinion sometimes before jumping into a rash and complicated situation, or acting brash and angry as a reaction.  I really appreciate everyone's comments and help figuring out the next steps!

Traditionally suicides skyrocket during November and December.  In 2011 they didn't, and I noticed.  Then 2012 came along.  And people started killing themselves.  At the rate of 1 or more per week in my relatively small jurisdiction.

Roommates come home to find their roommates hung, boyfriends are shooting themselves in front of girlfriends, an adult brother called the police to tell us to come get his juvenile sister, who was sleeping, after he kills himself.  I've cut people down from doorways and performed chest compressions on shooting victims.

When I get dispatched to a death, I can't ""not click the link.""  I have to go.  I have to go in.  I have to see the result.  I have to handle the body.  I have to talk to the family.  I have to hear the screams and hysteria.  And I frequently have to bring those images home.

People, especially relatively young people, are killing themselves at what I consider an alarming rate.  I want it to stop.

Please.  If you are feeling like you want to hurt yourself reach out to r/suicidewatch.  Or call 1-800-784-2433 (1-800-SUICIDE).  Or call a loved one. Or reach out to [Befrienders](http://www.befrienders.org/helplines/helplines.asp?c2=USA).  And if you see a friend or loved one in need, give them the support you need.  This is my Cake Day wish.

We all know about the [P-Dub asking for help thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ag96s/i_have_a_problem_and_i_dont_know_what_i_can_do/). Everyone donated to the guy who was popular on Reddit simply because he asked people to remind him about doing his homework. We didn't know the full story of what happened with his mom, nor did we wait to see what transpired. No, we donated $7,000 as of 24hours ago because we wanted to help.


21 days ago, a [woman who had similarly fallen on hard times](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a90vh/askreddit_how_can_i_pull_off_keeping_my_home_and/), a Redditer for over a year (more than P-Dub, I may add), was thrown into a pit. She also reluctantly posted a Paypal link (which she later removed). She was told to stop having children, Redditers were told to be a ""bit more skeptic and not just throwing money at people,"" and she was called a beggar.

Two people came asking for help. One made off with $7,000+ dollars, one got nothing. One got praise, helpful advice, and assistance, one got insulted and called a scammer.

Can we just ban e-panhandling altogether? The generosity of Reddit is amazing, but one of two things will happen if this continues:

1) People will become jealous, because someone got superstar treatment and help from Reddit because they were a user people ejaculated over, while other users in similar or worse circumstances who contributed just as much got nothing. 

2) People are going to start preying on our generosity in order to potentially make off with some money

The best thing we can do when someone has hit hard times is to give them our experience. We can offer words of wisdom as a lawyer, put people in touch with people we know that can help them, and even offer services to these people that they need at no charge. Scammers or unethical people will have no use with specialized help and advice, and the people down on their luck will be thankful for anything they can get.


**EDIT 1:**
Just got this from Shannonigans:

&gt;I know this will be buried if I just post a comment, but I just hoped maybe you could put an edit in there for me. No matter how many people were mean, the kind ones meant way more, I've received several gifts in the mail from redditors. Several stuffed animals, books, and a gift card, not to mention a giftcard to kohls to help. Reddit did about 1/3 of my Christmas shopping for me and the ones that sent kind words meant just as much. Right after my girls open their gifts, there will be a follow up with words of appreciation and recognition and pictures of the Christmas that reddit helped happen. I appreciate being skeptical, but I was really telling my true story. I hold no resentment towards P-Dub at ALL. If I could help right now, I would!

&gt;For now, a picture of my oldest and I with the card sent in stilesjp's care package of soaps (one of which she will NOT put down) http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v12/Shannonista/CIMG0278.jpg

&gt;Thank you, reddit, and thank you eggbrain, for caring. All the love in my immediate family goes to all the love for my reddit family.

**EDIT 1.5: (same time as the previous edit, but wanted to separate thoughts)**

I'm really glad things worked out for Shannonigans. I was disgusted when I saw her called terrible names (some of which, since this posting, have been deleted.)

Unfortunately, this doesn't change the fact that had there not been this topic, no one would have known about her, or any of the other unfortunate stories, some of which have been posted in this thread. I respect the right of individuals to make their own decisions as to whether or not to donate to a particular user. But I also think there is a responsibility of users to not just throw money at situations that they know almost nothing about.

I think it also teaches a bad example that someone down on their luck can get an instant solution in the form of cash without working for it (Which is why I think gifts of service and people is much more helpful). Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

I usually always walk him to his car and help him put his groceries away, and he always tries to give me a dollar even though I've told him I can't take tips.

Today, I was coming back from break and noticed him checking out with another cashier. I walked over and said hi to him, and he smiled really big and looked super excited. He had bought some suspenders he wanted to put in in the store, but couldn't clip the back of them. So I helped him. I didn't even think about it, I just helped clipped them to his belt because it was no big deal. The cashier started giggling, and was like ""omg did you see that?? She touched that old guy!!"" And told everyone like it was big gossip. 

I walked him out to his car like I usually do, and when we got to his car, he stopped and said he had a question for me. He asked me why I was always so nice to him, and I told him my mother is a geriatric nurse, and when I was a kid, I used to hang out at the nursing home with her playing with the old ladies and pretending I was there granddaughter, because it made them extremely happy that someone cared. My mother always taught me to respect my elders, because a lot of them have no one that talks to them, or is even nice to them. I told him I wasn't trying to say he was a lonely old man no one talked to, but I'm always polite to everyone, especially the elderly, because that's how I was raised. He got teared up and told me I was absolutely right, his children hadn't spoken to him in years, his wife had passed a while ago, and when he goes out in public people treat him like a burden. He said I am the nicest person he had ever met at a Walmart, and that I'm the only reason he ever comes here anymore, and that he wished some people would learn some manners. He hugged me and asked me when I worked next, and usually I never tell anyone, but I gave him my entire schedule for the next two weeks and told him to avoid the times I go to break.

I just don't understand why it was such a joke that I helped an old man, and why no one else would help him. Yeah, he's a crotchety old guy who talks constantly about nonsense, but he's still a person. I hate my generation sometimes.

Back when I was in school, the University newspaper ran a story about undercover cops using a younger, cute girl to camp outside the liquor store just off-campus and ask people to buy her beer.  She'd give the people money, then ask them if they wanted to come back to her vehicle and share one as a way to say thanks.

Get back to where her car is supposed to be, van door opens up, cops inside, and you'd get a ticket for underage buying.

Later that evening, my friend and I were going to this same liquor store to get some beer, when we were approached by a cute girl, who asked us if we could buy her a six pack of beer since she was underage.

Being a dumbass, I said sure, took her money and we went inside.  About 10 seconds later I remember the piece about the undercover cops, and realized we were about to get arrested.  At that point, we decided the best thing to do was to buy a 6 pack of super expensive root beer (blowing $9 of the $20 she gave us) and we put it in a paper bag.

We walked back out, and she asked us ""did you get it?"" to which we said ""yeah, of course.""

She invited us back to her car to have one each as a thank-you.  Sure enough, we head to the back and there's the black van.

The door opens up, cops sitting in there with headphones on etc. and they tell us ""you're in a world of trouble now.""

I put on my best trollface and said ""really?  I really thought you guys could use some root beer sitting out here in that cramped van all night.""

There was an awkward pause, and then they opened the bag.  Root beer, nothing else.

Then they told us to get the fuck out of there, and we were interfering with a police investigation, and if we didn't leave we'd get arrested.

We walked across the street to our apt. building went into the various laundry rooms and yelled out the window every time she approached someone that it was a sting.  They left after 20 min. of that.

tl;dr - cops tried to trick us into buying beer for an underage girl, we took their money and bought them root beer instead.

edit:  For those saying this would have been entrapment, it wouldn't have been.

http://www.lectlaw.com/def/e024.htm

&gt;A person is 'entrapped' when he is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or their agents to commit a crime that he had no previous intent to commit; and the law as a matter of policy forbids conviction in such a case.

&gt;However, there is no entrapment where a person is ready and willing to break the law and the Government agents merely provide what appears to be a favorable opportunity for the person to commit the crime. For example, it is not entrapment for a Government agent to pretend to be someone else and to offer, either directly or through an informer or other decoy, to engage in an unlawful transaction with the person. So, a person would not be a victim of entrapment if the person was ready, willing and able to commit the crime charged in the indictment whenever opportunity was afforded, and that Government officers or their agents did no more than offer an opportunity. 

I would have been screwed, because of the three things required for entrapment, they didn't do #2

&gt;Second, the government agents then persuaded or talked the person into committing the crime. Simply giving him the opportunity to commit the crime is not the same as persuading him to commit the crime.

She just asked, she didn't persuade.  She offered the opportunity, that's it.  If I'd said no, and she proceeded to badger me it would be entrapment, but I just say ""sure"".",,False,,t5_2qh1i,True,,,True,t3_hqyxq,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hqyxq/trolling_law_enforcement_whats_your_story/,

He thinks we don't notice, but we do. How should we confront him?",13303,11203,3712,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0tpe/our_summer_intern_is_extremely_lazy_and_spends/,"So for the summer, we've had an intern. He started around June. He's a pretty cool guy, and he gets along well with the office. The first few weeks, he was fine. We gave him simple tasks to ease him in, which he picked up on. Over time, we gave him more and more, but nothing too hard or too high a work load.

Now, for the past month or so, he's been completely slacking off. I noticed the work flow coming from him has slowed dramatically, and he seemed a bit more lazy in general. So, I asked my friends in the IT department to give me a report on his internet usage. Surprise surprise. Browsing the internet, plenty of reddit, even some youtube here and there. All times of the day, at a high volume. When we last talked, I brought up that work had slowed, and asked why. His response was that he felt his work had gotten more difficult - which is BS, because he's very qualified for what I've assigned to him.

I'm not a tough boss, and I've never had to confront a worker before - our office has always had really great employees. So, how should I go about this? Give him a stern talking? A friendly one? A joking message through reddit that says ""Get to work!"" anonymously? He's a good kid, he's just been lazy lately.

**Edit:** OP has not abandoned you all, don't worry. As for all the comments about interns shitting yourselves - good. It might be you I call into my office later today or tomorrow. Straighten up, and get to work. The more I from interns here, the more I want to prank him!

Yes, I plan on talking to him either this evening or tomorrow morning. Yes, I will update. Some have asked how much he makes, and if it's for free: definitely not free labor - THEN I would probably understand. He makes around $18/hour if I recall correctly.

**Edit 2**: [The hour of reckoning is near.](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/bwe/images/2011/03/prairie_dog.gif)

**Edit 3:** Edited the poor bastard's name out because the sound of so many interns shitting their pants in this thread is too beautiful. Unfortunately, there won't be time to call him in today - a meeting came up and I have other stuff to do by the end of the day. He'll be called in first thing tomorrow morning, and I **will** update you beautiful sons of bitches. Going to try and keep it light hearted, but at the same time keep firm that he *does* need to get more work done and that his browsing needs to decrease drastically. We are okay with some browsing, just not the amount he does. 

One last gem: called friend in IT, had him check again since he did earlier today. Looks like he  cleared his browsing cache and cookies, probably upon seeing this thread. Stay tuned...

**Edit 4:** Guys, we aren't hiring right now. I'm sorry :( Please don't PM me, I can't get you a job. If I could, I would - but you'd probably go on reddit as much as this guy. And then I'd have to come to /r/askreddit on how to deal with the situation. And then I'd get more PM's asking to be hired.

**Edit 5:** Really, we aren't hiring. I promise I can't get you a job.

**Update after our talk:** So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the ""okay, well do you know why I asked you here?"" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said ""uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?"" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we *need* more work coming from him.

So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. 

Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform *my* boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop.

As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own ""GET BACK TO WORK"" page, just for a short while.

I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry.

**tldr: Thousands of interns produce brown fruit that flows into their sabatons upon reading this thread. Our guy was one of them. We're cool now. I'll leave it up to him if he wants to out himself here.**

Late one evening I was walking home from work when I noticed two dudes walking behind me. They spoke in Armenian, and it's a very rare thing for someone in Sweden (or anywhere else, for that matter) to understand Armenian. Their dialog, summarized, went something like this:

&gt;""Look at her. Just look at her, walking with her expensive boots and jacket, all fancy. Since when are women allowed to make money, anyway? Look at her fancy ass. She probably has a great job and plenty of money, the slut. And we have to save pennies to buy cigarettes. What a slut. If this were a less crowded street, I'd shove her into a corner and show her a thing or two.. She wouldn't be so fucking fancy anymore, I bet. Put her in her place...""

**UPDATE 3:** Animal control would not take it because it is considered ""Live Stock"" and they don't handle that. So I just let go, nothing else I could do and I was tired of it using my garage as its bathroom. The odor in there is ridiculous. I had to spray it out with a water hose, it shit everywhere.

**UPDATE 5:** As more neighbors are getting off work everyone is coming over to see the damn thing, this is getting out of hand. I am about to start charging a fee to have an encounter with what I am now calling the shitcock. Also one neighbors dog decided to give it a go, he got his shit pecked. I might as well go get a goat and horse and open a petting zoo.

*To everyone giving me tips on how to scare it away, understand this. This peacock is not your average peacock. He has titanium balls (if male) and has the mind set of Rambo. Nothing phases it.

I am not one for hurting animals so keep the tips coming but I am not going to shoot or harm it as many people are suggesting. We have also called around 5 different animal rescue type services and no one wants it, looks like were in it for the long haul with shitcock.*

She was told that she would get the remainder of her contract, which is payment until August, and was then ordered off the premise. I thought this was kind of shitty, but at least she has 8 month's pay.

Today, the principal that fired her (she is a teacher), said they are breaching the contract and not paying her. Normally, this would be something she could take to her union, but she couldn't afford insurance *and* the union, so this was the first year she has not been in the union.

The first year she is not in the union, and they fire her on christmas and breach contract. She called her *old* union rep and he said that they are fighting this kind of thing all over the place, but they won't represent her because this is the first time in 25 years that she was not paying union dues. She was even promised by the secretary that was going to handle the paperwork that she would get full pay, on wednesday. That secretary was fired today.

The principal said, ""If you want to fight it, hire a lawyer."" 

I think that, collectively, we have 1,500 dollars between me, my brother and my mom, and the lowest that we have heard from a lawyer initally is 2 grand.

\*there is a *tiny* mortgage on the house (about 8 grand or so), but if she can't pay that, she is going to lose the entire house.

I don't know what to do, my mom doesn't know what to do, and my brother is in the Navy, so he is completely oblivious to the problem.

In summation, My mom's school district fired her, broke her contract because she was not in the union.

Frankly, I only post this here because I'm desperate I have no idea what can even be done.

\* I wrote ""I don't know what to do"" twice here. This is effecting my posting skills.

**A [$233](http://www.doobybrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/spider.jpg) value donation was just made by someone.** (Not really, they just sent the drawing.)

**""Here's another $12, I'll give you $50 more if you drive to Pittsburgh and let me throw a hamburger at you""**

*Flying would be cheaper, I could maybe get a ticket from SouthWest for 60 bucks, and if you can cover that, you get to throw the hamburger at me for free.*

___

Okay, I'm going to take a little break and check on things in three or four hours, I'll bring updates then. By the way, everytime there is a paypal transaction, I get an email.

I have 300 emails.\*

D:

\* make that 500 emails.
___

I thought I'd update you all on the plan that has come up from all this:

1. The NLRB keeps unions in check, and apparently what my mom's union has done may have been against the rules, and I have the form to submit to the NLRB concerning the union rep.

2. If the union thing does not work, someone has contacted me with a lawyer they know that may take the case Pro Bono (oh, how many times have I written that today and wanted to write 'Pro-Boner')

3. At the very least, a scary letter from a lawyer may do the trick and get the contract reinstated.

4. If all else fails, your donations will at least keep things afloat for some time.

5. Alternate 'If All else fails', taking this to the press. I list this as a last resort because I don't see my mom going for it. She feels really bad about the whole experience.

That is all for right now. Being Friday night, not much can be done over the weekend in regards to this whole mess, so any real action will have to wait until Monday. I think this is why they fire people on Fridays...

Edit:

Update Tuesday the 29th or Wednesday the 30th, everyone that donated will be getting an email from my mom (at least, everyone whose email I could find)

Here's the story, and [here's a link to the original AskReddit thread, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m7g6k/reddit_we_lost_something_can_you_help_sesame/): 

In 2009, we put together an anthology of Sesame Street’s then 40 year history.  The end product of this anthology was a coffee table book, “Sesame Street: A Celebration –  40 Years of Life on the Street.”  The book is extensive – a full color, 300-plus page masterpiece.  The amount of research it took to produce the book?  A years-long endeavor, involving multiple people digging through a seemingly endless trove of boxes and bins -- all of which, collectively, promised to tell the complete story of Sesame Street’s history. 

Except there was one item missing.

In the summer of 1969, Sesame Workshop (then Children's Television Workshop) created an episode of Sesame Street -- an unaired test pilot shown only to a focus group of children. Later that year, on November 10, 1969 after incorporating the data gathered by this test pilot and many other sources, the first ever episode of Sesame Street – Episode 0001 -- debuted. 

The actor who played Gordon in the Episode 0001 was Matt Robinson, who held the role through season 3. In seasons four and five, Hal Miller took over. Since season six, Roscoe Orman has played the role. But the man who played Gordon in the unaired test pilot?  We did not know who he was.  And our records came up empty, the man’s identity, we feared, was lost to history.

On November 10, 2011 – our 42nd birthday – we decided to ask the Internet for help.  And congratulations, Internet: 

You found Gordon.

[Here's a pic of him from 1976, eight years after the episode was filmed.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvy8brgL7j1qcaggg.jpg)

Gordon’s name was Garrett Hobart Saunders, an actor local to New York who primarily performed in traveling theater.  Out of respect for the privacy of his family, we won’t be sharing the details of his life here.  But the story as to how we found him – how you found him, well, here it goes.

We posted our call for help everywhere we could think of, starting with SesameStreet.org.  We shared it across our social media accounts – Facebook (even on Elmo’s and Cookie Monster’s pages), Twitter, and Tumblr as well.  And we posted it to Reddit, where it quickly hit the front page. Within hours, people were making suggestions, and within days, the story travelled across the web and across mediums.  It even made a few television news shows, one of which ended up being the big break.

Mr. Saunders’ nephew saw a story of our search and immediately contacted his cousins – Garrett Saunders’ two daughters.  Both women reached out to us later that day, providing us the photo above and the other information we needed.  With their help, we were able to verify that Mr. Saunders was, in fact, the first Gordon.

We’d like to thank everyone who helped us spread the word and ultimately, solve our mystery.  And thank you, too, to Garrett Hobart Saunders, for being part of Sesame Street’s history.

Turns out, the man is the teen's father. Now, through two years of seeing this kid almost every day, I know a few things about him: he's in foster care, his mom OD'd last year, he grew up on the streets, he was abused by several of his mom's boyfriends. 

So I was surprised to see he had a dad, honestly. But it became quickly apparent (to everyone else) that the dad wasn't that in to seeing his son. But the boy could not see that. He was talking all about his life, his group home, his younger brothers, etc. Then he says, ""Why don't we go to lunch? Let's go to Wendy's"" (right across the street.) The dad goes, ""Sure, let me go get my wallet, I'll be right back."" And he walks out the door and doesn't come back. At all.

This kid stood in the middle of the library for like an hour, then went back and forth between us and Wendy's for the rest of the day. A co-worker and I ended up sitting in the parking lot with this kid for like two hours after we closed, just letting him cry.

This is a teenager who has seen and experienced the very worst things, many of them probably at the hands of his father, and yet he wanted so desperately to be part of his life.

When you stop at a stop sign/stop light and there is someone standing on the street outside of the passenger side window (perhaps waiting to cross the street), simply roll down the passenger side window. Done.

This causes two things to happen. 

First, the passenger will look out the window and wonder why it's going down. Especially when the weather doesn't warrant an open window.

Second, the pedestrian will take notice and look at the window being rolled down.

What then ensues is a gloriously awkward moment between the passenger and the pedestrian as they stare at each other without any clue as to what is actually happening.

I'd like to start a discussion about the rapist thread, which I see as a serious danger.  In a nutshell:

* Rape is a crime which sometimes hinges directly on feelings of power over the victim.  
* That power often loses its meaning if the victim is unconscious.  Many rapists typically need a victim who knows they are being victimized.  
* This victim is the rapist's audience.  This is crucial.
* The audience gives the rapist pleasure, euphoric delight from unfettered, witnessed suffering.  That euphoria is intense and is possibly driven by the same neurobiology involved in a drug high. 

Now, when Reddit invites rapists to retell their stories, they offer an audience of thousands.  The possibility that individuals reading these stories will be horrified afresh is very appealing to some rapists.  It’s neurobiologically very much like anticipating drug use.

Note:  the audience doesn’t actually need to be horrified.  In the mind of the rapist, the possibility of horrifying an audience is what is appealing.

Ever wonder what makes addicts keep using?  A major factor is the craving that comes from recalling the feelings associated with the pleasurable activity or drug.  Cocaine addicts, active or in recovery, who are asked to think about using cocaine have measurable brain changes precisely when they report cravings.  We haven't actually measured this in rapists, but we suspect it's *highly analogous*.

Thus, the Reddit rape forum is very possibly triggering rape cravings in rapists.  

It is also teaching rapists how to rape better via shared stories, the same way we teach new participants to improve in any field, by sharing our experiences.

I plan to be available to discuss this, so jump in.

Edited at 6:43 pm to eliminate gendered language.  My apologies for insensitivity!  I was pretty anxious when I was writing this, and my bias showed.  Any gender can rape any gender.

Fourth edit, 2:09 pm 31 July:  My point is that speech has power, and it can be dangerous.  I wanted to outline why it might be dangerous in this instance.  Is censorship the answer?  ~~No.  Responsible and accountable speech is the answer.~~  I don't know what the answer is.  That question is in the domains of law and philosophy, for it is a question of values, a question about how the world *ought* to be.  My point is about how the world *is*, and it stands whether or not there is free speech.  Also, yes, I fully agree that rape is a complex phenomenon with multiple motives.  I'm speaking specifically about sadistic, serial rape, which can indeed involve euphoria and the triggering of cravings.  I've made edits above as well to soften the tone.  Also, removed the distracting asterisks.

Fifth edit:  a number of people have requested links to research about rape and rapists.  All links are to free, full-text articles, so you can read in depth if you wish.  Here we go...

* Male rapists in this sample were [1.5x as likely to have been physically violent](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3365003/?tool=pubmed) to a female partner
* Male rape is [2x more likely](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256140/?tool=pubmed) in societies where gender inequity is normalized
* In this sample of 1686 men, 466 had raped a woman, and [251 were multiple rapists](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3247272/?tool=pubmed).  The most common motivation ""stemmed from ideas of sexual entitlement.""
* Men do indeed get raped and they have [enormous difficulty](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067991/?tool=pubmed) disclosing this
* In this sample of 2049 men, [376 reported forced sex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3118408/?tool=pubmed), a finding ""consistent with assessments from Western countries.""

For background info, I did an AMA a while back on travelling around spontaneously with no travel plans (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/w85a6/iama_spontaneous_solo_traveller_ill_take_your/).  I mentioned in that last one I was leaving for another trip in the upcoming week.  

That trip occured this past July, and during it, I decided to hop on a random cruise ship to Croatia where I met this guy. 

We talked and after hearing how I had no place to go when I reached there, he invited me onto his boat/yacht. Over the course of a 2 days, we sailed around the Adriatic Islands on his private boat, drank beer and just talked. After we docked back into the marina, we said our goodbyes and the only contact I had with him was a single email thanking him for his hospitality.

This morning, I received this email. 

I still have no idea how to reply or respond to this, but its shocking to know that even the smallest gesture makes the biggest difference in someone's life.

A buddy and I went to Argentina for two weeks and spent 3 days at Iguazu Falls. If you have never been to Iguazu [here](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=793&amp;q=iguazu+falls&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=iguazu+falls&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.281.3172.0.3656.12.8.0.4.4.1.312.937.2-3j1.4.0...0.0.2PNQmAKuzFY) are pictures to do it some justice.

So we spent a full day at the falls doing the standard touristy trails and boat rides, absolutely breathtaking, and talked to a park ranger about finding a real adventure away from the crowds and he told us about this hike that is about 2-3 miles on a flat path through the rainforest followed by about a mile of downhill switchbacks to a lone gorgeous waterfall that you could swim under. 

The next day we began our journey and all the splendors of the rainforest were out: butterflies of every color, giant golden ants, toucans, camouflaged iguanas within a foot that were 3-4 ft long and much more. It was the one time in life I got why chicks got butterfly tattoos. 

We get to the waterfall and like a dream that came true there is a model photo shoot going on under this gorgeous waterfall. We were like two kids in a candy store with perma Cool-Aid smiles. Its 3 models, camera crew, a park ranger and us. We were in heaven. After playing under the waterfall and swimming in the little pond we were eating lunch.

I look to my buddy and said ""No one is ever going to believe this happened to us"" all he said was ""They are getting naked."" My head whipped around and all 3 were completely nude with the waterfall flowing over their bodies...I love South America. For the next 2 hours we sat there in nirvana.

I will attempt to complete the highest voted tasks to the best of my abilities (IE they take place in destinations I can reach- most major cities worldwide except and almost any US destination, and I don't get an unlucky string of fully booked flights).  **Be sure to say the city your request takes place in.**  Feel free to assign me random adventures where ever you live.

I plan on documenting all this, taking pictures and video at each destination, and am looking to purchase a video camera-- can anyone recommend something lightweight?  Also-- **if anyone else has similar benefits you're welcome to join me for any/all of the journey.** We could take turns filming!

I intend on beginning my journey starting on May 7th and continuing into late July.

I didnt know him very well, and he had no reason to go with me, but we were both happy he did. The girls weren't happy with my choice, but they kept their word and we got a nice show.

Now they want to charge people $5 a month just to use your debit card. Do the math: BofA has 57 million consumer and small-business accounts. If a majority of them uses debit cards, BofA will make about $3 billion a year — or $1 billion more than BofA is currently making from transaction fees.

Having not traveled, I don't know where to start. If you've ever planned a surprise trip for someone, what advice would you give to others? How did your experience go? ",8072,6024,1675,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13vjy0/my_parents_raised_6_kids_nearing_their_60s_and/,"  As said in the title, my parents have worked hard all their lives for their family. We never had really nice stuff but they always gave everything they could while putting off their own desire. I'm the youngest and now in my mid 20s, so my parents should be able to wind down and get ready for retirement, do a bit of travelling, etc. Unfortunately with their financial situation (+11 grandkids to spend money on), that won't be happening. 

  My parents always talked about going on a trip but it's never happened. Dad works for weeks at a time, staying in camps doing 12 hour days and only coming home on (some) long weekends. It makes me sad that he works so hard with no end in sight, so it's the least we can do to show our gratitude for all the love and help they've given us. 

  Originally I was thinking some all-inclusive type package where they can just relax but I'm not sure it's really up their ally. One of my brothers suggested Ireland (we live in Canada) because both sides of the family originate there and I know both of my parents have expressed a desire to see that country over any other.

  Some questions I have are: 

* What is the best way to look for deals on international flights? I know of expedia and that's about it. 

* What kinds of places would you want to stay? What cities are best for travelling? Are there any dangerous places you would recommend avoiding as a tourist?

* Is Christmas a good time to visit a country like Ireland? My sister also suggested their anniversary (in June), which still gives them 6 months to organize themselves but may be tougher for my dad as far as time off work goes. 

Thanks for any help!

I find it is a good way to figure out if you've been making the most of your time.

It doesn't need to be something that will impress everyone, just think about it on a personal level.


EDIT:
Now that I think that this post is just about to reach it's peak I think it is time for me to explain the purpose of this little exercise.

I find that many people that live busy day to day lives often don't have the time nor energy to take a step back and notice the little things that they have done, only focusing on the bigger things that they are about to do. The little steps that are over looked can often make us feel slightly proud of ourselves and can give  the boost that is needed to reach the overall goal, so when looking back on it, we haven't just enjoyed the outcome, but the process as well.

On the other hand, there are people who don't feel like they lead full busy lives. This idea of reflecting on the most positive thing you've done recently gives you a little pat on the back, showing you that you have been doing something no matter how small or insignificant you think it is.

In future if you ever find yourself rushed, anxious or just feeling a bit down and out, just think of this and every single time you do, you will always find a boost in your self worth.

TL:DR: Just think of this occasionally in future.

His advice to the OWS was: 'Stop being against something and start being for something.""   Reddit's thoughts?",9875,7839,2608,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mngiw/i_attended_a_private_function_where_president/,"He was speaking in Ontario.  He is a great speaker and I was very impressed with his speech/interview.

EDIT:  Was quite impressed with all the comments and feedback on here when I woke up this AM.  Even the silly comments.  

Some answers to questions I have received:  Clinton was speaking at the Ontario Economic Summit in Toronto.
At one point he actually said that he feels he should be taxed more.  I'm not sure how this impacts discussions here, but some people seem to think this is a critical fact that is needed.  I don't think it matters myself.

I don't have a transcript or a video and I'm not sure if one will become available, if so I will share.

I'm not opposed to OWS, I'm not for OWS either.  Many people, including Clinton, have a hard time supporting OWS because it isn't entirely clear what OWS stands for.   It is too broad.  

I'm no longer a banker, I work close in the area of public policy, I'm not the government that OWS is opposed to.  I'm FOR distribution of wealth.  Though in my meetings that is not my direct message.  I state problems and offer solutions.  I tackle issues one at a time.  When I worked for a bank, I was NOT the 1%.  It is PART of why I left, not that I was looking to become the 1%, I just didn't agree with the direction the banks are going.  Even the CDN banks.

Clinton IMO was simply offering advice, I don't believe he was speaking out against OWS, in fact I think he wants them to be successful.  I could be wrong, he is a great word smith as some have said.

Another personal opinion:  If I judged you based on your past, specifically a 1-5 key negative elements of your past, would YOUR own advice be valid?  I know I have made some major errors in my past.  I agree Clinton has goofed up royally in the past, but I think he offers a valid point.  Also I feel that because OWS has decentralized itself, it also opens itself up to individuals who may be a little too right wing and they discredit the OWS movement.  i.e. those protesting things like oil in the general sense and are doing it under the OWS movement.  

FOCUS is needed and I personally believe that some sort of centralized publicity needs to take place.  I feel like OWS is trying to speak on our behalf as the 99%, yet I can't support such a disorganized cause that lets many factions speak on my behalf that I don't really agree with.

Anyway, I posted this to open dialogue, that was my only motive.  I'm not saying I'm a Clinton supporter or I'm against OWS, just helping set the stage for discussions on where OWS is going.  Cause I don't know and that makes it hard for me to share my support to them.  In my own town, all OWS has done is provide a home for the homeless, for now.

EDIT 2:  For the purposes of dialoguing the statement, I should have just left out who said it.  I feel like some of you are more concerned with who said it, than the validity of the point.  Great discussions here regardless.  Thanks everyone.  And I wish I could read ALL the comments, but there are far too many now.

Reddit, what random act of kindness motivated you to ""pay it forward""?",17836,15813,6230,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13km6a/when_i_was_14_a_random_guy_saved_me_from_a/,"I was 14 and two girlfriends and I had gone to the theatre in my neighbourhood to see Ghost Rider (my first mistake, I know). We had gone to the 10pm show, so it let out around midnight. It's the only large theatre in the area so it's always filled with moviegoers, but there is very little staff and the hallways are deserted when any movies are in progress. This is all especially true for the late night shows.

When our movie finished, my friends went to the bathroom, as is necessitated by the female movie theatre ritual, and I elected to wait out in the secondary lobby.

That was probably my second mistake.

This theatre, due to its lack of staff, often has more people sneaking into the theatre than people paying for tickets. It is very, very easy to simply waltz in through a side door when another person is walking out. 

I was the only one in the hallway which made me a target for an extremely large, homeless/cracked-out-looking 40+ year old black man (only relevant because I'm pale as fuck and he could *not* pass as my dad). He was built like a truck.

 Generally I'm extremely outgoing and can talk with strangers easily; however, the moment I noticed this fellow approaching, an overwhelming sense of fear washed over me and my brain kept telling me to get out of there fast. My naive 14-year-old self decided to stay where I was, thinking: ""There's no way in hell anything bad could happen to me since I'm obviously invincible to the world. Bad shit only happens in the news. Don't judge a book by its cover, aphrodite_whities! He's probably a lovely guy.""

He approached and asked me if I had any cigarettes. I said no and that I didn't smoke, when he suddenly reached out and grabbed my hand. He stood there shaking my hand saying how he was just dying for a cigarette, increasing his deathgrip every time I tried to pull my hand away. He kept closing the distance between us while strangling my hand and eventually he had me backed into a corner, all the while he keeps fiddling around with something in his pocket (I don't know what it was; he never took that hand out of his pocket the entire time). He kept saying how he wasn't even there to see a movie, just wanted some cigarettes. He was insistent that we go get cigarettes and kept trying to steer me towards the side door.

I was so scared that I was probably on the brink of pissing myself. I looked to see if anyone was around, only to notice my two friends standing outside the bathroom door -- not doing anything while this man was forcing his body onto mine in a public place. They were the only people around and they were just standing there. Understandably, they later said they were confused as to what was happening and didn't know what to do.

Thankfully, a movie lets out right in front of where the man has me trapped. 

Every single person passed by without so much as a second glance. Shit, I thought, I'm gonna get kidnapped. This man wouldn't take his eyes off of mine for a second, and pushed his chest against mine every time I looked around for help. I was too afraid to yell.

Suddenly, a group of three guys (probably only around 15 or 16 years old) came straggling out of the theatre. They didn't notice me at first, but just as they were rounding the corner out of the lobby, one of them turned around and stared at me oddly. He mouthed ""**do you need help?**"", and I nodded as discreetly as I could.

The guy came running up and threw his arm around my shoulders, saying things along the lines of ""thanks for waiting, babe. You ready to go? That was a great movie, huh? I'm glad we went in the end. Who's this guy?!"" The man instantly lets go of my hand, keeping his other hand in his pocket, and backs away quickly, mumbling how he just wanted a cigarette, and then he ran out of the emergency exit at the back of the lobby. 

My guy escorted me outside, and I was in such a state of shock that I think I just hugged him and ran away to my mom who had been waiting in the parking lot. I had been so sure that no one was going to help me, not even my friends, and in such a moment of panic I was really not thinking straight enough to follow the steps I should have (i.e. yell for help). 

Ever since, I've made an effort to make sure I'm aware of my surroundings just in case someone needs help but can't ask. Haven't ""saved"" anyone yet, but only time will tell! The extent of my ""paying it forward"" is saving girls from bad situations at the bar, nothing heroic yet, but hopefully I'll be able to help someone out when they really need it.

So, Reddit, what has a stranger done for you that made you want to pay it forward?

**TL;DR: 14yo me didn't go to the bathroom after a movie, ended up wanting to piss my pants while being harassed by a man in the lobby. Random guy pretended to be my boyfriend, scaring off the creep and potentially saving my life.**

(I also just want to add, in case this guy is a redditor and remembers saving some girl that one time, a sincere thank you. It has haunted me since that night that I never thanked you for what you did. Thank you.)

By the time I realized what was really happening the kid was about 10 feet in front of an armored data tape truck which based on how high the cab is I don't think the driver could have even seen the kid if he was looking.  A girl who looked like she was about 25  stepped into the street and lifted the kid up by the arm and pulled him back onto the curb as the truck skidded to a stop.

I was shocked and impressed, I had watched the whole thing happened and in no way could have responded so quickly.  Well instead of thanking the woman that just stopped her child from dying in front of her the mother went absolutely bonkers.  She started screaming ""How dare you touch my child"" along with a string of obscenities.

Most of you are aware that they troll funerals with the intent of inciting a response. The ""Phelps-Chartered Firm"" is the legal arm of the WBC, located in Kansas.


Here's how we stop it: file a bar complaint with Kansas and get Phelps-Chartered Firm attorneys suspended/disbarred. Take it from a lawyer, a bar complaint is serious business and must be responded to. This is not an issue of whether WBC may express their opinion (they're legally permitted to do so), but whether the attorneys participating in this scheme are acting professionally and ethically. I contend that they are not.


**Step 1**

Print out a [complaint form](http://www.kscourts.org/pdf/complaintform.pdf) and fill out the required information. 


**Step 2**

The most important thing is to make proper allegations. Here's what I've come up with, feel free to submit or modify **(Edit: I would honestly encourage everyone to do their own research and determine if there are any other rules which you believe the Phelps-Chartered Firm violates. My letter is a template, not meant to be copied en masse. If you find the firm's actions disparaging to the profession, inform Kansas of your opinion in your own way.)**:

&gt;*This complaint is against members of the Phelps-Chartered Firm (""The Firm""), located in Kansas. Its members include, but are not limited to, Jonathan B. Phelps, Shirley Phelps Roper, Rachel I. Hockenbarger, Rebeka A. Phelps Davis, Margie J. Phelps. The Firm has violated the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct numerous times and continues to engage in acts which demean the legal profession.*

&gt;*The Firm is the exclusive counsel of the Westboro Baptist Church (""WBC""), with WBC providing the near-total source of work for The Firm. Every member of The Firm is a member of WBC. WBC is engaged in the practice of protesting high profile and military funerals throughout the United States with the purpose of inducing violent reaction against WBC members. The Firm is so closely involved with the operations of the WBC that it is an actual part of the WBC.*

&gt;*Members of The Firm have repeatedly violated Rule 8.4(http://www.kscourts.org/rules/Rule-Info.asp?r1=Rules+Relating+to+Discipline+of+Attorneys&amp;r2=2) of the Kansas Rules of Professional conduct. Members of The Firm have represented their client (WBC) with the knowledge that their client's actions will likely lead to an attempted battery or assault. Members of The Firm have conducted this representation with actual or constructive knowledge that their client's actions will lead others to engage in criminal violence against WBC, in direct violation of 8.4(a).*

&gt;*The Firm provides actual and constructive support of WBC's actions, which adversely reflects on the The Firm and its members' fitness to practice law, in violation of Rule 8.4(g). In addition The Firm's actions violate the Kansas Bar Association's Hallmarks of Professionalism as The Firm diminishes respect for the role of the lawyer in society and fails to respect all persons, regardless of gender, race, or creed.*

&gt;*As stated in the Scope of the Kansas Rules of Professional conduct, ""[t]he Rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. The Rules simply provide a framework for the ethical practice of law."" Members of The Firm have acted unprofessionally, unethically and counseled their clients to induce others to violate the law. To permit their continued ability to practice law in Kansas would be a flagrant disregard of professional guidelines and would put the Kansas legal community into disrepute.*


**Step 3**

Mail this out to:

Office of the Disciplinary Administrator

701 Southwest Jackson, First Floor

Topeka, Kansas 66603


Please be respectful, articulate, and professional. Bar complaints are a serious business and the goal of this is not to inundate the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator with paperwork. The goal is to present reasonable arguments and public support as to why the Phelps-Chartered Firm should not be permitted to practice law in Kansas.

**tl;dr** Make a bar complaint against WBC lawyers with handy instructions provided.

**Just to be clear (because this has been a recurring point brought up): This is NOT an attempt to infringe WBC's free speech. If courts say the 1st Amendment permits them to protest funerals, so be it. I just find attorneys who protest funerals in this manner as unfit to have a license. This is not what attorneys should be known for and it is not how we should act. Model Rules of Professional Conduct exist in every US state and I believe that if this firm doesn't violate the letter of the law, it certainly violates the spirit of it.**",,False,,t5_2qh1i,True,,,True,t3_dl5ol,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dl5ol/i_hope_this_may_help_some_of_you_since_i_see_it/,

I'm male, 27 and have had HIV for 5 years. When I was 22, I moved out from San Diego to Kansas City to be with my boyfriend of 3 years. He just had heart surgery (he is only a year older than I am, it was due to a faulty valve) and wanted to move back home to Kansas City. I followed him and a month later he dumped me. 

I was stranded out here financially and trusted people I shouldn't have. After a couple quick failed relationships, I gave up on love and looked for lust (hey, it was still attention). I went online to find someone to play with, and we played bare, and that's all it took.

I didn't cope well. Most of my close friends backed away or abandoned me at the time. I stopped going to school, quit work, didn't pay the bills, and found myself on the streets. A friend took me in and told me to get my shit together, and I did.

Right now, I'm going to college full time, work in web design full time, been in a relationship for 4 years with someone who is HIV negative, and am taking life one day at a time.

Statistically, I'll die before my friends, but it has made me appreciate life a lot more and enjoy their company. It sucks, but I'm still alive, and that's what counts right? 

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me, went looking online for sex, got HIV. Have had it for 5 years.

EDIT: Couple of things since I've found similar questions being asked, and feel it's best to answer them here.

**What's life like with your HIV negative boyfriend?** It's fine. Small things have to be remembered. When playing with each other, we do things that are low risk. Oral (no swallowing) use condoms, jerk each other off. Those sorts of things. I'm a bottom so it is a very low risk, but low risk doesn't equal no risk. Other than that, when I get injured (I play rugby, and I rock climb) or hurt myself, I have to remind people not to get near my blood if they can avoid it. 

**Why is HIV more prevalent in the gay community?** Many reasons. Mostly that anal sex will usually tear part of the inner walls, causing blood. Those pipes weren't meant for that kind of abuse ultimately. That's why it's such high risk for bottoms. The vagina is a little more resilient, but it's still an exchange of fluids. Nothing is 100%, remember that.

**Why did you have sex without a condom?** Because I was caught up in the moment, didn't want to ruin it, and I'm an idiot.

**Why did I talk about this?** I don't look for sympathy in posting this. I've come to terms pretty easily. It was my fault and I deserve it. I'm doing this so others out there don't feel alone. Though we might have contracted HIV differently, most of us are dealing with the same things. It's good to let others know they're not alone.

EDIT 2: More things I missed

**How do you feel about people who make jokes about HIV/AIDS?** I have no right to complain honestly. I make jokes about it to make it easier, and I've used it to (jokingly) guilt trip someone into small things (""You can't just eat my yoghurt!"" ""But... I'm dying!"" ""God damn it! Fine, you can have it!""). I've also made jokes at the expense of others due to their plights so I'm not sure I have room to complain. Regardless, I've always had a sunny disposition about things so honestly I prefer humour over not talking about things. If you can make me laugh about what's trying to kill me, you must be an alright person. And yes, I laughed at the AIDS song in Team America (because that was a very good parody of RENT).

**Why were you getting tested so often?** Everyone should. If you're sexually active, it's the smartest thing to do. It protects you, and it protects those around you that you play with. I know it may seem a bit odd, but asking people for proof of their last test shouldn't be so damn hard in our society. Between offending someone for asking them for their resent STD test results, or getting HIV because you trusted someone, I'd pick the option that doesn't try to kill me. Get tested, and get the people you know to be tested. Awareness and education about these things are important. It shouldn't just be for the gay community.

**Why don't you fix your title?** I know, I know. I messed it up, and you can't edit titles. This is what I get for rushing the title to get to the body of the post. I've made a horrible mistake :(

LAST EDIT

**Why not do an AMA?** I wanted this to be more about everyone else, and an outlet for them to tell their stories, just in case they felt like no one else would listen to them, and the ability for people to read other's stories. Nothing about me is special. There are plenty of people who have HIV/AIDS, and have just as much if not more to say than I do. I don't feel there's really a demand for it, and since I have no scientific answer, but merely personal ones, I don't see how it would help others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an overwhelming number of positive posts in this thread, and it makes me happy. I appreciate the sentiments. 

For those who just spout of the first hateful thing you can, I'd love to refute the things you say, but it simply isn't worth the time. I don't know you, and you don't know me. It seems it'll stay that way.

For those that shared their stories, I thank you. It isn't always easy, and I appreciate it. For those letting others know they're loved and not alone, thank you. And for those who generally wanted to know more and read this, thank you. You guys are good people.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sadly it's that time for me to pass out, so I won't be able to respond. I hope people keep up the discussion, and keep up the awareness. If this can keep even one person from having to go through the same thing, it was worth it already.

I need your advice reddit. What are my options when dealing with such a big company?,6434,4449,783,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ghal9/mcafee_is_running_a_scam_siteadvisorcom_is_just_a/,"Ok, I run a website design site. On 2009 February, McAfee’s siteadvisor.com flagged one of my sites as “not safe” and anyone with McAfee virus scanner or toolbar is now told it has a virus and is blocked from visiting it (existing users have emailed me daily about this too).

What actually happened is they basically pulled links to all executable files on my hosting. They then run it via their virus scanner with heuristic scanning turned ON. What this basically means is that any file which McAfee scanner ""thinks"" is a virus is now flagged as one. Anyway, so they found a file on my domain and tagged it as virus called “Search threat library”. Their result is based on guesswork because it says on the page: “In our tests, this download contained programs **some people** would consider adware, spyware or other potentially unwanted programs.” Thank you, that’s not vague at all! Now the reason I know this file *cannot* be a virus is because I compiled it myself (with *Delphi*) and was not a public download either.

So, I wrote to them, their support told me they’ll re-scan my website. I waited patiently for weeks but the flag was not removed. Being a small webmaster, I said fuck it and I just deleted the file from my server this time (to a 404 page). Wrote to them again (this was few months ago). They did not even reply this time. I emailed them a few more times to finally get another canned reply that my site will be queued again for scanning. I patiently waited for weeks again but nothing happened. So now I am basically being punished for something I **never** did and a file which *doesn't even exist* on my server for the last six months. 

Then one day it suddenly hit me.. You see the thing is McAfee siteadvisor.com also sells these hacker-safe certificates to websites for $360 / year. With that in picture, this whole fucking thing just makes sense. This is just a ploy to sell those certificates. In internet-speak, this is how it works:

    * Find and flag random files as a generic virus (based on some guesswork scanning)
    * Flag the entire domain for hosting viruses and start blocking visitors to it.
    * Domain owner buys *hacker-safe* certificates for an inane $360/year to get site re-tested.
    * Profit!

My option now is to either buy their $360 hacker-safe badge or keep losing more business everyday.. I’m a small webmaster, even if they turn 10 people away daily, it hurts me bad :( I do not have the resources to hire a lawyer or send them legal notices either.

So, I can buy their stupid certificate but I have been **waiting patiently since 2009 February** to resolve this and being strong armed into buying their stupid certificate after all this time will be so fucking very unfair. So I'm posting here as my last ditch attempt. 

I'm desperate for ideas, Reddit. What are my options? Please help me.. 

**edit:** I can see this on the front page. woohoo! Hopefully someone from McAfee will see it now and reply. Also I don't mind if a blogger wants to contact me for more details to write about this little scam too. I've also emailed all details to *AHhHhh_shit* and he has also been a lot of help. My site has been listed on McAfee ever since 2009 Feb and finally i'm beginning to see some hope that someone will at least hear my case! Thank you again Reddit for being awesome. 

**edit 2:** the editors of two leading tech blogs  just contacted me for details last night (replying now). Also, a lot of people have replied (or PMed me) with their own sites and similar stories which only makes me happy that this is finally getting some attention. I wrote to McAfee again (as per turnipsoup's advise) but it will take two business days before we hear from them. I am amazed with the advice and help Reddit has offered me. I will definitely post an update too if something happens.

**edit 3:** my site is finally green again.. woohoo! reddit did it. Everyone who mailed/contacted McAfee on my behalf thank you! I have waited almost an year for this to happen and you guys did it in less than 2 days. I really can't thank you guys enough for your support.

The List of Real Life Cheat Codes needs an update.,8715,6728,11289,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/un437/its_been_2_years_the_list_of_real_life_cheat/,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c7wby/ok_reddit_lets_make_itthe_list_of_real_life_cheat/) is the original post made by a redditor called Lurial about two years ago.

While those cheats may be awesome, it's about time we got some new ones up there and i'm sure there are more than 30 cheat codes we could all use. I've messaged [Bacongobbler](http://www.reddit.com/user/bacongobbler) - A redditor who makes AmA's into comprehensive, easy to read and straightforward lists about doing the same with the cheat codes so they're easier to read. 

That's about it, I'll start us off:

1. When you go to a restaurant where they bring you your drink in a cup/glass, ask for no ice or for ice on the side. Often what they do is load your drink with ice so that it seems as if there's more in there, especially at bars.

2. When you pour soda, pour it along the side of the cup instead of directly into it - like they do at bars. This keeps alot of the ""fizzyness"" in the drink and as a result, it keeps a lot of the texture and flavor.

3. If you need to withdraw more money than your limit, if you do it quickly enough, you can withdraw your limit twice from the same ATM and sometimes the one next to it before it stops you from withdrawing any more.

Thanks for your submissions!

**EDIT:** Woah! Front page! Bacongobbler replied and said he'd be able to make the list sometime today.

Thanks Again Everyone, these are some awesome cheat codes :D

Reddit, what are some of your most embarrassing medical stories?",13432,11457,5491,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11ofxj/i_was_once_so_constipated_that_the_doctor_had_to/,"It was six years ago when I was eighteen. I had been in my first year of college so needless to say my student diet wasn't that great. My boyfriend and I were house sitting for a friend and on the third night there I was awoken to the most terrible stabbing pain in my stomach. I tried to get to the bathroom but I ended up collapsing on the floor in a near fetal position, barely able to breathe and sweating profusely. My boyfriend hears me fall and gets up to see what is wrong. I can't speak, the pain is so great and I am having a hard time breathing so he painstakingly leads me to our friends car and drives me to the hospital. 

At this point I'm in so much pain from him not really knowing how to drive a stick and jerking and stalling along the way that he has to go in and ask for assistance. I'm loaded onto a gurney and strapped in because the outstretched position nearly kills me with pain and I start lashing out. After the doctor cuts off my clothes and sees no outward injuries on my stomach, he begins to compress on my stomach which nearly makes me pass out. He thinks my appendix must have burst, or that I had a ruptured intestine. I'm administered IV Morphine and finally get some relief. 

They roll me down the hall and take some instagrams of my stomach. To get the X-rays back takes a while, so while we were all awaiting the pics I was administered more morphine. Eventually, a big woman with a Texas accent enters the room and exclaims, ""You're full of shit!""

""What?"" I ask, completely confused and holding my stomach. ""I'm serious. I'm in a lot of pain.""

""Oh, no doubt,"" she said, and pulls out an X-ray of my stomach. ""See all that white in your guts?"" She points with her pen and traces all the way from my anus up through my large intestines. ""You are LITERALLY full of shit. I have never seen someone so full of shit in my life.""

My boyfriend erupts in laughter and the nurse is trying her best to hide her amusement as she has been tending me through the hours and knows that I am obviously in a lot of pain. I groan but am a bit amused myself. It WAS pretty funny, after all. I ask the doctor what they were going to do about it and she said that they were going to do an enema and see how that went. I was given laxatives and a ton of water and told to wait 20 minutes. I can feel my stomach rumbling a bit at this point and it hurts me a lot when it does. 

Eventually a nurse wheels in what looks like a dominatrix sex rack, complete with ankle and wrist straps. My boyfriend again erupts into a fit of laughter. I am not amused this time. I'm starting to get a bit embarrassed so before we begin I ask that he leave. He pretty much begs me to let him stay but I'm having none of it. After he leaves the nurse wheels in what looks to be some sort of futuristic pressure washer; I'm pretty much right. 

She straps my ankles and wrists to the rack in an upright position and proceeds to insert the tube into my ass. It's uncomfortable and cold, but hey, I'm gay so it's like.. whatever. She then turns it on, and like the first mate on the Titanic begins to slowly increase power and pressure. I can feel and SEE my stomach begin to inflate slightly and OH MERCY does it hurt like nothing else. It felt like knives were pushing OUT of me now, ever so slowly. I cry out but she insists ***MORE POWER*** and I keep filling up like a balloon, hollering in agony. After a minute or so of constant pressure she turns it off and tells me to clench up because she was removing the tube. I want nothing more than to do just the opposite, but I assume she knows what she's doing and follow orders. She then attached another tube to a hose and inserts it. This one is MUCH bigger and the lube is cold as fuck, but I'm gay so it's still whatever. 

She then proceeds to Hoover my mother fucking insides. After 30 seconds I hear a ""hmmm"". I ask her what the problem was and she told me nothing was coming out but I beg her not to pressure wash my guts again. At this time the doc comes in as she's pulling out my butt plug and informs me that the shit packed in my colon is too wide in girth to be machine enema'd out. She was going to have to do this manually. 

She has the nurse grab a bucket, a plain white janitors bucket and puts it underneath me. She then puts on the latex gloves, completely lubes up her hands and begins what I consider to be some sort of medical fingerbang to loosen me up. After a while of this (I was trying to keep my mind focused on something other than this butch P.E. teacher-lookin' southern woman giving me assplay legally so I wasn't keeping track of time) she brings out a stretching device and begins to open me with it. At this point I feel so ashamed of myself, but I'm also doped out of my mind. The pain begins to come back in full force and I start shouting for more painkillers but Lady McGuyver down there tells me that they can't administer more because it will stop me up even more. I'm just going to have to deal with it until they can ""unclog me"". So, I endure as I'm being stretched. It hurts like hell down on my asshole, too. I feel her fingers in there and she tells me to push. So, I push. I push so hard that I feel like the blood vessels in my face are popping. My head starts to bang. I'm pushing hard and she's telling me to push more. I must have been screaming my head off. I can't imagine that I wasn't. Finally, I felt something give. She told me to push more and I did I could feel things moving. So, I push some more. After a minute I finally feel myself deflating as water and shit debris tumble out into the bucket. It all happened very quick after that. I was unobstructed and gushing hot lava a minute later and finally felt complete, utter, blissful relief. 

I was told after I woke up in the hospital 8 hours later, around 5 PM, that the doc literally helped deliver my shit child. I had never been more embarrassed in my life. But, as time passes, and my humor ""evolves"", I find myself laughing about it. I changed my diet immediately after and have a good healthy bowel movement at least once a day. I found it strange how my depression lifted a lot after that. I had been severely depressed for a couple of weeks before that and I found out that being constipated does that. 

So, your turn!

**TL;DR** Got severely constipated so much that I had to go to the ER, where enemas and laxatives didn't work. A woman doctor had to crank my asshole open and help me deliver a shit baby with her hands.

1) When she's not around, go check the labels on her shoes, shirts, pants, bra, and underwear. Measure one of her necklaces to see what length she likes. Pocket one of her rings, take it to a jeweler and have them tell you what size it is. Write all of these sizes down.

2) At some point she will ask you to buy tampons for her. It happens. When you go to the store, buy 3 small packages of her brand. Give her one and hide the other two in your car (near the spare tire, she'll never look there). Next time she asks you to buy her some you can just go to the bar and have a beer instead of actually going to the store.

3) Never buy a diamond. Cubic zirconia and moissanite look just as good, and man-made diamonds are getting easier to find every year.

Edit: To clarify #3, there doesn't need to be any deception. It's just stupid to pay $1500 for a worthless rock. Go buy a $300 ring, propose, if she says yes then tell her that you bought a ring with a synthetic stone because you don't enjoy funding civil wars. If you still feel the obligation to verify your love with a poor financial decision, give her a $1200 gift certificate to a bridal store.

Edit2: I thought of another one:  
4) If your SO likes to spoon, but you're not in the mood to cuddle with a thermonuclear device, just follow wreckemtech's handy MS Paint guide to [Faux Spooning](http://imgur.com/2ePio.png).

A few months ago, a form circulated through nearly every major department. We were given no explanation on what this form was for, even when asking managers etc. Their responses were always vague and something along the lines of ""it's for training purposes.""

I tried to politely decline filling out one of these forms which required all kinds of personal information but was told in no uncertain terms ""I had to"" - now I know in a perfect world I would have stuck it to the man, but I have rent to pay and I get dizzy if I don't eat at least twice every 24 hours. First world problems!

Today, the reason we were ""forced"" to sign this form became apparent (to me at least) - a small group of employees from my department were invited into a room to complete the aforementioned ""training.""

Now this training was supposed to have taken place over a period of months - which they illegally back dated all the paper work to reflect. A facilitator was supposed to monitor and observe our competencies and have us complete a number of practical tasks as well as fill out some written short answer questions, multiple choice, standard stuff.

Instead, they had us fraudulently complete the assessments by feeding us the answers, filling in all the sections with competent where the trainer should have, place back dates and numerous other fallacies all over this thing, and then sign, date it and hand it back like it was nothing to worry about.

Here is the kicker, for every hour spent by this imaginary facilitator over the imaginary period of imaginary months, observing us and training us to be competent in this particular area, they are receiving government funding, subsidization and kick backs. 

Now don't get me wrong I know it's pretty commonplace for corporations to make their training ""fool proof"" pad it out and do some spoon feeding. But straight up lying and then making your employees a party to it, all under the guise of something very vague in an environment where major line managers are there and it's unbelievably uncomfortable to be the guy who says ""Hey, something is not right here"" - which I did at stage 1 on multiple occasions only to be shot down is not something anyone should have to endure in a professional environment.

I'm kind of at a loss as to what I should do, am I over reacting and being an asshat about this? I consider myself to be a more or less good person, I value morals, you can sugar coat it and say who cares or whatever but at the end of the day, this is pure and simple.

A massive corporation fraudulently acquiring government kickbacks, which taxpayers then have to foot the bill for, when said company already makes squillions more than necessary for any one to be happy with. I feel like I've been made an accessory to some greedy low act and I am not happy about it.

I don't know whether to try and ask someone about it, I have a feeling that would go badly. I could try to deal with it internally, I also have a feeling that would go very badly, and know from experience that it has for others in the past. Or I could go to an independent watchdog type organization and become a full on whistleblower....

Conflicted, help me reddit, what do? This is not sitting right with me at all.


PS.

Did some very approximate number crunching based on the limited information that I do have for sure, if they did this with all the staff in my department alone which is a small fragment of the total organization, they would stand to gain in excess of $1.7million in tax payer funds.

He was in the Georgia Tech Glee Club, and they were the musical guest on the show. I don't think he's even seen the episode since the original airing in 1969.

I've tried torrents, every video site I know of, CBS.com, Amazon, and I've even tried contacting our local CBS affiliate.

I'm about ready to give up, but I've seen Reddit do amazing things. Maybe someone's great-grandfather was a producer for the show. Maybe someone here has every episode of every talk show ever made pressed into gold-plated LP records for purposes of first-contact with aliens.

I'm not optimistic as I've read that Johnny Carson's Tonight Show has no surviving footage from prior to 1970 (apparently shows used to recycle tape as it was expensive). I fear the same will be true for all but the most famous moments of the Ed Sullivan Show.

Failing that, maybe someone has an awesomely appropriate idea for what might be the next best thing if the video itself is impossible.

Current situation as of 5:15pm

I just got an email from someone reliable who says that they have a copy of this episode and can send it to me! I'm very optimistic that this is legit, but I don't have it in my hands yet.

More to come later on! Thanks again to all of you. I'm looking forward to recapping this to give credit where credit is due and to share some more detail about the cool stuff that came up during this process.

Wooooooo!!!!!!

***keeping this stuff below because it's interesting for those just finding this and because it's not 100% a sure thing yet***

* It would be good if I could know for sure whether or not CBS has a recording somewhere in their archives.

* Even more people saying there's a chance they have/know of a copy.

* Yes, I have successfully spoken with The Paley Center. They do not have the episode and have referred me to SOFA.

* SOFA Entertainment had been brought up before, but I'm convinced now that I'll need to go to them unless one of those back channels comes through somehow. No official organization (CBS, museums, archives, universities, websites, etc.) will give me a copy of the video without SOFA's permission. I've heard this from multiple credible sources now.  I've also been told that they have been rigidly protective of their materials on occasion in the past, but that they are sometimes accommodating. I'm hoping for the latter.

* I have made an inquiry and am awaiting response.

* A few Redditors have said that they may have a back-route to getting a copy through various friends or connections. These leads are very cool and would be typical Reddit magic if one of them comes through.

* A couple of Redditors have provided me with contact info for people at SOFA--one of them had info from a previous successful effort to get a copy of a clip. I have an email in to SOFA now.

* I've gotten helpful responses from a handful of people at various websites and organizations. I'll thank them later when this is all done with.

* A PBS station did some rebroadcasts of Sullivan's shows. I can try to contact WQED to see if they have any of that footage. Someone below said a friend works there, so that's potentially a promising lead.

* Georgia Tech's archives library has responded with a negative. I have emails oustanding with a few others at Georgia Tech who may be in a unique position to know of an unofficial recording somewhere.

""Hmm weird he just did it a second ago"" So the doctor picks the baby up out of the crib and lets go. The baby hits the ground with a sickening thud.

By now Mike is furious. 

""**NO IM SERIOUS HE JUST DID IT A SECOND AGO SEE LOOK**""

And what that, the doctor opens up the window on the fifth floor nursery and slings the baby out the window. The baby boomerangs right into a parked car, shattering the windshield, glass and guts go spraying everywhere.

Just as Mike reaches his arm back to punch the everliving **FUCK** out of the doctor he says 

""Nah man im just messin with ya. It was a stillborn""

1353880990.0,1947,self.AskReddit,13s0o9,*Modpost* - Personal Information and You: Why Zero Tolerance Keeps us all Safer.,12777,10830,1476,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13s0o9/modpost_personal_information_and_you_why_zero/,"Dear lovely AskReddit users,

It's been a little while since our last mod post and that's a testament to how brilliant you guys have been. However, recently we've had an increase in breaking of our most important rule - no personal information. I'll try to keep this short because most of you are brilliant but I just need to cover **why** it's our (and reddit as a whole's) most important rule:

1) Once personal, identifying information is out there, it's out there forever.

2) The potential consequences for the person whose personal information it is are on a completely different level to anything else that could go wrong on reddit.

3) Users and non-users alike have a **right** to their own personal information being protected. Would you want your name and phone number posted for millions of people you don't know to see?

4) In any group big enough, there are going to be people who take things too far or have a different conscience to you. There's a very real possibility that someone sees the information and takes it to a level that you would think abhorrent.

And most importantly

5) Stories on reddit have a life of their own. How many times have we seen someone post a small story that blew up and either ended up being a lie/wrong/one-side of the argument etc? **We have no way of knowing if the story we're hearing is true or not**. When it's a question of whether to upvote someone's questionable story, that's not a huge deal. When it comes to someone having their address posted all over the internet with allegations of a serious crime, it's completely different. 

We had a post get very popular today where a user was claiming that his phone was stolen by a TSA agent and posted (what he claimed to be) the satellite location of his phone. Let's think this through:

* We have no way of knowing if the user lied to get back at someone/cause drama/for a joke etc.

* We have no way of knowing if the user was simply mistaken

* We have no way of knowing if the address is accurate

* We have no way of knowing what would happen if someone tried to be a hero and go over there

* We have no idea  if the user is scamming other redditors

**Personal information takes internet fun and adds very real, real life consequences, often to innocent people**.

**If you see any personal information (address, full names, phone numbers - any attempt to personally identify someone) contact the mods immediately and we will ban those posting it, no questions asked.**


----


FAQs

1) Does this include famous people/public figures/companies/groups etc?

This really depends on what the information is and what the context is. Is there an expectation of privacy? Is the information being used for malicious reasons? If you're desperate to post something and you think it *may* be personal information, simply **message the mods** and ask us. You won't get banned for asking.

2) What about photos?

You are allowed to post photos of yourself (although we always recommend that you don't show your face). The only reason we will ban/remove for a photo is if that photo contains identifiable information in it.

3) Can I post my own information?

We have no way of knowing whether it genuinely is your information or someone else's and it would be impractical to act as the detectives for 2.5 million users. 

4) What about X subreddit?

I'm just a mod for askreddit, I don't have control over other subreddits. However, if the mods of that subreddit have been non-responsive to PI issues, please message the admins. They take it **very** seriously.

**Important note**: There's a difference between mods and admins. Admins run the entire website and get paid to do so. Mods run specific subreddits and have no power outside of their subreddits.

1295802757.0,1936,self.AskReddit,f7kj9,"Do you realize that when you belittle people for asking ""stupid"" questions, you destroy their ability to keep asking questions?",10897,8961,2109,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f7kj9/do_you_realize_that_when_you_belittle_people_for/,"I have posted the gist of this before as a comment, but given my late arrival to the very popular thread about people asking stupid questions and the importance of this issue, I think it deserves a thread in and of itself.

I hate threads that ask about stupid, ignorant questions other people ask. They are belittling and low. Self-congratulatory assholes who snicker and roll their eyes at these people are the reason people stop asking questions: because you make them feel stupid. They're trying to learn something, and you're shitting all over them because you come into the situation with the benefit of having greater prior knowledge than them, or the benefit of a mind better at rational examination.

I'm going to have to paraphrase Carl Sagan here, because I don't know exactly where my copy of The Demon-Haunted World is, but here goes:

&gt; There is no such thing as a stupid question. Many people say that, but it really is true. Every question, no matter how ill-formed or ignorant of knowledge, is a request for knowledge, a request for information. It is an effort to understand better. Every time someone asks an honest question, it is an interrogation of nature, an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe.

Now we're back to me. You assholes are the dicks who drive people away from science. You're the people who consign them to never understanding, because they're afraid of being made fun of for asking the questions they need to ask in order to understand...because when they did try, you laughed at them and made them feel stupid for trying to understand. Nobody wants to feel stupid, and ""better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and remove all doubt."" Many of us condemn the jock and cheerleader stereotypes that made it uncool to enjoy or be good at science or school in general, but you dicks who laugh at the ignorant people are no better.

So go ahead and complain about how stupid your peers are. Weep for your generation or engage in further hyperbolic hyperventilation about how fucked everything is because some of us are dumber. In a very real way, when you laugh at these people and when you masturbate your own intellectual egos over the stupidity of people not so fortunate as you, you make it all worse. 

You are the bane of education. You are the killer of dreams. Someone, at a critical juncture, makes a decision to try to understand and they get _laughed at_. Humiliated. Shamed. All for ... what? Having the audacity to want to understand, or offer a suggestion that seems reasonable to their limited understanding?

Now, of course I am not talking about the class clowns or assholes asking questions to be funny or to be dicks. But any _honestly-asked_ question is what I'm talking about, no matter how silly or ""stupid."" And sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.

Instead of laughing at these people and letting them go through their life unvalidated and their thirst for information suppressed, why don't you recognize that they have a fundamental deficiency of knowledge and that the teacher may not have the ability or inclination to help them fill it. Then _help them yourself_. Just the tiniest bit of validation, even later, can mitigate the embarrassment that he or she feels, and just might result in one less person you would later consider a mindless drone.

tl;dr: Quit being assholes. Don't belittle people who ask a question you think is ignorant and consign them to more ignorance.",,False,,t5_2qh1i,False,,,True,t3_f7kj9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f7kj9/do_you_realize_that_when_you_belittle_people_for/,

I had a friend that spent his summers on research trips in Antarctica every year for 10 or so years. One year, on a hike with colleagues, he was deep in a rocky valley having lunch when someone gasped and pointed, speechless, high above them. As they all turned and squinted up towards the peak on one side of the valley, the silhouette of a tall, but lanky looking tree became clear. 

The group (8 men) went absolutely silent as they all stared. The tree was evidently alive and well, the hue around the tree indicated that it was still green. All of the men digested the sight before leaping up, dropping lunch, coffee - everything - to the ground. Of course this is the biggest breakthrough EVER. There are NO trees on Antarctica, in fact, chances are the last tree to grow on Antarctica was 240-300 million years ago. Every last one of the men (including my friend) agreed to abandon the task at hand and make it a priority to climb the peak, identify the tree, name the likely new species after one of them - or a fancy acronym of all of their names and make goddam history. 

It took 4 hours to climb about 1/3 of the way up. At this point the crumbly face of the peak made it difficult and only four men proceeded with what picks and ropes they had for safe ascent. Luckily, Antarctica in the summer means constant daylight. It took near 13 hours to reach the tree. My friend was one of the four to make the final climb - he described it as one of the hardest of his life (he was a hiker but not much of a climber). He said that on the way up, two others argued (when breath allowed), the guy who spotted the tree had decided that its discovery should be attributed to him - he was passionate about his cause and pretty much turned into an angry man that the other guys didn't even recognise. 

Once they reached the tree, they realised that they had in fact made history. My friend laughed so hard he swore he wet himself a little, as he plonked down at the top of this peak, he wondered, what kind of motherfucker brings an 8 foot plastic tree to Antarctica and what kind of motherfucker climbs 13 hours with an 8 foot plastic tree just to plant it, a good day or twos hike from the nearest hint of civilisation. Whoever it was, he swears it was the funniest damn prank he'd ever fallen for and to this day calls respect on that pranksters dedication.

**td;dr**   Friend in Antarctica is part of group who discovers first tree in Antarctica in several hundred million years. Climbs 13 hours to investigate, discovers tree is plastic and they've just fallen for the most epic but successful prank ever.

To save some time: the ""freedom"" argument is a non-starter, we obviously have many laws to protect the peace and quiet, even in large cities. (I would counter with the ""what if everyone did it?"" argument, and the answer is that cities would be unlivable, full stop).

Also, don't say ""construction noise is just as loud""...that is a necessary evil to build infrastructure, just like ambulance sirens are a necessary evil. Joyriding on a motorcycle isn't necessary in the first place, much less on a super-loud banshee from hell.

First, to be clear, I'm not against motorcycles, just really loud ones.

So far, the top reasons seem to be:

1) Loud pipes save lives

2) Fuck you, that's why

My neighbor had two daughters: 6 and 10 at the time. The 6 year old was my best friend and we played in her front yard mostly because her mother hated noise in the house. One day it was raining so we were playing upstairs. I guess we were too loud, because the mother had the girl go out back and pull a switch from a bush. I came into the kitchen to my friend bent over a chair, getting wailed on with a branch - bloody marks down her back and legs.  Our parents never hit us as kids, so I freaked. I went back upstairs and called 911, as you're told to do in an emergency when you're 7. I told the operator what was happening and he sent a squad car out. Child services visited the house regularly after that. I was never allowed over to play again, and my parents were pissed about having to dip into savings for an after school babysitter.  20 years later, I'm fucking proud of myself for trying to stop a violent attack on a six year old. 

Edit: Wow, thanks to everyone for your stories.  I'm reading through as many as I can, and it's devastating to hear about what some of you went through as kids.  I just called my mom for her input on this story, and she said after I explained the severity of the abuse that they were proud of me for calling the authorities.

10:15pm MST  Title says it all. I GeoIP'ed the ip address and it is somewhere in Denver which is an hour or two away from my house. Ideas? I've never wanted to hit the front page more in my entire life.

10:45pm MST    Update 1: Keylogger installed.

11:10pm MST     Update 2: Computer has been turned off, I hope he turns it back on. I wonder if the Wake-on-LAN feature is enabled?

12:15am MST    Update 3: Señor PoopFace appears to have disabled the keylogger. We are having power outages and this might be the culprit but I am still incredibly suspicious. 

1:07am MST    Update 4: Señor PoopFace did not uninstall the logger.

1:27am MST    Update 5: I have retrieved what appear to be SENORITA PoopFace's myspace credentials. Will report back shortly.

Question: What time do you think is guaranteed they will be asleep. I demand to know within a 95% confidence interval.

2:46am MST Update 6: I took over the computer only to find someone watching Lion King in iTunes at almost 3am. I was quick to black the screen but who knows what they saw of me clicking around. I was able to get the log file that never sent out. Must inspect and find it's secrets. Also stuck Prey on there so I can see when it is safe to take over the computer.


Whoever is using the computer loves internet Backgammon and sucks at Hearts.

3:31am MST Update 7: From what I can tell from the logger, their internet connection is terrible which would explain why the log data never came to my email. I'm all sleuthed out and I'm exhausted. Will post more exciting business tomorrow. Thanks a million everyone. Couldn't have done it without the hivemind!



12:17am (next day) MST update 8: waited for the computer to be inactive for a few hours and then went to work. Router login credentials were admin admin. Awesome. Found SSID and Router MAC. SSID appears to contain their house number, but not street name. I draw ever closer.

Big, stinky update    3:24 pm (next day) MST update 9:  Pipl.com gave an address corresponding with the name from myspace. Going to go cruise by the house and check for the SSID. Will report back soon!

disappointment update     4:45 pm (next day) update 10: Drove by Pipl.com address result. Super super sketchy neighborhood. The house was at the end of a dead end so it looked suspicious enough us driving through there. All the neighbors are out doing hoodrat stuff in street. We made 2 passes and didn't get a hit on the SSID and had to give up before we blew our cover. Called the police department to find out that there are not any detectives in the city that work on the weekends. I was instructed to sit on it until Monday. Dumb.


wardrive update     10:45 pm (day 2) update 11: Have my Alfa awus036h configured with Netstumbler on a laptop. Going in for a night mission and hoping for better results. I borrowed a beater of a car to be a little less conspicuous in the hood. I have high hopes for this mission. If this SSID matches what I have from before, I have an address to give the police.


wardrive #3 update BIG NEWS 6:34 PM (day 3) update 12: I've been outside their house. I know where they live. I will claim what is MINE.



7:23 PM (day 3) update 13: Officer just came to my house and I gave him absolutely everything they could possibly need to know. Times, IP addresses, MAC addresses, SSID, street address, names, phone numbers, ages, DOBs, schools attended, name of homeowner, etc. If this falls apart, someone will be receiving the bitchslap of vengeance and it won't be me.[WAR CAR!](http://imgur.com/4dx7v.jpg)


5:15 PM (day 4) update 14: I am fucking pissed. I left a message this morning for the ONE detective responsible for cyber-crime (read: he's the only one that knows how to turn on a computer). He has yet to call me back. Insanely frustrated at this point. I handed them everything on a silver platter. My best guess is they have a backlog of stuff from the weekends. Because they don't do detective work on the weekends. Wonderful. Calling in favors from family friends tonight. I really wish would be resolved by counting on the police department. Will report back tomorrow.

3:00 AM (day 5) update 16: These turds have changed the background of my computer to a picture of them snuggling and kissing each other. They're using my two 1920x1200 monitors and the picture can't be more than 300x300. Of course, the picture is tiled and pasted on the desktop like 30 times. You know that shit I'm talking about. From the log file, I saw that they opened up My Pictures, looked at some of them, and then started deleting them. One at a time. It took them more than 45 minutes. I don't know if they deleted all of them, and I'm sure I can recover them (they're probably still just sitting the the recycle bin) but their intentions were clear. My blood boils. 

11:00 AM (day 5) update 15: I am no longer pissed. I got a hold of the detective assigned to the case this morning. He is super legit. He had only been handed the case late last evening and hadn't had a chance to look over it. I was able to explain it to him from start to finish over the phone. He sounds like a super nice guy but I still have to document the steps I've taken. He asked me to write up the process in technical and layman's terms in order to prove that I'm competent in this field so if he has to bring it before a judge, my info can be used.


Funny update 6:30 PM (day 5) update 16: I think I just figured out why their internet is terrible. The entire time, my uTorrent has been seeding and choking the shit out of their connection. I have like 40 torrents seeding, and I only have it capped at like 800 KB/s upload. I need to turn it off ASAP.


*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

I wasn't aware that people were checking back often for updates, so here is some of the ridiculous stuff that has happened on my computer.

*They open up iTunes and were sorely disappointed when their search returned no results for 'michal jacsin'

*They don't know what Firefox and Chrome do. I have no idea how they even found Internet Explorer on my computer but they did.

*I just realized my torrents are absolutely choking their internet connection to death

**TL;DR**  I have obtained names and myspace credentials, phone number, and street address for the (suspected) thieves.

**TIL**  Everyone should install LogMeIn and Prey on all of their computers. There is a good possibility they will be responsible for having my computer returned.

**important question** Does anyone know how to search for a house(s) using only the house number and the city, not the street name. Reverse whitepages yielded nothing. **answer** used a few links below and searched every zip code in my city.  No results so  probably  not  an address. 

**question #2** What firmware do you load on a WRT54G in order to wardrive? My first attempt was a failure because I was just using my android phone and a laptop to try to snag the wifi signal. **answer** Laptop with a USB wireless adapter duct taped to the top of my car seemed to work well. Hell yes Wifi Stumbler. **[What a clean install](http://imgur.com/4dx7v.jpg)**

It begins far away from my parents, deep in the woods. 

I was 18 years old. As summer came to a close, I went on a weeklong hiking trip with my girlfriend. We went off the grid, many miles from civilization. There were no designated campsites, running water, etc. We were roughing it. 

Being young and randy, we wanted to have our share of sexytimes, so I brought a sizable stash of condoms. Of course, there were no garbage cans in the middle of the woods. When the deed was done, I had to put the used condoms into a ziplock baggie in my backpack. By the end of our week in the sweltering August sun, that baggie was full and funky.

The trip went well. I returned to my parents' house exactly one day before I had to leave for my sophomore year of college. I was a ridiculous slob. So, using my patented packing style, I hastily dumped my backpack's contents into my bedroom closet, picked through the mess, took what I needed and left the rest.

Yeah. I forgot about the baggie.

But somebody else found it. No, not my parents. My dog.

Basically, my parents came home one day to find used condoms spread all over the living room. Yeah. 

Apparently, my dog had found the baggie, but he didn't just sniff it, or eat it on the spot or whatever. No, he took it downstairs and spread my week-old rubbers and spooge all over the couch and carpet in the living room -- the first room you see when you enter the house. Welcome home, Mom and Dad!

They didn't tell me about it for years, to spare me the embarrassment. When my dad did finally tell me, he was laughing his ass off. But my mother was apparently... not pleased. 

**TL;DR - My childhood dog spread my used condoms all over my parents' living room.**

What do I do?,3524,1609,1513,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aikyj/i_just_got_the_worst_christmas_gift_ever_what_do/,"**Thank you all for your help. See edit 6 for what happened today. I felt this was getting long so I put it at the end. Damn that 10000 chars limit. Original post below:**

So this year has been pretty tranquil for me; I had a promotion, had excellent stock returns and got rid of most of my debts. I, however, got a quite unexpected Christmas gift and am unsure of how to deal with it.

My wife told me she had one gift for me this year: a very special gift. Keep in mind she told me about this in November; between that date and Christmas, we ate, lived and slept together. I would never have expected this.


Her ""only"" gift wasn't expensive furniture, watch or perfume: she had filed divorce paper. Not only that, she watched me open the big box where she put the little letter in front of our two children. We have been married for 12 years. 

She insisted I opened this gift at the end, after all gifts had been opened. At first I thought it was a joke. The form was accompanied with a court date, her asked conditions, as well as a letter from a lawyer she hired, saying she was asking for full custody of our children.

I could barely talk. Nothing had gone particularly wrong and nothing had changed. I had not noticed any change in her attitude, except maybe she looked a bit more tired, but I assumed it was due to the upcoming christmas. She was smiling all the time.

She wouldn't even tell me why she filed for divorce. As a matter of fact, I still do not know. I am now alone, our two children are asleep and she went to celebrate with her family. Yes, all alone on the night of christmas. I am at a loss for words.

I do not know what to do Reddit. Please help me. Why did she file these papers? Why did she play this game, ruining my and our children's christmas? That's not only cruel for me, but for them, as well, which is what I really don't understand. Thank you. It really help just writing the story.


**EDIT6**

Alright here's what happened since yesterday. I took my kids to bed and spend most of the night on Reddit. The FFFFFUUUUUUU, the funny and the pics sections were particularly helpful in passing the long hours. I'd like to thank all redditors for their help and input. They really helped me. This story is not yet getting to a end and I feel my nightmare is only about to begin, but at least now I have an idea where to begin. As I have said in another comment, I normally wouldn't share something so private but with all the incredible support I have gotten, I would feel bad not bringing this matter to an end.

First, the punchline: my wife is currently interned at a mental hospital and the psychiatrist refuses to let her out. It is now 4:30. I am back from a short visit with her, and the psychiatrist evaluating her. She is considered a high-level threat to herself and locked in a small room with a bed. She looked pitiful at best, nothing like the woman I loved, and married. I had a short meeting with the psychiatrist who explained what was happening. He was great in explaining **any legal paper filed in the last month has absolutely no legal value, and that he would testify about it**. That's already a great thing I guess but after all this... Heh. My wife will remain at the hospital until monday where she will get evaluated again. 

For all of those wondering how I could live with her for 12 years and not realize a thing, I would reply I was blind, naive and dumb. Overall these 12 years have been good and I have considered myself ""happy."" I now realize it was all a lie. I fail to realize how exactly I could be so blind. I do remember a couple of particular scenes. This one is at a restaurant - keep in mind we were both pretty normal, she was smiling and happy until I said this line:

ME: This salad is great.

HER: Oh, yeah, right?

ME: What's wrong?

HER: Of course, the restaurant's salad got to be better than the one I make, huh?

ME: No, yours is good too.

HER: You always think everything is better when it's made by another person. Everyone does everything better than me. This salad is better than mine.

ME: I did not say this. Your salad is great. This one is great too.

HER: @£¤@£ YOU! I'M FED UP WITH YOU. I WANT TO GO HOME NOW.

She was seriously mad, I even thought she would hit me. I thought it was just normal behavior or that she was in a bad mood. I didn't think much of it, or of the tons of events that happened after (one time at a Home Depot. ME: I need some rope. Which one do you think is best? HER: I don't know. Take the one I can hang myself with.)

So why here, why now? According to what she has said, my wife believed I was having an affair. It goes further than this, and is EXTREMELY hard for me to believe: **SHE BELIEVES HER KIDS ARE NOT HERS**. Yes,**she believes I made kids with that other woman I was cheating with, a woman that doesn't even exist!** I can barely believe it right now, it's all so sudden and a shock, but that's what she said, black and white, to the psychiatrist evaluating her.  I have a meeting with a psychiatrist monday. I basically have to decide what I will do.

I think the fact she thought I was having an affair really tipped her off. I do realize now I acted a bit suspicious and I blame myself for it. For example I would remain at work later some nights. Once, she almost ""caught"" me when I went out on Friday with some coworkers (I am supposed to get back home and help our children do their homework, and help with chores, and eat with my family) telling her I had too much work and would work late. She did call the office and they told her I was not there and that I ""went out"". I think this, and many years of small events, really tipped her off.

I don't know what to do. I am glad I was able to see through all this but at the same time I feel even stranger. She was pregnant for nine months, two times. We had pictures of her during her pregnancy. All her friends saw her pregnant. Any DNA test will confirm it (not that we should need them). Her name is on the birth certificate, she was admitted at the hospital, she saw her kids every day for years... Why...

I feel betrayed, and horrible. One thing she did was calling the police on me, although she had been kind enough not to tell them the children were in immediate danger. They came here early in the morning (just after I called the first attorney). Thanks to one redditor in particular everything that could potentially compromise me was already out. They came in, asked me if they could talk to me right there, and I accepted. I offered them some coffee (they declined) and told them what happened. They were surprisingly nice. I was fearing a bit the ""my husband is a violent man, I had to ran away"" but nothing of this happened. I showed them the papers, they took some notes, briefly checked around the house (at my request) and went away. I asked them if a medical examination on my children was necessary in case she accused me of domestic violence. They told me it was not necessary at the moment. Later on I called another attorney (who did recommend a medical examination), and deposited everything I had related to this story at his place, including many pages of notes. He listened to my story, took some notes, was very compassionate with me and told me to take it easy, and change the locks if I did not feel safe. We will meet again on Monday. One more thing I should said: after that ""gift"" she went to her parents' house and it wasn't the ""Haha you finally left that dumb husband of yours"" (her parents do not like me very much). It was short, she went to sleep and the next days she was even madder - made threats about cutting herself everywhere, and her family thought it was better to take her away, to professionals. According to the little I've heard she was crying hysterically non-stop. I've only seen her like this a few times, and I thought it had to do with her period.

The hospital called me as a ""relative"" of her. I spoke briefly on the phone and rushed there. I asked if I should bring the kids and the lady on the phone told me ""no"". I would learn a bit later why.

She was in hospital clothes. I barely saw for a minute, if that. She had no interest in seeing me at the moment. She looked tired, sad ... It's hard to explain. The psychiatrist read me about what had happened, gave me some advice, and told me she would need more evaluation. Meh, just thinking about this whole meeting makes me tired. She did say she thought her kids ""weren't hers"". When she was told there were many photographies of her being pregnant, she said it was faked, and that it is all conspired against her. I was cheating on her, she was convinced of it.

Here I am, about to cook again for two kids who might never see ""their"" mother, the mother they knew for years, ever again. I am alone, I feel horrible, and still angry and lost about that night. I wish I could portray her in a better light: she was a wonderful women with whom I felt in love and still loved to this day. She was happy, beautiful, smiling, loved art and sports and a very good mother for all these years. And now it all vanished, perhaps forever.

I am stuck with the choice of stopping all this. Fighting her dirty war. Going on with the divorce  and fighting for full custody. My priority are my kids and I do not want them to suffer more. They had a terrible, sad christmas and they might never recover from it. I lied to them, telling them she was sick but would get better very very soon, but I don't think they believed me. The truth is: I don't have any idea. I'm crying right now while typing this: I have to be strong for them, I guess. I have to choose between staying with her, ""forgiving"" her and going on with that relationship, or quitting her and living my life.

I never saw that coming from a mile. In barely 24 hours I lost everything I had. I have no idea what to do. Thank you for all the support Reddit you've been fantastic.

What was the longest you've waited for karma to kick in?,12087,10174,6174,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/woa29/today_a_racist_man_who_used_to_torment_me_as_a/,"
Tonight a guy walks into my family's convenience store to buy a pack of cigarettes. I know him from my days growing up here. Him and his younger brother used to give me a hard time, they were real bullies, racist types who encouraged others to pick on me and even to turn violent against me. I hated him, and his family, for taking a part of my childhood.

He was unusually friendly tonight, smiling at me and cracking shitty jokes that I smiled politely at but didn't really respond to. He counted his money with his gimp hand, which was partially blown in half (taking several fingers with it) by fireworks that blew up in his hand a few years ago. I gave him his smokes and change, said thanks, and went about my business. 

Before leaving, he stops, hesitates for a moment, and turns around to ask me if there are any job openings at the store. While I had heard him correctly, it's almost as if the words didn't register in my mind, so I asked him to repeat himself. He asks again, 'you wouldn't happen to have any jobs available, would you?' 

I explain that we're sufficiently staffed at the moment, that with my sister and I around for the summer that we wouldn't be needing anyone else to fill in the hours, which were sparse enough as is. I told him to ask again in the fall, when I'd return to Montreal and my sister to university. He said that it was okay, but that he needed something now because he was just left by his wife. He said thanks anyways, and walked out.

Memories of him being a jackass flashed around in my head, and through these a clearer picture began to form. When he had just graduated highschool, his parents broke up in a massive way, leaving a fractured home for his younger siblings to grow up in. Sometime in his life he experienced his hand being blown apart by an explosive. He had amounted to very little, and his marriage was falling apart. And now, he had to come asking for a job from the local nigger he used to make fun of and claim superiority over throughout his life. I'm half white and brown, btw, not black, but to people in this part of the world, if you're not white then you're a chink or a nigger.

It didn't feel good. I should have enjoyed it, but I didn't. While I don't feel bad for him, not in the slightest, I don't feel like any kind of justice was served, or that karma had given him his comeuppance. If the universe is truly neutral towards what is right and wrong, then this was just the way that life played out for someone who did a lot of harm to people in his time. He could have been rich, he could have been powerful, he could have kept the use of both of his hands. But it didn't turn out that way. Karma had nothing to do with it, there was no justice.

What occurred to me is that I'm not at all connected to this place anymore, this village where I grew up, not even to the pain and harsh memories that stayed with me for years. I've become my own person, capable of, at least on some level, sympathizing even with the scum of the universe that tormented my childhood, and to forget about the painful memories that followed me well into my twenties, as echoes from the past. 

I just wanted to share this, because I thought it was interesting.

The cop made an illegal left hand turn without looking, causing Kevin to smash into cop car. The cop gets out of the car and immediately admits fault and asks if everything is okay. Soon thereafter the cop's superiors arrive on the scene and begin having a conversation about how to spin the story to make it look like it was Kevin's fault. All of this (Luckily), audio and video, is caught on the police cruiser's video cam.

So... expecting the police to cover the damages to his bike, because that's all he wanted. Kevin goes into the police station the next day and finds that not only are they not going to cover his damages, but they are now charging him with failing to yield to an emergency vehicle, and are submitting the cost for their damages, to his insurance.

So basically the cops try to flip the story and screw him.... Luckily he manages to get his hands on the police cruiser tape. Which has the full conversations of the cops deciding how to spin the story, and the original officer admitting it was his fault. The cops have since tried to settle and get the story to go away, because there is so much evidence against them. But now Kevin just wants to get the word out about the story, and try to get something actually changed, instead of just taking the cash and shutting up.

So reddit, could you please help me get the word out? Maybe forward the story to others who might be interested, journalist friends, blogs? Any advice or help is appreciated. Thanks!

**EDIT:** People keep asking how he got his hands on the tape: 
From Thebarron00 (Kevin's son Nick.)
&gt;Thanks LeonTrolsky, and thanks you for all the support reddit, I'm Kevin's son Nick.
And in regards to how he got the tape, he learned that whenever the sirens turn on a microphone is enabled. Knowing that there was a recording, he filed a California Public Records Act, and 4 weeks later he had a copy in his mailbox.
Feel free to ask any other questions and I'll answer what I can.

**EDIT 2:** Awesome! Thanks for all the support and help Reddit! We'll continue to answer as many of your questions as we can, and keep you updated on any developments. THANKS!

**EDIT 3:** The cop's siren and lights were on. Yes, but they were flicked on as he begins to make the illegal turn, pulling out in front of a motorcycle going full speed. Kevin tries to stop, but he simply doesn't have time:
&gt;""I came out and -- yeah I didn't see you coming down there -- you know -- either. I turned the lights and siren on up there, and I tried to go slow around the other car but... ""(Cop)

&gt;""I slammed on the brakes,"" interrupted Halliburton (Kevin), ""but if he's coming out there no way I can stop in time.""

&gt;""Yeah . . . no, yeah,"" Froome (Cop) replied, ""I'm sorry.""

**TL;DR** - Friend's Dad was trolled by cops. Cop made an illegal left hand turn without looking, causing Friend's Dad to smash into cop car with his motorcycle. Cop immediately admits he's in the wrong, then his superiors gets there and they spin the story. End up charging Friend's Dad with an offense and trying to make him pay for the accident.

-[Third post, where after all of this drama over our son and shaky marriage, my wife and I separate and I lose my son and dog.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yc7zo/update_i_am_the_father_and_redditor_whose_teenage/) 



To put a long story short, I discovered my teenaged son had sexually abused our family dog, Colby, with a hairbrush and his fingers a few months ago. After I confronted him about it, he confessed, and promised never to do it again, and in return I agreed to keep it between him and I and not tell his mom. 

A while later, I discovered my son reneged on his promise to me, and had abused the dog again. This time I felt I had to bring my wife into the matter, and when I told her, it all blew up in my face. She couldn't believe her son would do that sort of a thing, and she eventually got it into her head somehow that it must have been ME that abused the dog. A short while after telling her about these incidents, we separated, and she wound up with the dog and my son, who when confronted went back and denied that he had ever done anything to the dog, despite admitting to me that he had (and me actually catching him in the act a different time). 

So the last time I updated, I had been living at a friends house while my wife and son (and Colby) stayed at the family house. My wife was somehow convinced that I was the abused of our dog and that I was blaming it on my son (which is maybe the most confusing and infuriating feeling I have ever had). 

I tried calling my son for several days in hope that I could convince him to come clean and help get us on the road to fixing our family. He did not pick up nor did he ever call me back. So about 2 weeks ago I decided to show up at the house when I knew they would all be there. I knocked on the door and my wife would not answer it. 

I admit I kind of lost it and started shouting and pounding on it, and she eventually came outside, where a yelling match ensued between her and I in the front yard. I finally left after she just put her hands over her ears and started yelling ""dog fucker, dog fucker, dog fucker"" over and over again to try to humiliate me in front of the neighborhood. As I walked back to my car fuming I looked back at the house and saw my son staring at me from the second story window with a blank look on his face. I stared at him and shook my head in disappointment, but he didn't change his expression. I have to admit, that really broke my heart &amp; pissed me off. 

So fast forward to just a couple days ago. I am at work, nearing the end of my day, when suddenly my phone rings and it's my wife. I pick it up, and she's sobbing and obviously very upset. She tells me that Colby has bitten my son, and he has gone to the hospital to get stitches. She says Colby bit him in the lower abdomen, 2 times. She doesn't know what to think. Obviously, I know exactly what happened. I could tell she finally knew I was right. Colby would NEVER bite anyone unprovoked, he is an incredibly friendly dog and has no history of biting or being aggressive at all.

When we got off the phone, I felt this rage building inside of me. I felt like it was finally time for this shit to end. Colby had stood up for himself against my son, who had betrayed both of us. I couldn't prove it, but I just *know* my son was abusing the dog again, and I felt responsible for having left him alone with Colby all of these times. It was like Colby finally lashed out in desperation after having nobody there to protect him. I felt sick to my stomach for having abandoned my dog with my kid, who obviously doesn't give a fuck about me or any of us, as long as he can keep getting away with shit. 

I left work and went straight to the family home. This time, my wife answered the door and let me in. I went straight to my sons room, where he was laying down watching TV. He looked at me in surprise and I told him not to talk. I basically said ""I know what you did, you can deny it and you can blame me all you want, but you and I both know what happened. I am taking the dog, and if I ever find out you go near an animal like this again I will report you to the police, I don't care if you are my son. This is disgusting and unfair, and I raised you better"". Obviously I said more than that, but that was the gist of it. He was extremely uncomfortable.

Then I went downstairs and out the back door to get the dog. I put a leash and Colby and walked him back through the house, and my wife stopped me and told me she was sorry. We talked for about 5 minutes, and we both got a little weepy. She asked me to forgive her, which I told her I did. She then invited me to stay at the house, to which I said no. I'm not ready for that, and Colby deserved better, I had already let him down too many times. 

I left her crying in the house, and put Colby in the car. We drove back to my friends place, where I am staying. I've since been looking for a small apartment with a short term lease that accepts dogs, as I have decided that I am not going to move back in with my family. At least not in the immediate future. Colby is finally with me, and is safe, and I need time to think about what our next move should be. I know that asking my friend to house me and now a dog is pushing the bounds of his good grace, so this is what has to happen. 

A lot of you have written to me asking for updates, and I apologize for not getting back to all of you. Mostly, I had no significant changes in the situation until all of this. But I thought you all deserved to know that the dog is safe. 

However, I still do not know what I am going to do about my son &amp; wife. Do you think I should report him as is? The more I think about it, the more I am sure he will probably just do this again. Colby might be safe, but I am still, despite all he's done to me, worried about my son. He is a minor, so legally I am still responsible for him.

So this cute girl was sitting next to me and she was frantically fingering the empty black screen trying to turn it on, I was getting frustrated. I watched her 5 minutes doing the same thing before I made sure she was stupid as a clam and then I reached over to her screen slowly, pressed the 2 inch wide power button with the power mark on it, looked at her eyes and calmly said ""This is how you turn on the system"". She was looking so stupefied that I remember thinking she would probably get an orgasm if I teach her the function of ESC button. Only 2 hours later I realized the screen's brightness was so low that it was seen as black when you look at it from the sides although it was open and running. She was just navigating through menus to choose a movie to watch when I suddenly closed her screen and made my glorious remark.

The mods have been reviewing our rules and have decided to make some small changes to the rules to make them shorter, clearer and reflect how we actually moderate the subreddit. Most of the changes are in clarity but there is one new rule:

&gt; Askreddit is not your personal army or advertising platform. Please do not post questions clearly designed to garner attention for a cause, gain free publicity or publicly shame a person or company. If your post has any other purpose than creating discussion, it will be removed.

We felt that, quite often, people would throw a question on the end when the intention of the post was reaching a lot of people with **their message** and not **starting a discussion**.

Please take some time to look at the other changes ----&gt;

and reply to this post telling us what you think.

Kind Regards,

The Modteam


Edit 1: A lot of people asking for examples so here goes:

The following will **no longer be allowed**:

&gt; X company did Y and Z to me. How can I get the word out about the way they're scamming their customers?

You can see clearly that the question was tacked on at the end as an excuse to fit it into the subreddit. The main intention of the post is to complain about the company and tell as many people as possible. If you **really want to ask a question like that** we almost certainly won't think you're trying to circumvent the system if you simply **leave out the name of the company/person/subreddit** etc.

Edit 2: Protip: You're not the first or last to say ""At least you're not jesus"" to me or some variation.

Edit 3 - **Story posts**: I'm getting a lot of questions about this so I thought I should add an edit. Due to **overwhelming** popularity, we are **not** outlawing story posts. We've asked the sub many times before and it's clear that people want them to remain. Again, our criteria for posts is about whether the OP is asking for opinions/discussion or simply using askreddit as their soapbox. While it's subtle, there is an important difference between the story posts where someone says ""X, Y and Z happened to me, when has X, Y and Z happened to you?"" and ""Company X did Y and Z to me, how do I get the word out?"". The difference is that the story posts is asking for other people's opinions/stories and generating discussion. The company post is clearly just an attempt to spread information.",,False,,t5_2qh1i,1347843790.0,,,True,t3_zzrx4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zzrx4/modpost_small_rule_changes_to_the_subreddit/,moderator

First, some background info. I live in Pennsylvania and you're allowed to (and usually have to) pump your own gas. In New Jersey, it's illegal to pump your own gas.  
  
So, some friends are driving around New Jersey. Said friend is the member of a band and, with him, is the other 3 members of his band, his girlfriend, and another friend. That's 6 people. The car only has seats for 5. So, on a trip to the gas station, one bandmate figures it'd be fun to ride in the trunk.  
  
This guy is a bit crazy in the best way. On the way from the venue to the gas station, while in the trunk, he gets totally naked save for a pink bandana around his neck so he can surprise the shit out of everyone when they get back.  
  
The car arrives at the gas station and, realizing they have to let someone pump their gas, they pull up to a pump and an attendant comes to help them. When he asks my friend to open the door covering the gas valve thingy, with him being used to manually opening it himself (as opposed to using the automatic button inside the car), he fumbles around for the button...  
  
And pops the trunk.  
  
There lays a naked man, who looks a bit like a beardless Jesus, wearing nothing but a pink bandana.  
  
The best part is my friend didn't even realize it was the wrong button. So, the attendant just stands there awkwardly as the guy in the trunk tries to shut the trunk while everyone in the car sits looking bored with straight faces.  
  
So, what do you peoples got?  
  
**EDIT:** I forgot to mention: I told them he should have gotten out of the trunk, walked over, opened the door on the gas thingy, walked back, got back into the trunk, and closed it. Nothing more amazing could have happened.
  
**EDIT:** I made the front page! Woot! The band in the above story, Eye on Attraction, is releasing a new album that you can get [here](http://eyeonattraction.bigcartel.com/product/the-factory-cd).

My own take is that it never does. I'm horribly uneasy when tombs are taken apart and put into museums, and even more uneasy about museum collections of human bones, neatly labelled in drawers. It seems disrespectful.

EDIT: I wasn't expecting this to get so... busy. I've learned a lot about ethics and archaeology, past and present, in different countries and I've enjoyed the very wide range of views, right from bodies don't matter, to the feeling that bodies shouldn't be disturbed, and from the idea that bodies remain sacred as long as their previous inhabitants are remembered, to the idea that burial is unnecessary pollution, as well as the clear distinction many draw between grave-robbing and archaeology at all periods, and those who see no distinction ever.

* When my boyfriend and I shower together, we do a ritual butt-dance. We rub our butts together in an up and down and then side to side fashion and exclaim we're married

* Sometimes when I leave the bedroom after sex, he'll steal a pair of my underwear, hide them somewhere, and when accused will say ""but it's my friend""

* Whenever he bends over, his butt-crack shows a little. I put things in it. My favorite was a drinking straw that I then proceeded to blow into, causing his cheeks to vibrate. We call it the ""reverse fart""


**EDIT**: Wow! Thanks for the response, Reddit! I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. I can't say I'm surprised that butt-dancing is as popular as you have made it out to be. If you haven't yet, I urge you to try it with your loved one, dry *or* soapy.  

On a more serious note, I don't think the weirdness we share is anything to be ashamed of, and like many of you have mentioned, it's these unique secret codes and languages that bring us together. I sincerely hope that anyone out there who hasn't found this with a person (and who wants to) will hold out for someone who can put down the sword and shield, and just be a goof.

I am not necessarily an advocate of increased regulation as a blanket solution, but would, at a minimum, like to see public policy based on an evidence-based reality as opposed to ideology or profit maximization.

When these industry groups deliberately obfuscate the weight of scientific evidence by either attacking legitimate scientists or sowing unjustified doubt in the mass media, they are delaying necessary action that results in avoidable damages. 

I know that civil suits are one way to go about this, but they haven't proven to be particularly effective in a reasonable time frame (it took decades before lawsuits against big tobacco were finally being settled in favor of the plaintiffs, and countless cancer deaths and other related health issues in the interim). 

Are there ways to make these sorts of activities more legally actionable? If so, what would they be? 

What are the implications on Freedom of Speech? 

What mechanisms could be put into place to distinguish between the malicious and the ignorant? 

Is the onus on the public to self-educate? 

I'd like to know what Reddit thinks.

EDIT: I also want to make it clear that the intent is not to stifle opinions I don't agree with by punishing disagreeable thought. What I want to discourage is the deliberate spreading of facts that are demonstrably false with the express purpose of confusing the public and furthering a political or corporate agenda. 

While I understand there are mechanisms (i.e. civil suits or criminal proceedings in the case of deliberate fraud) in place for those rare instances where intent can be proven and harm can be measured, there are many instances of such behavior that goes unpunished, on both ends of the political spectrum. Just because there is insufficient evidence to warrant legal action, it is still wrong. 

Regardless of party affiliation, there should be some accountability, particularly for those who are in positions of power and influence who I believe should be held to a higher standard. Although a government imposed penalty system would be susceptible to abuse and is not likely the right solution, we still need to come up with better ways to change the system in order to encourage due diligence and intellectual integrity amongst those making public statements that can have wide-reaching effects.

I can't express my gratitude enough. This has been an amazingly therapeutic experience, and I can't wait to start putting all of these ideas to good use.

For those interested in sending something, the PO Box address is:

340 E 1st St #3973
Tustin, CA 92780

My Oma's name is Inge. She loves flowers, her house is decorated in a fake French aristocratic style (super gaudy...), and she used to own a cat (I don't know if she likes cats though...). She was a career waitress and she built her house with my grandpa. She's lived in the same village her entire life, but she always loved to travel (or, at least, the idea of traveling). She took a trip to Mallorca once that seems to have been the highlight of her life. She grew up during WWII and if I can get a couple glasses of champagne in her, she'll tell me stories from bygone days.

Postcards, letters, crafts, drawings, etc. will all be forwarded to her there. Feel free to break out the rusty college German and write a quick note if you feel like it. Anything and everything is greatly appreciated (you know, within reason...). I don't want to be picky, but if gifts can remain smallish and lightweight, that would be amazing.

The Internet is an amazing place. I'm so happy to have ""met"" all of you.

Edit: My Oma doesn't have Internet or a computer, so no Reddit for Grandma! Sorry folks!

Edit 2: Lots of people have shown interest in helping me out! If you're interested in sending me something to send to my Oma, please PM me and I'll get you the PO Box address as soon as I set one up on Monday.

Edit 3: A gold star for anyone who can figure out what this edit is about.



Backstory:

So, my dad passed away from colon cancer about three months ago. Since my dad was an only child, my Oma has very few remaining relatives. One relative is a somewhat evil sister that lives right up the street from her, who preceded to chastise my grandmother when she called to tell her that my dad had died). The other remaining relatives are my mother and half-sister, who don't speak German.

I'm trying really hard to be there for my grandmother, but I live in California. I call her every week, but the conversations are starting to get to me: she's so lonely and bored and I think she's really lost the will to live.

Now, I don't have any delusions about how much I can change this situation from abroad. I'll be in Germany next summer, but until then, I was thinking that I might send her a little envelope every day. It could have a picture or a saying or just a ""how ya doin'?"" type of note inside. Since y'all are always so creative, I was thinking maybe you might be able to give me some more unique ideas.

******
Where we are - it appears we have statistical proof of vote flipping in the Primary. Much of the research focuses on South Carolina, but we have extremely suspicious data on most other states as well, though we need to be careful since some states are primaries and others are caucuses, which need to be kept separate, even if both end up being fraudulent.

The basic summary:

1) Romney is always the only benefactor. 

2) There is evidence of vote flipping going back to the 2008 primary.

3) The algorithm(s) being used are rather crude, often basic 1:1 flipping. 

4) Votes are often, but not always, siphoned from a single candidate. This candidate is often Ron Paul, but has also been Gingrich, Santorum, and even Huckabee in 2008.

5) Romney benefits as precincts increase in size, and this increase is algorithmically 'clean' with little or no 'white noise' common to non-altered candidates. For example, we might see a steady 10% rise in Romney's votes from precincts sized 50% to 80%, at which point it increases to a steady 15% (far after any differences in size should matter).

6) Demographics are not at play, though this is the 'debunk' most often brought up by people new to the thread. 
******
A candidate's cumulative score should gradually converge with reducing volatility towards his final result. This is an absolute mathematical law. Romney's score goes there in straight slanted line with no volatility. This is simply entirely impossible in an un-rigged election. 
******
As you are versed into stats, here is what I would consider a mathematical proof of vote rigging. I apologize to our friends who will get a headache out of the analysis.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/znxHc.jpg)

Consider ballots as a random variables. Look how fast small precincts become a powerful predictor of Romney's score: a standard deviation of 0.2% as soon as the second decile, 0,1% in the 3rd!

And then? The mathematically impossible happens:

Romney's score jumps by 1%,

10 times the previous standard deviation,

every decile

FOR AN AVERAGE PRECINCT VOTE SIZE UP ONLY A COUPLE OF DOZENS OF VOTES

Are demographics of 50-vote precincts different from 70-vote precincts? No way.

The impossibly large systematic linear deviation is the mathematical smoking gun.

Look for the telltale sign: Romney's share suddenly climbs in a straight line. Paul sole provider of votes in NV, apparently.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/FHFdS.jpg)

See how undoctored counties exhibit flat lines fast, even with low population?
******

The following argument is mathematically stronger than the previous ones by several orders of magnitude.

Counting votes in a ballot is like taking marbles fron an urn until you've got them all out. Take an urn with 10 marbles, 5 reds 5 blues. You draw the 1st: probability if it being red? 50% Let' say it is red. Pick the second. Probability of being red? 4 reds left in there, so you know it is now 4 chances out of 9.

Now put a 10,000 marbles in there, 1/2 reds 1/2 blues. Pick one. Now make a chart of the cumulative % of the drawn balls that are red. Your first data point on the chart will be 0% or 100%. Draw the second ball. The 2nd data point will be 100% (drawn 2 reds), 50% (1 red, 1 blue) or 0% (no reds). As you know that your final result is 50%, the line will oscillate up and down randomly but rapidly converge towards 50%, something like this:

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/gLrof.jpg)

The mathematical law describing this process is call hypergeometric. It describes in particular the statistics of partial ballot counting! And if you tell me that Romney has got 50% of the votes in that ballot, I can tell you that he needs to be real close that 50% by the time we have counted 90% of the votes, a bit less close at 80%, etc... Poll science shows that 10/20% might suffice for the oscillator to turn into a complete flat line. But maths allow another nice trick as well. If you tell me after 25% of the votes counted what Romney's score is, I can actually tell you the probability that he will get to a score of 50% at the end of the vote tally. Isn't hypergeometry nifty?

As we have seen, Romney's lines do not converge flatly towards the final result. It does not everytime the ballot is relevent to the final outcome. His score starts by oscillating and flattening but then shoots up in a straight line in dozens of counties. That is mathematically impossible.

Let's look at the numbers of Allendale County, SC. 311 votes.

Here is a chart you are now familiar with: Candidate score vs Cumulative votes sorted by ascending vote tally

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/dcGhL.jpg)

Normal patterns, nothing special apparently. Now the hypergeometric distribution allows me to caluclate the following probabilities:

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/XWtXU.jpg)

What does it say? Take Santorum. His final score is 12%. Don't forget: this is not an estimate, it is actual. His cumulative score MUST get there. People in Fairfax No 1 are known for their superior political wisdom. Santorum gets no vote. So 23 votes have been cast. Santorum has only 311-23 votes left to go from his current 0% to 12%. Probabilitity of him getting 0% out of 23 votes cast? Hypergeometry says 5%. But he does very well in the Martin precinct (guys, get a grip, his a fake). His cumulated share of votes goes back to 10%, close to his final score of 12%. The oscillator has sent him close to the final target and the probability of that is high: now 39%. Etc... Gingrich does well early, so he then needs very little to reach his final 52%. The number reflect that. Paul was looking good all the way but is trashed in Fairfax No 2. His odds from reaching the final 7% fall suddenly from 77% to 7%. Romney needed a big last precinct to end up 29%, which he got.

So expect big volatility in the numbers as candidates outperform/underperform locally and oscillate before reaching their final score.

If we plot the last table, we obtain that cute doodle:

X axis cumulative vote, Y axis Probability of having the score X or lower.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/9EzK9.jpg)


When a Y value is at 50%, it mean that the oscillator is currently aligned with the final score. So expect to go across that line frequently. In a real world.

Ok, more example of untampered counties.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/TMlQa.jpg)

Now. Think, Winnie, think. What does it mean to be at 0%. It means that your interim cumulative score is so low that you have no chance to get back up to the final result. On the charts which will follow, 0% is always something like 0.4%, or 0.002%, or 0.0000000000000000001%. Take this one.

[VISUAL](http://imgur.com/RqdEF.jpg)

VOTE FLIPPER ON ALERT !!!

How do I know? Notice a difference with the previous charts? I guessed so. What are the odds when Romney is at 27% with 23% of the votes counted to end up where he did, at 32%? Hypergeometry, a law of the universe, says: 1 out of 267,385,153.

Checkmate.

Edit: for the sticklers, it's ELECTION FRAUD not voter fraud.
******
**As per the Demographic argument**
The crucial evidence being presented is that the vote percentages for Romney are steadily increasing with respect to time, in high-sample districts. This is evidence of vote rigging that is simply not contradicted by:

a) claims of statistical error

b) demographic shifts with respect to time of day

c) unevenly distributed vote tallies
******
Response from the Author of the original thread in response to TribbleTrouble's rebuttal below:

Pb 1: Oh dear... You know the score of 3 candidates so you can deduce the score of the 4th therefore non random variables therefore no hypergeometric function? If I give you the proportion of the red balls, can you deduce the score of the blue ones? Oh yes? Darn. Does it mean that hypergeometry cannot be applied to exhaustive ball sampling anymore? Well it still can. Still struggling big time with the basics, kid. Good luck with that exam.

Pb 2: Again, Romney does not correlate to population headcount, he correlates to RELATIVE population. This will stay beyond 98% of the audience, I have to accept it.

The numbers never ""overestimate Paul's chance of performing well"". I don't have that data. The work analyses the trajectory to the actual final ballot count, never anything else. Very confused student again.

Get Jon Stewart to do an AMA--I will mention this to his executive producer, give him some information about what they are, how much traffic they get and how to contact the /r/IamA mods, probably can't mention it during the interview, but will certainly bring it to his attention if possible backstage. 

2. Mention CISPA--If we get to a natural part of the interview where it makes sense to do this, I will certainly mention it in the interview. 

3. ~~Tell him the Earth is spinning the wrong way~~--thought this was a hilarious idea at first, maybe a great way to end things, but upon further reflection--and the fact that it now has fewer upvotes than the LameMeme recommending I don't do it, I'm going to pass.

4. Look right in the camera just as I'm about to leave and say ""Kendall Gibson, we know what you have done."" so as to make ky1e's brother have a heart attack--not so sure about this one. Wouldn't want to be held liable for an emergency room visit... And there are probably easier ways to cause a heart attack. 

5. Do an AMA afterward--tomorrow is going to be crazy busy because I'm here in NYC (and on the show in the first place) to promote my book, but I'll take lots of pictures and if there's interest, will do one later this week.

Thanks so much everyone!

EDIT II: 

1. Definitely hoping to mention Amendment One in North Carolina.

2. I'm going to mention to a producer that it would be amazing if he'd host a presidential debate. This seems like a way, way, WAY long shot, but goddamit, that would be amazing. 


**EDIT THE THIRD**

Just got back from taping. Didn't manage to mention CISPA during the interview, but gave the producer I worked with a facts sheet and explained that it was basically the latest iteration of SOPA/PIPA and great comedic fodder. She seemed both genuinely interested and unaware of its existence. Hoping this happens. I was really sad we didn't have an opportunity to talk about it naturally, but, as a bunch of people pointed out in the thread, forcing it would have backfired. 

I talked with his personal assistant about an AMA, who said that it sounded like a good opportunity and would pass it directly on to Jon's agent, who makes those kinds of decisions. Obviously there are incredible demands on his time, but I mentioned how much we enjoyed NDT's AMA's and it seems he and Jon are pretty close, so fingers are crossed.

To answer a few recurring questions: 
1. As to what I was doing in the cemetery - This is in my hometown. When I lived there, I walked through this graveyard weekly. I've always loved cemeteries, they are just extremely peaceful and beautiful. Probably the strangest thing about the experience is the fact I've walked the path I found it on countless times. It wasn't there before, I certainly would have noticed. However that stone got underfoot, it got there in the past few months. 
2. No, I didn't keep it. I'm not superstitious, but I wouldn't feel right about taking it. I did move it off the path, and perched it up against a tree.

More discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ueu4j/karmanaut_is_at_it_again_shitty_watercolour/

Edit 1- Thank you Shitty_Watercolour for letting us know your side. Please don't delete your post because it's a weekend and lots of Redditors might be drunk, wasted, or sex-tired and may not be Redditing. They need to hear your side so that they won't just proclaim Karmanaut as anything as they want without justification that indeed you are on the right side of things. People love what you do inasmuch as you love it so don't let others take that away from you. Let your self-expression overpower other's unfair oppression.   

Edit 2- Shitty_Watercolour , if it's worth your time, you can read all the Redditor's response which mostly praises and adores your work. If thousands, if not millions, of strangers rally behind you though it does not affect their life condition in any way, then you know the hivemind's spirit is with you. Hope that is enough to still fuel your drive and motivation to create shitty watercolor paintings.

Edit 3- Does anybody know if it's possible to remove a moderator from a subreddit if majority of the subscribers asks for it? Anybody knows the process? Is it possible?

Edit 4- To those saying what's the point of this or this is just a waste of time, I hope you will realize that there are things that will make us rich and there are those that will make us great. Nobody may give you a plaque or an award or a shitload of karma but you yourself is aware that in one point of Reddit's history, you stood up for someone, in the name of greater good. That is greatness in character. And you don't just get that from anywhere or anyone, you have to earn it.

Edit 5- Let's give Pteraspidomorphi comment some consideration because it actually makes sense: ""I like shitty watercolour as much as the next man, but there is a blatant breach of rediquette going on here. Karmanaut replied to a bunch of comments here and was downvoted, often hundreds of times, effectively censoring his side of the story. What most people are reading here is a one-sided and often inaccurate hivemind pitchfork mob's circlejerk.""

Edit 6- Karmanaut's explanation: http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ueu4j/karmanaut_is_at_it_again_shitty_watercolour/c4uspfq?context=3

Edit 7: According to Karmanaut: Here's the comment in /r/IAmA that led us to discuss his actions and eventually resulted in a ban. If you'll read the comments there, you can see that users were unhappy with him asking for money and reported the comment:  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/toiz6/adam_lakers_carolla_here_ask_me_anything/c4od5ag

Thanks for your suggestions.


EDIT/UPDATE - Wow... Reddit is an amazing community.  I've literally been fighting back tears while pouring through all of the comments and offers for gifts and amazing things for my son... and while I appreciate it, and I know he would LOVE to have a pile of really awesome things, I have to respectfully decline.  This really all started out as just an appeal for suggestions for cheap stuff that he and I could do this weekend that would be memorable and cool, and I'd worry about him getting the wrong idea about gifts, etc.  I hope no one is offended,  I really... really appreciate everything you're all offering, and it makes me immensely happy to know that I'm a part of this amazing community of people.  

Thank you.

So it's looking like we're going to load a couple of his buddies into the car and go paintballing for the day, followed up by a night out camping!  Thank you all for the suggestions... I'm going to take a lot of pictures and share them after the weekend.

In 2001 I was wrongfully accused of a crime I did not commit by an ex-girlfriend who was very angry with me at the time. As a result I plead ‘no contest’ to a charge that now forces me to register as a sex offender. Nearly 12 years later I cannot find an employer that will hire me because of this. I desperately need a job in order to pay my bills and live a normal life.

If you could find it in your heart to hire me I promise to always be hard working and forthright while under your company's management.

He was taken to a small hospital in Millen GA. I was living in Atlanta at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. 
When we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he’d been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room. “Its okay” he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls “I’m the Doctor”.

TL;DR: Local mechanic is also the Doctor

We had about 10 people and had about 5 different tabs which all included an 18% minimum tip.  

The service was terrible, the server was incredibly rude and would always response with some kind of sarcasm when we asked questions about the menu.  He took the wrong drink orders twice and blamed us for getting them wrong.  Brought all the apps and entrees at the same time and got upset when we said we didnt want the apps anymore.   My friend payed in cash and when he brought back change, there was no receipt. she was expecting to see 5 bucks and some change back.  When the server came back there was no receipt and only 4 bucks and change there.  She asked him to see the receipt to see if she had miscalculated cause she expected 5 dollars and then some back.  Instead of saying something along the lines of ill go check or something accommodating like that, the dude got irritated and said that he threw away the receipt and reached for his wallet and said ""how about i just give you a dollar if you want it that bad"".

That pissed us all off so we didnt leave any extra tip.  I wrote down ""NOPE!"" on my receipt in the additional tip line.  when i went to use the men's room before leaving, he tapped my shoulder as i was washing my hands and goes.  U think ur pretty funny with that tip dont you?  why dont we step outside so I can show you how funny i can be?

Im like WTF?  called the manager over and told him her server wanted to fight me cause I didnt tip him. explained the whole situation to her while the dude was just eye fucking me the whole time.  other servers had to calm him down cause he kept trying to interrupt me when i was talking to the manager.  I declined all their gift cards cause fuck i dont wanna come back to a place where the staff is gonna shank me.

Would you support being able to access your vote online in order to confirm your vote was not flipped?,4184,2341,615,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11yftc/reddit_would_you_support_being_able_to_access/,"Here is my idea. What if we were able to access our vote online to make sure our vote was counted and counted correctly?

Obviously our votes still need to remain anonymous. So you wouldn't be able to access your vote using information attached to your person such as SSN or your name and birthdate. Instead, when you vote, you are given a sheet of paper with a randomly generated user name and password. When your vote is counted it is uploaded to a government website where you can log in to check that your vote matches the ballot you turned in. You would also be able to check the individual ballots in any county in your state (or maybe nation wide if all states enact it)

There is no danger of the vote being attached to you unless you give that information up (no different than being issued a bank card when you open a bank account) and the transparency makes it difficult to flip votes because if enough people came forward it would warrant an investigation and possibly a redo election. 

What do you guys think?

EDIT: There seems to be a lot of confusion. I'm not suggesting an online vote counting system. Just an online storage system. All votes would be counted the same. They'd just add the vote to the database when they're done counting it.

What zombie basically amounts to is naked wrestling in the showers after gym class.  They would clog the drains, turn all the showers on hi (so it would be foggy), and turn the lights off and designate a zombie.  The result of this was screaming that could be heard from the gym.  The girls always wanted to know what was going on, and other guys just told them ""you dont want to know.""  Eventually, one of my other friends took a girl in there during the game.  Right as he opened the door, she saw our one friend ""turn"" our other friend into a zombie.  Over her screaming, you can hear they guy yelling, ""IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?!

The long answer is that it was a new feature developed by /u/Deimorz for moderators to implement as a subreddit-wide feature to obscure the vote counts on comments for a predetermined amount of time after their submission.  

The goal of this is to hopefully curtail and minimize the effects of bandwagon voting, both positive and negative.  Highly voted, or lowly voted, comments tend to illicit a knee-jerk vote from people, subconsciously suggesting that the post is better or worse simply because of its score.  We know that's not necessarily the case, but it is true that a top comment after the first hour is likely to remain the top comment for the duration of the post, whether higher quality submissions come in after it or not.

As opposed to 'contest mode' which randomized the sorting and obscured child comments,  hiding the vote score will not affect the sorting and child comments will continue to be displayed as usual. The difference now is net vote difference between submissions will not be visible until the time limit is up, at which point the scores for those comments will appear.  

Ideally this will level the playing field for the first little while of the post few new comments being submitted, and will hopefully discourage piggybacking on top votes for karma or weaker comment making it to the top just because it was there first. Now a comment will more likely be voted on based on its merit and appeal to each user, rather than having its public perception influence its votes.

* Sorting follows how you have it selected (new/controversial/best/top), only the counts are hidden.

* The current time is set for 2 hours, and goes anywhere from 1 minute to 24hours.  It can be tweaked as necessary, which we will likely have to do.

* Unfortunately it's not like the CSS where a user can elect not to apply if if they dislike it, it's a feature of the whole subreddit.

* It is RES-compatible, meaning that even with RES it still obscures the vote count and spread until the time limit is up.

* \*All mobile apps should be effected by in the same way, their display may differ slightly until they catch up to adding a '[score hidden]' type message.

* Bullet point

It'll take some tweaking and refining to get it just right, so we ask for your patience.  Unlike most of the other features,  this one is about as minimally obtrusive as can be. Besides, reddit is supposed to be about the content, not the karma anyways, right?

Any further questions, just ask, and hopefully we'll have answer for you. And keep your eyes peeled in the various 'meta', data-based, and 'theory of' subs, this will likely yield some very interesting studies and posts about the trends observed from this(if you're into that sort of thing).",modpost,False,,t5_2qh1i,1367372204.0,mod-post,,True,t3_1dfnku,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dfnku/why_are_comment_scores_hidden/,moderator

More Details inside.",7730,5890,1692,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1414af/reddit_almost_every_day_some_random_haitian/,"So 3 months ago we bought a house, and signed up for a for a phone/internet/cable bundle, we didn't need the land-line, but whatevs. Anyways, almost immediately started receiving the typical BS telemarketer calls, cruise offers, collection calls for people previously attached to the numbers, etc. However, everyday around 5 o'clock we started getting phone calls from the same number from either a presumably Haitian man and/or woman who speak absolutely no English as far as I can tell. For about two weeks, I tried to explain to them that Madmwazel Pierre didn't live here, it was the wrong number, but every day they keep calling back. 

One day when they called and I was really busy doing laundry so I just put the phone on speaker and gave it to my 2 year old daughter. She reacted to their voice, and started ""talking"" back babbling, laughing and mimicking them. I went in the other room and came back 10 minutes later and they were still on the phone talking to her. Eventually my daughter mashed enough buttons to hang up the phone. 

The next day, they called back, phone went straight to my daughter... This has been going on for about 2 months now. Some days they listen and talk for 20 minutes, most days its only around 5, but they have talked to her for as much as thirty minutes before. During this time, I am able to load the dishwasher, do laundry, pick up the house and use the bathroom. Stuff that is really hard to do with a very active 2 year old.

I don't know who they are, if they are crazy, lonely, old, or really just don't understand that we have no clue who they are. They could be swearing or doing anything I guess, but they really seem harmless. I have become very thankful for the time they spend talking to my daughter. She even seems to look forward to it too and calls them her ""pals"". 

So Reddit, what weird random things are you thankful for or do you look forward to in your life?

I was on YouTube last night, and somehow ended up in the section about gays coming out, reactions, etc. Some of them were really touching, and  I ended up watching every single one known to mankind. I went to bed round eleven, forgetting to log out of the computer. Next thing I know, Im being woken up at 3 in the morning.

I'm incredibly disoriented, trying to figure out whats going on, and she's screaming and shouting in my face. She tells me I have to get out now, and not come back until I'm ""fixed"". I've sorta figured out the plot here, and start telling her the truth: I'm not gay. She doesn't believe me, says now I've lied as well as been gay. She calms down enough to a controlled fury, gives me a string bag with a couple days clothing, and tells me she never wants to talk to me again, unless I  ""do something about this."" Its about 7:30 right now, and I'm at my friends house. Im 15 years old, and as much as I hate being in that homophobic environment, I need my mom to provide for me until I can go to college etc. I tried calling her half an hour ago to tell her again, but she just screamed that I was lying. I dont know what to do. My friends going away soon, so I cant stay here. 
PS: this is a throwaway account for privacy reasons, and also my other account is probably still open on my home computer. The one my mom's got access to. Im not looking for karma, just help.

Anyone have any thing they found out about their parents that makes you want to gouge your eyes out?

Edit: So y'all are in for a treat. I called my mom and explained to her the post I made. I told her that it quickly recieved over 4,000 comments and she was FLATTERED. She says ""Wait 400 comments? 4,000 COMMENTS? About meeeee?!?!"" So she agreed to do an AMA. It won't be tonight because she has to work, but hopefully tomorrow....she needs to call me back. Anyhow, two things:

1.I'm gonna delete some of my comments so she doesn't get offended and get mad at me. 
2.She doesn't live near me and doesn't have a computer so she's gonna call me and be available for an hour or two. I'll post the time when I verify.

I know that evidence of some sort would probably exist, but I think of how briefly civilized humans have been around (7000 years, roughly), and then I think about the vastness of prehistory (350+ million years), and it just seems as if entire civilizations could have existed during that time, without our knowing.

Question:  Can Reddit help me find a home for my 2 kittens in the SF Area? 

Answer:  *A resounding yes!*   

See now, THIS is why I love Reddit.   Please give yourselves pats on the back for being awesome. 

I have genuine offers so I am deleting the plea for help so that I don't get any more. 

Thank you so much to everyone, I am in awe of the outpouring of concern, advice, humor, words of wisdom and help.  

P.S. I don't know if it's the big C or every disease, but I have pages of private PM's offering highly detailed, fervent advice on alternative treatments, diets, medical centers, miracle cures, alternative therapy cancer treatment books, advice that I should take this vitamin or that oil.   Thank you for the very well-meaning information, but I'm a traditional medicine/ hard science kind of girl and I have a good team of doctors that I trust.
