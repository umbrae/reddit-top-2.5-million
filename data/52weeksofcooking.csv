Everyone knows there is a huge variety of things you can do with eggs in terms of cooking. [Some info on cooking eggs](http://whatscookingamerica.net/eggs.htm)

The challenge is to cook 1 or more dishes this week that use eggs as a main ingredient 

If you've never cooked eggs or want to master one of the 
basic ways of preparing them, try something simple like [scrambled eggs](http://www.mrbreakfast.com/article.asp?articleid=17) or [fried eggs](http://gordonhamilton.hubpages.com/hub/how-to-make-the-perfect-fried-egg)

You could explore your creativity by making an interesting omelet.

You could learn the proper technique for making [hard-boiled eggs](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_perfect_hard_boiled_eggs/) that aren't hard to peel or [molding](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS435US435&amp;q=molded+hardboiled+eggs&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=GJ4AT-yZGKisiQLIoJjSDg&amp;biw=1333&amp;bih=674&amp;sei=Gp4AT7P5MuqdiQKSpoCYDQ) them

Some other ideas include [tea eggs](http://appetiteforchina.com/recipes/chinese-tea-eggs/), breakfast burritos/tacos, quiche, putting fried eggs on sandwiches or burgers, making eggs from birds other than a chicken (quail, duck, etc.), or desserts made primarily from eggs such as meringues or egg custards. 


This article by endless simmer on [100 ways to cook an egg](http://www.endlesssimmer.com/2009/04/16/100-ways-to-crack-an-egg/) has a lot of unique other ideas. 

Bonus challenge: make eggs central to a main dinner dish

The point of this thread is to discuss ideas for weekly themes. We want to make a schedule of themes so that we can spend our time each week cooking and discussing photos and recipes rather than debating over the theme for the next week. We can always change things up partway through if necessary. 

h3ather and I have generated a number of ideas but we want to find out what you as participants are interested in.

I see this going a couple potential ways:

1 - having a specific ingredient be the theme each week (e.g. pumpkin, mangos, kale, ginger)

2 - having specific ingredients be themes and also having other types of themes such as cultural dishes (e.g. indian, french), types of dishes(e.g. soup, casserole), cooking styles (e.g. marinades, raw, slow cooking), and other types of inspiration (e.g. holidays, food from books or movies or different time periods)

Let us know what you think!

The idea would be for you to cook 1-2 dishes each week based on the theme and then share pictures and recipes on the subreddit (completely fine to do more or to skip weeks if necessary)

Edit: to clarify, with the second option the theme would sometimes be ingredients and sometimes be other themes (e.g. We won't make you make salmon pie or something like that ;)

We will also try not to be too exclusive, as in requiring very obscure ingredients or utensils",,False,self,t5_2t4i2,True,,thirtyweeks,True,t3_msdh3,http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/msdh3/themes/,

1. Rach11 has decided to step down as a mod, so it's just me and ivydesert at the moment.  If anyone else wants to help out, send me a message!  And thanks to rach11 for doing an awesome job in 2012.

2. Flair:  I'll continue to update people's flair, but instead of me keeping track of the number of week's that everyone has completed, YOU must send me a message when you think you deserve flair.   Note, the consecutive week flair MUST be completed in the week of the challenge to count.  Total weeks can be completed at any time.

You can make anything along the range of authenticity. If you are new to the style, or don't have easy access to ingredients, you can try looking up simplified recipes for dishes you may have had before from restaurants. Here are some [easy recipes]( http://chinesefood.about.com/od/recipesbymeal/u/easy_chinese_recipes.htm ).
If you are experienced with Chinese cooking, try something new, or try to perfect a dish you've made before. 


If you are able to, try buying things from a Chinese market, or at least the international section of your grocery store. 

there are several Chinese food recipes on sites you may already be familiar with (e.g. [allrecipes]( http://allrecipes.com/recipes/world-cuisine/asia/china/ ) or [foodnetwork]( http://www.foodnetwork.com/search/delegate.do?Nr=Record%20Type:Result&amp;N=4294961335&amp;fnSearchString=chinese ))

Feel free to link to more authentic recipes or add any questions or suggestions in the comments. 

I was very impressed with the week 1 submissions, can't wait to see what people do this week!

As a reminder - please title your submissions with the week #

This week we're doing [Appetizers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hors_d%27oeuvre)! aka Hors d'oeuvres. 

This is definitely a category with lots of possibilities. 
Appetizers are meal starters, a first course, or food served during the Cocktail Hour. Sometimes I like to just get a few appetizers at a restaurant and share them rather than get individual entrees. Many of you will probably have some with champagne tonight to ring in the New Year. Will you make some fresh cut [Crudités](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crudit%C3%A9s) or a delicate Amuse-Bouche? Forks are optional!

Here's a [list of recipes](http://www.epicurious.com/tools/browseresults?att=116) to get your juices (or drool) flowing.

Pan Frying is a dry heat cooking method that involves cooking in a pan with minimal oil and sometimes no oil at all.  Pan frying can be mistaken for sauteing, but this [site]( http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/blog/cooking-techniques/saute-pan-fry-and-stir-fry/) explains the difference.

Some foods that pan fry well are fish fillets, pork chops, chicken breast, firm tofu, steak, and firm vegetables (potatoes, onions, etc).  In most cases, the goal of pan frying is to make food with a crisp, golden brown crust and a moist interior.

You have all month to prepare and share photos and recipes of your creations. 

**Note: Please participate actively whenever possible as it will make the subreddit so much better :) This means not only cooking and posting photos but also upvoting and commenting on others' posts.** 



The theme this month is ""Traditional holiday dishes from around the world."" One of the best parts of the holiday season is the amazing meals. These meals vary a lot from family to family and culture to culture. This month we challenge you to cook a holiday dish or dishes from another culture.  

Wikipedia gives a great [list of Christmas dishes from other countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christmas_dishes). You can find recipes by searching for the names of the dishes or perhaps asking advice in this thread :)

There is another good list [here](http://foodlorists.blogspot.com/2008/12/around-world-in-80-traditional.html) that gives names and recipes.

[This site](http://www.theworldwidegourmet.com/traditions/christmas-recipes/) talks more about the traditions related to food in various places.

[More recipes](http://www.whats4eats.com/holidays/christmas-recipes-and-traditions) with some nice pictures.

And of course one of the best parts of Christmas is the [cookies!](http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/christmaseve/a/xmascookies.htm)


Remember to always title your submissions with the week number. So this week we'll just call it Week 0.

Why aren't many people submitting recipes?  It seems like kind of the point of this, right?  To challenge ourselves to make something new and inspire others to try it it.  Over the past 2 weeks I've seen a lot of delicious looking dishes and no recipe to be able to try and make it myself.

So, can we all make an effort to submit with recipes?  I won't be submitting for all 52 weeks, but when I do I'll submit recipes as well.

Thanks!

If not, well, probably not good, but if you do this is the challenge for you! What we're going to do is take one of those things you used to eat as a child (bologna and cheese sandwiches or cereal or whatever kids eat) and recreate it. For instance, I am going to do a deconstructed bologna and cheese sandwich (stealing my own idea here). How is it deconstructed exactly? You'll have to wait and find out. But I'll give you a hint: it involves bread. And bologna. And some cheese. Deconstructed. Those are all of the hints you're going to get. Anyway, your challenge time starts now.

I know some people post their recipes in the comments, but am I missing the secretive post that contains all the recipes for these awesome pictures? I’m sure I can’t be the only one to feel like these pictures are just a tease because I don’t have the recipe to recreate the dish myself. Just thought I’d mention this to help make this a better subreddit. I know I don’t participate by posting my own pictures/recipes, but I still love using this to pick what I’m going to cook up next.

You can use beer, wine, or liquor for this week's dish and if you can't purchase alcohol, the cooking wine in grocery stores is always an option.  
  
There are many dishes, savory and sweet, that can be created with alcohol.  If used correctly, alcohol can bring out many different flavors in food.  It is commonly used in marinades or reduction sauces, but if you're already used to preparing marinades and sauces, challenge yourself to create something unique.  If you're feeling really brave, you can even try a flambe!

Then within that Introduction thread we would love for people to comment with more information, especially for example with the cultural dishes linking to various recipes sources, etc. 

You then have that week to prepare 1 or more dishes according to the week's theme. Make anything! main dishes, sides, desserts, etc and take pretty pictures to share. When sharing pictures and recipes in the subreddit please title them with the week number to help keep things organized. Examples: Week 1: soups - new england clam chowder, Week 2: lamb - spicy lamb skewers. 

The point of this is obviously to encourage people to cook more, so definitely adapt the themes to work for you (e.g. make vegetarian meals or use a similar ingredient if you can't find the recommended one)

People have had a lot of great ideas about the format. In the interest of keeping things simple for people we will probably stick to 1 theme a week (ingredient, cultural, type of dish or cooking technique) rather than try to do too many combinations. Keeping things relatively open-ended will allow the widest participation.

One time I tried to make some lamb shanks in a red wine reduction, but what I ended up with was some Kraft macaroni and cheese and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. If you include bread, that's five ingredients, right?  
  
So, fellow home cooks, I implore you to go out to your, you know, food store or whatever, and buy those five ingredients or pick them from your garden or yard or something and turn those five ingredients into something edible. Or inedible. It doesn't matter to me because I won't be eating it.  
  
Your five ingredients generally doesn't include things like butter, salt, pepper, and oil, but it's totally up to you if you include those things or not.

However, after the suggestion of our newest mod u/LazyG, we've decided to broaden the theme to include the remaining  Nordic countries of Finland, Iceland and Greenland, as well as the Norse territory of Svalbard.

Over the course of history, cultures have been exchanged back and forth over and over through various wars and unions, resulting in few distinct geographic or social distinctions between national cuisines. The staples of cuisine are quite similar throughout much of Scandinavia, evolving from necessity. Early inhabitants of the region lived off the land, foraging for wild mushrooms, berries and greens, hunting local game animals and fishing. Cured, dried, preserved or pickled foods became widely used to ensure that their hard-earned meals would last through the long arctic winters. [Noma](http://noma.dk/), a restaurant celebrating traditional Danish cuisine has ranked among the [best restaurants in the world](http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/) for several years for their use of these traditional techniques and methods.

[Saveur](http://www.saveur.com/article/-/Scandinavian-Recipes) has some great recipes if you're looking for some inspiration. As for me, I'm going to go for Finland. Something about Finland has always really appealed to me. It could be because all of the best metal bands come from Finland, but who really knows for sure? Anyway, I'm sure many cuisines of Scandinavia will inspire everyone to make some great food!

The theme this week is [cheese](http://animalluverclub.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/funny-pictures-mouse-is-in-a-room-full-of-cheese.jpg)! 

I'm quite excited as I am quite addicted to cheese. Cheese is a wonderful ingredient that can be incorporated into any meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and any type of dish (appetizers, sides, main dishes, desserts).  It pairs beautifully with fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, wine, etc. Maybe try something you've never made at home before (mac and cheese, cheesecake, gourmet grilled cheese, broccoli cheese soup, etc.) or something new and exciting!

Here are some links to get you started:

Below will be the flair groups for members of the subreddit that complete x number of weeks in a row.  Each group listed below will have a different flair trophy.  Once you complete the 52 week cooking challenge, you will get to pick the type of flair you want next to your username.  All weeks must be consecutive to receive the flair trophy.  
  
* 5 weeks
* 15 weeks  
* 25 weeks
* 45 weeks  
* 52 weeks  

I will be keeping track of the number of weeks people are completing consecutively, but if I miss giving you a trophy, please don't hesitate to bring it to my attention!

EDIT:
Here is the second list of when trophies will be given out for total # of weeks (either consecutive or not).

Rice is a main staple of Korean cuisine and so are the many side dishes [(banchan)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banchan) served during meals.  More common Korean dishes include [bibimbap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap), [galbi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galbi), [kimchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi), and [bulgogi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi).  And don't forget the [desserts!](http://koreanfood.about.com/od/snacksanddesserts/Korean_Snacks_and_Desserts.htm)


A lot of Korean food can be spicy, but there are many dishes to choose from that don't include that intense flavor.  

Korean food may seem daunting at first, but there are many recipes even for beginners. One of my favorite Korean recipe [sites](http://www.maangchi.com/) even has a [guide](http://www.maangchi.com/guide) for beginners.

Today kicks off Irish Week, which ends on St. Patrick's Day. Planned? Probably :D
I'm from New England, which is populated by many Irish immigrant descendants, so this time of year is pretty big in these parts. Typically I'll go to Boston, get reasonably drunk, and see the Dropkick Murphys. The parades in the major Massachusetts cities are a pretty big deal as well. 


But the best part of March? Corned Beef and Cabbage!!!! I like my cabbage steamed, and served with a malt vinegar. 


Of course there's SO MUCH MORE than just Corned Beef and Cabbage, which is where you guys come in. 
Remember, Irishmen eat what's around them, and that includes fish, lamb, potatoes (introduced in the 16th century), berries and dairy products. 


[Here's the Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_cuisine) and [list of dishes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Irish_dishes)

I have to be honest, I don't know much about tarts. In fact, I thought
they had to do with prostitutes or loose women in general. I don't know
that much about prostitutes or loose women, either. I think it might be
a British thing, but I digress. Or maybe I don't. 
  


Anyway, Wikipedia describes a tart as baked in pastry, but with no
pastry covering. So, I guess it's like a pie. I mean, it sounds like a
pie to me. You know what kind of tarty pie goodness I'm going to make?
I can't say. Tarty pie sounds vaguely dirty, to tell you the truth. I
think you guys should use it in everyday conversation once this week.
I've already used it. See above. I'm leading this game, I think.
Certainly, I am.  
  
I just noticed that Wikipedia also mentions a tarty prostitute or
promiscuous woman.  They are on top of it over there at wikipedia. On top of the
tarty pies.

Coffee is typically used when making desserts, but it can also be used for savory dishes. It is especially great in BBQ sauces, marinades, and rubs because it can be used to bring out the flavor in meat.  
  
When cooking with coffee it can either be used in its brewed form or ground form.  When used in its ground form, it usually takes on the role of a spice and generally has a stronger flavor.

Tomatoes are very versatile in the culinary world and are typically freshest in the summer months.   They have many uses and preparations such as being eaten raw in salads, fried, used in sauces and salsas, the list goes on and on, so you have a lot of leeway this week.

Tomato season in the US is typically mid-July to late August and there are many different types of tomatoes out there.  Fresh tomatoes typically have better flavor than supermarket store bought varieties, but if you can’t get fresh yet in your neck of the woods, the supermarket kind can definitely be dressed up a bit.

Roma type tomatoes are usually best for stewing and sauces, while the big beefsteak varieties are best for raw preparations.  Mini varieties are usually the sweetest and can be used many ways.  If I had to pick a tomato type to use, it’s definitely the mini tomato.  But I have a secret.  I really don’t like tomatoes.  Sure, I like pizza and pasta sauce and all that is made with tomatoes, but I don’t like tomatoes in their whole form.  It’s probably a texture thing.  All those slimy insides.  Crazy, right?!

Some flavors that go well with tomatoes: garlic, basil, oregano, that sounds like the start to a great pasta sauce!  Just remember, tomatoes have a more acidic flavor, so you’ll want something to balance that out in your dish.

And yes, tomatoes are botanically a berry but since they are savory, they are used as a vegetable in the culinary world.

Some ideas to get you going!  As always, feel free to add your input below.

When I was looking up spicy food recipes to include below, I found out January 16th was Spicy Food Day.  Who knew?  We all do now.  We are a couple weeks late, but better late than never right?  Well, only in some cases.  This case might be one.  
  

Anyway, spicy food!  Spicy food is definitely an acquired taste, so this week might be tough for some people.  If you don’t like spicy food, why not focus on a particular spice this week?  It’s your challenge, have fun with it!    


Many different cultures embrace spicy food, so this week might be the week to try a different country’s cuisine.   Spicy food is all about certain spices and quality of the spices.   You can determine the amount of heat you can handle and adjust recipes according to your taste by playing around with the spice combinations/levels.  
  

Here are some recipes to get you started this week!
