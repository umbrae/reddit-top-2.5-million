The idea of fiscal responsibility combined with a liberal view on social issues. The more I learn about Libertarianism, the more I like it. The idea that government should be sleek and efficient instead of being bogged down with bureaucracy. The idea that people are free to make up their own minds and live their lives without being intruded on by the state (so long as they don't do harm to others).

Though I really like the idea of Libertarianism and often like to think of my views as Libertarian leaning, I still haven't been over on some issues. I've brought up these issues in r/Libertarian and have heard their answers, but I'm still not convinced. So I thought I'd see where you stand here at Libertarian Left.

1) I feel that taxation serves an important purpose in society. To call it ""theft"" seems a little ridiculous to me. If anything, the only problem I see with taxation is that it's gotten way too complicated. I feel like having a simplified tax code with less loopholes and deductions, so we know that individuals are actually paying the amount they should be, is the way to go. This way we could have substantially lower rates and still collect revenue. Everyone gives a fair share, society as a whole is better off. Everyone wins.

2) Protecting the environment is more than a property issue. If my neighbor pollutes the hell out of his property that still affects me, even if it doesn't damage my property. Pollution affects the ecosystem, which in turn affects all of us. To me, this is a justified circumstance for the state to intervene, since it constitutes one doing harm to another.

3) I think we could reign in the entitlement system a little for economic and work incentive purposes, but to leave society without ANY sort of safety net seems ridiculous to me. It'd be wonderful if we lived in a charitable society where everyone voluntarily helps one another, but not everyone's like that. My main concern with things like welfare isn't the idea of welfare itself, but in making sure that those who really need it get it, and weeding out the freeloaders. I've known more than a few people who have used their unemployment checks to buy booze, weed, and etc and this just seems like a slap in the face to taxpayers when this money should be going to things like food and shelter.

Both represent some range of business interests. In fact, they can change their positions 180 degrees, and nobody even notices. In the 1984 election, for example, there was actually an issue, which often there isn't. The issue was Keynesian growth versus fiscal conservatism. The Republicans were the party of Keynesian growth: big spending, deficits, and so on. The Democrats were the party of fiscal conservatism: watch the money supply, worry about the deficits, et cetera. Now, I didn't see a single comment pointing out that the two parties had completely reversed their traditional positions. Traditionally, the Democrats are the party of Keynesian growth, and the Republicans the party of fiscal conservatism. So doesn't it strike you that something must have happened? Well, actually, it makes sense. Both parties are essentially the same party. The only question is how coalitions of investors have shifted around on tactical issues now and then. As they do, the parties shift to opposite positions, within a narrow spectrum.""

Much of fundamental science has little to no immediately obvious practical value to a society.  Often, it's only after decades, sometimes centuries that an earlier seemingly purely curiosity motivated discovery leads to a major technological breakthrough.  As an example basically all of modern society is dependent on a set of four equations developed by a Scottish physicist  named James Clark Maxwell, describing the behavior of electromagnetic fields in a vacuum.  These equations were fascinating to other physicists and mathematitions, but at the time had no practical useful purpose that anyone knew of.  They were basically a curiosity.  Even Maxwell never imagined how completely they would change civilization over the next 150 years.

Over the years, the low hanging fruit in fundamental science has mostly all been picked.  Probing any deeper into the fundamental nature of the universe is exorbitantly resource intensive.  Currently private enterprise just doesn't see the value in this kind of research.  Sure they are all over technology driven R&amp;D, but most of that is ultimately dependent on discoveries made in fundamental science years beforehand. Nobody wants to fund fundamental science unless they can see some tangible benefit.  Scientists currently are forced to petition the state for resources and support, and even that is becoming less and less of a real option in many places.

So my questions is, how would fundamental science be perpetuated in a society modeled on libertarian left ideals?  Is it realistic to believe a stateless society could produce the will and resources to build something like the Large Hadron Colider, or an expanded SETI program, Or any number of expensive high tech experiments just to satisfy the curiosity of a few nerds with deep questions?",,False,self,t5_2r54y,1352411859.0,,,True,t3_12v5eg,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/12v5eg/i_am_very_attracted_to_the_left_libertarian/,

I am curious what you think about unions, and what perspectives various strains of the LL have on them.

My personal opinion is that too many unions, though well-intentioned, end up serving the interest of capital by making the wage labor relationship more tolerable for the worker.

Why is this? It seemed everyone was onboard with stopping SOPA and PIPA. Why not CISPA?

If you look at the bills, SOPA, PIPA, and CISPA,it becomes apparent why this CISPA bill has made it so far. SOPA and PIPA were harmful to the large internet moguls. SOPA and PIPA made these private companies responsible to police their entire user base, thus costing these companies time and money. The legislators realized that these large companies had the lobbying power to stop SOPA and PIPA, so they seemed like a lost cause. However, CISPA now gives these companies an almost tyrannical power against its users, this is why so many private companies support it. SOPA and PIPA were hyped up more heavily by the private companies because it harmed these companies, but since CISPA isn't harmful to the private companies, and rather beneficial, it slid under peoples radar.
Your thoughts?

TL;DR SOPA and PIPA were harmful to private companies and was hyped by these companies. CISPA benefits private companies, thus it slid under the radar.",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,,True,t3_swcsc,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/swcsc/cispa_why_it_slipped_under_our_radar/,

I was never an extreme lefty, but I associated to, and agreed with, the left ideology more than with the right.

But then over the past few years, I have found myself going from being a lefty (liberal) to a libertarian and totally skipping the right (conservative).

Has anyone else done this, or is there more of a gradual shift with some time actually being spent as a righty (conservative)

Here are some of the things I believe in...

* Property Rights
* Low taxes (flat tax) **(edit...meant to say ""Low taxes""...removed the 'No or')**
* Gay Rights
* Descriminalized marijuana
* No racism
* No wars
* Personal responsibility
* Climate change (though I don't think we're 100% to blame, but I do think we're affecting things)
* Freedom of religion and Freedom **FROM** religion
* A few other things that I can't think of now, but basically **Live and Let Live** is my motto and no free rides unless you are 100% incapable of fending for yourself

As for some clarity, I'm from Canada so even our right wing is pretty left compared to yours, but here's our party structure...

Center-Right: Conservatives
Center-Left: Liberals
There are others, but I've never associated with any of them

There were a couple of points being made that I think we should all be more cognizant of making, as well as other flavours of libertarianism. One thing to remember is that whether a government takes our wealth or a private elite or banker takes the money, it's still a tax - just that private individuals are usually more of a kleptocracy than a government is.

Blaming countries isn't really the issue and countries themselves aren't necessarily anyone's enemy:

&gt;But these days, “offshore” wealth is virtual—Henry describes “nominal, hyper-portable, multi-jurisdictional, often quite temporary locations of networks of legal and quasi-legal entities and arrangements.” A company may be located in one jurisdiction, but it is owned by a trust located elsewhere, and administered by trustees in a third location. “Ultimately, then, the term 'offshore' refers to a set of capabilities,” rather than to a place or multiple places.

Who are responsible?

&gt;“From banks to accountancy firms and corporate lawyers, some of the biggest businesses in the world are part of the fabric of global tax avoidance,” writes financial researcher (and former Goldman Sachs trader) Lydia Prieg in The Guardian. “These companies are not moral entities that we can shame into paying their fair share; they exist to maximize their profits and those of their clients.”

I especially would like to underscore the part about corporations not being moral entities. In fact, that's something to remember when it comes to co-ops and credit unions. They *must* be moral entities to some degree. And when it comes to these large banks, we are no longer capable of stopping or regulating them without government intervention. At this point it's an abstract or an idea. Who do you go after? Some rich guy? Bank employees?

Inequality is a political choice:

&gt;Inequality has already been skyrocketing around the world, by the measures we currently use. If the top 1 percent in the US don't own just 35.6 percent of the wealth, for instance, but a much larger chunk that's hidden away somewhere, what does it mean for us? Don't forget, as the report notes, that “inequality is a political choice”--that we determine what to do as a society based on the amount of inequality we think is tolerable or just. If that number is far greater than we think, how is that skewing our priorities? Many Americans are already misinformed about our level of inequality—but this report confirms that even supposed experts were wildly underestimating the problem.

This is particularly interesting because it shows how skimming of wealth and productivity has left us in a system of inequity that isn't some ""oh those poor people"" bleeding-heart kind of stuff, but simple theft. If certain people have extracted the capital necessary for society to survive, we're broken. If they loan it back to us, that's immoral. If they won't loan it back to us, that's even more immoral. Government does share some of the blame for spending beyond it's means, but it's sort of a moot argument when there's a literal drought of capital. 

Finally, I won't quote all of #6, but the point shouldn't be tax the ill-gotten gains. It should be to reclaim the money. Essentially this is theft. We gave the banks a bailout. These banks and people took our money. They were supposed to re-invest in society and the taxpayer. That's why the bailout was so insidious. It truly was taxing the 99% to give money to the 1%. Wanting to tax them is irrelevant. We shouldn't even be talking about it. We should be seizing our assets from them.",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,,True,t3_xlkkt,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/xlkkt/good_article_from_rgreed_with_some_interesting/,

Why do we hold the 2nd amendment so precious that we accept the occasional 'broken egg' for the larger sake of freedom, but other amendments somehow doesn't deserve this level of vigilance?

This is really ironic to me, especially because the founders granted us the right to bear arms as a means to protect freedom and as a hedge against tyranny.

Where is the NRA and the gun lobby in the wake of systematic groping and invasive scanning in our airports? Where are they when illegal highway checkpoints are now performed within our borders? Where are the gun lovers when our government decided to begin wholesale spying on its own people?

I'm an odd bird in that I am a liberal who supports the 2nd amendment. I have no love of guns. But I love freedom. The Constitution gave us the right to bear arms to protect that freedom from tyranny or invasion. Implicit in that right is responsibility.

If gun owners are just going to use their guns to target shoot, hunt, kill burglars and muggers, and let their kids engage in mass-slayings, but not to defend against tyranny, why should I maintain my support? If the NRA is just going to act as a lobby for another penis-extension industry, alongside Viagra and sportscars, why should they have my sympathy?

The founders didn't really care enough about hunting/target-shooting/killing-burglars enough to grant a Constitutional amendment. There was a higher calling in mind. But when will our 'militias' answer the call?

The NRA can and should immerse itself in every issue infringing on the Bill of Rights, since the right to bear arms is there expressly to protect freedom. If gun-owners aren't going to be down with the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th &amp; 10th amendments, then how am I supposed to support the 2nd?

If I am starting to see that my peers don't actually value freedom, but rather only guns themselves, then I wonder if I should start fighting to get rid of guns. We're getting nothing for it.

TL;DR: If the 2nd amendment is to guard against tyranny, then why have the gun-owning population and organizations like the NRA had no response to the rise of the police state in the last decade?

We talked for a couple hours on the subject, and he seems like a libertarian in the making. He asked me for some books so he can start researching. I am a libertarian, but definitely a right leaning one. He on the other hand seems more left leaning. I only know good authors that are right leaning and I don't want to turn him off. I was wondering if you guys could hook me up with some authors for the libertarian left. He seems interested in issues like the NDAA, CISPA, and the war industrial complex. Also any websites that are good for general political information would be helpful to. 
Thankyou guys  

Edit: Sorry guys I don't have much of an update. I have not seen him since we had our small chat on politics (it lasted about two hours). But thank you very much for your responses.

Mind you, I am a market anarchist, I used to be Socialist (and before that I was a Democrat). This really appealed to me in that it promoted freedom of choice while also arguing for adopting (in my opinion) excellent morals. It's great. I used to have these morals, but after switching to an-cap, I became more philosophical and jaded. Everything was an abstract and societal injustice didn't seem as real to me because I kind of withdrew from the main of society. I think this had a lot to do with feeling isolated (nobody where I live, including family and former friends) take my views of anarchism seriously. A lot of people here are statist liberals. 

Reading this, I was reminded that people are still struggling and impoverished, and I need to care more and do more to help. I've been volunteering at 211, but I got into it mainly for work experience (since I'm have extreme difficulty finding employment). Now, I'm really happy to be a part of something that can help people help themselves.

I want to give America a liberty upgrade. How? By handing out a series of striking pamphlets on the most pressing issues of the day to people across America from July through October.

Around 20 people have already joined the project, as researchers, editors, distributors and donors. The first two pamphlets are done (on liberty and education). The third pamphlet (on corporations) is written but not yet designed.

We are running short on funds and we need more distributors. See here for more information:

http://www.indiegogo.com/commonsense

I expect a lot of great things to come out of this, like:

* people saying ""D'oh! Now I get liberty.""
* more resistance to authoritarianism
* more libertarians getting elected to office
* mainstream media coverage for the people involved
* it could even pave the way for a Ron Paul or Gary Johnson win

Be a part of this pioneering project! Join us as a researcher, editor, distributor in your local community, donor or just by sharing it with your friends.

Join this revolutionary project as we set the stage for a more libertarian 2012!

I believe the gov't needs to back WAY the hell out of daily life, so in that regard, I have that in common with most Libertarians.

Where I'm slightly confused, is in economic policy. I'm of the mindset that we cannot trust businesses to serve anyone but themselves, and thus we need to put up enough regulation to make sure they're not doing anything harmful to the general population.

I think Teddy Roosevelt said it best: ""We demand that big business give the people a square deal; in return we must insist that when anyone engaged in big business honestly endeavors to do right he shall himself be given a square deal.""

As for the super rich and taxes, I'm mostly against income and sales taxes, I think if we want to prevent anyone from accumulating too much wealth, and therefore too much power (although I believe money should not give any one person or entity more political power than another) we should have things like luxury, property, estate, and inheritance taxes instead. In that way, we can still tax the general population a bit, but not based on their work, or what they're day-to-day purchases are, only on things that are excessive, or an unproductive use of money. I'm also for taxing more heavily those that only use their money to make more money, in addition to the aforementioned things. Too many wealthy in this country make their money by not doing any work at all, they simply exploit the system for all its worth.

Where does that ultimately put me?",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,,True,t3_gjy6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/gjy6n/am_i_a_libertarian_leftist/,

For years, I considered myself a right libertarianism, though always of the minarchist persuasion, rather than the absurd anarcho-capitalist drivel regurgitated by Rothbardian. (If I had to pick a stateless variant of left-libertarianism to endorse, I would more than likely go with mutualism, but I don't know if that will help with the topic I want to discuss.)

My journey to becoming a left-libertarian initially started with my belief that a society has an obligation to inform its members about virtually every economic decision as much as possible. So while right libertarians would rather burn down the house and with it, I have always been reluctant to do so, due to my belief that the FDA, SEC, FEC, et al. perform valuable functions that help to mitigate the effects of *caveat emptor*.

Over the last several months, I've slowly expanded this point of view and added to it a firm belief in the distinction between personal and private property, as well as one in positive rights, not just negative rights. After all, isn't ""freedom to"" just as important as ""freedom from""?
So, with this in mind, I began to justify more of a social democratic welfare state than most right libertarians endorse. This includes a universal (or in my preference, single-payer) healthcare system.

As I know there are several possible models for this to be implemented, depending on whether the society in question is stateless or not, I would specify I am talking about a society that still has some semblance of a state.

I have convinced myself that single-payer is the most efficient means of healthcare for all... but what I'm running into is something I have not been able to get around and I have no urge to get around either. And that is the notion that of the implicit social obligation in any form of universal healthcare: **if you benefit from the system, then some would say society is justified in applying paternalistic measures in order to modify your behavior/lifestyle to enhance the efficiency of said system**.

And I still don't agree with that. This basically means that things like sin taxes, whether they be on drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and as it's looking like now-- fast food -- are immoral in my view. And it seems this one view is preventing me from continuing further with this entitlement logic.

So I put it to you guys like this:

* Can these views be reconciled together? Does it make a difference if they are or not?

* If not, how do left libertarians justify social engineering by any means (state or stateless) in order to get its members to fulfill their obligations? I still understand it to be force, regardless of what its source is.

* If left libertarians do not justify anything of this sort, then what kind of other solution would take a similar approach without the specter of compulsory social engineering? 

I want to thank you for any answers you all have. I'm not entirely sure if this is the right subreddit (I'm sure you could make a good argument it should be in /r/socialdemocracy) but I still wanted to see what everyone's take on this issue was, from the vantage point of anarchists, communists, syndicalists, mutualists, etc?",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,,True,t3_10ak2a,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/10ak2a/help_me_reconcile_my_views_on_universal_healthcare/,

* I think that taxation should generally be low for all, but times of a true crisis could see an increase in taxation.


* I think most governmental issues should be handled locally by however they see fit, but having a base of federal, democratically elected guidelines is not an inherently immoral. With that in mind however, any sort of federal elected authority should be given only the bare minimum of power, just enough to fulfill its duty.   


* Business' should be allowed a wide range of freedoms, like any collection of citizens, but they are not inherently above the law. Democratically approved restrictions (food sanitation, etc.) are not inherently immoral. 


* A loosely restricted free-market economy.


* A classical liberal stance on government power

A constant state of inflation robs savers to favor borrowers.  Grandma on a fixed income sees her buying power reduced while Mr. Elite Business man gets to payback enormous loans with cheaper dollars.  For this sub, you could couche it in a workers-vs-owner context.

In addition, fractional reserve banking compounds this problem by increasing the money supply further.

Not a very free market, huh?).  

What we have today in the United States and countries are [areas where local currencies have been produced with some success,](http://gtne.org/?q=theme/38) but their voluntary usage is constrained by the fact that state-level taxes can only be paid in US Dollars.  Perhaps a social and political campaign could be started to publish to have certain local currencies, and/or new ones, to be accepted at the state and Local level **as taxes**.  I'm sure a gradual process of socioeconomic change could be started from there.

I come from a lefty-socialist family in Europe. We are not really hardcore socialist, just suporters of the main party here, wich is suposed to be socialist, but hardcore socialist/comunist will say they are not. I followed politics before, but now I realize I knew nothing.

I discovered Ron Paul in YT and had a great impact on me. Monetary policy hooked me, and I have been studying Austrian Economics since then. Now, I have some novice questions about left-libertarianism. Very basic probably.

- Is left-libertarianism only socialist-anarchist and anarco-capitalist, or there is left-minarchist or something similar? I guess the answer is there arent.

- I am all for free markets (well, I am ok with some regulations at local level) but the land issue makes me wonder. I dont like the idea of Henry George of taxing the land. I believe anybody should be able to use their land as they wish once they own it, without having to pay rent to no one, so if some comunities want to stablish themselves they can (like hippie or any kind of comunity). Also, I have read a little about the mutualist idea that use of the land gives the property. But they say that you have to use it yourself personally. I dont see that as very practical and I dont see that kind of arrangement happening in real life. Are there any other type of philosopy or ideas, specially practical (not so much moral) about land?

- Finally, any thoughs and ideas about left-libertarianism are very wellcome since I am now moving a bit into more political stuff after reserching for a year and a half a lot about economics.",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,,True,t3_9wpvj,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/9wpvj/exsocialist_now_ron_paul_converted_questions/,

So how can a libertarian be the opposite of itself by being (left or economic authoritarian) libertarian? Anyone care to explain? Isnt that just what communism is?


Anyway, another thing I want to know, do ''left libertarian'' beleive in the none-initiation of force? Because I think thats what makes you a libertarian... And from what I read I dont think your hero Noam Chumpsky is... Anyone can explain?


On economics... do Left libertarian beleive in austrian or kenz economic? Do you guys beleive in sound money or fiat money?

2) The Industrial Revolution produced horrible conditions for some laborers (and continues to do so). In the West, public ethics have come somewhat dictated that the law should prevent terrible labor conditions from existing (though the West doesn't have as much of a problem with using unethical labor from other countries). So do you think a less regulated economy could fix  this? If so, how?

3) In the notion of ""greening"" our society, does a less regulated economy truly  help us to get to a sustainable society? I understand that some corporate interests have used the state to protect their interests, so I agree on that aspect, but I have some doubts as to whether or not an unregulated economy could really bring about the change that we need.

I'm not trying to ask these questions in a hostile tone, I genuinely want to know. I'm somewhat ambivalent at this point to more government regulation or not. I feel like I keep reading about the state being used by corporations and NOT to ensure the ""free market"". At this point I support a more socialist approach to society, if it could be run correctly and efficiently. However, I'm getting critical of this aspect.

Do I belong here or somewhere else?,5,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/13xaeq/libertarian_who_has_recently_moved_away_from/,"I've been identifying myself with the tradition Libertarian party in America for about 6 or 7 years, and have been lead to believe that ""Free-Market Capitalism"" would lead to an end to Corporatism and the Plutocracy in control of it.

As of late, I've been doing a lot of research on Anarchism as a result of my first visit to the /r/Anarchism subreddit and my state of bafflement as to how they believed that ""Socialism"" was the only true economic system in an Anarchist society. I always thought that the only viable form of Anarchism would be Anarcho-Capitalism, and that Socialist Anarchists were just idiots, since I always followed the media's presentation of the definition of Socialism as a nanny-state that sees free markets as evil and immoral, and a bunch of other bullshit that I couldn't agree with. After reading the posts on /r/Anarchy about how Anarcho-Capitalism is a contradiction in terms, about how Capitalism required some sort of state or coercive force, and reading numerous posts demanding that /r/Anarcho-Capitalism be taken off of the /r/Politics side bar because it was a just ""Edgy Libertarian Teenagers who have never touched a reputable Political text who just want to rebrand themselves ""Anarchists"" somehow for le max edge factor, despite the entire ideology being a complete contradiction in and of itself"", I decided to go converse with the ""real"" Anarchists about their economic views. 

Long story short, I eventually realized that Capitalism is actually NOT the total Free-Market economic system that I thought it was, and about how private ownership leads to a Plutocracy of non-productive private property (means of production) owners receiving a massive fraction of the profits. I always believed in a system where the harder you work, or the more productive you are, the better your state of living will be. I thought Capitalism was the only system resembling that, but apparently my views parallel ""mutualism"", which is sort of a free-market system of Socialism (no private property, so worker owned firms as opposed to private owned firms) where payment is based completely off of productivity, and profits are distributed in a Democratic system. 

To my knowledge, Left-Libertarians believe in Free-Markets without the Private Property principle. I watched that one interview of Noam Chomsky where he talked about his views on Free Markets vs Capitalism (Chomsky has since changed his position to something of an Anarcho-Communist, though he's labeled himself as an Anarcho-Syndicalist and a ""Libertarian Socialist""), and read a few posts in this subreddit about similar topics. The views that I'm being seen advocated here are all things that I completely agree with.

My question now is simply which of these two very similar ideologies I would identify better as, an Anarcho-Mutualist or a Left Libertarian? Does /r/LibertarianLeft find my views parallel to what they consider as Left-Libertarianism, am I more of an Anarcho-Mutualist or something else in the Anarchy school, or something entirely different?",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,,True,t3_13xaeq,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/13xaeq/libertarian_who_has_recently_moved_away_from/,

In order to encourage fuel efficiency in the United States without mandating manufacturers meet random targets, why not have a pricing system based on a sliding scale?  It would be very simple for auto manufacturers to place an NFC or WiFi chip in a car that broadcasts its fuel efficiency.  When a driver pulls up to the pump the pump then reads the car's MPG.  Based on the MPG of the car, fuel would then be priced.

Someone with a highly fuel efficient vehicle like a hybrid might pay a low price, say around $2 a gallon.  Someone with a SUV that only gets 10 MPG might pay around $6 a gallon.

That's probably why there are so many stories of policemen tazing people; cops in general are just too low-rent to be trusted with any power.

* I have generally called myself a Burken Conservative, believing social, political, and economic change as inevitable, but should be *moderated* to prevent social collapse (Burke compared the American and French Revolutions on this). 

* I'm a proponent of a variation on Social Contract theory, seeing society as an organic unit where everyone is acting to the ultimate benefit of society, and the function of government is to guide people towards working to the good of society and punish people who act against the interest of society.

* In social matters (ie, religion, marriage, sex, etc) I come down to asking ""is this any of my business? Oh its not? Then why do I care?"", because as long as everyone involved is involved willingly, then I don't see why I should care.

* I don't see any problem with the US (where I live) getting involved in the politics of other countries, as long as we are helping a Democratic/Republican government and our presence is actually requested.

* I think that everyone should have access to the basics to survive, but that it is not the responsibility of the government to provide people with those basics. Rather, the government should work with NGOs and private companies to provide them to people

Thats about all I can think of off the top of my head.

Curious to what you think, such as (constructive) criticism, support, suggestions, etc.

 I started off as a supporter of the libertarian party and Ayn Rand.
From there I became a huge supporter of Stefan Molyneux, even though I could never get fully on board with his epistemology. I found that I could not get on board with anyone's epistemology.
 Instead of supporting natural rights or consequentialism or objectivism or any other type of libertarian philosophy that is derived from a strict adherence to reason and empiricism, I have embraced a type of epistemological agnosticism. Not that I do not believe that knowledge is possible, but I have not come across any system that does not, in my experience, have some type of fault, such as contradictions, self justifying, etc. 

(I will point out that I do not totally throw away logic and empiricism, as they seem to be axiomatic, but they are also self justifying. I just do not find them as self sufficient for exclusive systems of knowledge.)

So I apply this to libertarianism as seeing that the State has no justification, or at least has not produced one yet. If I am correct, this is kind of the view of Crispin Sartwell, but I may be mistaken. 

So to summarize, I do not support a positive claim to the moral correctness of libertarianism, I simply question the claims that the State is moral.

How'd I do? :),8,5,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/kh85l/hey_rlibertarianleft_i_roomed_with_my_good/,"&gt; Pursuant to talking about exploring political/ world view / economic exploration, I was going to suggest you **not go against your gut**.

&gt; If the criteria by which you judge any political system is how well it treats the person at the bottom (and you are instantly repulsed by someone who comes off as indifferent to that person's plight and greedy to boot) do not fight that. That's a good thing, it means you give a fuck. And, as people, if we sense that someone has ugly motives beneath the surface (that she doesn't give a fuck), we are going to have a hard time giving any credibility to that shifty person's words.

&gt;[mutual friend] errored this way for a while last summer, he said, ""I'm going to challenge my views so I'm going to listen to...""

&gt;-  Rush Limbaugh and whoever else is on the obviously jackass neo-con-republican radio station on the drive in to work.

&gt; If you feel like exploring and challenging yourself (not that you need to or should) go with something that sticks to your core values:

You wouldn't want to be labeled as a conservative for favoring small government, or a liberal for believing in privacy rights.

Many people can't imagine something apart from the ""Left-Right."" You embrace a second dimension to politics, the line from statism to liberty. So now you have 4 nodes, like this:

http://88proof.com/img/worlds_smallest_political_quiz2.gif

While that is better, I don't find it sufficient. I would add a THIRD dimension. The first dimension of politics (right/left) is 'what should state do?' The second dimension (liberty/state) is 'why should the state do...?' This third dimension, making this more like a 'cube' is 'how do you subvert the state?'

People that identify with Gary Johnson, Ron Paul and other 'mainstream' libertarians, favor a government which is fair to the status quo of our class system. They don't see anything inherently wrong with pure capitalism.

The way we see it, on the other side of the cube, we place a stronger emphasis on social justice. Now how deep into the cube do you go? Do you avoid taxes, try to live off of the grid? Maybe, like I do, you seek to push the government toward obsolescence through redistribution of wealth and prosecution of the greedy?

So you see, I can no more accept your black and white characterization of state vs. liberty than you can accept liberal vs. conservative.

1365512394.0,0,self.LibertarianLeft,1bziq7,"Article about Addiction from LinkedIn, text since many may not belong to that network: The Vast Emotional and Financial Costs of America’s Killer Epidemic",6,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/1bziq7/article_about_addiction_from_linkedin_text_since/,"[Why is Addiction Still Considered a Personal Weakness?](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130409120623-25760-why-is-addiction-still-considered-a-personal-weakness)

When we hear about someone with a heart problem, HIV, cancer or diabetes we conclude they are ill. If we encounter people whose throats close when they eat peanuts or require epinephrine shots if they mistakenly eat shellfish, we understand there are aspects of their genetic wiring that make them susceptible. Yet when we hear about someone with a drug or alcohol problem, they are all too easily dismissed as weak, self-indulgent, indolent, sinful, narcissistic, debauched and feeble failures. Why don’t we assume that drug and alcohol addicts are ill and often seriously and chronically sick?

That’s one of the questions raised by Clean: Overcoming Addiction and Ending America’s Greatest Tragedy, David Sheff’s new book that studiously documents his reflections on the place of addicts in America. Sheff knows whereof he writes. He documented the calamity of drugs in his previous work, Beautiful Boy, which described in horrifying detail the descent into life’s basement of his son, Nic, who took his first puff of pot at the age of 12, feasted on pills of all concoctions, later started shooting up cocaine, heroin and crystal meth and subsequently ricocheted between the streets, halfway houses and all manner of treatment centers. (Sheff, I should note, is a longtime friend).

Since the 1980s, drug-related deaths in America have doubled – partly because the potency of some drugs has doubled or tripled. (Deaths from prescription drugs quintupled between 1999 and 2007). The Centers for Disease Control estimate that every day 365 people die in the United States from drugs and around another 275 die because they have become the victims of addicts through robbery, driving accidents or murder. That’s around 250,000 deaths a year - or about five times the number of U.S. military of deaths during the entire Vietnam War or almost forty times the number of US military fatalities in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It is impossible to overestimate the consequences of drug and alcohol addiction on society, and Clean should be an eye-opener for every parent and manager who clings to old-school prejudices and believes that addiction is a matter of choice and human weakness. One in twelve Americans over age of 12 is addicted to drugs or alcohol and addiction is now a more prevalent disease than cancer, stroke, HIV or Alzheimer’s. In poorer communities, the problems are viciously accentuated. Beyond the personal tragedies, addiction places a huge hidden tax on America – on our healthcare system, juvenile detention centers, prison systems (which are poorly suited to treat addicts but groan beneath the burden of their incarceration) and, most insidiously, workplace absenteeism (of both the physical and mental variety).

Every day in America, according to Sheff, about 20,000 people over the age of 12 try drugs or alcohol for the first time. Some teens (and US teens use more than in any other country) have a sip of alcohol or a toke, dislike the taste and are strong enough to shrug off peer pressure or have a good enough relationship with their parents or teachers to seek assistance. But for the unlucky teenager, that early sip, sniff, smoke or snort provokes a mental stimulus that leads to a life of misery. Nine out of ten addicts fall into this dreadful hole because they started using before the age of 18. Lest we forget, about 40% of college students engage in binge drinking which can also lead to long-term calamity. For teenagers, whose prefrontal cortexes (the brain’s center of judgment) aren’t fully formed, those early experiences are catastrophic. This makes it nearly impossible for many teenagers to stop using. Drug and alcohol use changes the brain.

The perils of drugs and alcohol addiction are faced in every home and workplace. The addict, at least for a time, is usually adept at concealing the problem. The relative, friend, colleague or boss is often oblivious (frequently for years), sometimes woefully ignorant, often blind to the indisputable scientific evidence, all too eager to offer the benefit of the doubt, and often does not know where to turn for help or whose judgment to trust.

Sheff notes that most doctors have not been trained to recognize the traits of substance abuse – particularly in teenagers where it is most dangerous. For the disease of addiction there is no national center, association or society as there are for other illnesses such as cancer, diabetes or the heart. Almost half the pediatricians in the country fail to recognize drug problems in teenagers. Most of them simply haven’t been trained to screen properly. Every case is different yet – as with other diseases – there are warning signs such as: a familial history of addiction, attention deficit disorders, depression, stress, anxiety, poverty, trauma and broken marriages.

Clean provides an unvarnished portrait of the world of detox centers laced with charlatans and people quicker to separate patients from their money than their habits. He describes the pros and cons of inpatient and outpatient treatment, the way drugs can sometimes be used to wean addicts but, above all, stresses the importance of intervening as early as possible. For the longer an addict is hooked the more protracted and painful is the treatment.

The baffling catalogs and web listings of available treatments that greet addicts and their families range from the primitive (cutting grass with a pair of scissors) to the ethereal (solitary meditation retreats) and the physical (outdoor wilderness retreats). By contrast, the cinderblock-sized guide many teenagers consult before applying to college looks straightforward. Treatment programs, which are frequently entered when both the patient and their helpers are distraught and confused, are a complete crapshoot.

Though there are a few bright spots, America’s many battles (there has never been a purposeful war) over drugs have failed. The public admissions of Betty Ford or Kitty Dukakis are long forgotten. Nancy Reagan’s battle cry (“Just say no”) is now just a trivia question. Even the mournful memory of John Belushi’s gurney being wheeled out of the Chateau Marmont has become another milestone on our national drug trail. All these many tragedies later, we still find ourselves chuckling as the comedy shows ridicule the dependencies of celebrities like Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan.

Maybe we can take some solace from the reversal of one fatal addiction: smoking. The carcinogenic consequences of cigarettes were first highlighted in 1953 and, though it has taken decades, refinements in medical education, huge public health campaigns and a hardening of public sentiment have led to a massive improvement. In the last fifty years, the prevalence of smoking in America has dropped by more than half. Doing for drug and alcohol addiction what has been done for smoking will be hard, require large amounts of money and will take several generations. But it’s a fight in which we should all enlist. Remember, addiction is not a choice; it is a gruesome disease. And – like it or not – we are all co-dependents.

The problem is that states tend to become leviathans. The founders in America obviously thought hard about this and wrote an ingenious document with limited power spelled out plainly. But it didn't work- the state eventually became what it is now anyway.

So here is the (new?) idea: the ideal state should have a preconstitution and a constitution. The preconstitution lays down the very basics (think bill of rights), procedure for ratifying a constitution, and a 20-50 year expiration date on the power of any constitution.

Basically, the current constitution, along with all laws and government agencies it allowed for, is dumped every 20 years and a new one is ratified in its place. Each constitution could actually be more like a ""social contract""- except the people would actually get to sign off on it from time to time.

Anyone ever heard of such an idea? This is really my last burst of political creative thinking before I become a full blown anarchist- so please feel free to comment and critique.

-----

Following on from a discussion between spatchcock and myself here : http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1ecb9r/the_federal_budget_in_3_minutes/ : I wanted to try and better understand the libertarian view of government.

There are many things on which we will certainly agree, and possibly some that we won't.

It is my view that government should should play a role in providing public services such as healthcare, education, transport, and infrastructure provision and development, among other things.
Can anyone explain why government providing these services is a bad thing?

We can get into examples of government overreach, such as legislating an individual's state of consciousness via the prohibition of cannabis, excluding the right to recognise same sex relationships formally, and over-regulating certain industries, on which I'm certain we will probably agree, at least in part, and possible also in principle.

But I'm really interested to understand the reasoning behind the idea that all government is bad. And if all government isn't bad, what can we agree on that should be a required service in a functioning society?

Surely there are some things in which we, as a society, are greater than the sum of our parts. (?)",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,,True,t3_1ecusq,http://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianLeft/comments/1ecusq/what_is_the_role_of_government/,
