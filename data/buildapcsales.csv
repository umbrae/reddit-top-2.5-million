If you have any concerns, please message me.  Now let's have some fun!


**Update**

Some are saying this hasn't been well thought out.  I'll give you that to a degree.  This started as an idea personally, and also the prizes so far listed is what's coming out of my wallet.  So if you think the prizes aren't worth the effort, please contact my employer and tell them to give me more money (humor).  

I am currently in discussion with someone that would like to offer more stuff for this contest.  I am hoping that will also help with a random drawing for the ones that don't make it to top 3 winners.  If you feel this contest is not worth the time, that's fine, you don't have to participate.  But I hope many of you do, as I think this is a fun idea and hopefully we can do more stuff like this in the future.

**Update #2: PRIZES!**

I'm glad to announce that a company has joined to sponsor and donate prizes to the contest.  James, a fellow redditor that operates [Quixby](http://www.quixby.com) along with other active redditors is going to donate a **Corsair 600T** PC case.  We would like request the winner to take a picture with this case.  They just launched their site and if you have free time, check it out.  

Quixby will also donate **3 $10 Newegg Gift Cards** to contestants that do not place in the top 3 at the end of the contest.  All names will be compiled through [random.org](http://www.random.org) and the first 3 listed will receive a $10 Newegg Gift Card!

The drawing for the Corsair 600T will go first, followed by the remaining contestants for the (3) $10 Newegg Gift. Cards.

**Update #3: MOAR PRIZES!**

Another sponsor!!  The wonderful people at [Mythlogic](http://www.mythlogiccorp.com/) will be donating (3) prizes for the top 3 winners and also (3) Mythlogic Mousepads for contestants chosen at random.  The top 3 prizes are in this order: **Copy of Diablo III, Diablo III T-shirt, and Mythlogic T-shirt!**

**Update #4: Entry time has been extended.**

Entry time period has been extended to the end of the day on Sunday April 15th.  Voting will begin on Monday April 16th.  This has been done to accommodate people who are currently in the process of building their setup.

**Update #5: Games added for prizes (random winners)

Manirelli has been kind to donate (5) copies of ""Lucid"" via Steam (codes will be provided) to 5 random winners that do not win any previous prizes listed.  **Steam is required for these prizes.**

**Update #6: Pictures of the Corsair case!

1376437155.0,177,self.buildapcsales,1kbanf,[Rant] Enough is enough. This irrational hatred of Newegg needs to stop. Amazon is great. Newegg is great.,359,182,173,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1kbanf/rant_enough_is_enough_this_irrational_hatred_of/,"Let me start off by saying this post is long overdue. Pretty much every Newegg ad/flier that gets posted here the top comment goes along the lines of ""ZOMG Y U NO GIVE ME MORE SAILS NEWEGG"". This is proceeded by people circlejerking Amazon and complaining about Newegg. [It was just painful seeing the amount of misinformation going through this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1k9ufo/newegg_diy_done_right/).

Before people get the idea that I am some Newegg fanboy, I'll let you know that I have been shopping at Newegg for about 8-9 years(since they gave out free stickers with almost every purchase) and Amazon since they were just a bookstore. I have spent thousands of dollars at both retailers and have dealt with their customer service and returns departments on more than one occasion. I also have seen pretty much every sale that has gone through here over the last ~2 years. I'm not biased towards one or the other, I base my purchases off of the price.

**The way you people should be making your purchases should be based off of the price**. Let me reiterate, **THE PRICE**. Here are a few points I really think need to be said.

**1**. Newegg promotions pretty much always have at least a few sales worth posting here. Its blatantly obvious that the people who are saying this haven't looked through the ad or don't know enough about prices to distinguish what is a sale and what isn't. More importantly, **why are you complaining in the first place**? No other retailer puts out sale ads the way Newegg does. Tiger Direct is now doing almost daily sales ads but I think everyone can agree they aren't as good as Newegg's. **Amazon, on the other hand, never puts out any sales ads that are worth posting here**. Its extremely hypocritical to complain about one site's ads when the site you are lauding(Amazon) doesn't put out any at all.

**2.** I keep hearing people belittle the prices of Newegg. [**If you haven't seen it, look at the stattit for this subreddit**](http://stattit.com/r/buildapcsales/). It shows that Newegg has more than six times the amount of sales posted than Amazon. Just browse through the new submissions on this subreddit. Newegg has more sales posted here than every other site combined. For the most part, Amazon doesn't have better prices than Newegg. They might match a fair amount of their prices, but they usually don't beat it.

**3.** Stop making irrational complaints about Newegg's customer service. Newegg's customer service is phenomenal. If you have ever been on their live chat or talked on the phone to one of their representatives you know that they do everything in their power to help you. **Both Amazon and Newegg have outstanding customer service**. One is certainly not blatantly better than the other. The two sites return policies are also a lot more similar than they are different. People keep saying Amazon has a no questions asked return policy. This is not true. I have talked to people who have had their returns rejected because or the same type of thing as Newegg. The most common reason: physical damage. In both cases the retailers find that you have to go through the manufacturer, not the retailer to have your part replaced. In the last year or so there has been maybe 3-4 horror stories posted here, BaPC, and GamingPC of people who supposedly got screwed over with a return to Newegg. That's not an alarming rate.


**4.** I see people saying that Prime makes Amazon the better place to purchase from. I have subscriptions to both Prime and Shoprunner. The difference between the two? I've had shoprunner for **FREE** for 2 years and it won't expire until December 2014. Both have the same selling point; you get free two day shipping. One isn't inherently better than the other. I saw an extremely stupid comment on the Newegg ad posted today saying that the shipping was much better from Amazon. Whether you are using Amazon or Newegg, you are getting UPS/USPS ground for free shipping or 2 day UPS/USPS with Shoprunner/Prime. The time it takes for something to arrive is relative to your location, not based off of the retailer. Warehouse location also dictates delivery time.

_________________________________________

**TL;DR** stop perpetuating this anti-Newegg circle jerk. This is not a post bashing Amazon. This is just a wake up call for the people being influenced by those who are trying to persuade others to spend more money just to buy from Amazon. Buy from the retailer that is cheaper for you. Some states do charge sales tax for Amazon but not Newegg and vice versa. Contrary to the belief of one individual on the ad that was posted today, No, you don't have to pay sales tax at the end of the fiscal year for online purchases if your state doesn't have a use tax.

The customer service of both Amazon and Newegg are fantastic. Those saying otherwise probably have never had a problem with them and are just spewing the same garbage they heard from the last person who said it.

I would like to remind all old and new subs of /r/buildapcsales to read the sidebar.  Nothing new has been added, just wanted to remind everyone of what should not be posted.

The most important one to follow is no posts that deal with selling or trading PC parts.  Posts that are linked directly to websites that are providing a discounted price on a product (MIR, sale price, clearance, etc...) is our main focus.

If there are posts that do not follow the guidelines, it will be removed (to the best of my ability, I am only one person).  **If by chance a trade / transaction of one person to another happens via comments or PM, in any way! That is between the two of you and /r/buildapcsales is not responsible if the deal goes south.**

* See /r/computebazaar &amp; /r/hardwareswap if you wish to exchange hardware

Also, affiliate links are not allowed (see sidebar for additional actions that will be taken).  I only know of a few tags to identify these, and if anyone has some insight on monitoring that better, please send me a PM so this can be handled more effectively. 

----------------------

Additionally, I would like to also thank everyone that participated and contributed to the contest we held recently (especially manirelli, Quixby, and MYTHLOGIC).  There will be more giveaways / contests in the future that will allow everyone to participate, probably not rich in prizes, but something to help go towards getting that PC built!  

Have a great weekend everyone.

It's about that time of the year when I promised another giveaway.  Unlike the last one, this will not be a contest, but a giveaway, this will allow all subs that meet certain requirements (still working on that) that have a chance to win a prize.

I will be able to contribute a little more than I did last time.  I am also open to anyone that would like to donate or [sponsor the giveaway like last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/taq35/winners_of_the_2012_buld_a_pc_sales_contest/).

Timeline:  The giveaway will be around / during / or shortly after Black Friday - Cyber Monday.

Now to the fun part.  What would you, the community like the giveaway to be?  

Throw a bunch of names on random.org and pick the winners (That's no fun)?  

A scavenger type hunt for a PC build under a set spending limit but meets the requirements for a new game?

What kind of prizes would you be interested in?  Gift cards?  A specific PC product?

Let's throw around some ideas and see what we can come up with.  We should be able to set up a nice event giving the increase in subs since last Spring.


**Update**

Prizes suggested that are a safe bet: Gift Cards, RAM, SSD Hard Drives, Fan Controller, Keyboard / Mouse

Loki7714 and I then started /r/Massdrop 

Basically, [massdrop](www.massdrop.com) is a site where people can get together and organize a group buy of a product, directly from the manufacturer. Then, the guys at massdrop will go to the manufacturer and haggle with them, all in the hopes of getting a better price for us.

The advantages of /r/Massdrop are two-fold:

**1) No more waiting for deals. We can decide what we want to buy and when.**

**2) Lower prices, since we are buying directly from the manufacturer.**

We are currently organizing a group of people to get a 128 GB Crucial m4 SSD, so if you were looking for one, as I know many of you are, come check out /r/Massdrop or post your own idea for a group buy!",,False,self,t5_2s3dh,False,,,True,t3_wa6n1,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/wa6n1/come_check_out_rmassdrop_for_deals_on_pc_parts_no/,

Hey guys and gals.

Some interest has been shown to the mods for allowing eBay links.  So I'm bringing it to you guys to discuss this, since you are the work force for the content of this sub.

What are your thoughts on allowing eBay links, that are **buy it now** with an **inventory of 5-10+** on a posting that has a price cheaper than Newegg, TigerDirect, Amazon?

**No auctions, no used equipment, *USA only**

*There are other buildapcsales for different regions

----

Lots of ideas, opinions regarding this.  Thank you everyone.  As of now it looks like eBay links are in favor as long as there is several conditions to be met.  I'm going to go forward with the notion that we will allow eBay links, but after I come up with the conditions some of you have suggested.

At this time please do not post eBay links, they will be removed.  In the coming week or so, I will make an official post explaining the new policy on eBay links and update the rules on the side bar.

Amazon only price matches on TV's (who knew)
Newegg/TigerDirect doesn't Price match on cpus

So I looked up what best buy's Price matching rules are. For them it doesn't matter what the item is. The way it works, as long as a competitor has the product on their store shelf for that price they will honor it. 

So I found the i5-3570k i want on Best Buy's website. Called them up and let them know about the product at Micro Center. Told them the one in Texas, i'm sure you can refer to any of them. What they will do is put you on hold and call the store to verify. So shortly after I was told that they do in fact sell it for 189.99 and will price match it for me.

I recently (11-8-2012) ordered a TV that daily steals was offering. It was a ""Curtis 24"" LED HDTV"" that was priced at $125. I figured this was a ok deal and since the gifting season was almost upon us I would order one for a family member. That's when things started to go downhill.

Their website ""Failed processing"" and suggested that I place the order again. I thought that was strange but continued on and filled out all of my information again and to my surprise at the end of all of it I was billed for two of the TV's rather than just the one I wanted. I'm not a stranger to buying things online and have had this happen before so I shoot an email to there ""Customer service"" and inform them of the situation and was expecting them to just remove one because nothing had been ordered as of yet. Wrong... They have it set to show that they print the label the minute that your order is complete and by there reasoning this means the order has already been shipped and nothing can be changed. They did how ever say that I could ship it back to them and they would refund me the money, but not the shipping cost.

I reasoned with myself that I would just end up using it or selling it on craigslist and would just wait it out. Well I waited, and waited, I am still waiting to this day. I have sent multiple emails to there crappy customer service always being told that they will inform the correct person and nothing is ever done. At one point they tried to blame it on UPS saying that they had the items but UPS still shows the only thing that has happened on the tracking number is the printing of a label.

I am having to go by my bank today to file a charge back and hopefully get my money back because they refuse to email me back or refund my money after emailing them multiple times. My hope is that no one else falls for this and while the deal may look great, it's safer to pass.

1350340008.0,104,self.buildapcsales,11jauf,OK... The whole Black Friday cult thing is sort of getting out of hand(why you shouldnt wait until Black Friday),144,40,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/11jauf/ok_the_whole_black_friday_cult_thing_is_sort_of/,"It seems like almost every deal post here there is someone asking ""Should I wait for black Friday?!?!?"". Yes, Black Friday is coming up in November and it will almost certainly have some very good deals...But before you drink the Kool-Aid lets try to use some common sense:

-**Black Friday is more than a month away.** Computer Parts go down in price as time goes by. This descent in price will occur whether Black Friday happens or not. You can have a fully functional computer now or you can wait and have the same computer for cheaper. Thats just how it works.

-**Black Friday is for mostly brick &amp; mortar chains.** Most of these places are going to be having sales on regular consumer electronics. Places like Staples and Best Buy might have some good deals on hard drives or monitors but past that these places probably arent worth your time unless you are looking for peripherals. There are some exceptions like Microcenter and Frys that will probably have some deals on PC hardware but just remember that for every great deal there is a moron who is willing to wait outside in the rain for 24 hours to get it first. 

-**Cyber Monday**(the day for internet retailer deals) will be following BF and is what you should really be waiting for. Yes some sites will have both Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday sales but if the past is any indication of which one is more worthwhile than its safe to say that Cyber Monday is the day for most of the deals.

-**Many sales will be limited in quantity.** On both Cyber Monday and Black Friday everyone and their mother will be prowling through the stores/web to find the best deals so dont expect to hit pay-dirt even if there is a sale on an item you want....which brings me to my final and most important point.

-**DONT EXPECT EVERY ITEM TO BE ON SALE**. People just assume everything they need for their build will magically be on sale on BF and CM. That's extremely improbable. Most places like Newegg and TigerDirect will release some really large Ads but dont expect category wide price cuts.

**TLDR**: Stop posting in every thread asking if you should wait for Black Friday. Any answer you get is going to be no less speculative than your own imagination can conjure up. If you have been eying a component for a while and find a good deal on it in the next month and a half then its safe to say you wont regret buying it.

Hello /r/buildapcsales!

We've been contacted by /r/buildapc in regards to users wanting to have their own contests and giveaways.  They thought it would be best to direct that traffic and submissions to this sub.  Myself and /u/driscoll42 discussed this and have come to an agreement that we will allow these type of posts.  

There are only a few guidelines that will need to be met, I also informed /r/buildapc to do the same when advising their users.

* Users are allow to start their own contest or giveaway.
* These will be operated in a self post
* No outside sites, links, FB groups, or forums that are having a contest are allowed to be posted
* **Mods are not responsible for any of the contests that are outside of the official /r/buildapcsales contest/giveaways**

We want to keep the sub as clean as possible and with the rule of not allowing outside links to contests will help with that.  

Also, the mods here are only responsible with contests that we conduct.  As of right now I have always thought of an annual giveaway/contest before Black Friday.  With that said, any contests that are offered from a user, they are solely responsible to manager and gift the rewards to the winners.

With these changes, I think it will benefit our community and make things more colorful since we're basically grinding Newegg and Amazon.

If there is a user who has a small company (e.g. from previous contest sponsors; Quixby, Mythlogic), you are more than welcome to have a contest and let us know about your site.  But please keep the contest within the self post on /r/buildapcsales.

Thank you

So unfortunately, no more cheap processors for those of us not blessed by a nearby MC. :(

EDIT: Based on responses, it seems price matching in store is entirely based on the manager, and some others have even had luck on the 1-800-BESTBUY line I tried to order from.

Knowing how people can be in public relations I do the math of how much it would cost for restocking vs the $20 savings. I'd still save around $11. I can use that as negotiations. My ammo against any resistance. I call their number, get in touch with Juan, who is not a barely any English speaking human. He's polite. Friendly. Asks how he can help. I explain I just bought my case yesterday and its already on sale. He explains their return/price match policy. I smile smugly. I'm gearing up to release my ammo and he says ""if you would please hold for a second I will see what I can do""... Seconds pass before he's back on the phone explaining that not only will he price match the difference of $5 but also refund me the additional $15, saving me the hassle, and time waiting, for a mail in rebate! Mouth agape I thank him, repeatedly, say goodbye, score him highly on the phone survey, and grin. Now that's customer service.

(800D at $150). Free shipping unless you add on a fan, see below. 

EDIT: Great find by /u/walrus4lyfe. There's also a promo going on, add a twin-pack of AF-120 or SP-120 fans, or an AF-140 to your case order, and they'll take $30 off, giving you the twin-pack fans for free, or even lowering the price of your order. For example, if you order the 650D for $100, and add the AF140 to your order, your total comes to $88.99 (plus shipping for the fan, see below, and tax if applicable).

http://www.corsair.com/promo

* AF140: $18.99 (save $11.01 off your order)
* AF120 and SP120: $29.99 (save $.01 off your order)
* SP120 PWM: $34.99 (add $4.99 to your order)

HOWEVER - They will now add shipping for the fans. For CA, I see:

* Standard 4-6 days - $4.89
* UPS Ground - $6.86
* UPS 2nd Day Air - $60.34

Annnnd looks like the site is getting hammered.

Here's what it looked like in my cart. Decided not to get it, I've got a Midi R2 that I haven't even built out yet.

It's possible they sell bundles for cheaper than buying it from amazon or newegg or other websites.

For example I just purchased the NZXT Phantom and NZXT Kraken x60.

Including tax from amazon the case cost $271.55 and the Kraken cost $149.89 which equals $421.44

I was then doing some research on them and typed both at the same time into google and [got a hit on the NZXT website.](http://store.nzxt.com/product_p/sp-p820-x60.htm)

Yup, that bundle is $309.99. For a grand loss of over $100.

Fuck me but whatever, that's what I get for not doing enough research. My recommendation? Do enough research.

Edit: Also some more advice, if you don't have it, sign up for amazon prime and shoprunner(for newegg), they have 30 day free trials, gives you 2 day free shipping.

Hey guys and gals.

As requested by a builder, we now have link flair for each category.

* Case
* Fan
* GPU
* HDD
* Keyboard
* Monitor
* Mouse 
* Processor
* PSU
* SSD

This will come in handy when an OP forgets to add it in the title.  All users will be able to add this flair on their own posts.  

By chance this catches on like wild fire, I will modify the posting format and have the flair listed and no longer request the title.  Thoughts?

Also, since I haven't really touched base with you guys since the giveaway during the holiday season.  Are there any changes, suggestions, or ideas you might have for this sub?

This is an assumption, but I believe the promotion is available to anyone, so if you want free two day shipping on Newegg for a year check it out!

[how I found this place lol](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/technology/at-hacker-hostels-living-on-the-cheap-and-dreaming-of-digital-glory.html?ref=technology)

Basically the idea is to pool all of our collective bargaining power together so we can get a better deal from the manufacturer (the site probably takes a small cut for fee). I know everyone's build is unique and we each have our own needs, but I think parts like SSD, HDD, and even monitors can be similar enough that we can make this work. 

We won't have to deal with the fluctuation in pricing from vendors, and guess when the next ""deal"" will happen; we can stop scouring all over the internet for cheap parts. 

Thoughts/Comments?

edit: this also lowers your tax basis since most of us will need to pay a sales tax; use tax is also becoming more and more common now.

For those wondering what Massdrop is - It's where people vote on which product they want to buy and once complete Massdrop goes to the manufacturer and negotiates a deal. Once this has happened there are goals in sales that reduce the price for each goal achieved e.g. 5 purchases means 5% off and 20 purchases could mean 10%. **It costs nothing to vote** and also **there's no money spent until the sale has completed meaning you you only spend the lowest price it goes to** (sorry for bad explanation - for example if you buy when it's 5% off and it reduces further to 20% then you get it for the 20% discounted price)

If what I said makes no sense (I don't blame you, I'm bad at explaining things) then visit here -&gt; https://www.massdrop.com/how-it-works

There's a vote on which **256Gb SSD** to get - https://www.massdrop.com/vote/61

A vote on which **Gaming/Mechanical Keyboard** - https://www.massdrop.com/vote/gaming-keyboards

And which **Soldering Iron** to get - https://www.massdrop.com/vote/soldering-stations-1

All you do is select you're top 3 choices and it should be up soon from what I've seen.

I've saw Massdrop on here before for a mechanical keyboard deal but it's came back again.

Upvote please - If enough of us vote then hopefully we get a good deal.",,False,self,t5_2s3dh,False,,,True,t3_1a8it0,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1a8it0/massdrop_voting/,

It would also allow for more US sales to get to the top here, and for Canadians to find sales available in Canada. Everybody gets to see what they want to see. It would make it better for everybody I believe.

I'll try to copy Canadian based submissions for the next few weeks from builapcsales submissions to get it started. 

Of course, I think it would be nice to decentralized BAPCsales for every country... I know there isn't that many of us, but we have to start somewhere. Let me know what you think!

1362147627.0,42,self.buildapcsales,19go58,Thank you BuildaPCSales!,62,20,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/19go58/thank_you_buildapcsales/,"Thank you BuildaPC! You guys helped me build a decent rig for a great price over the past few months. I decided to link every sale I found here along with pictures of the build. The GPU had not arrived when I took the photos, I’ll take pictures with it installed when I get cable extenders. The PCI-E cables that come with the OCZ PSU are only 6 inches long and I can't route the cables in a clean manner. 

Here goes: 

PSU: [OCZ ModXStream 700W]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/r84jj/amazon_ocz_700w_modular_80_power_supply_5999_with/) $30

Motherboard: [ASRock Z77 Extreme4 LGA 1155]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/18kqab/motherboard_open_box_asrock_z77_extreme4_lga_1155/) $90

CPU: [Intel 3570K]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/13nry1/intel_core_i53570k_lighting_deal_on_amazon_140_pst/) $190

Memory:  [G.Skill RipJaws X Series 2x8GB] (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/151170/ram_gskill_ripjaws_x_series_16gb_2_x_8gb_240pin/) $65

SSD:  [Kingston HyperX 3K 120 GB](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/11d41k/ssd_kingston_hyperx_3k_solid_state_drive_120_gb/) $60

GPU:  [MSI R7850 Twin Frozr 2GD5/OC ](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/199l93/gpu_msi_r7850_twin_frozr_2gd5oc_factory/) $170

Case: [Corsair Carbide Series 200R]( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/16ycp3/amazon_us_corsair_carbide_series_200r_compact_atx/) $45

**Total Price: $650 with shipping**

I’m really pleased with how the rig turned out.  I spent almost a year building it but I think the cost savings were well worth it. I just ordered a set of Noctua 120s to replace the Corsair fans. I’m waiting on a CPU cooler to go on sale, I’m leaning towards the H100i with Noctuas or the Noctua DH-14. The DH-14 is cheaper and efficient enough for me but I like the fact that the H100i would seal up that open grate on the top panel of the 200R. I wish I had waited and picked the Fractal Design R4 when it dropped a few weeks ago. 
After the cooler I’m saving for an ODAC, probably a JDS O2 combined model and a set of phones. I haven’t decided but I’m leaning towards AKG 700s or 550s. Once I have the audio squared away I’ll find new monitors. I don’t have desk space for 3x24”. I’m partial to setups that run Dell3011s and some combination of 20”s in PLP but I don’t want to spend the $700+ on a 3011. Maybe used 3011s will drop to $500 when the 3013 is released. I’m not holding my breath. 

Other stuff on the desk: 

-[ Majestouch 2 with blue keys]( http://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=759)

-[ Razer Goliathus Control Edition]( http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-goliathus-control-edition)

-[ Razer Mouse Bungee]( http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-mouse-bungee)

-[ Razer Diamondback 3G]( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826153027)

-[ Razer Carcharias]( http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-carcharias-for-xbox-pc)

-Asus 24” something (nothing special)

-Dell 2007WFP

Thanks again BuildaPC contributors! You helped me get a lot out of my budget for this build, keep on hunting for deals!

1343077758.0,42,self.buildapcsales,x1bcx,A guide to bundling items on newegg(with pictures :D) X-Post from BaPC,54,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/x1bcx/a_guide_to_bundling_items_on_neweggwith_pictures/,"*******[I MADE A NICE PICTURE SLIDESHOW TO MAKE IT PRETTY!!](http://imgur.com/a/Zl9lk)*******

First things first... Yes a lot of people know that there are combos on newegg. If that is you congrats! You successfully navigated through Newegg by yourself. However, there are far too many who dont realize that there is a link on almost every item's page where you can save money on another item by bundling the two together. Others know that you can go to the combos page on newegg but there are thousands of combos on there so actually narrowing down the items to what you are looking for is extremely hard. This guide is for those people. 

**Step #1** - Find an item you want

**Step #2** - Scroll down to where there is a box that talks about a combo discount when you purchase another item with the item you want. **Usually the item they list sucks so people just disregard it altogether. DONT DO THIS!!** [There is a link in the bottom right corner that says ""Browse more combos"". Click this.](http://i.imgur.com/3KyXoh.png)

**Step #3** - Browse through the items they list to see if there is anything you might want. Most of the time the items you want will have a bigger discount than if you bought the items separately. (The only time this isnt the case is if the items have promo codes that take off a larger amount than the combo discount offers...more on this later)

**Step #4** - DO YOU RESEARCH!!! Since you cant use promo codes on the combos check to see if it would be better to buy the items separately. I show this in the slideshow. You can however still use rebates and ""special offers"" with the combos so keep that in mind when shopping.

Now some of you might find this remedial but I know for a fact there are plenty of shoppers out there that don't ever check for combos on items they are about to buy. That was me until a few weeks ago when I scored BIG on a $3 usb car charger lol. I know it might seem silly that I'm even posting a guide for something like this but people need to know that they can be saving money.

Yes I understand that this isnt a sale.

**Edit: IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME THAT YOU CAN INDEED USE ""PERCENT OFF"" PROMO CODES WITH COMBOS!! ITS ONLY THE SET AMOUNT DOLLAR OFF CODES THAT YOU CANT USE!!**",,False,self,t5_2s3dh,1343099100.0,,,True,t3_x1bcx,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/x1bcx/a_guide_to_bundling_items_on_neweggwith_pictures/,

http://us.ncix.com/go/?refer-a-friend

I'm guessing all you have to do is get the person you are referring to create an account, sign up for e-mails, and enter some credit card information. You can get up to three per month. Anyway what I plan to do is use 2 of my own credit cards to see if it works to get $40 in NCIX credit.

If anyone doesnt have an account on NCIX yet and wants $20 then I will be more than happy to refer you(and get myself $20 as well) but this is by no means an advertisement to get myself more referrals. I'll update this in the morning sometime letting you know if using my two credit cards at the same address works for getting credit but its late and i'm going to bed.

[Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/)

Promo Code: VME10BTS

Offer expires 8/19/2013 or while funds last. Does not include Newegg Promotional Gift Cards, Marketplace or Open Box items. Cannot be combined with other promo codes or promotions that include a free gift. Total discount limited to $30.

About V.me:

You sign up with V.me and input you credit card information. From what I can see, they are saying that they are more secure than retailers for credit card information. It a third party handling all the transactions. No additional fees. Think PayPal-esque.

This Promo code is not that much, but those who want to buy high end items, CPU, GPU, MOBO's and etc... especially if they have a rebate will save a lot. It says one discount per customer. I will try multiple accounts on Newegg and maybe you can use the same V.me account and save on each purchase. 

For example, buy a GPU on one, save $30, MOBO on another account, save $20, and CPU on another... That will net you a lot of saving if this would work.

**What I am buying**

I tried buying a Newegg gift card, but Newegg processes their gift card separately from their usual add to cart checkout, so no Promo Code input. If you go under the gift card section. There is a gift card called [Zeevex](https://gce.zeevex.com/vendor/steam). With this gift card, you go on their website and purchase a Steam card with the Zeevex card. So buying $100 will save you $10 and so on...

[Monoprice.com](http://www.monoprice.com/)

Promo Code: BTSPER4

There are a couple of things here that I would get and have had before. Items must be on the Promo Link to be able to be discounted by the promo code.

I have both the Desk Mounts. They are heavy and durable. Supports the weight of 21"" monitors. Only downside is that your desk need to be a certain thickness. I solved this by just folding up cardboard and using that to gap the space between the desk and clamp.

I have used Monoprice many of times, usually for cheap cables and random accessories. Some of their products are top notch some are just meh. I would definitely read the reviews. 

**Additional Coupon**

Once you make the purchase, Monoprice will email you a coupon code. [Coupon Promo Page](http://www.monoprice.com/promotions/?id=10next_q3_2013_main) It is a $10 of $30 purchase. In the fine print of the Promo for the BTSPER4, you can only apply one coupon per order. So you will be able to use this coupon on other purchases. Coupon code will be emailed once the first order has been shipped.

If you are purchasing multiple items on the Promo page and one of the items is over $30, I would suggest buying the other products and waiting for the coupon code and purchasing separately. This might not work all the time because of shipping cost. You will have to do some math on your part to see how you can save.",,False,self,t5_2s3dh,False,,,True,t3_1k7jil,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1k7jil/monoprice_back_to_school_shopping_20_select/,

Now with that out of the way, for those curious, I split soda on my server in an accident. Cleaned everything to the best of my ability, but soda dried into the CPU socket, and its a loss there.

Unfortunately, that was the only PC I had though, so I have nothing to get the files off of my hard drives (which should be okay). I don't really feel like redoing my own work on a different computer either.

I placed an order through Adorama when I found that they had a SSD cheaper than anywhere else. I ordered the part Friday May 17 2013 and shortly after, I received an email saying that my transaction was declined. I made sure that my card wasn't suspected of fraud because of my online pc part transactions. It was not suspected of fraud. After everything was fine I went ahead and ordered the SSD from Amazon.  On Sunday May 19, 2013 I received an email saying that Adorama went ahead and processed my transaction! On a Sunday mind you, when no one is working and no mail comes. I tried to dispute it today, Adorama tells me that I have to wait to send the package back and wait for them to process my refund. I am not a wealthy person so this put me in quite a financial pickle.

I wanted to let r/buildapc know. I had read that a few other people have had this problem. If you guys have any feedback or if this has happened to you and you can confirm it, that would be helpful. I just don't want everyone who is building a pc to have to waste their time and money.  

TL;DR Declined for a part order. Ordered the part elsewhere. Initial part is charged after being declined. Debt.

UPDATE: The reason I went through this company was because newegg suggested it. The company that is sending the package is the one that must issue the ""package intercept"" is what USPS called it. Their site states clearly in their policy that if an order is to be cancelled or intercepted, that it must be before the order has shipped. This is helpful information, except when they decide that they want it processed and shipped before any one will answer the phone on a Sunday. From what USPS has told me, the order has not shipped. I assume that they would be the first people to know. I kept getting a lot of resistance to even look to see if it had shipped, which I'm sure would have taken maybe one phone call. Then they denied that they could do a package intercept, when I know that it would have cost them 10$ to do it, which is probably why they wouldn't. It looks like I'm just going to have to take it. I'll just have to wait for the package, send it back, and wait for my refund to process. Thanks for all the suggestions and help. I hope you guys are careful when ordering from this company.

I own these headphones, and here are the pros and cons (I bought them about ~half a year ago)

Pros:

- Exceptional sound quality, comparisons put it competing with $100+ headphones

- Isolates sound incredibly well

Cons:

- Was uncomfortable for atleast the first 4 days of owning, pinched my head and made my ears sweat. After that grace period it feels fine to use.

This is similar to a popular deal posted a couple weeks ago, where this was available for $235 with the 'iheartgames' $15 discount code.  They are back in stock and the code 'RALLY' works for $20 off, saving you an extra $5.

Also, if this goes out of stock, there is also the option of the Non-Dirt3 version (100312-3L) at http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-H6950_2
This version is $5 less, but has $5 shipping, so it evens out.  According to newegg reviews, it is still unlockable like the Dirt3 edition.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102954

It does not appear there is a difference between these two GPUs.  They look the same, and all specs are the same. (on the superbiiz site, it shows a 5000Mhz vs 1250Mhz memory clock speed, but if you look on newegg, you will see the Dirt3 listed as 1250 as well, so that appears to be in error).

**For those that are buying this expecting the Deux Ex game, please understand that this was a mistake on my part.  (I think) you only get the Deux Ex coupon if you purchase the non-Dirt3 Edition (100312-3L).  I was not aware of this and I don't know how to change the title.  It does, however list list it as a qualifying GPU for the game if you click the Deux Ex ad on the right sidebar.  Whether you can argue this to ATI or not, I'm not sure, but the coupon does not show up in your cart with the Dirt3 version.  I'm sorry!**",,False,self,t5_2s3dh,True,,,True,t3_mq7jj,http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/mq7jj/sapphire_radeon_hd6950_2gb_dirt3_edition1003123sr/,
