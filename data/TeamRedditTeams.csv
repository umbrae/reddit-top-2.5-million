**APPROXIMATE ELO**
I know it can be embarrassing but if you want people to actually respond they want to know an approximate skill range of yourself. Even if it is low, most people will be willing to play a few games with you.

**SERVER**
NA / EU-W / EU-East (Self explanatory)

**TIME ZONE**
Helps with arranging specific times to play / convenience

**ROLE**
What do you normally play? This is extremely important and you should include 2-3 champions you are *good* within a role. Do not list off 5-7 champions in one role because you probably cannot play that many champions at an acceptable level (this is *not* noob stomping but understanding match-ups, utility, how to teamfight with a champion)

**COMMUNICATION**
Skype, mumble, etc. (Self-explanatory) 

This will drastically improve posts and important information that can be quickly obtained. If you just post ""AD carry LF team/duo"" and you give some text ""cant get out of elo hell"" most people will just think you are not very bright. Think out your post and give **detailed** descriptions about your playstyle and champion range.

1329235904.0,20,self.TeamRedditTeams,pp86a,Alright so here's what I'm looking for: ,22,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/pp86a/alright_so_heres_what_im_looking_for/,"A ranked team of utter gentlemen.

I was thinkin' we'd go with *League of Legents*.  Get it?  

Preferably but not at all required, someone owning the Gentleman Cho'Gath skin.

**What this entails:**

1. **First and foremost, respect**.  Respect for not only your fellow teammates but your opponents as well.  Use some empathy for God's sake, man.

2. **Proper grammar would really be fuckin'**... It would be the tits, frankly. The idea is to class LoL up a bit.  I'm not saying I won't join you if you use the letter ""u"" for the word ""you""...  *But deep down I will always hate you.*

3.  **No ELO required**!  Hey man, I get it.  I get it.  You tried to play serious, but solo queue has always treated you wrong.  You can't get enough friends together for a 5v5.  The times you *did* try ranked  ended up a nightmarish vision of hell.  It's *totally cool*.  I've been playing for a couple of years now and I avoid solo queue whenever possible. 

4.  **So you're just saying you suck and are trying to pass it off as acceptance, right?**
Haha *whaaaat?*  No way... I--Psh.  No, but seriously.  I'm level 30, and I own 46 champions.  I've got one rune page, and it's jungler-geared.  I prefer not to jungle, but I've come to learn that runes are *essential* to junglers whereas anyone else can survive pretty much without them.  What does this *really* mean?  I've got a damned nice understanding of large amount of champions.  I've got a huge amount of diversity.  I have my favorite champions, yes, but I'm also capable of playing almost 50 champions with decent knowledge of how they really function.  This also means I understand and can predict enemy tactics more efficiently. 

4.  **Scorpion Wins - Friendship!**  Obviously getting together the sort of group that won't end up biting one another's head off is going to need a common ground.  As you can probably tell by now, I like to kid around a lot.  Humor is the spice of life.  However, I'm also very polite to strangers (although just the absence of rudeness is just fine), and serious about my game.  Yes, I want to win; we all do.  I just like to remember that I'm playing this game because I *enjoy playing it*.  I'm not HotShot, and I'm not playing for cash .  I will do everything I can at all times to try and make sure our team wins.  I almost never surrender unless my team *really really wants us to*.  I'm stubborn and vindictive and fight to the bitter end.

5.  **You typed way too much** - I know.  Nobody even reads this subreddit, right?  Well this is the conclusion of my much-too-long search for LoL companionship.  I have Mumble, Skype, etc and I'm ready and willing to voice chat while gaming.  If you're interested, PM me, comment, or do the LoL-y thing: my summoner name is Ninjujitsu.  Let's class up LoL and have fun doing it.

**Edit**:  How foolish of me.  I'm NA.  I'd be happy to play with anyone on my smurf account, or make a new account for other servers.  Just so long as you speak English.  Or very slow, limited Japanese!

**Edit 2**: Interesting factoid: League of Legends has *millions* of users.  Hard to believe?  Well if you think about it, not particularly!  World of Warcraft held the world record or an MMO at over ten million.  Reaching two million for a game like this is child's play!  What am I getting at here?  Well, there's a small country's worth of players (and several literal countries) actually playing League of Legends.  Of course there are many douchefuckers.  That is the way of the world.  More importantly, there are people like you and me out there.  Decent human beings who enjoy the game and don't regress into the [Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect)  Even if I'm not the teammate you're looking for, don't be discouraged by the assholes in solo queue no more than you are the assholes you bump into in public.

**Edit 3**: I just want to thank the three of you that up-voted this thread.  Scroll down the front page and you'll see mostly straight 1's.  There's a sponsored proposition (ie money involved!!!) that has 7, and that's about all that sticks out.  It is very much positive reinforcement to know there are LoL players out there that appreciate manners and coherent thought as opposed to ""omg gay noob feed akali amumu bitch"".  I don't know how many hours of LoL I've played-- I know it's a shameful amount -- but I really care about this side of the community. 

**Edit 4**: Wow, I expected a few replies but this is awesome.  I haven't logged in yet as I've had a few other games to mess around with (Mass Effect 3 Demo out yesterday).  I will make sure to add everyone just as soon as I do.  Also, I clearly emphasized the wrong part: I meant to emphasize the *gent* part of League of Le*gents*, but hey that works too!  I don't mind playing with ents.  They're a friendly and well-meaning people in my experience.  Double also, I'll be happy to play normal games with people on EU or those under level 30.  I've only played a few ranked games, so it's not like that's all I'm interested in.

Some of you might recognize me from my stream on twitch and/or the fact I was one of those banned Elo boosters a few months back which led to my AMA... or from dota/hon.. Or wherever. ANYWAYS.... Please listen up! 

My team qualified for the Riot S3 Path to Pro and due to some unfortunate circumstances we need to fill our support slot. Seeing as I am our ADC its my job to pick one. I realize this is short notice and nothing close to optimal but it's the best we can do. 

REQUIREMENTS: 

17+ yrs old from NA

Available to duo q as tryout Thurs 

Available to play in qualifier this Friday from 10am PST on; as well as on Sat 

Available to fly down to LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA USA the 11th (riot will pay for everything) 

Willing to become a riot sponsored player with a salary which means you must practice with us 4+ days per week and take this shit seriously

2k + ELO support main season 2 or 1850+ s3

Willing to speak up with a mic as well as listen 


Also realize that the odds of us actually gaining a slot as a riot team is low, but there is a chance. Do not be afraid to fail/lose. My team has put in a lot of work to get this far and we expect serious apps only. 

Please respond/message me with your lolking summoner profile link Page thing as well as any pertinent information (I. E. History, best champs, etc). Also let me know the best times for you to duo q on Thursday evening/mid afternoon 

Also realize that just because you don't hear back from me doesn't reflect anything besides the lack of time that we have to fill this slot with. No hard feelings. 

I'm sure there's more that I'm missing so check back for edits. 

Also you can contact me directly at my stream @ www.twitch.tv/dye44

Annnd if this doesn't apply to you my team would appreciate an up vote just so this thread gets more exposure. Realize you are helping out a team of 4 dudes who love league and who knows maybe we are the next TPA

**Introduction:**


World Dominance gaming is a new, up and rising gaming community that welcomes all. We are currently looking for League of Legends members to increase the population of our LoL division.

**About us/history:**


World Dominance as a name has a rather long history. Dating back a few years, it was once an extremely large gaming community. Due to negligence of past-leadership, the clan fell apart. The official recount of said events can be viewed on our forums:

[Click here!](http://wdgaming.net/forums/showthrea...Happened-to-wD)

However, we are done looking at the past. Moving forward, World Dominance (wdgaming.net) has been steadily recruiting / building infrastructure for the past 3 months. We are fully committed to bringing this clan back to the heights at which it rightfully belongs.

Viewable on our website, http://wdgaming.net/forums/forum.php , we have a listing of our game servers on the right. Rankings are climbing higher and higher, and we’d love to have YOUR help making this clan the beast we know it can be 

**Our requirements:**


Here at wD Gaming, we are specifically looking for players that are willing to participate in the community! Our LoL division is designed to accommodate different types of League players.

In LoL, you have the player who enjoys playing with other people, and some casual, friendly, gaming. A lot of competitive communities do not cater to this type of player. We do! On average, we currently have 5-10 LoL players doing 5v5 normals nightly.

Also in LoL, you have the hardcore, competitive gamer that wants a team. Not just a team. A unit. A cohesive, teamwork / skill-oriented UNIT. Because as any such gamer will know, skill alone does not make a 2200 Ranked 5v5 team. Chemistry, teamwork, communication, pure skill, ‘in-depth game knowledge’. These are all things that make up a professional League of Legends team. We cater to this player extensively as well.

Or perhaps you’re somewhere in the grey zone between these two types of players. That’s fine too! There’s a place for everyone here at wD Gaming!

Got friends? Love playing LoL every night with them? We love to accommodate groups of applicants as well! Our community has very reasonable requirements / bylaws to accommodate all types of gamers.

**Why should I join wD? Great question! Here’s why:**


We currently have 400+ registered users across multiple divisions. Roughly 150 of those are active.
Daily hangout with our extensive and diverse community.
An extremely welcoming community. Great place to have some fun!
We are active in many time zones as well! EST , CST, MST, PST are our main zones (North America). Lots of latenight gamers as well!
Teamspeak 3 server with constant slot increases: wdgaming.ts.nfoservers.com
League of Legends mentoring by our 1800+ players.
IT related advice / services. Very skilled designers / developers / repair technicians in-house.


**What are wD Gaming’s expansion plans?**

We are planning to organize weekly tournaments with prizes going to the winning team. (ex. 100-200$ of RP)
In-house scrims every second day, randomizing the teams and playing just for the fun of it
Custom game modes that we are planning to create. (Ex- Modified versions of ARAM, Teemo Hunt, etc.)

**What differentiates wD Gaming from the myriad of other communities out there?**

Most communities your thanks is a slap on the butt and a firm hand shake. wD Gaming thanks you with forum privilages and wD Credits which can be used to participate in contests, spend on virtual items in our many servers, or spend on raffle tickets.

Our clan members are (for the most part, RE: Diversity! :P) extremely friendly / accommodating people who love gaming. Although, even if you’re a quiet person who just wants to game and not be bothered, we work with that too! We’ve got lots of quiet gaming channels to accommodate that!

**Introduction:**


World Dominance gaming is a new, up and rising gaming community that welcomes all. We are currently looking for League of Legends members to increase the population of our LoL division.

**About us/history:**


World Dominance as a name has a rather long history. Dating back a few years, it was once an extremely large gaming community. Due to negligence of past-leadership, the clan fell apart. The official recount of said events can be viewed on our forums:

[Click here!](http://wdgaming.net/forums/showthrea...Happened-to-wD)

However, we are done looking at the past. Moving forward, World Dominance (wdgaming.net) has been steadily recruiting / building infrastructure for the past 3 months. We are fully committed to bringing this clan back to the heights at which it rightfully belongs.

Viewable on our website, http://wdgaming.net/forums/forum.php , we have a listing of our game servers on the right. Rankings are climbing higher and higher, and we’d love to have YOUR help making this clan the beast we know it can be 

**Our requirements:**


Here at wD Gaming, we are specifically looking for players that are willing to participate in the community! Our LoL division is designed to accommodate different types of League players.

In LoL, you have the player who enjoys playing with other people, and some casual, friendly, gaming. A lot of competitive communities do not cater to this type of player. We do! On average, we currently have 5-10 LoL players doing 5v5 normals nightly.

Also in LoL, you have the hardcore, competitive gamer that wants a team. Not just a team. A unit. A cohesive, teamwork / skill-oriented UNIT. Because as any such gamer will know, skill alone does not make a 2200 Ranked 5v5 team. Chemistry, teamwork, communication, pure skill, ‘in-depth game knowledge’. These are all things that make up a professional League of Legends team. We cater to this player extensively as well.

Or perhaps you’re somewhere in the grey zone between these two types of players. That’s fine too! There’s a place for everyone here at wD Gaming!

Got friends? Love playing LoL every night with them? We love to accommodate groups of applicants as well! Our community has very reasonable requirements / bylaws to accommodate all types of gamers.

**Why should I join wD? Great question! Here’s why:**


We currently have 400+ registered users across multiple divisions. Roughly 150 of those are active.
Daily hangout with our extensive and diverse community.
An extremely welcoming community. Great place to have some fun!
We are active in many time zones as well! EST , CST, MST, PST are our main zones (North America). Lots of latenight gamers as well!
Teamspeak 3 server with constant slot increases: wdgaming.ts.nfoservers.com
League of Legends mentoring by our 1800+ players.
IT related advice / services. Very skilled designers / developers / repair technicians in-house.


**What are wD Gaming’s expansion plans?**

We are planning to organize weekly tournaments with prizes going to the winning team. (ex. 100-200$ of RP)
In-house scrims every second day, randomizing the teams and playing just for the fun of it
Custom game modes that we are planning to create. (Ex- Modified versions of ARAM, Teemo Hunt, etc.)

**What differentiates wD Gaming from the myriad of other communities out there?**

Most communities your thanks is a slap on the butt and a firm hand shake. wD Gaming thanks you with forum privilages and wD Credits which can be used to participate in contests, spend on virtual items in our many servers, or spend on raffle tickets.

Our clan members are (for the most part, RE: Diversity! :P) extremely friendly / accommodating people who love gaming. Although, even if you’re a quiet person who just wants to game and not be bothered, we work with that too! We’ve got lots of quiet gaming channels to accommodate that!

Recently though I've been getting more and more frustrated at the general standard of play I'm witnessing at my current level in solo queue (silver), and especially since people dont seem to be willing to try the difficult things you need to get good at, in order to become a better player. And seeing as it's not really possible for just me alone to pull myself out of this hellhole, I'm looking for a skilled, active and dedicated ADC player to grind to a high level with.

I've got 8 years experience playing competitive team games to a decently high level, mostly Counter Strike 1.6 and WoW arena, so I know what it takes to be good at a game. My time playing WoW has been really helpful for picking up LoL quickly, seeing as I played mostly 2v2 as a disc priest (2.5k highest elo achieved), those skills transfer over really well into supporting bot lane, and supporting in general.

So basically I'm looking for someone who -

is 18+

speaks fluent English and has no problems communicating on skype/ventrilo/whatever

preferably has a history of playing competitive games to a high level before 

follows and stays up to date with the LoL scene

This has been a project that has been in the works for three months and it has finally come to fruition! As it says in the banner, this is a league “Created by the Community, for the Community”. The league will be hosting Town Hall Meetings very soon to allow everyone who is interested in participating the opportunity to get their two cents in. The point of this league is to provide a focal point for the competitive community to practice and further themselves as players. Through the three different divisions we have set up; Amateur, Intermediate, and Professional we hope to provide teams with fair and competitive play.


This is a version one of the site. Because we have no funds to develop a completely custom site (it would cost upwards of $5,000 for that) the version one will unfortunately have limited features. We hope after a season we will be able to take the website to the next level.

Features

* Find a scrim chat program
* A recruitment section on the forums
* Season play with a finals tournament to decide winners of that season
* The potential for teams to move up a division to compete against better teams

We've got a group of six players that play together fairly regularly.  At least two of these players have sketchy schedules that prevent us from playing as often as we'd like.  So here I am looking for new players.

Ideally we'd like people that are confident in jungling, or solo laning.  We have a pretty set and reliable bottom lane pairing.  Ideally we're looking for people that were gold last season, but we'll try anyone out and are willing to give advice.  If you're a reasonably competent player, and are capable of improving you might find a spot.

1365375294.0,5,self.TeamRedditTeams,1bvov2,"[NA]-[Reflectia eSports]-[LF Top, Mid, AD, Support]-[Competitive Gaming]",13,8,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/1bvov2/nareflectia_esportslf_top_mid_ad/,"**Introduction**
            
Greetings summoners! My name is Q and I will be the director of eSports, as well as the manager/captain of team A. This is a recruitment thread for team A, as well as team B. First off, I would like to establish that this is my attempt at creating a successful eSports organization. What that means is, we will be seeking sponsors and community recognition through marketing, as well as gameplay. I am looking for dedicated (preferably well rounded, high skilled, knowledgeable) players who are willing not only to give their all to the team and the organization but to also be willing to market themselves, and their organization proudly. It will be taken seriously, with almost a job-like atmosphere. 

This being said, I am sure this will raise questions as to whether or not the player will be paid accordingly. I will say again, this is the creation of the organization, meaning as far as monetarily, in the beginning, players will not be paid a ‘salary’ style of pay. The success, and monetary value of the organization will rely on the dedication of the players as well as any additional support we seek through management and scheduling roles. The players will receive what they put into the organization. To succeed, you must win, it is that simple. It takes a large kind of dedication that not all players are up for. Players on the team who stream, will be able to keep that money as their own, while money/prizes from tournaments will be split between the players as well as the organization. As the organization creates more buzz within the community (primarily through performance) the amount of money made will increase. As we become more successful within the League of Legends community, we will eventually expand to other games (in the far future), as every successful eSports organization does.




**What we are looking for:**
	For each role, we are looking for a combination of mechanical skill, understanding of matchups, game knowledge, awareness,an understanding of your job in a teamfight, as well as solid communication (large part). In the champion select screen, you must understand your role within a team composition, as well as be planning out what you are going to do to help win the game, according to the strategies being planned out by the team. Additionally, I would like to point out that there are going to be losses; being a part of this organization means you hold a willingness to help others improve, as well as yourself. You must be able to evaluate your own mistakes, learn from them, and overall be a positive contribution to the team through input and questioning.



**Why two teams?**
	One thing I notice about the NA scene is, being as underdeveloped as it is, it is lacking stringent practice schedules. The main reason for having two teams is to have a consistent team to practice against, via scheduling. Each team will operate independently, aside from practice scheduling, meaning they will enter tournaments and competitions as separate entities entirely. A good example of this would be Frost and Blaze, from the Korean servers.



**What roles are needed:**
	We are going to need several roles to populate each team. When you try out, you are not trying out for either the A or B team, if you make the cut, what team you are on will be decided by comparison to the other players who also made the cut. (this only applies to the roles that are needed on both teams).

Reflectia (Team A): Top, Support

Reflectia B: (Team B): Top, Support, Mid, AD




**How do I try out?**
	If you feel like you would make a great addition to the organization, as you have a solid combination of skill and competitive attitude. Then feel free to try out. Applications should be sent to my email and you will be emailed back with information on try out scheduling. Applicants must be at least 17 years of age and close to/already graduated high school. Applicants must also play on the NA server.


*The applications shall be formatted as follows:*

It's a small tournament that is growing rapidly, in which we take teams comprised of players ranked gold or below and pit them against each other in a double-elimination bracket. This time around, we've been fortunate enough to become a prized event by Riot, so the prizes we can offer are substantially better than what we could offer in the past. The prizes for this tournament are as follow:

4th place: $5 RP for each member of the active roster (max 5)

3rd place: $10 RP for each member of the active roster (max 5)

2nd place: $15 RP for each member of the active roster (max 5)

1st place: $20 RP for each member of the active roster, **and the triumphant ryze skin** (max 5)


We're obviously really excited about this, and we need about 3 teams to register in order to make this a 16-team tournament rather than an 8-team tournament. Registration does close very soon, so please organize your teams quickly (preferably before saturday).

*If you would like to register your team, or you have any questions*, you can follow [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AptB2hFc9eIZdGRTSGdpRm5UWG4tSWZHZFBaSXVqQXc#gid=0) which has the regulations, information on the teams registered for the tournament, and a link to our registration page. Please be certain to read the rules first, as they help explain who is eligible to compete and who is not. 

**If you are interested in shoutcasting**, please e-mail me at LeagueOfLegendsExhibition with ""Shoutcaster"" in the subject. Send me your name, any shoutcasting experience you have prior to this, your strengths/weaknesses as a caster, and whether or not you can stream. I'll reply promptly. If you have any sample of your voice so I can hear your microphone quality, that would also be helpful. [Vocaroo](http://vocaroo.com/) is an easy site to record a short sample on.

The event will be livestreamed, on [my channel](http://www.twitch.tv/dattmennis) and on another channel if we get a second crew to shoutcast the event. 

If you have any questions that weren't answered here or on the registration link, please feel free to e-mail me at LeagueOfLegendsExhibition@Gmail.com
or tweet @Datt_Mennis
or join the LoLEx chatroom on the league client.

Thanks, everyone! Happy gaming!

I'm expecting to get laughed out of the sub for this, but here goes anyway. (I did try looking at both /r/SummonerSchool and /r/SummonerPreschool but neither allow duo requests.)

Me: a very new player who likes support. I decided, instead of blindly derping my way up to 30 and beyond, to try and pick up a buddy right from the start and hopefully have a much more enjoyable experience overall. Tried ingame but have had no luck and none of my RL friends are interested in LoL.

My team and I are looking for a support sub to fill in for me during certain tournaments and scrims when I'm unable to attend due to work. 

Being a sub, you won't be expected to play every single tournament we sign up for or every scrim, since I will hopefully be attending most of them, so your schedule will be very light and flexible. However, be prepared for maybe 1 tournament a week (which can take up to half a day, depending on how far we get) and 3-4 hours per 1-3 days a week for scrims. 
You will definitely be expected to at least practice with the team a couple of nights a week, just to gain and maintain synergy with our AD carry, etc.

Also, don't expect to be a ""back-burner"" player just because you're a sub. You will be just as much a part of the team as me, you just probably won't play as much. c: You will receive the prizes for any tournament you participate in and win, etc.

Requirements
We do have certain requirements to qualify for our team, but they're not anything unreasonable or nonnegotiable. If you have any questions about any requirements, don't be afraid to ask!

1) Working mic/Skype. We use Skype during practice and tournaments to communicate with each other. Having Skype and a working mic to talk to our team is an absolute must, since we value communication in games.

2) We prefer for you to be at least 1500 elo. However, this can be negotiated if you prove to meet our standards, regardless of elo. But please do be aware that we have fairly high standards, so if you aren't certain of your support skills, this may not be the team for you.

3) Be a good support player! This is an obvious one. But please be comfortable playing a variety of support champions (playing all of them is a big plus). Know what to build for any situation. Be an avid warder, watch the mini-map consistently, etc. If you only play 1 or 2 support champions, this may not be the team for you.

4) Be a good team member! This is another obvious one. We would like a team member who is laid back and an overall amiable person who is easy to get along with. Be a vocal person who is comfortable with communicating with the team about what's going on in the game. Don't be a rager or a smack talker. Playful banter with the enemy team is okay, but we never troll or act like ******bags. Most of the people we practice with are people who we may scrim with on a regular basis, so it won't get us anywhere to make those people our enemies. Be okay with losing sometimes. Figure out what went wrong, talk with the team about it, and move on; we all try not to rage on this team c:

Random Info

1) We sign up for lots of tournaments, but our schedule isn't consistent. Some weeks we may have no tournys, some weeks we may have more than 1. Just be prepared for the competitive scene.

2) We play against 1900+ elo players on a regular basis (and usually do well!), so be prepared and able to play at a high level, against very skilled teams. Be prepared to help formulate advanced strategies, etc. 

3) Once again, being a sub, you won't have to play as much as a regular team member. So if you want to get into the competitive scene, but don't want want to commit that much time.. This may be for you!

4) We have 3 1500+ players (one of them almost 1900) and 2 1400+ players on our team. Just to give you an idea of our team's average elo. c: But like I said, we play against 1900+ elo players consistently and have no difficulty.


If you are interested and meet the requirements, or just have questions, please add me (cocomuffinzz) or my team member, chillcrunk10. Or you can just comment on this thread! c:

I will write it simple and fast, nuff said. Actually we're planning  make a team which could aim for gold rating atleast. I would want some experienced players to form a team with.

Secondly, please DO NOT ADD ME to your friend list, if you're interested and wish to join my team, leave some basic information about yourself - that means: something about your 5s experience, feelings about the future team and the team composition you wish to play.

DirtNapGaming.com Is revamping the way we support competitive teams. With a newly added ""social groups"" in the top right corner 
of the site, teams now have a blog/forum hybrid, where fans and staff can track the teams progress and the team can communicate with each other. Another fantastic resource that DirtNap is creating for its members is a ""free agency"" a database that I will maintain. That will track available players. Detailing stats about them as well as the role they play on a team. This will eliminate the hardships placed on team leaders that used to exist in the older system. Now team leaders and ""free agents"" can easily find teams that fit their skill, and time commitments.

However, without community involvement this sadly won't go anywhere. Currently I have over 30 members signed up as free agents. Along with 6 actual teams already active. Come and be involved in a fantastic community that supports up and coming teams through early levels of play all the way to the sponsorship of your team. 

Currently DirtNap already sponsors three teams!

F.A.Q.

Q: I'm not very good why would anyone want me on a team?

A: We have many members in DirtNap Ranging in all skill levels. Many people around your skill level would love you on their 

team. Also we have our own FREE in-house coaching department run by Stocky24. 


Q: Once I join a team then what?

A: Dirt-Nap will soon be running its own in-house events. Such as show-matches, tournaments, and even our very own ladder.


Q: I don't know the first thing about leading a team. Where would I even start?

A: I personally ran a competitive team for six months and know all the ins and outs. I can provide advice on how to practice. 

Also I can aid in where and how to sign up for important tournaments.

We're currently only recruiting from silver/high bronze (1/2), so if you're above those then you are unfortunately too good for us.

We have over a year of history under our belts, and our primary philosophy as far as player recruitment goes is that while skill can be worked on, people cannot. What this means is, we're more interested in friendly teammates than we are interested in raw skill (beyond a base level required for us to remain competitive). By joining our team, you become a part of our family.

We plan to use all subs to the fullest extent we can (at least a couple will likely be alternating position EG-style in about a month or so), so bonus points if you bring any of the following to the table:

* Flexibility
* The ability to give/take criticism in a constructive manner
* Fresh baked goods
* The willingness to look over games that you didn't play in to see something we might have missed
* No seriously, the baked goods are like an instant yes

________________________
I've been looking to join a team for a while now, for a few reasons. I want to improve my individual skill, and I find it's easier to do that while playing with others looking to improve and all playing competetively. I also just love the atmosphere that could potentially come from a team environment. I enjoy theory crafting and coming up with new strategies, and that is pretty much impossible to do without a premade team.
______________________
I want to join a team that is Gold+. I want this team to already be running, since I don't want to do the old join a team and then disband because the team never has a stable roster. This team should also be participating in various amateur tournaments like Go4LoLs. I prefer to use a VoIP program other than Skype. Raidcall is a good one and so is ventrilo.

I’m PRØTØMAN, the ADC and captain of my Ranked 5’s team, The Minibosses. As it stands, my team is comprised of myself, N4DD on support, PenBerg at top, and TigerofWhite mid. 

We're 6/0 so far, steamrolling our placement matches and first ranked. We're currently a Silver 1 team. We had to replace our jungler, due largely to the fact that our jungler turned out to be an asshole.

So here's what we're looking for:

1) You have to be a fun person to play with. Keep optimistic when the chips are down. You can’t win your lane every game, and we will respect that. Counterpicks and bad games happen. You are expected in turn to treat us with the same kindness. Team chemistry and communication can turn a potential loss into a win. We value personality over raw skill. Flaming teammates will NOT BE TOLERATED.

2) That said, skill around our average level is necessary. Be proficient with many jungle champions, specifically the strong picks in the current meta. We’d appreciate you knowing most of the following: 

Amumu, Hecarim, Sejuani, Trundle, Malphite, Cho'Gath, Nautilus. We try to run an AoE comp. The more AoE junglers you have mastered, the better.

3) We use skype, mumble and raidcall. You must have a mic.

Add me or reply here if you have questions. Our support is going to have a busier May than expected, so we won't be doing ranked as often as we'd like. Three of us are also still in college, so our schedule is lax. We like to play when we can, and play often, but understand that a strict schedule isn't possible. We take the team seriously, though, and expect the same from our jungler.

Hello guys!

Because our last team abandoned due to personal problems we're now forging a new team. We're looking for someone who gets along with us and has fun while playing, but we don't want to leave out the serious part. I hope you know what I'm trying to say. So our current roster is:

* [Mayor Lazorswag] (http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/23924213) as toplaner (please don't take the name into account for your decision! :D)
* [BrushHour Lyss] (http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/22087329) in the middle
* [Colonel Overlord] (http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/19297257) as support

We have consistently placed top 3 in most weekend tournaments and know we have what it takes to become a serious top playing team. We are in need of a serious Jungler who is willing to put in the effort to push our team to a professional level. 



Things we are looking for.

-Commitment 

  Again I can't stress this we like to play 4-5 nights a week, we count on you to be there for us.

-No rage

  We aren't playing to blame each other if someone messes up it is on them, although the team is there to support them out of their mess.

-Skilled

  Timing buffs, knowing at least 5 jungles, and having a well rounded sense for the game is always good and accounted for. I know with the new season 3 jump things are a little floppy but with practice we know that we can all adjust to the changes.




With that said if you think that you have what it takes then post below or add me or the team leader in game


My in-game name: Mcintyre

Since I chose to leave my team this summer, I haven't wanted to play in a team. I wanted to improve my individual skill, but I feel like I've improved myself sufficiently to play in a team again. Since I think it's hard to find a good team where I like every team member, I've decided to start a team myself. I was 1600 S2 and am currently 1540. I have, however, Platinum, because I used play 3v3 a lot (Was #8 on EUNE ladders at some point). I shifted my focus to 5v5, but occasionally I help friends get a decent rating. I haven't played much ranked due to computer problems (solved now).

I am a 19 y/o Danish man, who is currently unoccupied due to a chronical decease. This means that I'm practically online for practice from 11 am to 1-2 am. I play the bass and I like Mudkipz.

My expectations for the team is a steady roster and ability to participate in tournaments like Go4LoL. I want to have a team in which we can evolve as players, both individually and as a team. I also want steady practice and punctuality.

I already have a friend of mine who plays AD or Support and I main Jungle. So we need a Top, AP Carry and either an AD Carry or a Support.
 
 
 
**What I want from you:**

* You have to have been at least 1500 S2, preferably also now.If you have plenty of experience or have any other mitigating reason for a lower Elo I might consider you, but please don't spam this if you just reached level 30 or you are 800 Elo.

* You should be able to play several games (3-4) for 4-5 days a week. I don't want to recruit anyone just to find out that they can only play 3 games a week.

* Understandable English and mic. I can live with heavy accents, but you have to be fluent.

* Communication. Being a team is all about it, not just in game, but also outside.

* No rage. This is pretty obvious, I'm usually calm and I would like you to be too. Ofc you can express frustration and indicate bad plays, but it has to be constructive criticism.

* Preferably 18 or older. I won't accept anything below 16.

* Share the same goals as me. You have to be willing to put time into this and participate in tourneys. That being said, ofc you skip training if it's your mom's birthday or w/e. RL before LoL.

* You should preferably have a decent champion pool. I personally have every single champion and for the sake of swapping, it would be a big plus.

* You have to have a decent pool of champions for your role. I play a wide variety of conventional and less conventional junglers.

* Team experience is a plus. I have played in a number of teams with members ranging from unranked to 2k and participated in both on- and offline tourneys (Played mid vs Froggen once).

* You should have a sense of humour and be able to relax and just talk. Being comfortable with each other is paramount for a team IMO.
 
 
 
I will be the ""Team Leader"", not in the sense that there will be a hierarchy, but I will simply be managing practice, signing up for tourneys etc. A practice schedule will be made when I know when you can play.

If you are interested, just leave a comment here. Add if you don't fulfill some of the requirements and I'll assess whether I can still use you. Ofc add the role you want and maybe something additional that sets you apart from others. 

**I don't want friend requests as it's too hard to manage, it's much easier for me to have comments here.**

I will try to monitor this thread as much as possible and answer to your applications as soon as I have a definite answer. If I approve, we'll have a few games together to get a feel for each other.

The team doesn't have a name yet, I figured we'd decide together.

Minimum Requirements:

You will need TeamSpeak 3/skype (free,) a working mic/headset and be at least 18 years of age.

MUST MAIN Jungler ROLE!!!!

Ideally you will have had experience in the Jungler role in a competitive setting (Ranked 5's, Go4LoL, other tournaments, etc.) You should also own all the champions viable to the role. (IE. Support - Sona, Soraka, Alistar, Janna at a minimum)

Time and Scheduling:

We currently play 3-4 days a week. Sundays(go4lols) as well as Tues, Wed with an option for Fridays. We begin at 6:30pm EST during the week and 2pm EST on Sundays.  Anyone interested in trying out must be able to attend scheduled practices a majority of the time. 

Conversely, this does not mean we will not play casually on off nights.

Attitude:

LoL is a team game and your attitude should reflect as such.  You must be able to learn from mistakes and take steps to not repeat them.  We always try and have a good time so being able to take a joke is pretty necessary. That being said, the quickest way to the exit is raging. Don't do it.

We are two guys from Denmark, currently looking for either;

A) A team to join, or
B) To start up a team

Either will do. My current Elo (DatLolleren) is at 1336 (NN: WEST DatLolleren) - Though my Elo on the West server is 1028 (A bad Ranked start and the lack of motivation) with a Win/Loss on West of 12/14 and a win/loss on NE of 4/0. I've been maining AD Carry for quite some time, though I lack the training I could've gotten during the summer, since I had a friend who started playing, and I felt like I needed to help her get to know the game (Hence why I have a smurf on NE). My champion pool on NE isn't that big (I have Ezreal, Corki, Graves, Ashe and Twitch), but I am looking to expand it over the time I obtain more IP for use.

My friend is sitting at ~1128 Elo at the NE server due to a bad Ranked started along with him being unlucky with his premade friend and missing motivation of playing alone. His top Elo on his smurf on West is, on the other hand, 1291 (Funny thing that both our smurfs are higher than our mains - Starting Ranked too soon much?). He is willing to fill almost any position, other than AD (Mine) and, as I presume, top lane. He has mained mid for a time and Jungles when he can, but switched to bot lane with me when we are Duo'ing.

Other information would be, that we have known each other for.. Around 3 years or so, so the synergy is great. For more information (If needed be) you can add me in-game for a chat. If you want to join or let us join, then go ahead and add me. In-game name on EUNE is WEST DatLolleren

I am level 15 but not really enjoying blindly pugging for groups. I find that a lot of groups I end up in get sabotaged by really bad play and general asshats in games, the kind that will intentionally feed at your expense and argue or end up afking most of the game.

I'm not looking for good/pro players necessarily. Just a group of people I can have fun with from time to time. Voice chat is also a big plus due to the nature of the game and the inefficiency of using text chat in-game, if anyone has a ventrilo/mumble/teamspeak server, that'd be cool but otherwise we could use Raidcall to talk.

For added information, I play champions like Ashe, Annie, Ryze, Poppy, Cho'gath etc quite well. I am not that accustomed to other champions otherwise. I mainly like playing AD carries, AP carries, gankers, tanks etc. I am willing to try other champions if anybody in this group has suggestions.

As for if I want to be competitive at this game? If I have free time, I may do some ranked and go into deliberate practice/research mode. Thing is university could be a limiting factor.

I used to be a StarCraft II player that wanted to go competitive but the over-competitive die-hard nature of the game was ruining my attitude a tonne and I just got sick of the game. I could go deeply into the reasons why the game frustrated me but the skill gap between Platinum and Diamond alone, the eltiism of the playerbase, the lack of real friends to play with had soured my attitude of the game. For the moment I am only just still dabbling into the HotS beta but I still think in the game's current state, I don't plan to buy HotS. Before I went straight off of Sc2, I slithered all the way from Bronze League back in November 2010 to Platinum by about April 2012.

**TL;DR:**

* Former SC2 player ranked Platinum League on EU server.
* Looking for a group of friendly people just to play LoL with because I want to experience this game the way it was intended, with a group of people. I want to ideally aim for level 30 at some point. Asking here because no friends are interested in League of Legends.
* Not asking for the best players, just people to have fun with.
* Voice chat a major plus, ideally using Raidcall but cool with using vent/ts/mumble if option is available.
* No pressure to go ranked/competitive. May try if I have the time.

-Have skype, ts, ventrilo if you bear with my somewhat corny jokes!
-Rage: Never, just a lot of critique on how WE can get better at carrying.

I really need someone that has awareness at the game. CAN call the shots on when to drag, when to ward, when to fight. Will ward at all times and INITIATE FIGHTS.

I'm not bad at adc but usually supports in solo q just suck :P. DONT be hesitant to engage good fights etc, I will focus fire what champ you call. 
If you are confident in calling shots and have good-great game sense and are stuck in ELO hell cause of noob CARRIES, please feel free to leave a comment here and we can play some ranked. If it takes 100 games to get our chemistry down, I'm up for 200 games. I have excellent work ethics in both school and video games. If I want to win, I want to get better.

Second, we probably have ~15 people that have expressed interest in playing mid and only 2-3 that have messaged us about playing top.

Alright, we were only able to get through 1 mid + 1 top today for first rounds as none of the other tops were online and available (that's not your fault, as we didn't set a specific time to be on).  We will be starting up with new people tomorrow (Friday 9/28) at 4PST/5Mountain/6Central/7EST/etc.  Hopefully some more top laners will be on as there is always a huge line of mids waiting to tryout (if you're planning to tryout for top, add me (iJoo) and let me know that you can/cannot be around tomorrow evening ~ thanks).",,False,,t5_2sx2c,1348797051.0,,,True,t3_10f3af,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/10f3af/naomen_gaminglf_mid_and_topranked_5s/,

We continue to explore methods of bringing together gamers who share similar interests, play-styles, and skills.  Our mission is to provide a more enjoyable in-game experience for every gamer. For the next two weeks, we will be online on the North American server between 8pm - 12 midnight PST (+8 GMT).  Look for us anytime before or after these times too.  There are two ways you can reach out to us:

* 1) Send a friend request and an in-client chat message to Mageyouulook, Gamepalz, Rochadad, or Treemunk
* 2) Look for us in the Gamepalz or Reddit chat room

We'll be trying different ways to match players, especially those that took the survey.  We'll set up 5 v 5 games, and recommend laning partners.  We hope to do it quickly so you don't spend too much time waiting around.  And, most importantly, we'll depend on your input for what works and what doesn't.  

Here's some interesting data from the survey.  As we had hoped, the Redditors who took the questionnaire are very similar in age, ranking, and play-style.

I'm looking for chill, mature and open-minded players to play normals, duoQ, or even rank 5's with.

**For Normals**

I queue up for normal games to practise new champs and/or to have fun. Both of these things are usually hard to achieve, if I queue up alone. You can't practise champions, because always someone starts to rage at you, if you do bad. You can't really have fun with ""out-of-the-meta"" -champs either, because again, someone's always going to rage about it.

For that, I'd like to play with ppl, who don't rage or get mad, if someone's doing bad. They should also have a healthy sense of humor and an ability to have fun (VERY IMPORTANT).

**For DuoQ**

I'm currently sitting around 1650 elo, hoping to get Plat (1900) at some point. Best role for me by far is support, although I'm looking to pick up few sololaners, in case I can't get support (I already play a somewhat decent ad, and I'm prolly the worst jungler EU O.o). I prefer to duo with someone, who plays ad, but that's not mandatory. You should be 1600+ and competent enough to climb the ladder all the way to the 1900 mark.

**Rank 5's**

I think this one is pretty ""unreal"", but I'm always open for offers. I think that proper 5v5 is the real way to play LoL instead of 5 individuals v 5 individuals (= soloQ). Like I told before, my best role is support, and that's the role I'd play if I had to play competitively.

In all cases, I prefer to use some kind of a voice communication, mainly Skype (can use others too). My timezone is GMT +2, and I usually play more during the evening, although I'm online most of the day. I speak finnish and english, and I'd hope you'll speak one of those two too.

So, first of all, we want to make a team to HAVE FUN and of course to improve ourself.
But the most important thing is to have fun together, we don't want trolls or flamers.
Our philosophy is simple: we are a team so we have to help each other, to support each other even if someone fails (even if it's hard).

How can we improve ourself if we'd get flamed by our own teamates ?
We don't want our team mates to flame or troll between them, that's not like a team should be.


My friend is 1544 elo something like that, I'm between 1300-1350 hidden elo.
If you're cool and you agree with our philosophy (and you're between 1300-1500 elo) you can contact me by pm.

* Trying to get better by analysing your own mistakes

* Never Rage. Rageing about yourself because you suck hard is kinda ok.

* Buy wards, donsn't Matter which role you are

* You are friendly, chilled and funny but can switch in serious mode within a second

* If your Teammate is losing try to motivate them again.

* Never surrender. Fight until its over. 


I also want to want a serious competitive Team but in fact i don't have any Elo conditions this Team will start by just train in normal draft mode until we have some nice synergy. 

Beside that i want to have a Team who like to talk about Team compositions and Team strategies. 

I would play the ad carry of this Team because this is my main Role. So if you are a main ad carry and want to join we maybe could build a second Team if there are enough people who want to join, but i actually don't expect that. 

Age and nationality doesn't matter you just should speak and understand English quit easily. 

If you are interested in this just wright your ingame Name, your main Role and i will add you. 

Hopefully out there are 4 people who would like to join me and my new Team. 

See you on the field of justice, Summoners!

**Team Captain:** Infernix20

**Team Zone:** NA - West (PST timezone) 

**Team Practice:** *We do not have set practice days/times, but we like to practice close to every day around 6PM-12AM PST.* (Obviously we will not be playing for 6 hours a day, but those are the times we are comfortable playing in.)

**What we need:**

The team is currently looking for an exceptional top lane player with strong experience with top tier champions (Riven, Lee Sin, etc etc.) Experience with other roles would really help us be a more flexible team.

We are also looking for an exceptional support player with strong experience with all main support champions (Soraka, Lulu, Janna, Sona, Taric, Leona.) Must know how to actually play a support!

We're looking for people who knows they have what it takes to be a top player and eventually compete in tournaments. We're not looking for a specific ELO range, but we expect you to understand how the game works and know how to handle it mechanically. 

*Must have skype and a mic*

**Who we are:**

Immense Gaming is a new team looking to build up a solid core and eventually compete in tournaments. All of us are around the 1500+ ELO range and bring a casual approach to the game, but always strive to be the best players possible. We bring a hardcore mindset while playing, but have an amazing time playing with each other.

Team Line-Up:

Infernix20: AP Mid (Can jungle, top and support as well.)

LegitDave: Jungle (Can top or mid as well.)

Hawkfira: AD Carry (Can mid or jungle as well.)


As you can tell we are all pretty versatile and don't mind changing roles, so we are trying to find someone that has great mechanics and knowledge in a couple of roles.

We went 4-1 our first 5 games. We lost one game because we were trying someone new out and they turned out to be total garbage. We're looking to lock down our core and get a lot of practice in.

Requirements:
- Availability from 5 pm - 10 pm EST for practices Monday-Thursday.

-Willing to accept criticism and/or make changes accordingly.

-Must be able to communicate clearly and effectively with voice (We will be using Skype).

-Must have a reliable computer and internet connection.

-Must be able to play on weekends (various tournaments, leagues, and scrims).


Roles:

Solo Top

Jungler


About Me:
-Led several competitive teams in CS 1.6, CS:S, Quake 3/Live.

-Played in dozens of tournaments, both online and local.

-Have won several thousand dollars in cash and prizes.

I am the least experienced player on the team with around a 1200 ELO as I have not been playing ranked (solo queue is painful). I am the support player of the team. The team will be playing around 1100-1300 ELO right now. We will obviously be working towards raising this. 

The goal is to get players with the right mindset who are interested in working towards better play. We are not looking for the best players in league, we are looking for the best players for us. I won't tolerate raging. Win gracefully and lose gracefully.

Just reply to this thread with the following information:

-Top 3 champions in that role

-What you can bring to the team

-Link to replay (It can also be emailed to purenorthern1@gmail.com. Just make sure to include your reddit name)

**The Facts**

* Summoner Name: Lord Rygor

* ELO: 1400-1550

* Favorite role: Top/Jungle

* BEST role: Support/Jungle

* Team specialties: Knowing when to teamfight, Counter jungling, Objective timers, Warding

* Team weakness: AD carry positioning, Risky Baron calls

* Favorite Champions: Rumble, Soraka, Shyvana, Master Yi, Caitlyn, LeBlanc, Sion, Zilean

* BEST champs: Soraka, Zilean, Lee Sin, Shyvana, Sion

I might as well confess, I'm a League of Legends addict. I work a 12 hour job for the government and when I'm not out saving the world I'm on the fields of justice always trying to improve my game. League of Legends is my passion. I'm 25 and a more mature-type gamer that's chill and easy to get along with. **I want a team that wants to compete in events.** (Go4lol, etc.)

**If you're just a casual team, don't add me.**

I've been on a few teams before, but they always fall through. I want something that works. If I'm not filling these roles, this is what I expect from my teamates.

* I want an AD carry who is mechanically sound. Last hits matter.
* I want a mid that knows how to roam, and how to ward pathing so we can follow the enemy jungler.
* I want a top lane that can handle his own and win his lane.
* I want a support that works well with the AD carry and wards even if the enemy team has an oracles.
* I want a jungler that knows how to, and when to; gank, counter-jungle, or farm.

I know, I'm asking a lot. Everyone who's seeking a **serious** team wants these things. So please, hit me up. *I could be your guy.*

* I work well with others.
* I listen to criticism and take it with a grain of salt.
* I don't rage often.
* I won't flake out on you.
* I like lists.
* I'll show up to practice and play what the team needs.

So basically I would like to find a few people who can play through north american (eastern) college hours. Which means basically whenever... 

In terms of rank, or qualifications i don't really request much but would just like a group of people (non-ragers) who are between 1400-1600 elo in solo queue or who feel confident that they can contribute on that level. The main reason I'm doing this is because i feel like solo queue is is not indicative of how good some people really are at this game.

For instance: I believe one of my best traits in LoL would be my ability to read the map and i can tell what people are doing, where they are going, even without wards. (obviously i prefer to have wards though)

The main thing that bugs me about solo queue is that teams just plain refuse to communicate/listen if they think they are better than you. Lets be honest, that's about everyone.

Anyways, main point is that I'm looking for some people who would like to get better at LoL, have free time, and want to play more competitively.

Qualifcations:
 
-Solid Play (~1500elo)

-Non-ragers

-Willing to communicate and have fun

-Have headset

-Willing to fill roles

Thats pretty much it, comment and let me know if people are interested. :) thanks.

we are a serious competitive team who is looking for a Solo top player and Support.
The reason we are looking for new people is because our former top/support, has to work most of the week, and we want to practice at least 5 times a week (with weekend days)
we had our first go4lol tournament where we made it to third round. and we want to get better then that. you have to be able to play Go4lol every Sunday.

at the moment our setup looks like this -

Tjalfei - AD carry

F0rmidilosis - Mid

Zanelicious - Jungle

the requirements for joining us -

you want to learn more in this game.

you dont get pissed at your teammates, we will after our matches discuss what the reasons for the mistakes we did are.
as we need 2 people for our new team, we are a newly formed team yet again , which mean we have to practice as a team, and you will have to deal with this, even if it wont go that good the first couple of games.

age req - 18+

be a happy guy (: , if you cant handle mistakes we are not the team you are looking for. 

help your teammates out, help them to get better, even duo queue in ranked is a good thing, to learn more.


Note - there is no elo requirement. but you do need a skill level about the same as ours, and you will have a tryout.


Just write an application here, and ill add you ingame if you might be what we are searching for!

We are three gold players planning to start a ranked team and we are looking for two players to fill the remaining slots.

We do not really care if you are silver, gold or platinum but we are aiming for platinum and you should feel confident being or getting to and competing at that level of play.
We are a semi-serious team and will probably play about three times a week, maybe more, if we should have the time.


**What roles are we looking for?**


We have no set roles as of now, the players in this team right now are

**EDIT: a Mid-Player**

a jungle/top/support player

one guy without a main role

So, we probably need an ADC player the most, but all roles are up for grabs.


**What do we expect from you?**


-a certain level of dedication and ambition

-willing to put effort into mastering your role

-constructive criticism: give it and be able to take it. We strive to improve and we will have to, none of us is a platinum player right now but it is our goal and to get there we will need to help each other improve

-fluent english and the means to communicate via teamspeak/ventrilo/whatever. We are two danes and one german so we need you to speak english to communicate.

-time.
We want a consistent training schedule, probably about three times a week for a few hours each.

-positive attitude


**Man, that sounds great, where do I have to sign?**


Reply in the thread, PM me or add me ingame (Torem Kamina, EUW).
We will decide if it works out on the fields of Justice.

TFA is a small review site with a few dedicated gamers and nerds that write articles, cover events, and stream a weekly podcast that try to catch people up on everything geek that happened that week.

The Futon Alliance has had a large and still growing Starcraft 2 squad for quite some time now, and I have taken the initiative to help us expand to League of Legends. Thanks to GameVox for sponsoring us we will have access to a large voice chat server for players to practice in and hang out. 

My goal is to recruit players to fill up 4 teams (yes, 4 teams!) The Plan is to have two teams ranging from a Gold 1 - Diamond 1 Level, and two teams ranging from a Bronze 1 - Gold 4 Level. 
Four Teams may sound like a lot, but it would allow us to have good practices and help within the team. This would allow for each higher level team to scrim with the lower level and help them improve while also having another team of the same level to scrim with. Depending on everyones schedules I would like to hold practice sessions at LEAST twice a week, but three days a week would be ideal. 

Wondering what we can provide for you? We can provide you with a friendly environment to improve your gameplay and talk with other players, as well as having chat servers for everyone to use. The end game goal is to compete in amateur team leagues and work our way up as we improve as a team.

Anyone who is interested can e-mail me here at: Tag72793@gmail.com Or add me on League of Legends: Hôward (don't forget the funny ô :D)

In your message be sure to let me know who you are, how long you have been playing LoL, your current ranking, preferred position + champions. Also leave me a little not telling a little bit about yourself and why you want to join/how you would benefit the team as a player :)

My name is Eclipse and I am the manager/founder of Team Vort3x. I am here today to recruit a couple of positions on our team and hope to find some good fits! If you are interested please read on into this wall of text and find the proper categories for you. Thanks!

Team Vort3x has two teams, one that has been officially organized which you could call our A Team, it carries the name Team Vort3x itself. The roster is nearly full, however we have had to make a few adjustments and are in need of a Sub Support, Sub ADC and a few external roles such as Team Analyst/Coach to help go over replays, to assist in improving the team as a whole and generally be a pair of eyes on the outside of the team to give that extra edge.

**All Role Rules**



* No raging, you can get upset, you can be frustrated, but keep flaming and raging to a minimum.
* Must have a strong game sense, mechanics, teamfight mechanics, etc.
* This is not soloqueue, we are a team and you are expected to act like a teammate and respect your fellow teammates. If you are obsessed with soloqueue and can't seperate the two, we do not wish to try you out. Simple as that, my apologies.
* You are required to have a microphone, and install mumble. The VOIP program of choice will change in the future but it is included right now in our host plan so we will continue to use it.
* You must be 18+, you will not be added/tried out if you are under the age of 18 due to the fact that we have had some maturity issues in the past with younger players.
* You must correct your atttiude prior to applying. Cockyness, Mr.Know-it-all and jocky players in general are not welcome. We are a team, we play like one, we work together like one. Do not come in here and start an argument because you think you are right. We will discuss problems in games, comps and such in a respectable way and progress like a team.
* All applicants must be Gold V+, some of our members may be under that threshold but that is the current standard for any future members and is not up for agrument.
* You must be active on our website as we have a team only section, a calendar for practice schedules only visable to team members, etc.
* You must have time! We are a serious, dedicated team and you must have the time to practice, scrim,and be on line with the team on mumble all the time.
* Personality, personality, personality.

**Sub MID**

* Must have a solid independent playstyle and able to withstand a bit of countering.
* Must be able to attend regular practice
* Must know how to trade and avoid taking much damage, must ward and take care of themselves well
* Must be able to roam, go for objectives, and not just sit in lane 24/7
* Must have a deep understanding of a solo lane and have strong mechanics.
* Must be able to handle criticism well and also give input as well.


**Sub Support Position**

Many people think it's easy to support that you can do what ever and just let the Marksman do the job. Unfortunately that is not the case - not for us here at Vort3x anyway. We are looking for a strong support player who understands that the Support practically carries the lane at the beginning of the game. Basically the Support is the important part of the Bot Lane meta as of right now. And with this we are looking for talented supports who can do more than ward, peel and stand around.


* Communication is key! Talk to your ADC during games, be able to work with him in order to get that umph you need in lane.
* Strong game mechanics and teamfight mechanics. You must know your job, whether it be a tank support who will be in front, or a CC machine like Nami or Thresh.
* You must have a strong champ pool, I can't stress enough that knowing just Janna, Sona and Taric are not strong picks. You are free to have favourites but you are playing with a team now. You are expected to play what will win us games and win you lanes.

Hi, my name's Avira (IGN: aviraaaa).

I'm a student with a passion for eSports and League of Legends. I'm dedicated, attentive, and willing to put in the work to get your team where you need to be. I'm not going to pretend I'm some diamond level player, I'm not looking for a team to play or sub for. What I am looking for is a team that is on their way to do great things, but needs a little more organization to get them there.

**What can I do for you?**

Most teams form, do well in some ranked 5's or light tournaments, and then look to do more but never do. That's where I come in.

As your team's manager, I will:

- Find &amp; sign you up for regular tournaments.
- Match you with teams that are on or above your level for valuable scrims.
- Schedule EVERYTHING and keep you guys on track.
- Need a sub/replacement? I'm on it.
- Help you recognize and work on whatever issues your team might have.
- Want to get the word out about you guys/your streams on social media? Got it.
- Get you sponsorships (provided the team does well enough).

**You are...**

A serious team with big talent and even bigger goals. I love competitive League of Legends and I want to be a more active participant in it. My hopes are to work with a higher tiered team, but if you're not there, that's okay. We can work towards it if you honestly believe you have the potential.

All that I ask from duoing is that we benefit from each other by teaching each other, and able to resist badgering from other players because I'm not in the mood of dealing with people who believe in elo hell and cursing at people for their mistakes.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to give you guys any physical money but I could give whoever is a part of my team a minimum of $~~25~~10 in RP IF we win.

That being said, **I need to make a team.**

Now, I myself am only level ~~24~~25 but I will be picking out the team based on merit (elo/match history) and position.

**Benefits**

* Not a permanent team in any way.

* Possibly $~~25~~10 in RP! (THINK OF THOSE SKINS)

* Semi-local fame.

* Entry money goes towards a good cause (make a wish foundation).

* Completely online.

* **FREE**

**Drawbacks**

* Must be available for games.

**Benefits to drawbacks**

* Flexible options that will fit YOUR schedule! Can't make a game? That's ok, we have substitutes. Just come to the next one.

**Conditions**

* Good behavior during games.

I am a mid and will most probably be using Ahri.

Open positions (updated immediately):

* top

* bot

* bot

* jungle

* substitute for any of the listed positions (Substitutes will receive $~~10~~5 at least regardless of if they play or not)

* substitute for any of the listed positions

Please email me (oheesak@gmail.com) the following information if you are interested:

* Summoner name

* Position

* List of champions you are more than comfortable playing.

* Level and ELO if applicable (non lvl 30 players will have their match history, rune pages, etc viewed.)

* Suggestion for team name

* Email. It'll come with your email to me! :D

Currently ADC and Support are filled, and I will be filling mid/ jungle depending on who we recruit. We are looking for 2 mains and 2 backups, though the backups shouldn't be concerned as they will still see plenty of games as people are not always online.

On average we play from 10pm EST to 4-8 am EST, and random times throughout the day.

**Introduction:**


World Dominance gaming is a new, up and rising gaming community that welcomes all. We are currently looking for League of Legends members to increase the population of our LoL division.

**About us/history:**


World Dominance as a name has a rather long history. Dating back a few years, it was once an extremely large gaming community. Due to negligence of past-leadership, the clan fell apart. The official recount of said events can be viewed on our forums:

[Click here!](http://wdgaming.net/forums/showthrea...Happened-to-wD)

However, we are done looking at the past. Moving forward, World Dominance (wdgaming.net) has been steadily recruiting / building infrastructure for the past 3 months. We are fully committed to bringing this clan back to the heights at which it rightfully belongs.

Viewable on our website, http://wdgaming.net/forums/forum.php , we have a listing of our game servers on the right. Rankings are climbing higher and higher, and we’d love to have YOUR help making this clan the beast we know it can be 

**Our requirements:**


Here at wD Gaming, we are specifically looking for players that are willing to participate in the community! Our LoL division is designed to accommodate different types of League players.

In LoL, you have the player who enjoys playing with other people, and some casual, friendly, gaming. A lot of competitive communities do not cater to this type of player. We do! On average, we currently have 5-10 LoL players doing 5v5 normals nightly.

Also in LoL, you have the hardcore, competitive gamer that wants a team. Not just a team. A unit. A cohesive, teamwork / skill-oriented UNIT. Because as any such gamer will know, skill alone does not make a 2200 Ranked 5v5 team. Chemistry, teamwork, communication, pure skill, ‘in-depth game knowledge’. These are all things that make up a professional League of Legends team. We cater to this player extensively as well.

Or perhaps you’re somewhere in the grey zone between these two types of players. That’s fine too! There’s a place for everyone here at wD Gaming!

Got friends? Love playing LoL every night with them? We love to accommodate groups of applicants as well! Our community has very reasonable requirements / bylaws to accommodate all types of gamers.

**Why should I join wD? Great question! Here’s why:**


We currently have 100+ registered users across multiple divisions. Roughly 60 of those are active.
Daily hangout with our extensive and diverse community.
An extremely welcoming community. Great place to have some fun!
We are active in many time zones as well! EST , CST, MST, PST are our main zones (North America). Lots of latenight gamers as well!
Teamspeak 3 server with constant slot increases: wdgaming.ts.nfoservers.com
League of Legends mentoring by our 1800+ players.
IT related advice / services. Very skilled designers / developers / repair technicians in-house.



**What are wD Gaming’s expansion plans?**

We are planning to organize weekly tournaments with prizes going to the winning team. (ex. 100-200$ of RP)
In-house scrims every second day, randomizing the teams and playing just for the fun of it
Custom game modes that we are planning to create. (Ex- Modified versions of ARAM, Teemo Hunt, etc.)

**What differentiates wD Gaming from the myriad of other communities out there?**


We are currently in the process of developing a premium subscription-based donation system. Our professional developer is approaching the middle of his development-cycle. This system will be implemented with a strict NO to the ‘pay-to-win’ philosophy (RE: Combat Arms, Shaiya, etc etc). At the same time, members who help to support wD Gaming with our many associated costs of running, will be compensated quite handsomely in comparison to similar communities.

Our clan members are (for the most part, RE: Diversity! :P) extremely friendly / accommodating people who love gaming. Although, even if you’re a quiet person who just wants to game and not be bothered, we work with that too! We’ve got lots of quiet gaming channels to accommodate that!
We have extremely active administrators for all of our divisions / servers. We go out of our way to help new and existing members alike! 

**Competitive LoL in wD Gaming:**


Now that I’ve been over how warm and fuzz and awesome our community is, let me get to the serious competitive aspect.
Looking for a team? Think you’re the best ADC in your elo? Well that’s great! However, we are recruiting for a variety of personality traits, not just skill. Review the list below to see if you’d be a good fit:

Skilled
Teamwork / Chemistry
Overall knowledge of game mechanics
+1700 ELO (We use a mix of Top Rating / Current Rating to satisfy this requirement)
Activity. We practice / scrim daily.



That being said, our only currently open spot on our main team is Jungle. Although, with enough interest we will most definitely manage multiple teams. The ELO requirements is non-negotiable and at full admin discretion.

With league of legends season 3 adding the new top 32 teams, the possibilities are endless, and with strong communication and mechanics, anyone with the proper requirements can make it up there!

Requirements:

- Over 17 years of age from the beginning of the season(Riot's Rule)
- 1800+ elo(some exceptions)
- Have a team-above-self mentality.  We are looking for team players, be able to make plays FOR the TEAM not for YOURSELF.
- Positive attitude throughout the game and ability to give/receive constructive critisism without getting emotionally involved.
- If you are a top laner, have the ability to win your lane or AT LEAST go neutral EVERY SINGLE GAME(this is not hard to do if you think while you play).  We don't need people who want to showboat or try to impress us.  We want someone who has consistency and expert knowledge of their lane.
- Be active and able to play from 5 - 10 cst every week day. Also availability on sunday is key as we participate in Go4LoL.

Add LG Doctor Sick in game for an interview ONLY if you meet these requirements.

* Other Roles: Ezreal, Corki, Ashe, Katarina, Lee Sin, Malphite, Jax, Olaf, Irelia, Vladimir, Nocturne
* Strengths: Most flexible role and champion wise, fantastic map awareness, wards EVERYTHING, great knowledge of the game's strategy

We are looking for a Top player. These are other requirements/expectations for anyone willing to join us.

* Respectful and open to criticism
* Good communication skills: You should have good map awareness, ward, and call MIAs, etc. You should also be willing to give out any criticism on your mind. We'll always listen.
* Diverse champion pool: You should be able to play many solo top champions and be willing to learn new champs
* Flexibility: We would like you to be able to play at least one other role as well as top, so we can change our team comps and picks depending on the situation.
* Age: Anywhere around the ages of 15-20 is ok. It just makes you easier to relate to; we're all around 17. :P
* Timezone: We all live on the east coast. This allows for better scheduling
* Commitment: We don't know how far we can or will go. Ideally a season 4 championship would be epic, but our goal is to put a winning and competitive team together. We need committed players who can give our team enough time out of their days.
* ELO and skill: Doesn't matter too much. As long as you are a decent player who is open to getting better, there is room on our team for you.

That's basically it. You can contact me here or in a PM. My IGN is Narglepuff so feel free to friend me and let me know when you are available.

Have you been wanting to join a team with high aspirations of breaking out in competitive tournament scene? Do you have the dedication and mentality it takes to stick through the thick and thin of things? If so, then we are looking for individuals like you!    


**History of myself**  


I myself have been on a few ranked teams with the mindset that playing in ranked team will improve my play in other parts of the game. It has and I’m glad I’ve had those opportunities. My past teams fell off though because of lack of drive. I want this team instead to have great drive to strive for the highest that we as a team can muster. Accomplishments by myself and past teams are that I placed in quarter finals in a few tournaments (not go4lol we only won a few matches there against plat people, mainly smaller tournaments) with my team and also have played with many platinum players in scrims and such. I feel like that experience has made me a better player and has increased my drive to play this as well as perfect my play. Currently I am on hiatus because of school and have taken a few weeks break before the season 3 changes. With this team I plan on coming back very hard and playing for very large amounts of time. With that being said lets talk about the team goal.    


**Team Goal**  


Our goal is to find a ‘core’ group of 5 players that are willing to do what it takes to climb up the competitive ladder in hopes of reaching a professional level of play. I want this to be not just a team, but a family of sorts. I believe that in order to compete with other professional teams, it takes more than just playing games together. Bonding with your teammates is key. Getting to know one another in and out of the game.    


**Requirements**  


I am not here to set a standard and with that being said anyone can apply. The one thing I can’t stress enough though is that you NEED to have the willingness and desire to reach the goals put in place. If you can’t take constructive criticism, take time out to watch your replays and learn from your mistakes, as well as adhering to a strict practice schedule, then this isn’t a team for you.    


**Recruitment**  


Recruitment will be starting during this week and will continue until I post a closing date on this post. I will want to play at least 3-5 games with each person that qualifies to try out. Please have skype. I will purchase a mumble or vent server if necessary once we get started. IF THE RECRUITMENT FORM ISNT FILLED OUT WE WILL NOT ADD YOU IN GAME.    


**Edit: If you have a friend you play really well with (ie. Bot lane comp etc.) and want to try out as a pair, please let me know.

Nu spelen we sinds september op de EU server. En zijn wij op zoek naar 2 mensen. Zodat we met jullie regelmatig een 5v5 Ranked kunnen gaan spelen. Op het moment zijn wij nog niet alle 3 lvl 30. Maar dit is geen probleem aangezien we toch even met jullie moeten oefenen of dat het lekker samenwerkt.

Wat Zoeken wij?

Wij zijn op zoek naar 2 spelers -17- en ouder -Wij zoeken mensen voor de bezetting van Ap-Mid of Jungle, -Wij willen dat je geintresseerd bent in wat je speelt. Dus je volgt je rol, kijkt wat beter werkt, en speeld ook -champions wat werkt binnen het team. -Het liefst zoeken wij een Duo dat elkaar al kent. -Ook willen wij dat als we met zijn 5e zijn dat het team voorgaat en dat je dus niet met anderen een potje speelt. -Headset,Dit is vereist omdat we Skype Gebruiken

With a couple blunders over the last few months of trying to join failing teams I've decided to try to put one together myself hoping to find a full group of like minded players. A little about myself before I talk about how I would like the group to run in a perfect setting. I've been playing League for nearly a year now, having played mostly normal games (some success in soloque but did not play much in S2 hoping to start S3). I have a fair amount of 5v5 experience with a fair amount of my normal games being with a full group of strong players, and also playing on ranked 5v5 teams (highest 1420 elo) Nearly all my free time lately has been dedicated to grinding League so I take the game somewhat serious, and I try to be studious about the game in general. With a tryhard attitude I'm not an uptight prick about anything, don't rage, love playing, ect. ect.

Hopefully a few people on this subreddit can relate to my general experiences with league and want to get something started with me. Here are some general expectations/goals I have in mind for players and the team.

* Be self motivated! I want players who genuinely love this game. I want everyone to be passionate about what they do.

* Be passionate about your role! I don't want a support player who is playing support because he can't find a team who will have him playing mid. This goes the same vice versa, but you get the idea. I'm looking for players who study their lanes, and understand the meta behind it all.

* Practice Practice Practice. Looking for players who are already giving up a good chunk of time grinding on their own. I would like to have a SOLID practice schedule once a few members join, and we can work something out. My schedule is pretty open so I am flexible on what times.

* Looking for long term goals. I don't want this team to play a few games over the course of 2 weeks and then call it quits because we lost 3 games in a row. I want to build a long term relationship with a group. You're not signing a contract or anything by joining.... but hopefully you're not looking to hit it and quit it.

* No rage, I hope this goes without saying... constructive feed back and an open dialogue about what our weakness's will be what happens.

* Headsets are pretty much a requirement for preforming on a higher level.... Skype/TS/Mumble/Vent I don't care really.

That's all I can think of for now, hopefully I can get some talk going with a few of you and we can start this project up! Questions comments ect. can be left here or in Reddit mailbox. If you are interested just leave a little info here about yourself and what you think you can bring to a team. I will give EVERYONE a tryout now as I'm finding a solid core for the group.

Enmity Gaming is recruiting serious and talented individuals for our ranked 5s team going into season 3. Last season, we achieved a ranked record of 10-2 and were 1650 rated. We did not play enough games and we did not take it as seriously as I would have liked. Going into this season, we will be dedicating more time and effort to developing ourselves as a team and coming up with unique compositions and strategies.

A little bit about ourselves; all of us have had competitive gaming experience in the past. Whether it be competitive raiding in WoW or CAL-x experience in FPS shooters. We are dedicated to being and playing the best we can.

What we are looking for in potential prospects; willingness to adapt and learn new champions to fit team compositions, someone who can listen to directives and execute, be aggresive and take the lead when playing a champion who needs to make big plays in order to be effective and ultimately someone who can work in the team environment and self analyze to maximize their gameplay and efficiency. Please be skiled and willing to learn. Skype/TS/Vent/Mumble is a must, depending on what we decide to use.

We are currently recruiting for jungle, top lane and support roles. Please leave the following information below and we will be in contact with you in order to perform a quick assessment and trial runs with respective candidates.

Age : 25
Timezone: PST
Available Play - times: Whenever
Role Strength in Order : ADC~Mid~Top~Support~Jungle
I've ran my own team to 1800 ELO as being the primary start caller
My Stream : http://www.twitch.tv/so_sleepyy

What I am looking for in a team
1 - Dedicated Practice Schedule
2 - The Desire to participate in s3 path to tournament (with top 5 placement goals)

What I'm not looking for
1 - Forming a new team ( this may be an option, but its a long shot)
2 - A team that is not dedicated to practicing multiple hours a day, multiple days of the week over the next 2 months in preparation for season 3.
3 - A low elo team, no offense to low elo players however with the tournament in 1.5 months I do not think it will be smart of me to pursue a low elo team at this time.

I am 16 years old and for the past 2 years i am mostly playing supports which is my main role. I play lol since May 2010.

What can i offer:
Perfect skill orders, runepages (20) and mastery pages for champions that i pick.
Adapting own itembuilds for max performance.
Common sense which is not so common anymore ...
Years of experience.
Decent posibilities to swap champions (75 champions owned)
No derping around if we get weak opponents ... always tryhard.
No meaningless raging or flaming.
Communication, theorycrafting, teamplay, consistency.
Ability to make relevant calls for the role i play.

I like playing all the usual supports (Taric, Sona, Janna, Soraka, Leona, Blitz, Lulu, Nunu, Ali). 
Of course when Riot release a new support it will be instabought, instalearned and added to the roster.
As for the support Lux, Zyra, Morg, Fiddle ... i do not like supporting with those so do not expect to see me playing them unless Riot decides to buff them to release Xin Zhao state.

What do i expect:
Pretty much same thing as what i can offer and at least 16 years old members and all gold rated or above in S2 soloq for obvious reasons(I know my elo sucks but as you know it is hard to carry a team as support).
I prefer TS3, but i can adapt if necessary. As for the practices i can play whenever as long as i know one day in advance.
And, like i said in the title, i want to participate in Go4LoL weekly and besides that i look for a team that can practice about 20 hours in the remaining 6 days.



Last words ... i do not expect to find the team overnight. I am patient. Unless i can fit in 100% i do not think i will be able to enjoy it.

Hey guys, what's up? We're a set of brothers that are looking to make a name for ourselves come Season 3. We're looking for a top, mid and support that are team oriented, and interested in practicing daily, theorycrafting and practicing team compositions together, roughly 10-15 hours a week.

**Team Name**: The Dire Wolves

**Team Members**: 

**Jyorn** (AD) 1430~ Elo current with a 1600 top. Owns all AD and supports but Caitlyn, farms hard

**Zaccu** (Jungler) 1200~ Elo current with a 1230 top. Owns most junglers, excels at duelists junglers

**Kasi** (Support) 1237~ Elo current with 1240 top. Owns most supports, excels at aggressive supports.

**About Us**: We've played games together for awhile, mostly WoW raiding and PvP, but have been involved in League for about two years. After seeing the opportunities that are available come Season 3, its only felt fitting to try and put together a team of people that are willing to put in the effort to become a reckoning force in Season 3.

**What we expect from you**:

**Top** - 4-6 champion pool (more would be nice, but must start somewhere). Knows how to initiate, has good map presence and overall, knows how to team fight.

**Mid** - An aggressive player with map awareness, that is willing to roam and either assist other lanes, or create havoc throughout the jungle with our current jungler.


**Our visions/goals**: For Season 3, we want to take the challenger circuit by storm. We'll have less time to work together than most other teams that will be running for it, but our time involved and spent time together practicing, and doing everything we can to step our game up will give us an edge. For every 3 or 4 hours of practice, we will strategize, talk team comps and overall feedback on each others play throughout the games. We'll be entering into all the tournaments available for us, as well as looking for other opportunities such as sponsors.

Must have Skype, working mic and time to dedicate.

By ""competent"" I am referring to the ability to recognize counters and play multiple champs accordingly.  Having conditional builds and a certain base level of skill is a given.

I started playing in season 2 and got into ranked play way too soon (and even without the appropriate runes [I have seven rune pages now &amp; about 30 champs]).  My Elo hit rock bottom and I got stuck there in my frustration.  But I have studied and practiced a lot since then and am confident that I can play at a much higher level in season 3.  I'd ask anyone interested in partnering with me to ignore my ridiculously bad Elo and give me a chance in a normal game.  I'd like to start practicing with a partner now in preparation for season 3.  

My primary roles are jungle&gt;support&gt;top&gt;adc&gt;ap mid.  I am very competent with at least two champs in the first three roles and am competent with Ezrael as ADC or Casseiopea as an AP mid.  

Obviously, with my limited skill as AP mid or ADC I am looking to queue with someone who is more capable in those roles -- but it would be good if you can fill in other roles when we get overruled by the rest of the team.  And then we can coordinate bans when one of us picks first so we can maximize our chances to win.  

I play most nights after dark and we can use with Ventrilo if you'd like (but I'm not very chatty).  Most nights I like to start with a normals game to make sure my internet connection is good.  

I'm also not a big griefer and expect to do pretty well with the new honor system.

I have started a team after posting [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/yo09w/euwkagemi_can3lf_teammatesranked_5v5_tournaments/), about a month ago. 
The team currently has a player for each position, but due to schedule incompatibilities and people being in and out, we cannot play games together as much as I'd like. That's why I'm looking for more people. 

I want the team to be able to play tournaments at least once a week (Go4LoL and perhaps others), and ranked games at least 2 or 3 times a week. So, if you're into that kind of thing, and fit into the type of player I described in my [first thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/yo09w/euwkagemi_can3lf_teammatesranked_5v5_tournaments/), join us :)

Also, below is something I wrote to my team when we started playing together. I think it is relevent for anyone who wants to join so I'll just copy it here.

&gt; From my experience it's very, very, very difficult to have a ""single setup"". There will ALWAYS - and I mean ALWAYS - be someone who has a birthday party, who has issues with his internet, who has found a new girlfriend/boyfriend, who has to study for exams, who got hooked into another game, or who will have a fight with another member of the team and they don't want to play together again, etc etc. 
&gt;
&gt; So I don't want the team to be limited to 5 players. I want to have 5 ""main players"", and a bunch of other players who can sub, in case one of the main players can't be there. But I don't want the subs to be like random people. I want everybody to know each other well enough, and be comfortable with each other. That's why I will be bring new people even if we are already 5 and having good games, and I will try to make it that everybody has played enough times with all the others.
&gt;
&gt; Also, you don't have to consider this team as ""exclusive"", in the sense that if you want to be part of another team, go ahead. I won't consider it like you're ""cheating"" on the team or anything. Because the truth is, perhaps after some time it will not work between us, so it's not bad if you have a back up team. Or perhaps there is another team out there better for you, with a better name, a better captain, a better organization, more skilled, more fun, more whatever. If you have other opportunities, just go for what's best for you =)
&gt;
&gt; If somehow I can bring the team to the finals of Season 3, I will, for sure :P 
&gt;
&gt; But right now, realistically, I don't know you guys very well yet, and I don't know your ambitions, I don't know how much you want to dedicate, nor how much you CAN dedicate to this game. Maybe you don't even know yourself. 
&gt;
&gt; It will take a couple of months before we figure things out. In the meantime, I will do what I can to get people to play together as much as possible.
&gt;
&gt; In the end we will see what is the combination of players that has the best synergy, and this combination will be the main team. Maybe I will be a sub, I don't know :D 
&gt; But whether you'll be main or sub, the most important is that we can improve together without being scared of failing, or trying out crazy things, and have lots of epic games with unforgettable moments. And that if someday, for some reason, you're not in the team anymore, you won't feel it was a waste of your time because you would have actually learned a lot :)

I have some people in mind so I dont think I'll be looking for people on this subreddit only.

Requirements

- dedication - willingness to improve the team together and play together

- knowledge - don't sign up for top when you actually play jungle just for the heck of it, only tell me that you're interested if you have sufficient knowledge in the role to a certain degree.

- time - willingly spending a few hours of a week to play with the team and practice together.

- skill - I'm looking for people around 1600 or higher.. to be honest having someone above 1900 elo makes me feel that people don't get along well together.. also the recent patch made you get matched with similar solo queue skills.

- Amiability - not raging/flaming/shit talking for mistakes, rather trying to fix it.

- MIC is preferable, someone who can play after 4PM PST

I'm looking for people to play serious ranked 5s with for season 3. In my opinion, solo queue elo doesn't matter as much in ranked teams after you get above 1600. People know how to cs, people know not to facecheck. It's the matter of strategy and execution of plans and decision making. The team might not make it to famous low tier teams like Team Orbit, but I would at least enjoy company of others with as much dedication I would like to put into the team.

I'm a young (22 is hopefully still young) aspiring gamer, maining support in League of Legends. I've won 1 Go4LoL competition and 1 local competition as support. I value my team over myself when it comes to teamfights, yet i am not reckless. I am always calculated, being a perfectionist by nature. I main Blitzcrank, Leona and Taric, but recently i have started to like /love Sona, Lulu and Nunu. Nunu is not really one of my least favourite supports, but he is more combo oriented (i.e. Ashe, Vayne, Kog'maw). I'm always willing to improve and get the best of what i'm doing. I am on EU-West at the moment, seeking a group of 4 players willing to go pro. If anyone is interested, i would gladly tryout for your team as a support. You can either PM me here or you could find me via skype (abnegation.sunstrider).

I do not ask for upvotes since i am in no way a ""lol-karma-whore-thingy"", just please do not downvote this for no reason.

P.S. I am fairly strong at playing AD aswell.

Edit: I play any AD except Cait, which i find rather poo at the moment.

Edit2: i have a lot of champions to switch, got runepages for everything, got a mic, got all communication programs (vent, skype, ts, mumble). I also want something more serious then just ranked 5v5 if people are up for it.

Edit3: as WasKE395 asked, i am gonna talk about my elo for a bit. 
I am currently ~1350 elo, highest on this account was 1446. It is physically impossible to carry your elo upwards by only playing support, eventho i tried. I've another account on EUNE @ around 1900 elo, but EUNE is just incredibly bad, i really want EUW, can log that one to prove stuff. On EUNE i've like never played support, reason the elo is high.
people will mostly not believe anyone that won competitions can suck @ elo, but solo/duo queue is just... well... solo/duo. The ammount of trolls is just sad.

Requirements-

Serious about improving oneself and playing on a team

A good knowledge of the game. 

Good natured. Raging is frowned upon but sometimes we all lose it. We ask that you are not jerks.

From our Team Captain ""Crisís"":
------
This is a Competitive Team.
I am looking for *SERIOUS, COMPETITIVE, DEDICATED, EXPERIENCED* and similar minded players to join up.


**About myself:**

* 3 years of playing LoL
* 2.2k elo main account (currently inactive)
* First place for 3 different online tournaments
* Multiple top 16 and once top 8 for Go4LoL
* Have been sponsored and still have contacts with them
* Have managed and built all of my previous teams
* Experience of pro-level games (scrims and matches vs pro teams)

I may not be the ""pro"" player but I am very experienced player for semi-professional league scene. 


I am not looking for players who are as experienced as me, as that case will be rare. I am looking for players who are SERIOUS DEDICATED COMPETITIVE and WILLING TO IMPROVE.

**Serious:**

* Take every game seriously
* Be positive
* Act professionally (no rage, no blames)
* Take criticism and accept, admit your mistakes

**Dedicated:**

* Be present for team matches
* Be active
* Be LOYAL

**Competitive:**

* Play to win
* Be willing to discuss (theory craft)
* Have great knowledge and mechanical skills

General Mind: - I have seen many players/teams that fall apart because they just do not have matching personalities and minds.

--Elo hell
If you believe in it, prob not the team for you. SoloQ may not be the good stand to judge someone but it should not be the excuse for being low elo. People who have skill to climb can climb up easily.

--Respect everyone, do not think you are the best (Don't be cocky and have excessive ego)
As it says, it just annoys and disrupsts team mentality


**I am looking for players who are specialized in specific role (meaning I will look at your ranked stats. not going to waste time on people who apply for multiple roles)** GOLD+ ONLY
-------------------
**Filled Positions:**

* AD Carry


If above interests you and if you fit into those requirements, please leave a post or add me for tryout
When you add me or leave a post, please inform me with the following
Your schedule
Why you want to join/ what you are looking for from this team

I'm a 1300 support looking for an Ad Carry who is higher elo than me. I only have 45 ranked games **(27w/18l)** played so I have a bit more to lose (or gain) when I play my games. I have a lot of games to play before I start plateauing and I'd like to find someone who is better than me to play with.

..


Some reasons you might want to consider playing with me:

• Fluent English speaker

• Not a moron

• Able to take a loss without raging

• Quick learner

• Great team player, always willing to take advice and constructive criticism

• I have my own vent but am willing to use any other voice chat client

..

Some reasons you might not want to play with me:


• I'm not perfect and I don't try to pretend I am.. not every game will end up with you dominating the lane with your pentakills of awesomeness. I'm all about competitive play but it's a damn game with people who are better than (and worse than) the both of us. Not looking for an endless rager or sore loser.

..

Thanks for making it this far. With all of that out of the way.. I adapt with my carry's playstyle but I love being aggressive, showing lane dominance, and getting into the opponents's heads. 

I main Janna, her current ranked stats are: **1.1k/2.7d/13.4a**

I'm **best** with Janna, Sona, Lulu, and Zilean.

I'm **proficient** with Soraka, Galio, and Blitzcrank (I land 95% of my grabs.. I amaze myself sometimes).

I very much dislike Taric.. very very much.

If you're interested in playing a normal or two and seeing where things go, awesome.. post or throw me a pm. I'm holding my summoner name to avoid the spams I've gotten in the past.

Truthfully, I can play just about any role, but I definitely play support far better than any role, so I choose to focus on that.

I'm not so cocky that I think I'm carrying entire games, but I can definitely make the plays during laning and during teamfights, regardless of which support I'm playing.

However, I do understand that I might not always get the opportunity to support. In that case, I tend to play a pretty decent jungle, AD carry, and occasionally mid.

Please, won't you join me by the fire? Treat yourself to a cup of tea. I enjoy earl grey with a wedge of lemon, but I'm not the snooty type to make judgments about people. I've never really enjoyed the taste of coffee: it leaves a chalky after-taste in the roof of my mouth which I find unpleasant, even when diluted with chocolate and confections at the Caribou, Starbucks or Tim Horton's. So there's my first point of divergence, perhaps, from many of you: tea, not coffee. I do enjoy the smell of hot coffee, though; but I digress.      

Subterfuge Gaming is a multi-game community looking to find competitive players to set up a ranked 5v5 team and participate in various other activities that include, but are not limited to:  
*Killing things.  
*Having fun.  
*Playing games.      

The community itself is mainly focused on playing GW2 (and is part of the Ascension Alliance), though it is not a requirement to join. The alliance will be hosting in-alliance tournaments, though we will likely still find stuff to do.     

What we are looking for in members:  
*Positive attitude.  
*Thick skinned. We in the community express our bottomless love for each other in weird ways. We're into that kind of stuff.  
*Common sense. Yes.  
*Microphone is an absolute must, preferably with not a high-pitched voice.

A long time League player and I have had enough with random players and which to seriously improve with the right players. This means, we're dedicated, mature, self-sufficient and fun! 

**What we're after**

* 3 players that are casual in the sense that they don't play all day every day, though, between comfortable Oceanic hours (Australia). Doesn't exactly have to be specific times; we play odd or usual hours.

* Any role; we wish to improve on all aspects with every champion and mechanic. Second player in our team prefers mid but doesn't mind.

* English speaking / No Brazilians :P

* Confident to converse on Skype, strategise and input to the discussion.

* North American server 

* Looking to have fun

Probably worth mentioning: We are low ELO, 1200 +/- between us both, which means we are out to seriously improve and gain significant progress, 1600+

Best of all we're still noobs and that's why were here, looking for other noobs to to get BETTER!

Two friends and I are looking to create a semi-formal Ranked 5's team. What is Semi-formal you ask? Well. We don't want to set exact times for when we get together and play. No “Saturday at 7PM EST” or similar constraints. The premise is that when the group is online and playing League, that we jump into Ranked 5's together. Simple, no?

So first the things you want to know:

-Ez Bake Loven, Ahkrisa, MistPanther; Look us up if you wish.

-We're all guys in our early twenties.

-Our timezones are spread from Pacific to Eastern. 

-We use Skype as our primary form of communication.

-We play pretty often, mostly in the evening. 

-The three of us are 1500-1600 in Solo Queue. 

-We have a dedicated bottom lane duo, Ahkrisa and Ez Bake Loven

-MistPanther will be playing Mid or Jungle. 

-Therefore we are looking for a Top Laner, and a Jungler OR Mid, not both.

-We want people who are open to constructive criticism, improving themselves and adapting.

-The ability to play multiple champions with differing team comp roles(AP/Bruiser/Tank tops, etc) is required. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Interested people can respond here, or hit up Ahkrisa on the League client. At that point we'd like to chat a bit and then get into 2-3 games to get to know each other and see if its a good match. Its important that on top of being a good player we click as a group in terms of personalities, as well as playstyle. If its not working for us, we'll politely let you know and we can all move on.

Team:

Team GSO has been together and playing competitively for about 6 months, but have been playing LoL and other games together for a long time. We have access to a TeamSpeak 3 server along with two HD streamers. We currently have 5 members, but our AD carry just got a new job and can't keep the time commitments required to keep up with the meta and rapidly improve.

Activity:

We are currently in the Alienware NA battleground Invite Division and Tied for 1st place in our NESL open division. We have also regularly play in smaller tournaments as they become available. Once roster issues are settled we WILL be participating in Go4LoL's on a weekly basis. Our Ranked team Elo sits around 1400. If our elo is a problem please do not post.


Goals:

Simple. We're looking to improve as much and as fast as we can to go as far as we can in the LoL competitive scene.


=====================================

Minimum Requirements:

- We're looking for one more player to fill out the roster. You will need TeamSpeak 3 (free,) a working mic/headset and be at least 18 years of age.

- MUST MAIN AD CARRY ROLE!!!!

- Ideally you will have had experience in one of or both of these roles in a competitive setting (Ranked 5's, Go4LoL, other tournaments, etc.) You should also own all the champions viable to the role. (IE. Support - Sona, Soraka, Alistar, Janna at a minimum)

Time and Scheduling:

- We play weekdays approximately 7PM EST to 10PM EST. Go4LoL tournaments start at 3PM EST every Sunday. Anyone interested MUST be availble these times more often then not. That being said, your time zone or location is not important to us as long as you are available.

- We normally do not have any ""scheduled"" play on Saturday nights. However, this does not mean we won't be casually playing or that we may not schedule something here and there.

Attitude:

- This is probably the most important thing. We're looking for people who LISTEN. You must listen and quickly react to in-game calls and instructions without hesitation. We value all of our team members opinions, and it's ok to question calls or decisions, but it should be done AFTER the game, not in the moment.

- You must be able to learn from mistakes and take steps to not repeat them. This includes accepting constructive criticism and advice on builds, gameplay, etc. This is the fastest way to improve.

- We always try and have a good time so being able to take a joke is pretty necessary. That being said, the quickest way to the exit is raging. Don't do it.

Me and a friend have been in the makings of a ranked team for a while, looking for ways to get better. We both have very good knowledge of the game, the meta, mechanics, etc. The problem is, finding people who are on the same level, willing to learn at the same pace, or faster.

I myself play AP mid. My most successful champions, to list a few, would be Veigar, Brand, Vlad, Viktor, and Ziggs. In about that order.

As for my friend, he is unsure what to play. The best way to describe him, is somebody who is trying to find out what he wants. He is nervous about jungling, doesn't AP mid due to it being my sort of thing,  knows everything he has to do to be a good AD Carry, can solotop, and likes feeling like he can help as a support. His better champions are Caitlyn (AD Carry), Maokai (Solotop), Blitzcrank/Nunu (Support).

What we are looking for are skilled players who have a sense of humor, a vast knowledge of the game and its meta, and people who believe they can excel in a team environment.

What we are looking for: Somebody who can play one or multiple of the following: Jungler, Support, AD Carry, Solotop.

The only downfall to applying is that if my partner decides on a role to stay in, we will have to work around it. I am trying to find out with him for sure.

I've found (probably not to anyone else's great surprise) that what has improved my game above anything else has been simply playing the game lots and lots and lots. 

So I'm looking for a team that above all plays and practices a lot. Obviously i have other stuff in my life so having some days off a week is very important but i am looking to be practicing 3/4 days with a team that is fairly serious about competing in GO4LoL's and other such tournaments. 

Now why would you want me on such a team? Well i main support, in fact i exclusively play support (i can jungle very badly if needed to) and am very comfortable in the role. My best champions are Soraka/Janna with Sona/Nunu being my very good backups. As stated above I play the game a lot so can commit to extensive practice sessions. I'm very comfortable with the game mechanics/items and like to come up with different builds and combinations depending on the situation. You might notice that i don't play any kill lane supports (Ali/Leona/Taric) and this is because i find that in solo que you just don't have enough communication between the AD and you to pull that stuff off effectively - i am very willing to try learning some of these champs if the team wants it.

Personality wise I'm a pretty chill guy in his mid twenties who likes to party hard when the occasion (and cash) allow it. Competitive gaming is one of the few things that actually gets any adrenaline flowing through my lazy veins but even then you won't find me raging etc because things didn't go my way. 

Oh and also i totally want some decent people to try Ashe support with - it looks like it can work well.

Edit - i just realised i should add my summoner name which is 'Kryton13' so you can look up my stats etc if you want to.

I'm currently unranked, only having played 2 ranked games, but looking to get into ranked soon.

I'm looking for either a fun or serious team, either one will be fine. I would appreciate constructive feedback/criticism, but I'm not looking for elitism, or to be flamed/blamed; so if your team is easy-going and forgiving, and cares more about the fun of playing, I'd love to join.

I'm willing to play any role needed; my two strongest roles are top and AD bot, weakest being jungle, but I'm certainly willing to play and improve on any role necessary. I have a wide variety of champions for every single role.

In terms of playstyle; I like to play very passive and safe early, then going aggressive later on. I often play very safe champions that tend to win the lane; and if I'm losing my lane, I play very passive and just farm up and try my best to not be killed. I try my best to work with my team, and often play team-oriented champions.

My name is Jay, I am 15 years old in high school (sophomore) and me and my friend have decided to create a team that wants to be dedicated and serious. I am currently 1378 elo with Ap main being my strongest point. I know i'm young and that most of the LoL community looks down on 15 year old's saying that we are noisy and immature. I look at myself to be one of the rare mature one's who actually dedicate themselves to becoming better at this game. I have been playing for around two years now and i see myself as a solid player, but i know that i can improve.

 We want to create a team that knows when to be serious, and knows when to have fun. We live in the east coast so our time zone is EST, and we would like people who are compatible with our play times ( which is from around 5-9 every weekday and more in the weekends). I take criticism very seriously and try to improve my game as much as possible. I seldom rage and when one of the few times that i do get a little mad over a mistake of mine then i apologize. As i said before i mostly always play ap mid and my friend plays anything really. If a particular role is needed then he will dedicate himself to that role. I have skype and a mic so that isn't an issue with me. I know that my ELO isn't the highest, but i work hard on trying to improve it. I shot up 150 elo~ in about 2 weeks and i'm certain that if i grind it out, i can reach even higher.
I just started playing again after about a 1-2 week break so sorry if i don't do that well, my match history reflects that i am out of practice &gt;&lt;

We are looking to play ranked 5's and climb the ladder once we have a full stable roster going and maybe even Go4LoL's after that. In order for us to do this, we need players that can practice with us daily. Having a mic is a necessity and we want people who don't rage out for every little thing. There is no ELo requirement, because we do not believe ELO is an accurate measure of skill.

* We are a US West based team, but that does not rule out any other time-zone. 

* Semi-Serious for now.

*  We are looking to get better as a team(Not win right away)

*  We are looking for competent, chill, fun and mature members.

*  You must be able to take critique.

* Must be willing to practice on a regular basis(Not strictly enforced, but cooperation is needed)

* Recommended Elo range is 1300-1700, exceptions will be made if you're cool, have potential and you want to improve. Higher Elo DOES NOT guarantee a spot if you do not posses any of the qualities we are looking for.

*  When we have a solid and stable roster, I will begin to record Mumble communications and games(To improve team comms)

* I also have ~2k Elo friends/mentors who will help me watch and improve team dynamics  

* Once we feel confident enough, we will enter tournaments regularly(Go4LoL, Alienware Arena, etc.)

We know how to play several roles, but to be honest none of us brights at support also none of us are willing to do it. Except me, but I hate it to be honest. I only play support when we get a random that is unwilling to do it. 

So requisites are:

Level 25 at least so we can get into rank later, by the time I guess you will be 30. We play almost every day, we usually start at 4 pm PST. 

No ragers. Skype is a must to make jokes and laugh when I play Brolaf drinking beer and go berserker.

No ragers. Did I say it twice? That's because it's the most important thing. No ragers. It's a game, just chill and enjoy.

If you only play Sona (for example) that's cool, if you play every single support in the game it's cool too. 

Anyway, whoever answers first gets to play. Since we are not pros, or even a ranked team, we won't do tryouts. Just need a fifth man because we are tired of getting randoms insta-locking and shit.

Teamspeak and a working microphone is a necessity because we're pretty much always on there and we use it for comms in games.

You also have to know the basics of playing AD carry, so things like last hitting, lane control, how to harass properly (with auto attacks as well as spells) and you need to be able to get along with our support, as well as the rest of the team obviously, but having a good connection in bot lane is pretty essential but that comes with time so we aren't expecting anything sudden.

My summoner name is attached to my Reddit name if you'd like to check me out.

I'll blab a bit about myself and then lay out what I am looking for, so thanks in advance for reading!


-About Me-
I've played League off and on (mostly off) for about a year. I started with friends but they had no interest in improving so I got a bit tired of playing with them. I then discovered I loved to play Support but that has the drawback of making solo queue awful. So that is the basis of my looking for some people to play with.

Personally I try very hard to put zero emotion into this game. LoL community is 99% poison so getting involved with in game talks only gets that poison into your system. I just focus on the game and let talkers talk, I'm not one of them.

I also play very passive. Aggression is what sets a great player apart from all others but it also backfires a lot, especially for those not so god tier players. I see a lot of people get into trouble because they think you have to be aggressive to be good and it often loses them the lane. Lose lane, lose game.

Personally I am a 23 year old IT Major in Arizona, I typically play evenings through the night due to work and school. Plus I sleep in a lot. :p


-Looking For-
I am looking for an AD to duo with or a team to play with. I am not looking for another role to duo with because it doesn't benefit as much  from the increased communication.

If you're an AD, you need to really be an AD. This means most games you AD, I understand not all because sometimes roles are taken.

If a team you must have dedicated team play times and understand overall team strategy, such as specific picks for a comp.

In any case I want to play with students of the game. Although I have not played much lately (just AI games for the daily IP) I read and watch a TON of LoL. This means I have good understanding of the game in terms of builds, positioning and objectives. I want to play with others who have that and follow the game, not just play it.

Ideal person/people to play with would be educated on LoL, not trollish/ragey and with a focus on getting better. Losing or winning isn't relevant to me in a game as long as I got better and feel like I played my best, one cannot control the actions of 4 other people.

So feel free to reply or add me. Please don't tell me to add you, just add me and say hello. I will be available to play games starting Sunday and I have no problem being tested out to make sure I'm not awful. Also feel free to ask me questions if you have any!

Hey guys, We are a team of players ranging in age from 19-27 who play MOST nights and have been playing for about a year now.  We are soon looking in to doing Ranked 5 Man's and want to lock down a couple more people!

Earthmover (myself): Jungle mostly but sometimes AD carry - 

Ghost Hiram: Solo Top - 

Rogelnaut: Support mostly, sometimes AP Mid when needed -

Crookie Tusk: will play everything but doesnt play as much as the rest of us.

TL;DR: we would like to score 2 members, an AP Mid player and either someone really stong as AD carry or support.

We play together on Skype and will be streaming once we start the ranked mayhem.... we are fun dude's who just want to put a whooping on people without some random troll ruining games.  

If all goes well we will be looking into starting to participate in go4lol's once the team make up is set.

Current Season 2 elo: 1419

Availability: Weekends are free, I work a 9-5 job so generally available between 6-1am on weekdays. 

Background: 26 y/o, played DotA until I followed Guinsoo over to League of Legends. 

Roles/Skills: I play team support roles very well, focusing on rounding out team comp and counter-picking the enemy team rather than snatching my favorite solo carry. Given that, I have spent far more time playing bottom support or jungling than in any other role. I occasionally run solo tops with my favorite junglers (Trundle and Skarner top solo are powerful laners too) when the team comp requires it. 

Favorite supports: Soraka (100% wins in solo queue ranked with her); Taric (counters the squishy supports fairly well); Sona (a bit boring, but easy wins); Kayle (omfg, I carry games with this sh!t); Leona (with a reliable AD carry, this is a very aggressive combo)

Junglers when I need to: Trundle; Rammus; Skarner; Udyr

When playing support, there is lots of time to watch the mini-map, and I play this game with both strategy and tactics in mind, so I am a good play-caller by nature (a lot of times, you gotta lead in solo ranked to win), and I run through champ select with a strong sense of how to counter the enemy team, if your team can benefit from that.

- Decent game knowledge; ward placement/CV/timers/itemization/last hits etc  
- Maturity, sure we're all abit immature and like to have fun/joke around, but at the end of the day, no one wants to play with someone that QQs in chat about lag or luck every time they die... sometimes you were just outplayed or made a bad decision :P

**AD: Caitlyn, MF, Graves and Ashe**

A little about me and my team and I,  **Zeryl**: I've been playing League since release and I've always stuck to normals with my friends since the beginning, I recently had sort of an epiphany with LoL and told myself that this is something I'm pretty good and and I'd like to get better at. My favorite characters are Lee Sin, Nocturne, Udyr and Riven.

My Solo Top/Bruiser/Tank player, **Raeli**: He is a very good player, he's been playing around the same time as me and I'd say honestly that his knowledge of the game is better than mine, his positioning is good and he pulls off some pretty clutch shit most of the time. His favorite characters are: galio, cho, singed, jax, nasus and he is also an ex-WoW superstar rogue or something.

My Support player, **Razor**: is more or less the backbone for my friends and I his knowledge of the game always surprises me. He's always spot on with jungle timers, dragon and baron. His ward placement and timing is superior to any support I've ever seen. If you're playing the AD Carry and you lane with him, you won't lose and that I can promise. His favorite characters are Sona, Janna, Taric and Leona.

I'm a very competitive player when it comes to eSports games and this season I am really looking to work closely with a partner who plays at the same time as me to climb the ELO ladder. Please only reply to this if you seem like minded and are serious about playing together constantly to improve our ELO and skill level. 



Below I will post a little bit about myself, what I play, when I play, and my current ELO bracket. ***I am up for playing normals first if you want to try me out or to see if we will play well together as a duo que team***.




***What I play***


***AD Carry:*** This is one of my strongest roles. I’m an excellent farmer and almost always win my lane if I have a good support champion in lane with me. In matches I am usually the highest CS. I’ve been accused  of having tunnel vision when it comes to farming, but I like to farm. The champions I can play are:  Caitlyn, Ashe, Vayne, MF, Kog’Maw, Graves, Urgot in that order according to experience with them and my comfortable level of skill.


***Jungle:***  I started off LoL as a jungler and still like to Jungle WW to this day. I’ve had great success as jungle Rammus and Lee Sin. I play a good Noctourne. Right now jungle Rammus is my go to jungle pick. I hate jungling fiddle. Strongest champs; Rammus, Lee Sin, WW, GP, Noct.


***AP Carry:***  Karthus was one of the first champions I ever picked up and I’m still surprisingly good with him, though I have yet to play a match with him this season in ranked. My solo laning isn’t as strong as I’d like it but Karthus is my go to pick for AP. Strongest champs; Karthus, Malz, Akali, Brand, Annie


***Support:*** I don’t like it that much because I hate having to rely on other people to carry me, but I’m surprisingly good if I have a good AD carry. Strongest:  Sona, Blitz. Soraka, Janna, GP


***Solo Top:*** Weak point. I haven’t got to practice this much because someone else always seems to be doing it. I am however a very good farmer so I don’t imagine I’d have to much of a problem. Picks: Irelia, Cho, Galio.



***Play Times &amp; Elo***


***Elo 1400:*** I fell into a hardplace already. I think I’m 10-6 at this point from solo queing. 3/3 wins on Cait, 2/2 wins on Lee Sin, 2/3 WW but I’d have to check the rest of my stats to see where I fell off at.



***Play times are 8AM EST-9PM EST***. I work a midnight shift for the US Navy so I can play anytime I’m not working. Hit me up in game and lets see if we can get something started.



***Note*** 

I know this set-up isn’t very pretty but I kind of rushed it. I just want to get in there and play and climb this ELO!

Calm, never rage quits, never/rarely feeds (1200's)",3,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/l6hor/na_looking_for_ladder_partner_calm_never_rage/,"I currently Haven't played a ladder game in Season 2 yet But I played around a dozen games in season 1 to get to around mid 1300's. I decided to play more solo queues to get better first and Now I'm looking for a partner.


**[Pros]** 
. I rarely go negative in KD.

. Even rarer do I feed.

. Knows how to CS

. Values Assists + Team Plays/Winning more than getting fed

. Will never yell at a partner/BM or Rage quit.

. Good with many champions, atleast 2/3 from all roles.

. Knows when to retreats/push and how to target well in a fight



**Cons** [I'm certainly not perfect :p]


. I may miss out on some possible kills due to trying play safe. Not stupid kill misses but opportunities to gauge tower-diving and such.

. Not exactly extremely good at any 1 champions (Except Nidalee, but she rarely fits in a team). I usually just pick the role our team needs.

. I don't really know how to counter pick against the enemy team or what champions have good synergy.


**Wants**

.Just a partner who isn't ragey and plays with decent skills or is willing to learn.


I have skype, Vent, Teamspeak and Mumble!

I can play any class, but would rather not jungle.
I can Solo Top as a couple of champions.
I can AP Mid all casters (Anivia is my favorite)
I can AD Bot with most carries (Ashe/Trist/Cait being top 3)
I can also support with a number of heroes, tho I enjoy that only slightly more then jungling :)

I'm looking to start a team for season 2. A bit about myself. I've been playing LoL now for over a year, really enjoyed the team work aspect. I've played in tournaments including IvyLoL and the weekly Go4LoL. The team I was on recently is slowing things down, so I'd thought I'd start my own team. 

I main AD Carry: Vayne, Cait, Ashe, Corki, Trst, MF (not a great kog/ez player lol)

I'm around 1400, and I'm looking for cool people to practice with.

I'm a huge fan of unorthodox strategies, so I'd really like our team to be innovative in terms of our meta (getting a bit tired of the current meta anyways). But yeah if your lvl 30 and interested in trying out, I'd be happy to play a couple of games with you guys.

None of the roles are set in stone, so don't be put off if you only play AD carries. 

I'm from Cali, so PST practices usually on weeknights 7pm PST
also, I'd like us to start registering for Go4LoL ASAP.

So please add me IGN: imperfection1031 and/or reply to this thread
I'll try to be on tonight at 7PST.

 3. For your work you will receive 1/6th of the money of any prize pools we win in any tournaments.

 **IF YOU ARE MANAGER APPLYING THEN YOU DONT HAVE TO FILL OUT ANY FORMS SIMPLY STATE YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A MANAGER AND WHAT YOU PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH, HOW YOU PLAN TO MANAGE THE TEAM, STRATEGIES, ETC.**

 Please leave your IGN so I may contact you in game. Do not directly contact me


**TEAM MEMBER TRYOUT SECTION**

**What you can expect from me**

 Hello fellow summoners, my IGN is ThePotatoCannon, and am starting a new 5v5 ranked team looking to compete at a high level and play in Go4LoL tournaments. So you know what you are getting as a Jungle, I have competed on a numerous amount of teams winning tournaments such as Go4Lol and z33ks. My aspirations have usually been too big for my teammates so I have decided to make a team with Thornsofmisery. I have spent the last half a year focusing on game knowledge (understanding comps, picks and bans, etc...) to help with my shot calling in the game. The account I am currently playing on is Diamond 4 with me reaching as high as Diamond 3 (before I took a 2 month break awhile ago).

**What I expect from you**

 To play on this team and be in consideration you MUST be at least Diamond V, no exceptions. Next, you must be able to practice at least 2-3 times on weekdays and most weekends, for at least 4ish hours depending on people's schedule, obviously teamspeak/skype/ventrilo/dolby axon and a working mic is a necessity. Summoners applying must have a specific set of champions, and be able to trade with others in a draft pick scenaro. I am a very ambitious person, and I plan on creating a team that slowly will improve together and compete at the top level of League of Legends. There will be no toleration for raging, constant blaming, and put downs. If you can not receive constructive criticism or moments of tension between players this is not the team for you. I am looking for positive attitude players with the will to spend time to focus on getting better, not just simply playing and accepting an average performance.

**General Road map for how team will operate once tryouts are over**

 Monday-Friday: 4 hour practices/scrimmages 2-3 days of the week

 Weekends: Go4lol's on sunday as well as a minor tournament on Saturday

 After every game: Review and replay of game to see where we went wrong and what we can do to improve as a team in both communication and skill


**Player Attributes and further expectations**

 The applicant must have these attributes if applying:

 -Time

 -Focus

 -Positive Attitude

 -Sense of humor

 -Student of the game and his/her role

 -Willingness to learn from mistakes 

 -Ward placement and timers (particularly support and jungle)

 -Timers on jungle and objectives

 -Understanding trades i.e towers for objectives and vise versa

 -TEAM FIGHTS

 -Importance of CS/Kills and gold value

 -Reaction time to calls and ganks

 -Probably the most important.... Map Awareness and ward usage


 There will be time set aside for strategies and team comp setups. Please be aware that I am giving up a lot of my personal time for this team, and I expect my teammates to come prepared and focused for each practice.
 Before you start this application you must understand one important thing, winning and team cohesion DOES NOT happen overnight, hours will have to be put in before results may begin showing!

**Positions filled so far**

 That being said, Mid and Jungler positions have already been permanantely filled.

 Will be updated as roster spots fill:

 Jungle: ThePotatoCannon (Diamond IV)

 Adc: TBA

 Support: TBA

 Top: TBA

 Mid: Thornsofmisery (Diamond V)

 Manager: TBA


**Tryout Date Start**

 Tryouts will begin August 27th or August 28th! If you have any questions please let me (ThePotatoCannon) or Thornsofmisery know through posts via this thread! Do not contact us in game unless we contact you first!

The way is I will make the 2 teams each with relatively equal players try to find 2 teams that can work together. Pref if you are Gold V+ 

What this means if you sign up.

So I will fill both teams and start playing going max teams and games will be in-house scrims to start Team A vs Team B while doing this I will be evaluating players and seeing if there are any that have synergy together.

This wont be done over night and some time will be needed as I have a hectic schedule i'm sure you guys do as well so we will do our best to get this going.

Role: Top / Mid can sub ADC / Support 

Age: 24

Timezone: EST

Play times: I work in the hotel industry so my schedule varies from morning shifts to night shifts so it is fluctuating. BUT i play this game A LOT when im not at work I'm home playing (LoL saving money since 2011) Competitive gaming experience: None.

Goals on joining a team: I want to not only improve as a player I want to find a group of players who have the same focus as me. To improve themselves to improve together and to advance. I would love to play in Tournies and see how high a cohesive team can move up. I want 4 other plays that are skilled that can help me locate weakness or mistakes I wasn't able to even notice.

What you expect from us: ZERO EGO ALL COMMUNICATION. Team game is bigger then any individual if I tell you that you made a stupid decision I expect you to think logically if the decision was correct or incorrect and to communicate with me why you think your decision was correct and my assessment was incorrect or if you agree agree.

I expect you guys to tell me when I do something stupid or wrong and listen to my rationalizing of the situation and in turn make an open discussion on what would have been the optimal play.

I wanna be part of a team that wont just yell in game about making a stupid mistake which is counter productive to the atmosphere and confidence of the player.

I have a varying champion pool for both lanes and I can pick up champs very easily depending on difficulty of the champion (1-5 games to get a good grasp on the subtle differences) some champions I will NOT play just keep that in mind.. A.K.A Yorick...etc

I'm looking for a group of like minded individuals who want to improve as a unit.

Best of luck.

Jag är en svensk 20-årig kille som letar efter fler mogna spelare som vill starta ett svenskt lag. Jag är just nu i Silver I, 10 LP från mina placements till Gold. Jag spelar oftast Marksman/Support, men gillar alla positioner. Vad jag vill försöka uppnå är att ta mig till Platinum i 5v5 Team Ranked innan säsongens slut. Detta kommer inte vara en lätt uppgift men jag letar efter folk som har hög spelförståelse, men kanske har fastnat i en division eller bara inte orkar spela med smutskastandet som pågår i nästan alla Solo Queue games. Jag har spelat League of Legends i drygt två år och har en ganska stor förståelse av spelet, men håller mig gärna borta från att spela Solo/Duo pågrund av antalet idioter. 

Vad jag vill ha av dig:

* Var helst hög silver, eller låg guld. (Allt över Silver 3 blir bra.)

* Var inte en drygpitt.

* Hjälp dina lagkamrater. LoL är ett lagspel, samarbete är nyckeln.

* Kunna ge och ta konstruktiv kritik. Jag vill gärna ha en kort summering vad som gick galet när man förlorar. Vart det gick galet och hur man skulle kunnat förhindra detta. Samma sak när man vinner, vad gjorde man rätt och hur ska vi kunna fortsätta göra samma saker.

* Ha en schysst hög med champions som gör counterpicks lättare i champion select. 70-80%~ av alla champions, helst.

* Inte ge upp, möjligheten för comeback finns alltid där.

___________________________________________________________

Svara gärna här med en liten kort summering. Tackar för tiden som det tog att läsa detta, ha det bra!

I have experience playing vs. Challenger 5s teams thanks to the high MMR my current 5s team has. Unfortunately, the team's priorities aren't in sync right now and we haven't managed to play any games for many weeks now. Due to that I am looking for other teams to consider applying for/joining.

I'm communicative on coms, place importance on objectives, and reserve my out of game comments for before/after games and really just focus on the games during the matches. I really enjoy theory crafting, and I enjoy talking about our losses and learning from them. Want to watch replays after the fact, I'd be happy to take the time to improve myself.

I'm Urf the Mudkip and I'm the captain of Team Deficio Uncinatum and today we parted with our top and ADC players. The reasons were failing to show up at agreed times and unhappiness about that. Therefore, we're looking for players to replace them!

The requirements for joining are:

* Platinum V+: I will not accept anything but S3 or S2 Plats (Solo Queue).
* 16 y/o+: I prefer 18+ and will accept no younger than 16, no matter how mature you think you are.
* Activity: The training schedule is Monday through Thursday Evenings from 8 pm CEST until whenever we get too tired. If you don't have time in the evenings, don't apply.
* Goals: I plan to participate in Go4LoL, 4Pl etc. I have no personal ambition of ”Going Pro”, so just being competitive is the primary goal initially. You have to be willing to set minor IRL events aside if they coincide with the times for tourneys.
* Communications: You have to speak English fluently and have/be able to download Skype (for group messages/announcements) and Teamspeak (for in-game communications), I have a server.


Needless to say, we need to have a good atmosphere and I can't use players who aren't constructive and are in any shape or form toxic.

Experience with Ranked Teams and online tourneys is preferred, but not mandatory.

If you think you're suited, please add me in LoL on EUW @ Urf the Mudkip. If you do not meet the requirements, but somehow believe you have a highly mitigating surcumstance (Trolls in Solo Queue isn't, Elo decay is), leave a reply here and I might add you. If you do not live up to the Platinum+ requirement and you add me, I will not accept.

We will play trial games with hopefully everyone, but it ultimately depends on the amount of applicants. After a few games, I will review replays and notes and make a decision, which means the whole recruitment process shouldn't take more than a few days.

A little about me. My MMR is very, very low for a gold 5 - I am somewhere between Silver 1 - 2 technically. I typically get a stray bronze and silver 4-5 every now and then; I'm hoping that playing with someone with a high MMR will cap me as the lowest tier player. Play with at your own risk.

The reason why I'm in gold 5 was because I duo'd with my cousin when he was bronze 4 and I was gold 2. I duo'd with him to get a couple of easy wins (which I did during my promotion to gold 2) but when I solo queue'd, I would get a bronze and low, low silver stragglers that were literally the epitome of an ape every single game. So the highest I've been was gold 2 and I'm hoping to get back there with a little bit of help.

We are Alienation Gaming, and we're looking for players of high standards who can fill our ranks. Our team is meant to focus mainly on online tournaments such as Go4LoL, maybe even an occasional qualifier to LAN events such as Dreamhack, as well as playing Ranked5s with an end goal of reaching Challenger.

Right now we're on the lookout for:

* Midlaner
* Jungler
* Support (Maybe top)
 * Also looking for an in-game shotcaller, so having experience or a flair for that would be great.

We're interested in players with a good standing in solo queue (Plat1 and above). As well as having the right mindset as to improve and learn (both personally and as a team). 
We want players with great attitudes, who understands how to take as well as giving criticism. And we want players who likes to play with each other - socialize. You should be willing to adapt to the ever changing meta, as well as not being afraid of trying and learning new things, we don't want to be limited, we want to be limitless.

**Right now we're two players who can offer you:**

* Critical thinking
* Meta adaptive but also want to be innovative
* Want to improve as a unit, and recognizes losses are an important part of learning

We're currently:

* D5 ADC - aZies
* P1 Top (Willing to go support if the right top laner comes along) - Artesh

**Team schedule:**

Our team schedule will be planned to around 3-4 days with team practice around 3 hours per session (some days could have multiple sessions). As well as extra days for tournaments (Go4LoL, 4PL etc), and later on as our team gets used to each other, we will be on the lookout for scrim partners who can offer matches on a similar/greater level.

**Apply:**

If this seem like something you want to be a part of, you can contact me (aZies) through Reddit, or ingame.
