1339917168.0,336,self.BreakUps,v66sg,Hi everyone going through a breakup must read this inspirational post. It changed me post breakup and most importantly gave me hope. ,379,43,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v66sg/hi_everyone_going_through_a_breakup_must_read/,"

So, for all you newbies who ask the questions, ""Will the hurting ever stop,"" or ""Will my ex come back,"" or ""Why did he/she do this,"" this is how it typically goes down. 

You two break up--doesn't matter who does it. You immediately panic and begin chasing, begging, pleading, harrassing, phoning, e-mailing, IMing, stalking (okay not all of them, just pick whichever one you did). Most of us will likely do some things during this stage that will make you cringe when you think back on it, say after about 3 months. 

You lose weight. You neglect yourself, your house, your job (how many hours do we all log on this site while we are at work?). You drive your friends and family crazy talking about the break up. You cry at the drop of a dime. You can't even comprehend that your life might not again include that ""special person."" You begin putting them on a pedestal, forgetting all of the nagging things about them that used to drive you crazy. In your mind, they have become omnipotent, all encompasing, all everything. 

You convince yourself that you are a loser who just screwed up a relationship with ""the best person in the world."" You KNOW without a doubt that you will never EVER love like that again. You know no one else will come along who even comes close to being as marvelous as your ex (excuse me while I chuckle to myself here). You wear a sad face for the world to see (you should see my work ID taken 2 days after my breakup, it's just pitiful). 

They (the ex's) remain steadfast in their denial to get back together. Many of them leapfrog into new relationships, immediately being exclusive with a new person. For those that do leapfrog, they appear to just ""replace"" you with a new model. All of the things you two used to do, they now do with someone else. Bowling, cuddling watching television, motorcycle riding, antiquing. Whatever you two did, likely they will just begin doing those things with someone new. 

You hear about them and their new life. You are desperate for any crumbs of news about their life. Many of us make things worse here by trying to use manipulation to get them back--yet they stay away from us like we are the plague. 

For those of us who do still have contact with our ex's we begin selling ourselves short. Doing stupid things like allowing them access to our bodies and then wanting to strangle them afterward when they remind us that ""Sex does not imply hope."" 

You, in further panic mode, begin frantically searching the internet using phrases such as ""break ups,"" ""divorce stopper,"" whatever. You stumble upon this site, pay your money because your curious and lo and behold, you find all of us folks in various stages of this whole breakup bullsh*t. 

You voraciously read the posts. You search for news of those who ""got their mates back."" You're on the site constantly. You'll read the books and think ""Ah I can do this. I can get this person back."" You begin your ""no contact"" and for some of us, this will get a reaction from our ex's. For the rest, no contact is and will continue to be what you'll get and receive. 

Time goes by. You'll do some stupid things. You'll call your ex when you shouldn't. You'll call when you've had to much to drink. You'll call even after 50 people on this site tell you not to. You'll show up on their doorstep, hating yourself all the time. Then you'll come back to this site and ask everyone to tell you why you were so stupid as to do whatever it was you did. 

Then you'll get serious about no contact. It'll hurt, but you try to stick to it. Here's the turning point for most. For those folks who have contact with their ex's, your no contact will either bring them sniffing curiously around or they'll be somewhere high fiving their friends thanking the God's that you haven't called. 

Now's the tough time. Nothing but time works. Everday the ache in your heart grows a little less. It's only nanobits that it dies down by. But everyday it will get slowly better. You'll have setbacks. You'll run into your ex accidently. You'll run into mutual friends who'll tell you something about your ex that'll have you high-tailing it home for a good cry. You'll see your ex with their new ""friend."" You'll receive a phone call or an e-mail from your ex who ""doesn't want to be in a relationship but still wants to be friends (with benefits if you allow). 

Here's another important part. You need to truly sit down and truthfully look back at the relationship and understand what you did to help with it's demise. If you miss this part, you go through all the suffering for nothing because Buddy, you'll be back here again. This site is to teach you about you. To teach you how to be a better partner, a better person. Missing that lesson is detrimental to the whole process. It's the REASON that you're going through this. God (or whatever your higher power is) needed you to learn something about YOU. Don't miss out on the lesson. 

Then one day you'll smile because you didn't immediately check your answering machine when you came in. And one day you'll decide to clean the muck that has accumulated in your house. And one day you'll go outside and admit to the universe that you surrender what control you thought you had. 

And one day you'll decide to date again. And one day you'll go out on your first date and it will likely be a disaster. And then you'll either force yourself to continue dating or you'll decide that you aren't ready to date but you are ready to be out amongst people again. And many of you will have some quick reconcillations with your ex's. Many of us won't. But one day, it won't matter as much. Because time will allow you to catch yourself going minutes and then hours without thinking of the ex. And you'll begin to be able to think of life possibly without that person and not dissolve into a puddle of nothingness because of the thought. 

And for most of us, sadly, life will go on without that mate. That's the truth, amigos. Don't want to dash your hopes but probably less than 3% of the people on this site get back with their mates. Sobering isn't it? But, as the site instructs, you must accept this before you can truly begin to heal or draw your ex back to you. For the lucky (maybe unlucky one's depending on how much work it will take to keep a mate that has wandered back) who get back with their ex's, many will find that the paradise they envisioned isn't reality and what they once thought was gold has a certain tarnish to it now. But they stay and try and make it work because it's comfortable or, if they are really lucky, it's meant to be. 

But for most of us. Life goes on. And one day you'll find yourself having a gut busting laugh over something totally stupid and you'll think to yourself ""I am getting better."" And finally (thank God) you'll have sex with some new and find that a) if it wasn't good, at least you did it or b) it was so much better than with your ex you wonder why you waited so long to get back out there. And you'll know you're one the road to recovery. 

I guess what I'm trying to convey here is, while each situation is unique, the characteristics of most of our situations are the same. Most of us will go through at least something that I've written here. So, when someone tells you on this site that time will help you get through it, believe them. When they tell you that ""trust me, it will get better and you will stop hurting eventually,"" believe them. And when they give you good advice that your head understands but your heart rejects, take a moment to think before you react. 

Don't beat yourself up if you do something that you wished you hadn't (calling, contacting, etc) WE ALL DID AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. Be kind to yourself. Be forgiving of yourself. And most of all remember that being happily single is an alternative. Even if society is beating it into your head that you MUST have a mate, take some time to heal before going back out there. There are plenty of good people to love, but don't go back out there broken, jaded about love, etc. Accept realty. Experience the pain. Learn the lesson. Actively try to heal. Remember the person you were when you first met your ex and get that person back. 

And the universe will take care of the rest.""

1353457687.0,307,self.BreakUps,13jez5,Things I wish I knew when I was younger about breakups,357,50,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/13jez5/things_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_was_younger_about/,"I hope not to update this in another 5 years, but here are my anecdotal lessons learned that I wish I could have let myself know some odd 15 ~ 20 years ago...

**You are a different person in a relationship, and so is your partner.**
Everyone i've ever dated are generally a slightly different person, to a dramatically different person when dating. Or maybe that's just my rose colored view of them. I'm always surprised that my exes, after a break up, suddenly develop new interests, hobbies or attitudes. I now finally accept being in a relationship made me different. I now finally accept it made them different too. I always find a new person after a relationship. For better or worse. Speaking of people changing...

**The person you first met is not who they are now.**
I am well aware I fall in love more with the idea of someone, and I know its a dangerous trap for me. I've been completely head of heals in love with people who never existed, or the idea, fleeting or factual is not who they are now.  It's painful to idealize someone more than anything else, I convince myself they were perfect for me, when really, at the end of it, we were terrible together. That's why we're not together. Give this time, and don't try to chase down the idea of them, I need distance to get perspective on who they really are.  Which brings me to ""trying to be friends""...

**Don't try and be friends. At least for a while.**
Forget it, emotionally involved individuals need some time apart to recover from a loss. I wish I knew this before, I tried being friends with my exes, and either they blow up when I begin to date someone, or I blow up when they start to date someone else, or we get back together and the damn thing just repeats itself. Also, there are people, who I can never be friends with again. They were crazy (literally) or just destructive, so I tossed 'em out. I have no responsibility to someone once we've broken up, nor do I expect anything from anyone I date after it's over. Which brings me to my next point…

**Realize when the relationship is over.**
This is often the hardest part to get through. Even though the words ""we're over"" had been said, for me, every break up never became ""real"" to me until I saw the other person with someone else, or knew they were moving on, or I had developed feelings for someone else and started dating again. Note: I said developed feelings, I don't feel this way with rebounds or casual sex. Which brings me to my third point…

**Don't be a relationship jumper, that's just rude.**
I've done it, I've had it done to me. It sucks. I start investing myself into someone else, not cheating but putting out ""feelers"" and once I feel like I have another ship to swim to I tell my partner, sometimes blindsiding them, that this ship is sinking… Thanks for all the memories! And ahoy, i'm climbing into someone else's boat.  I had this happen to me and I can't explain how gut wrenching it is, it makes you feel completely insignificant, inferior, manipulated and lied to.  If you do this FUCK YOU, and fuck me too for doing this.  If I could go kick my-past-self's ass, I would.  Speaking of ass kicking…

**Be kind to yourself.**
OH LORD. I think i'm my worst enemy sometimes.  I will mull over every slight point of the relationship, worry about everything, take all of the anger and point it back at myself, making myself feel stupid, ugly, worthless. JEEZ. I'm a dick for kicking my own ass so much. Being kind means making changes in how I talk to myself in my ""head"", how I treat myself and doing nice things for myself on a regular basis to remind me that I do care about myself. Speaking of taking care of myself..

**Exercise, and put your emotions into healthy activities**
Part of being kind to yourself is investing in yourself. Take all that anger, loneliness and bitter spite and put it into something constructive like running, painting, learning something new or somehow enhancing who you are. This is taking care of your self and being kind to yourself all at the same time. DOUBLE WIN. OH, and speaking of unhealthy activities…

**Don't put your emotions into unhealthy activities.**
You know what i'm referring too, overworking, overeating, casual sex to ""get over them"", drugs, alcohol, etc. These are all just addictive things that I've never found, not once, to help. SURE they delay the pain pretty well, really well, but it'll be back. Sure as shit, it'll be back. So these activities, if you chose to participate in them, won't help anything. But I guess if you're hell bent on it go ahead.  OH, and while we're on the topic of drinking...

**BUt, IM Drunk, I HSOULD CALL THEM!**
No, no you shouldn't. I find myself missing my exes (drunk or sober). This is inevitable. They probably do too at times. Here's some tips: Try having a conversation with them in your head. Sounds crazy, but it's healthy to just talk to them and imagine them sitting there having a conversation back with you. I could also do what psychologists suggest, write a letter to them then burn it, but I prefer to have some witty dialogue back and forth with fake them.  My subconscious has a way of bringing up things I don't want to approach when imagining them. Speaking of talking to your ex...

**Don't engage contact with them until there's no emotions left**
I don't engage contact with them once were broken up until I honesty, really have no feelings left. I couldn't care if they were married or not. The thought of them with another person brings up zero emotions.  Then you can call, only then, and if so, be careful still, old feelings can crawl up fast. Funny part about this is generally when you're at this point you have no desire to contact them. Now that we're being honest...

**Admit you loved some things about them.**
This is totally optional, some people I have dated I really liked, mm, about, *zero* things about them. Some I really hated at first, but at the end of a long recovery had to admit I really dug somethings about them, still do.  Keep those with you, they're helpful. It helps you recognize what you want in a relationship. I don't idolize the relationship or them, just a few things that I really liked. But at the same time remember to...

**Admit you hate some things about them.**
I think this is the SECOND most important thing to take away from a relationship, and no, what I loved about them is not the first, but we'll get to that. Recognizing what I didn't like becomes a checklist to steer clear from. I didn't like being talked down too, it actually really bothered me, I didn't like how she found my playfulness as immature.  On future dates this becomes red flags for me.

**Admit if you had a part in the relationships downfall.**
This is the MOST important part. No sense in me not learning from my own mistakes. Although its rare to have a relationship that is 100% one persons fault for the breakup (or dysfunction) I can honestly say each relationship I made mistakes or learned things about myself and would like to fix that going forward. SO, I keep inventory of my mistakes, and hopefully figure out better ways of dealing with things in the future. 

**They'll always be in your mind.**
If there was a really strong connection I find myself thinking about them a lot. I can say from experience that even after 15 years, they'll still be there.  Just the strong emotions will be gone. I still think of girlfriends I had, in... jeez, nirvana was still a band. Anyway, thankfully it's now just happy memories, and mistakes learned that I don't make anymore. No hate, no bitter feelings, no ""jeez, they're the one that got a way"".  This just takes time for your emotions to pick themselves back up. Give it time, there's no time table for you to stop missing someone.

**Get back your identity.**
I have the worst tunnel vision in relationships. I mean, I really loose myself.  By that I mean my identity and theirs collide into wonderful new thingie. I have no idea if this is a terrible idea, or the reason people fall in love, regardless I loose myself in relationships.  When I get out of them I feel completely lost. Like I don't know who I am. But in time, I realize that by being kind to myself and exercising and putting my emotions into healthy activities I slowly regain my sense of self. 

**There are other people.**
I can say from a long history of experience, there are tons of other people. I find myself happier with each new relationship than I was ever in the one before, albeit it can take while for me after each breakup. Maybe I'm just getting pickier in my older age which means its taking longer to find someone right for me, but also means I'm happier with them.

**Be happy you had the opportunity to feel so high, and so low**
This always sounds funny for me to say it to myself. But it's true. Being alone or loneliness for me is just fear.  Fear I won't find someone else, fear of ""that was my only shot"", which isn't true at all.  But even past that, once you let go of fear, once you let go of anger, once you let go of all those emotions -- and it will happen one day -- you'll feel gratitude you had these experiences, and that you felt so high.  You'll then appreciate that feeling so good, also means you might feel this bad. So, I in a funny way, cherish feeling so low, because it meant I had the opportunity to feel so great. 

**Disappointment, disappointment, disappointment**
The hardest part of a breakup for me is not letting go of the bad things but all the good things you had together. The disappointment can be overwhelming. I remember as a child if my father wanted to impress how angry he was he never yelled, he never grounded me, he would simply say ""i'm incredibly disappointed in you"".  I feel like telling the relationship, myself and my partner the same things over and over again after a breakup. But try and remember its ok to be disappointed, its ok to let go of those things and be wrong. Now finally...

**Admit you were wrong**
Being wrong isn't an emotion, but brings about the worst emotions in us. It brings fear, loneliness, and anger. Anger turns to frustration, frustration turns to desperation. I have a tendency to see being wrong as an inherent fault in myself. I ruminate on how I should have known better. I could have done better. How the hell could I have trusted them. Truth is, if you don't embrace being wrong, treat being wrong with a light heart, you'll drive yourself insane. You could have been wrong about how you felt, how you treated them, how they treated you, whether you actually were in love. You could have been wrong about a million things. These are good things. They're not advisories but guides. They don't expose your fallacies or inferiority. They don't require neurotic examination, nor do they require careful examination, your emotions, your better part will carry them for you.  I was wrong about every person I  ever dated.

Have a read and get better.,236,31,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16fjyo/broke_up_have_a_read_and_get_better/,"**BIG EDIT N°3**:  Thank you all for the nice comments and questions. This was a throwaway and I did not expect this post to gather so much attention. Sorry if it's a bit late but I'd like to thank you all and will try to answer some of the loads of messages I got. 

Some suggested for this post to get promoted to a sidebar-like thing on the main subreddit, but I have a better idea. I think we can together compile a much better database on guidelines and lifesavers for recent breakupees (is that even a word?). Certainly much better than this post, which only has the knowledge of one person, and not much at all. 

If you like this idea, go tell it to the mods, and let's see if we can create something like a FAQ or document so desperate people can look at really quick and not have to dig through hundreds of vent posts in search of a helpful one. 

I mean, I created this because I found it very difficult, when I was through with venting, to try and help people through small posts or comments. They all got buried and taken down and I feel a bigger document is in order. 

Together we can add our efforts so that people over the internet who feel alone and broken can get support and comfort and can know what is in order for them.

Thank you for your time, **END BIG EDIT 3**

So, If you're reading chances are you feel heartbroken over a breakup.

If so, I also happened to break up not long ago, and can give you some useful tips.

So, you're broken inside. It happened. He/she left you, or you did it, maybe over nothing, or something terrible, or something inconclusive. You need help. I know you're torn between a plea for help and a feeling like a nausea inside that keeps you from reading a great deal. Just skim over and find a point that suits your troubles and read it. Maybe two.

**The reason for the breakup is irrelevant**

You heard me. Don't fret over it. There's always gonna be something that could have been different about why you guys did not work. You can be either the dumped or dumpee. You can be dumped over nothing, or leave someone not knowing why, or over something terrible someone discovered about the other.

In any of these cases, you are BOTH gonna suffer like little bitches. You and your ex, even if he or she doesn't show it (and if your ex does not suffer, s/he's a dick). Its how people work. We have feelings and our psyches attatch to others. It's like a drug. When the other person is removed forcibly from your day to day, you start missing him/her like crazy. **do not** fret over the reasons or how it could have been different. I know you're gonna do it anyway, but don't kill yourself over it. It couldn't because it's the past. Let it slide.

**Your life is gonna get screwed over for a while**

Yup. The lack of drive and the void left by the other person is gonna do some damage to your routine and sink you into a depressive hole. Maybe you haven't noticed. It's called denial. You start in absolute denial and at some point your deepest mind brings up what's happened.

The more time you spend in denial, the worse it is when this happens. Try to accept what has happened. Cry what you must. You WILL feel crazy urges to do stuff to maybe 'fix' things. Ignore them. They are just the dying screams of a part of you that is still attached. Let it die silently.

Your routine will die. Your grades will drop. You will seclude to mope. Don't. Get out there. The mind heals faster when it's feeling happy. Go out with your friends, meet new people. Take up hobbies, do what you always wanted to do with you new free time and money (relationships take both).

Excercise is awesome. It occupies your mind and makes you prettier so you can boost your probably shattered self esteem.

Dating is also very important. You will only completely forget about him/her when you start considering other people. True fact.

**IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU KILL ATTACHMENT**

Why? You may think this is absurd, that you're still in love or that it's impossible to obtain.

Bull. Attachment is the root of your problem. In fact, it IS your problem. Would you mope like this about someone you don't give a fuck about? No.

Attachment was generated because duh, you were bound to that person by a relationship and to retrieve all the mental energy and detatching your mind from the particular structure generated when you were not single is very very hard.

The mind does NOT like to change, AT ALL. It resists and thrashs. Don't be consumed by your thoughts and fade them into silence. In the first months this is nigh impossible, but it is expected if you ever want to be a normal human being again.

Try meditating (link to r/meditation below), or simply not giving a fuck anymore. I think there's also a subreddit for that. Your ex is now the same as those people who die on the news on other countries byut you don't even care.

Spending time with your ex only opens a wound that needs healing. If you two are not getting back together (you know deep in your heart if this has a chance of happening, but don't lie to yourself, it will only hurt more), maintain ZERO contact. Not even a ""hi"". Nothing. 

Time helps a lot. Time with as little contact as you can helps a great deal more. If you are confronted by your ex, escape. Lie, say you need to go see someone, that your grandma has baked you a pie, etc. GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM YOUR EX.

If he/she tries to talk, then ignore. If confronted, state the truth: That you need to be left alone. If he/she says ""hi"", say as little as you can. If you absolutely NEED to say hi back for social reasons, then just that will do. No conversation.


**Get over it**


If you are at those first few months where your mind is still hard wired to your ex, then stand strong. It gets beter with time, but your greatest enemy is yourself. You are probably very torn between thoughts of going back/still loving him/her and hating him/her and probably yourself for mistakes. Give these things space, but drown them if they get out of control. They should not stick around to the fourth month. Never.

Here's a protip: think about the shitty things. Think about the fights, the bad, bad things he or she did. The jerkish stuff. If you were the dumper, think about why you dumped that sorry ass. If you are the dumpee, then that undeserving shit has dumped you! He doesn't deserve to be in the same room as you, let alone dedicating him/her your thoughts.

If your ex dumped you and was an extremely good and flawless person, then I'm geniunely sorry. If reasons (and I mean GOOD reasons, serious shit) were stated for the breakup, think about them. Try and change if you need to. NOT FOR YOUR EX. NOT TO GET BACK. For you. So that this never happens to you again.

 If no reason was stated at all, then you ex was probably a dick. Sorry

In every case, give yourself the time and inner space to sort this out. Don't mope. Cry what you need to (these things are not easy) and move on. Go chase other potential mates to reproduce with. Or not. If that's not your deal then stay idle. Just find something to do after one or two months to get you back up and running. 

The funk is only gonna stay around if you let it. So when you start feeling a little better, kick it out.

**STAGES: What happens next?**

Getting over is a process that goes in many stages. Stages have particular symptoms. They fade over into the next stage, and some intermediate stages present symptoms of the other two. Also, you may jump from stages, or skip some and save them for later. People are really different. Some may spend a year in denial and then quickly grieve the rest. Some never make it out of depression. Some special cases just need some months. Every stage also contains slivers of others but tends to retract onto itself. Every one ends in Acceptance over something, but not a permanent one.

1: Denial. 

Duration: Breakup event - some weeks after, maybe months if you are too screwed inside

Symptoms: A feeling that nothing has happened. That you can carry on. That you will get better in no time. An urgent need to go do stupid or weird things that never before had you had the urge to do but are suddenly very important. A constant need of something to do. Anger when being confronted about possible grief.

Overcoming: Accepting that you are now single and that many awful things are about to happen and that you are very very sad

Denial is dangerous. The more you maintain it, the more it will hurt when it leaves. It's the mind's way of filling the void. It is a basic defense mechanism. Accept your vulnerability and break it.

2: Early depression with post breakup delusions.

Duration: since the Break of denial (""fuck, i'm single now and I'm so so sad""). Lasts around a month . More if you keep seeing your ex. May last forever if you don't get your shit together.

Symptoms: You will cry a lot. You will feel absolutely miserable about things. Fantasize about what could have been different. What you could have been different. Feel remorse and anger about mistakes and backstabs. A need to keep tabs on your ex. A constant fantasy of getting back together. You will seek unreal ways of achieving this. Pay no mind. If the fantasies start making you take actions you might regret, STOP YOURSELF before you do something permanent you don't need.

Overcoming: Find time to cry a lot. Listen to yourself and try not to be eaten alive by your own thoughts. Accept that you need to grieve. Think abour retracting into yourself and emerging reborn and a better person. Improve your inner life. Talk to those who will listen. You would do the same for them. 

3 and 4: Depression and Anger.

These two come together and jump from one to the other.
 
Duration: Indefinite. The individual durations are short bursts. The period where you're afflicted lasts as long as you let it. More than a month or even two. But finding a way to stop requires a strong will.

Symptoms: 

Depression: Lack of will and motivation. The feeling of not being completely yourself, that some parts of your mind are off or asleep, like an autopilot. Bursts of deep sorrow.  Lack of desire to do anything. Lack of care for you tattered life or fixing it. Sleep and eating rythms are upset. You may find it hard to go to sleep and to wake up. Awful nightmares. You will feel every song and artist speaks to you and about your troubles.

Anger: Strong bursts of undying and powerful wrath emerging from the memories of your relationship and issues. Wanting to hit things and break them. Wanting to hit people and break them. The need to scream loudly. Lashing out agressively to nonprovocative comments. Lashing out even worse to provocative ones. A deep seated desire for revenge.

Overcoming:

This is the toughest part. Here's the thing: Being in a relationship takes energy. Mental energy. Your mind invests it's energy on the bond created with your now ex couple. That bond is not simply broken, and your fragile mind still attempts to direct it's energy into the failed relationship after it's broken. You may consciously know what's happening, but your unconscious (and some conscious structures) is still attuned to the relationship.

In this stage, where mending the thing is put of the question, you feel anguish and rage at yourself and your ex and the world. The energy is redirected into plotting revenge and doing stupid things. Your mind ""sleeps"" so as to start healing. Like how a cut swells. It takes a combination of time and will to get this done with. You will notice a very awful moment where you descend to your darkest corners and confront with yourself and what has happened. You may choose to be tormented by it or to take all this spare energy and start investing it in yourself and improve as a person.

The choice usually takes the span of a week. Results are not immediate and relapse is almost inevitable.

Try to clear your mind and make yourself focus on things that are important. Calm yourelf if raging. Focus if idle.

Accept.


5: Acceptance

Acceptance is when one day you realize you haven't thought about your ex in what... Weeks? Months? And then you don't even give half a shit because he/she was not that important and go play some xbox or some shit. Maybe even go date someone better.

Seriously, at some point you are gonna have a bundle of realizations. About the relationship, about your ex and yourself. They will be very tough, but surprisingly you will understand them peacefully. At this point you've started reaching acceptance. You may realize that your ex was an utter tool. That he/she cheated on you (happened to me) while never giving away anything while in the relationship and maintaining it a secret. That YOU were a complete and utter tool, etc.

At this point the bursts of anger and sadness start calming down and the mental energy is starting to rewire properly. Acceptance does not come from one day to the other, though in retrospect it may seem like that. You will only arrive by walking the journey, SO KEEP WALKING IT.


**Don't keep tabs on your ex**

Ok, this is painfully hard, but try to not know any single thing about your ex. Delete him/her from everything online, and spend less time on social networks so as to not know anything through mutual friends. Stop talking to those much. I don't even care if they are very good friends, or if they now conveniently seem like very nice people to talk to. 

You will only fixate your ex more on your mind, and it will not even be your ex, but an idealized image. If it was your ex, the human being, s/he'd have flaws and things that would make you think and judge straight. An idea is flawless and unreachable and can fuck your shit up a lot more. 

ZERO CONTACT.


**There WILL be an attempt to get back at you. Keep your head up**

Especially if you dumped him/her. But even so, if you two simply had a 'falling out' or mutual breakup, or even if your ex dumped you, there WILL be an encounter soon where your ex will flaunt how his/her perfect life is. Maybe even her new date. BULLSHIT! Unless months (more than five) have passed, NOBODY gets better like that because of the aforementioned reasons on how the mind attaches and has a hard time unattaching. Not even your ex. S/he's using the separation and your not knowing anything about his/her life as a weapon to hurt you.

The best horror stories are those where the monster or nightmare is not fully described, so as to make the reader complete it with his fears and give him the brand of terror that scares him the most. YOUR EX IS DOING THE SAME NOW. S/he knows that you will fret and speculate about his/her life and feel jealous. In fact, s/he's doing this because s/he feels insecure and jealous and needs to get the first strike.

A real childish thing. And you, my friend, are above that. You will need to if you want to get over. You are a strong, badass man/woman and are as worthy of feeling good as any other. So get your head up and don't feel threatened or bullied. So try to avoid your ex and cut conversations short. 

If your ex is being a REAL dick. If he/she's treating you like garbage and taking advantage of your weakness or social spaces and conventions to screw with you and this happens daily or many times a week (if your're study or work partners) then set him/her aside and in all seriousness tell him/her to stop the childish games. No emotion. Just a stern look. 

DO NOT PROMPT A DISCUSSION. If your ex refuges into a discussion, don't go there. Just look him/her in the eye and say ""goodbye"". Then leave. If it continues, try an escape. It will stop.


**Want revenge? Here's your fix**

Revenge is a mistake. It NEVER brings about good things. Damaging someone directly only causes more pain and can initiate a cycle of revenge.

I know your feelings. I've felt them too. You feel you need to get back, to make that heartless fuck feel SOMETHING bad about the breakup.

I do believe that justice is a different matter, so we will try to reconvert toxic revenge into rightful justice. Justice is not forced or made happen. It is the way of the world to balance things. If you are a nice person and your ex left you, she will eventually realize it and feel like shit. If your ex cheated or did bad things and you left her and realizes this, he or she will also feel like shit for having done that.

Do this.

Take a month or two to yourself. Learn something cool. Do cool things. You will start feeling better and less inclined toward hurting him/her. You will start being a bigger person. Learn music, or a sport, or a language, or get in a band or a team or a choir or anything. Then do great things with them. Find cute girls or nice guys or whatever and date the fuck out of them (you probably feel like shit and think nobody will date you. It's bullshit, so go date). Go out with friends and do epic things.

Then, when your ex meets you, she will look at a stronger, better (harder and faster also maybe) you. An improved you. A person much more awesome than who s/he used to date. Bonus points if you are with your new date when this happens (Don't be a dick and prompt this situation though, that is awful). Then s/he will want to go jump off a cliff for letting you go, or for having wronged you or hurt you. It is the world's order making things right. 

Seriously, this works.

When you get your chance (and you WILL get it) don't talk too much. Just say hi. Leave. If asked, reply with short statements. Don't say ""Oh im fine, I've just taken up guitar and am playing a gig nex tuesday. And you?"". Don't ask anything about his or her personal life. 


**Your ex was not that special**

Seriously. I don't care if it was an eight year relationship. It hurts like hell, but if you were dumped then that person does not want to be with you anymore and should be left alone. If you left him/her, then you had your reasons.

There are millions of people out there. Go find someone better. Someone different. Your ex only seems special because you got to know him/her a lot. Many people are that deep and special and have those cute gestures that were so cute. Go find out why.


**NO CONTACT**

Seriously. Contact with an ex will bring only suffering. It will hold back healing and give false hope that will absolutely obliterate you when you see her/him with someone else. Healing hurts, but not as much as that, I guarantee.

Don't ever, ever, ever see you ex for ANY reason if you can avoid it.

If you HAVE to, say, if you are school or uni partners, or your friends are the same, then avoid talk and encounters. Ignore any attempts for attention your ex makes and don't make any yourself.

**Calm your mind**

You may find that your mind and thoughts are killing you. Pay no mind to the stupid attempts they suggest to get back. I mean it. 

Spend energy in doing things. Sports, excercise, reading, friends. Philosophy is great. Straighten out your ideals and consolidate your ideology in this time of self-reflection.

Meditation also helps. Not mantra or religious meditation (unless you're already religious in which case go ahead). Meditation is simply an excercise of the mind to which no religious or spiritual connotations should be added. It works wonders for stilling the mind.

You will be thinking from another person's perspective and you will start to feel rejected (the why's and what-if's creep in when you think like that, your ego has to figure out why it was fucked over, but the truth is that this was a learning experience, trust that this will make you better for the relationship that *really* matters to you down the road). People talk about different stages of breakups, but honestly it is different cycles. Some days you are over it, some days it comes back and your brain focuses on it. If you stay in the moment, and realize that you are more than your thoughts, then you can carry on and continue towards becoming the best man/woman you can be. Your brain can't fuck you over, because you can still choose to keep doing the things you think you should (you can think shitty thoughts all day and still run 15 miles or finish a huge project or work towards some success that helps you out and be happy about it later). Let me put it this way, you know you will be over him/her in 10 years, so why waste the time wallowing about it now. Time is the one thing you can't get back. The only thing you've got, the *only* thing that you can do anything about, is to choose what you do this very moment. You get this moment and you get to choose to do the right thing for yourself or to let another moment slip away. You can either be a victim and live a life waiting for others to eventually let you down, or you can start living your life at this very moment and work towards making yourself happy and proud. That's what it's all about my friend, it's way beyond breakups or men/women, it's way beyond work or family... 

This is life. It's *your* life, and you only get one shot at this.  There is no going back and changing your actions.  There are no second chances.  You only get one chance to make the right decision in this very moment.  If you want to waste time thinking about the past, then you've lost another moment.  If you see a chance to make yourself happy, then you better take it because eventually you are going to run out of moments.  We all become food for worms, and the sooner you embrace that the better. 

This relationship wasn't the very best relationship you can have, so why waste another fucking second on it.

Right now you are afraid because you lost something, doubt is creeping in. But you forget that we lose everything in death. Everything we've ever known and loved will change, be lost, or at the very least - die. The truth is that you can get anything you want if you are willing to work for it and understand that you will lose it. Once you understand that, then you have to make the choice to go after what you want, or to sit around and think about what you had until you lose more and more as you focus on one depression after the next. You understand now that to have the life you want, you have to fight for it, otherwise you will be let down over and over. 

But you have to make the choice.

I took a photo of her and the first thing I realised was just how distorted I was when I was scared I'd never meet anyone as wonderful as my ex. 

My last partner ended our relationship 10 months ago. 7 years of a relationship that I cherished just finished. I tried to negotiate as she told me that her feelings weren't the same anymore. I was confused, angry, desperate, hurt and downright broken. I was here reading all the advice and ignoring it. I was convinced that I could get her back, when I was doing more damage by not bowing out gracefully. 

I wanted to come back here. To let you know I've found someone that loves me so deeply, and that You can too. I was so afraid I'd never WANT someone new let alone FIND someone. All of that was irrational and I hope my few words and my hindsight can help you in some way:

**--- You're broken now,** and to be honest that's fucking great. It let's you know the love was Authentic, it was worth your time. It verifies that you're a passionate person who is capable of cherishing the people that are important to you. Whoever falls in love with you in the future is getting a person who knows the value of love. LUCKY THEM! 

**--- Committing to No Contact is really the best thing you can do**. If there's any hope of it working again, or you healing, then you need to see how each other feel when your not polluting each others space. Plus the time apart will help you think with your head instead of your cripplingly painful heart. You gotta be strong here. Make them miss you while you get yoyr independence back. You'll soon realise that trying to reach out to them only makes you sink back to square one. 

**--- It's fine to pour your heart out and read advice**. Just understand: there's no perfect selection or arrangement of words that is gonna fix you. That has to happen over time, and self action. Stand up, stretch and make a plan and Live. Depend on nobody else to repair you. 

**--- You're not going to meet someone like your last. Ever.** But thats okay. Everyone really is different, but eventually you'll see the beauty in the differences. Maybe they'll love some things your last partner hated. The intonations and inflections in their voice will be alien. Beautiful memories you had will be overshadowed by someone new eventually. Once you accept that you are idolising an imperfect person who isn't in your life anymore, things get easier. If they were so perfect you wouldn't be here reading this. The love of your life wouldn't have given up on you. When it's time you'll learn to see the beauty in someone else. Don't rush it though. It'll come. 

**--- This is an opportunity.** You can reset and redesign yourself into whatever the fuck you want. Work out and get the figure you deserve. Do what you want, wherever you want. Think selfish. Be so ridiculously selfish for a while til you love You again. Nobody's built like you, you designed yourself. Now step up the renovations.

1364729434.0,125,self.BreakUps,1bcqvn,Some tips from things i've learnt. You've probably heard them all before but here's my summary on how to deal with a breakup.,152,27,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1bcqvn/some_tips_from_things_ive_learnt_youve_probably/,"When you first experience the breakup, particularly your first or second major one like any skill in life it is something that you have to learn how to do. The first time you probably sucked badly at it, if you were dumped you likely begged and cried and if you dumped them you probably either rebounded or called them for a period of time unsure of how to deal with all these emotions. I've done both, both sides suck. In many ways when you dump someone in my view if they are a decent person it can be harder, you have to live with all of that ""did I make the right choice?"". It may not come right away, but for me it has always came. In many ways being the one that was dumped is easier in that you don't have to think about it. The decision is done for you and there are very easy rules you can follow to complete the process. I don't mean to sound preachy, but these are things ive picked up on that have helped me through breakups in past. Here we go.

My story: I recently broke up with a girl I had been seeing for over a year, she dumped me.

**The breakup talk**. Although you've all been through this when you are dumped its important to get as much information as possible for self growth without sounding like a psycho. Its fine to say you disagree, but you cannot ask them to reconsider. You can ask for reasons and say you disagree with their views but chances are your now ex is going through a stage called justification. They have spent the last weeks/months focusing on everything bad about you so they can justify the breakup and this will all come spilling out the second the talk is initiated. You may think all of their views are not justified and you're probably correct in this, but just understand there is mental gymnastics that go on during a breakup. Say what you will, get your limited closure and get away from the situation. A little bit of emotion shows you're not a sociopath, too much makes you look pathetic. 

- *The garbage* - Keep in mind what they tell you during the breakup is very rarely true. People don't often give truthful answers as to why the split is occurring, although if you read between the lines you can sometimes get some good inferences. Chances are you probably know deep down anyway. They may tell you they have to really find themself, this may mean that they'd rather beat their head against a wall rather then listen to you wine about your day once more or it may mean they need to find out how big the postman's parcel is. But please, if they've told you it may work out down the track but just not now or anything else that will keep you on the string for your own good ignore it. All that matters is they don't want to be with you anymore, they may regret this, they may not, but it doesn't matter. 

**No Contact.** This is preached by everyone and there is a reason for it. Everyone wants to contact their ex. They will justify it as 'trying to say that one last thing', they will justify it as 'ending it on a positive note' or 'making sure they're ok'. When you breakup you are basically similar to someone going through a drug withdrawel, you will have strong impulses to contact them and you WILL I repeat WILL do and say the dumbest things every time you open up to them. Things that will make you cringe in future. If you write them a letter no, just no. Everything you write is taking away your power and giving it to them. You know what happens when you go no contact? You reclaim your mystery, you reclaim your dignity (something you may have lost in the relationship) you also reclaim your self determination, you are in control again. If you continue to message your ex you are giving them so much power, the power to upset you when they see someone new, the power to put you down if they feel you are being too clingy, but most of all you're sending a message that you are not ok without them. Humans find that final message repulsive, you need to be strong and you need to show them you don't need their contact to survive. 

The real reason for no contact is simply that there is nothing you can say to make the situation better. If you call them expecting to speak to the person you once knew you will quickly find they are no longer there, the conversation will be awkward, short and you will walk away feeling terrible and knowing you're back to step 1. Also keep in mind if you've been good with no contact from the start of the breakup you only get one shot at it, really think about it, do you want to go back on all the good work you've done so far?

- *We can be friends* - Yes. But not until the relationship is truly behind you. For a decent long term relationship this can take a year if not more. If you still have a strong desire to be their friend chances are you are not over them.

**No stalking** This is probably the most important step of all. The modern world has introduced a plateau of modern methods for stalking every movement of your ex. The first thing you need to do is block them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Wuphf and anything else you use. Block their friends, block anyone else that might show their stuff in your feed. Make sure they can't get into your life. You need to do this instantly so that your body can begin to get used to them not being around. It can be difficult to begin with but only after you've done it can you see just how uplifting it is. You feel feel instant better, again its a control thing, you are incharge of your own healing here and nothing they can do can stop that.

- *Why?* If into your ex's Facebook you go, only pain you will find. There is nothing in there that can release your pain. By some chance you see that they havn't moved on and arn't living a fantastic life without you two weeks later what exactly does that buy you? A week more? Then what? You'll go back and check their page again? The reality of the situation is that in particular a young girls social life after a breakup closely represents throwing a dead cow into a sharks pen if you know what I mean, you don't want to see it. It will hurt you. If you don't see it then your mind can construct whatever parable it is most comfortable with and it can continue with this until its time to move past it. If you find out they are seeing someone 3 weeks later you are going to have that on your mind every second of the day until you are over it and trust me, suspicions are different from actual knowledge. You don't want to go through that.

**Life won't be the same** Now that you've got the basics down, you're not contacting them, you're not dwelling or stalking them, what now people say? Many internet guides will tell you that you need to fill your lives with exciting adventurous activities. But in my experience that just makes you miss your past life. The best thing ive always found is to become comfortable with the fact your life is now different, you have that time, you have those memories but now it was time for it to end. Your new life may be objectively worse in your eyes and i'm not going to promise you it will lead to better things but sometimes the path we are on is worse and doesn't lead to better things (although it usually does...) and you have to accept that. Over times your past life will be simply a memory and your new life will grow but don't rush it. I've heard the ""Its 1 month I should have moved on by now"" line so many times, it will happen when it happens. If you feel lonely be comfortable with the lonelyness, if you feel bored be comfortable with the boredom. Try and be comfortable with the change and your healing will progress faster than someone who tries to block it out.

**Let go of the anger**. After a breakup chances are you have a lot of residual anger. Unfortunately for all of loves highs it tends to have pretty deep lows. But for all of the terrible things your ex may have done to you being mad at them will not help, anger is an emotion that can only hold you back and delay your progress and chances are when you look at it objectively they wern't that bad anyway, they were just human, like you, you both made mistakes, chances are you both knew it was over. So don't hate them as it really is a zero sum emotion that will get you no where.

**Don't date until the time is right** This applies to both dumpers and dumpees. If you get out of a relationship chances are you are not ready to date yet. You are just using it to cover up the emotions and your new partner will notice. Ive rebounded before and carried in huge amounts of baggage. It makes you look bad. Only when you've come to terms with the breakup and waited however long it takes for the right partner to come into your life is it time to move on. If you go on the 'hunt' chances are you will only hurt yourself and probably someone else too.

**In your moment of weakness*** don't stalk, don't contact. We've all been there, it is very tempting, but it is a temptation born from reliance and a lack of independence. You will move past this. Remember, everytime you don't contact them you get stronger. You're kind of like a Pokemon in that regard, get strong enough and you will evolve! 

**You will be ok**. Ive had a few types of breakups, ones where I followed these rules and ones where I done what my emotions lead me to do, trust me the difference is marked. You all will be ok, i'm not going to leave by saying you will get another shot wiith your ex because you probably won't, but you will be once again fine in your own skin and that is the most important thing.

God bless.

1338987139.0,126,self.BreakUps,unv06,Saw my first serious girlfriend in a restaurant yesterday after 8 years post-breakup. Perspective and a lesson learned.,137,11,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/unv06/saw_my_first_serious_girlfriend_in_a_restaurant/,"I'm a 28/m married to a wonderful woman. We have a 2 year old and another due in January. I'm one happy dude.

My distantly ex girlfriend was my first love. We were inseparable in high school and the beginning of college. We had a horrible falling out when I decided to study abroad for a semester and she dumped me. I was devastated and took it poorly. When I got back stateside I vowed not to ever speak to her again.

8 years later: my best friend from high school, my son, and I are eating lunch when my ex comes in. My heart jumps. You know that feeling you get when you see an ex you were in love with. It's ""Hey that's her!"" followed by ""Oh…that's her."" All in the space of a half second, maybe less. 

She is with her best friend from high school and her daughter who is a bit older than my son. For the first time in 8 years we speak.

Me: How are you?

Her: Good! This is __________. Say hi, _________!

Her daughter greets me. Pigtails and pink shorts. She strongly resembles an old picture of her mother I used to pass in the hallway of her childhood home.

I implore my son to be sociable but he is focused on his spaghetti. We all laugh and banter about kids, jobs, and lives for a few moments before my ex's group takes a seat. I have a brief moment to dwell before I have to switch into Dad Mode and hand my son his juice, pick up a fork, and soon I'm engaged and laughing with the most important person in my world besides my wife. My friend and I talk work and houses.

Later I started thinking. No contact for 8 years and we meet under precisely similar circumstances. And it wasn't awkward or weird. Just two grownups talking about their kids. In that moment, strangely enough, it was easy to forget we were ever in love. 

There is a concept in the world of education (my field) that states novelty of experience imbues greater learning. Your first love is like that. It's so new and exciting that you remember everything about it. And when it ends it hurts so badly you can't imagine feeling good ever again. Being a teenager/early 20something means experiencing a wealth of newness that can be difficult to synthesize; heartbreak is even more difficult. For me, it took weeks before I felt human again after she broke up with me (and this was in a foreign country, no less!) 

Did our encounter dredge up some old feelings? Sure. But it also showed me that truly ""moving on"" means living as well as you can FOR YOURSELF. When people on this subreddit say ""no contact,"" they're really telling you to find a support system, indulge in a hobby, travel, do something other than dwell. It helps in the short term. Long term, it allows you to gain perspective on a life altering event and gain a better understanding of who you are and what you need in a partner.

IT WILL GET BETTER. Really. But you have to live your own life first. 

And here's the weird part: Seeing my ex at such a similar and happy stage in life made me feel good. She wasn't a bad person. She deserves a good life. Then again, so did I. 

So please, especially teenagers or thereabouts: remember your support system in whatever personalities it may be comprised of. Remember your own trajectory. Remember that you've got your own life to lead and it sucks  right now, but given enough space and time it will get better.

I am less than two weeks out of a serious eight month relationship. I am a 20 year old male, she is a 19 year old female. She broke up with me, I haven't had any contact with her since.

I have some advice for you that I hope will help. Whether you are fresh out of a relationship or still trying to get over one much later, I hope that something I am about to type will be able to allow you to see your situation in a different manner. Most of the things you have already heard, but that only suggests that they are very true. As always, each breakup is different but this is advice that should work for *most* breakups. Without further ado..

**Cut off all contact immediately**

This is the single most important piece of the healing process. If you continue to discuss your relationship with your ex, you will not allow yourself the ability to heal. At a later time, you *will* regret things you said following a breakup. The method you use to cut off contact may be different for every person. As for myself, I blocked her on Facebook and blocked her phone number. Any contact you have with your ex will send you back to square zero in the healing process.

**Yes, it is called a breakup because it is broken**

This may be the most obnoxious thing to hear but it is very true. Whether or not you can see it, there are reasons why you have come to this point. You *will* idealize the other person but that does not mean that everything was fine. Unless you have an extreme circumstance, you should not be trying to ""win"" your ex back. As Spock once said, ""Having is not so pleasing as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true."" This leads me into my next point.

**Get a notebook and write**

Write down everything on your mind. You *will* start to see patterns. The thing that helped me the most was to make a list of both the good and bad parts of our relationship. After doing so, you will probably find that the good things are not truly unique of your ex but the bad things are. You most definitely will find these ""good things"" with another person, without all of the bad things. Does that mean the next person will be perfect? Of course not. It only means that somewhere in your previous relationship, there were dealbreakers.

**Do not bandage your feelings**

Let yourself feel how you actually feel. If you feel like crying, by all means, cry. You will feel a very wide variety of emotions over the following days and weeks. Don't let your friends tell you how to feel. There is no need to ""suck it up"" or ""just move on"". You are at a very vulnerable state and most people won't truly be able to relate. Take it all in. If you felt nothing, that only means that your relationship didn't mean anything to you. It did.

**Similarly, do not drown your feelings**

If you try to drown your pain in drugs or alcohol, you will not make any progress in healing. The only difference is that you will have a hangover the next morning. It's as simple as that. You will want to be as clear-minded as possible, trust me on this one.

**Stop worrying about what the other person is doing**

Your ex is no longer a part of your life. You have absolutely no control over how they are feeling or what they are doing. All that is left of your ex is the memory you have of them. That doesn't have to be a bad thing. Cherish this. They helped you grow as a person, whether you realize it or not. You will never forget them, just as they will never forget you. It's time to move forward.

**Focus on yourself**

While you are in a relationship, most (if not all) of your time is spent focusing on the other person. Now that they are no longer a part of your life, take this time to get to know yourself better. Volunteer. Treat your body better. Study more. You may find that you missed your own self more than you thought.

**You will love again**

As much as you may *just know* that your ex was ""the one"", they weren't. If they were, they wouldn't have left you, or you wouldn't have felt compelled to leave them. Someday, you will meet the person that you will spend the rest of your life with. It seems like a foreign concept now, but just wait. You will love again, just as someone will love you again.

**Your situation is unique!**

Do not expect to find the ""answer"" from anyone. This doesn't mean that people will not be able to make you see things in a different, more digestible light (like this post!), but don't expect to find something that will fix everything. If you feel the pain and if you are interpreting the pain for what it is (the process of moving on), then you are well on your way to healing. You are strong and you are a great person!

**Do me a favor and smile :)**

I really hope that you will find some sort of peace or understanding from this post. If anything, take it as a sign that people do care about you and you will be just fine. If you need help, PM me. I'll do my best to talk things out with you.

You're letting your emotions cloud your vision and control you. And all that hate and anger will be for nothing, you will be wasting your time (which is what I did) and it's a lot of work/energy to be mad. All you can do now, is get over it. Have fun (which she no longer has the privilege to be part of) and move on.. Find another girl or don't. It's up to you, in the end it doesn't matter, its all a bunch a fuck. But remember you gotta take the good with the bad.. It sucks wiener ass.. And dude it might sound weird, but think about how sad you are now and think ""holy fuck how strange is it to feel anything at all?"" life is fucking kick ass and it is fucking awesome like you man. You're good looking smart and funny (and in that order). So yeah I don't know, have fun being sad you faggot.. Go to the gym and rage. Write a script or even song. 
Be sad because once your over it and you have no fuxks to give.. You wont remember why you felt like that. Then you will realize how good being happy really is..

1358820736.0,107,self.BreakUps,1711xa,Things I've learned after some time passed - The 7 Things to Remember Post-Breakup,123,16,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1711xa/things_ive_learned_after_some_time_passed_the_7/,"Dear r/BreakUps,

I came to you all a couple months ago when things were at their worst. I posted a few things, replied to a few comments, and shared my story. This was, by far, the most supportive subreddit that I have had the pleasure of being a part of and the experience was one I appreciated immensely. The account that I used to post my story and my content has now been closed (and this new one activated) to escape any contact with my ex and/or her new boyfriend (yes, who messaged me), but I wanted to take the time to come here and share a few of the things I feel I've learned over the past few months.

1. **Things do get better.** I can't stress this enough. In the immediate period following the breakup, the pain was excruciating. I loved this girl in a huge way, and endured a lot for the relationship, but things, over time, got way, way better. I've met some great girls and gone out many times in the last couple of months, and finding yourself again is a great feeling. I promise you all, things will get better, and time is a great healer.
2. **You cannot define yourself by your relationship.** If you have ever said ""I don't know who I am without this person,"" this one applies to you. I had this problem in my relationship; I didn't know who I was without her. After so long with one person, you become almost like one... sharing beliefs, plans, ideas, a sense of humour, etc. But at the end of the day, that's still a construct of a shared experience. YOU, at your core, are *not* that person. You have your own beliefs, your own ideas, your own sense of humour and your own goals, which you will be amazed you find again once you're back on your own.
3. **You are worthy of love.** This one was a hard one for me. I felt as though losing this girl meant that I was meant to be alone. How could someone I loved so dearly and who I did so much for leave like that? It didn't make any sense. What was wrong with me? I'm here to tell you: *Nothing is wrong with you.* You are worthy of love, and someone will show you that.
4. **You can't sit at home and wallow in your pain.** This might be a tough one for some of you. Some days I didn't want to go anywhere. I wanted to sleep it all away. This is a sign of depression, guys. You can't do this; you need to tackle your life head on. The advice that's often given to go to the gym, to go out, to spend time with family and friends... it's good advice! Listen to it! I found the gym to be my favourite place to blow off steam, and dammit I'm making great progress! I'm at a lower body weight than I've been in literally 5 years and I'm starting to see results in my muscle tone. Hit the gym! Read a book! Do something active which engages your mind and body in a productive way. And get the hell out of your house!
5. **Don't be afraid of new experiences and new people.** This was the best part of moving on... meeting so many great new girls and having a blast doing it. Believe me, there are literally millions of people out there for you, and it's just a matter of going out and meeting them. Hit a bar with some friends, maybe go to a social gathering with some people you are acquaintances with. Visit a convention. Just do whatever you can to be open to meeting new people. At the very least, you expand your network. At the best, you meet that next special person! I met a great girl who I had a fun little fling with just by going out one night to a party with a friend. You never know what's around the corner if you just say ""Fuck it!"" and go.
6. **Don't rush into a new relationship.** Now, when you meet these great new people (which you will, in time) you might be tempted to replace your ex. I know I was. But this isn't the time... It also isn't healthy for you or your new flame, because you're not really ready, are you? Are you trying to get back into a relationship because you miss the familiarity? The comfort? The feel of a warm body next to yours in the mornings? Yeah, I know those feelings. You want to be with someone to fill those gaps but hey... wait a while. Don't rush into something with someone you barely know just because you're lonely... you're not doing them any favours and you're not doing yourself justice either. Take some time to heal.
7. **Take it one day at a time.** Things might seem insurmountable now, but don't worry! If you take things one day at a time, the challenge is just to make it to tomorrow. No pain is forever, friends. This too shall pass. You can handle the burden, just focus on ""today"" and don't worry too much about tomorrow. Eventually, one day will turn into the next, which will turn into the next... and eventually, it will all pass. Before you know it, you'll be healed and back to normal! And life will be a-ok :)

I wish each of you nothing but the best in your healing process and I love you all. Remember, things are tough now, but *you* are strong. You can survive this. All the best.

And there are so many people out there going through the same journey too...with all the reasons and complications and details that make it so hard for us. We all have them. 

So however isolated, lonely, rejected, or otherwise horriblly emotional you feel, just know that there's a shit load of people who are in the same boat, which means you are not alone. Hell, there's a subreddit for us :)

I promise that one day you'll wake up and feel a little better, and then your life will start to go on. I'm waiting for that day too, just like all of you. 
It comes, I promise. And when it does, you probably won't tell us about it here. Because you've moved on.

 But that's the point. :)

1345796803.0,101,self.BreakUps,yqu0k,What I learned from my heartbreak,126,25,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/yqu0k/what_i_learned_from_my_heartbreak/,"I got dumped a few months back by the first girl I ever loved. It was by far the most painful and draining experience I've had in my life. It was so sudden, unexpected, and confusing, that I couldn't leave her alone. I didn't stalk her or do anything crazy, but I would still send her a text every few days or call her. She never answered. I didn't know what happened at first and I was furious and demanded answers, like many of you probably have. When my emotions calmed down and I could think clearly, I learned a lot about myself and about what happened. Let me just share a few points that I've learned about relationships/breakups from this breakup. 

- Don't call them. Ever. Yes the most typical piece of advice you can get on this site or others is not to contact them at all, No Contact. I wish I had known earlier, because every text you send, every call you don't get a response for, every emotional letter you send to them hurts you and pushes them farther away and you dig yourself a nice little hole like I did. Trust me, I know it may seem impossible, but you just can't talk to them. If they aren't responding, they don't want to talk to you, and it doesn't matter if it seems like the best thing you've ever written, or you have the perfect arrangement of words to bring them back, it isn't going to work. Leave them alone, so both of you can let the emotions settle and so both of you can grow and learn from this terrible experience. If there is any chance at all that you two can reconcile or be friends, this is the only way it's going to happen. It's too late for me, I tried too hard, so I'm trying to tell all of you not to be like me. Let sleeping dogs lie. 

- They are probably going to see other people, soon if they haven't already. I know that's probably the last thing you want to hear, because it is. Knowing that the person you love is sharing themselves with someone else gives you that tightness in the chest, that rush of adrenaline that makes you shake in fear, or it can make you ill. Although it sucks, it's inevitable. They aren't yours anymore, just like you aren't theirs. Don't decline to go out with your friends just so you can sit around scouring the internet for ways to get them back. Nothing but staying busy, working on yourself, or going out to hopefully meet someone else is ever going to help you. They might be seeing other people, so why shouldn't you? Oh, and if you happen to see your ex with someone else, don't do something stupid. Just say hey or say nothing at all, keep on walking. Although you are hurting, saying anything to their new squeeze or your ex is going to be the end of any hopes of reconciliation you may have. I guarantee you will never speak to them again if you do.

- Look inside yourself. How did you contribute to this breakup? At first I was gung-ho with she's a bitch who doesn't know what she's talking about, it's all her fault, blah blah blah. After about a month I started really thinking about it and I could point to several things that slowly worked together to push her away. Don't be an asshole and assume it was all them, really reflect on things they might have told you that were bothering them, no matter how minor. You'll find your answer and closure there if they didn't give you any. Although you may have done things to drive them away, it still isn't all your fault. I might have done some things that weren't cool, but so did my ex. There is contribution by both of you to the demise of your relationship. Learn from it and make sure that for the next person you avoid any tendencies you identified as a problem with your ex.

- Stay busy. Pretty self explanatory. Don't be like me and sit in your room all day, wasting hours and hours looking through all of these posts and googling every phrase that has to do with your breakup. It's not healthy, and you kinda start getting addicted to coming home and immediately starting your quest to find that magical arrangement of words to make you feel better. Let me tell you after 2 months of the most specific searches and reading hundreds of articles, you aren't going to find it. If your friends invite you to hang out, go be with them. If your friends aren't around, hit the gym or go running. Don't go anywhere near where you know your ex might be if you are out. Coffee places, restaurants, any places you know they frequent, steer fucking clear.

- They aren't coming back. Yes my friends, the absolute worst truth that you eventually have to deal with. I can imagine that a lot of you are constantly checking your phone for some text or missed call from them. That call or text that they apologize for what they did to you, or by some miracle that they want to take you back. Sadly, there is never going to be one. When my ex dumped me I was absolutely certain that she was going to call, no doubt. I figured that she HAD to have realized she had messed up, and in just a few short weeks she was going to call me crying, begging for me to take her back. Well that shit never happened, and I doubt that it will. Yea there are some stories around that pump you up, give you a little hope. Stories like my ex called me 2 weeks later, 2 months later, 3 months later, blah blah blah. Good for those people, but it didn't happen to me, and to be frank I doubt it is going to happen for a lot of you. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though. Once I realized that call wasn't coming, I truly began to get over her. I got serious about being in shape, I quit smoking, and did a whole bunch of other things that I had put on hold because my ex had consumed my life. I came back from being a pathetic excuse of a man who wept every other day, back to the confident and funny guy I always was. You can too, shake your ex off of their pedestal and put yourself back on it. You are number fucking one, don't ever forget it.

This definitely isn't the best writing I've ever done, but I hope that this can help some of you. If you have anything to add, put it in the comments so our friends on /breakups can begin their healing too :)

Edit 1: Here are some more things that I thought of

- There isn't going to be one fantastic day where your heart is healed and you can move on. You can't flip your love on and off like a switch. Your pain and your love for them slowly fade away. Don't hide from your feelings though, embrace your pain and sorrow, squeeze those tears out. Don't wallow in it though, it's not good for you. Don't bottle them up either, it might work in the short term but it is just a ticking time bomb waiting to explode on you. It is a slow and painful process, but you have to want to do it. If you are still clinging on to any hopes of being anything, together or friends, let them go. You aren't going to move on an inch if you are still harboring fantasies of them running back to you. Life isn't a movie, and I'm 99% sure it isn't going to happen.

- A popular question and one that I have asked as well is, ""Does my ex hate me?"" Unless you did something completely crazy or cheated on them, i seriously doubt it. My ex was the epitome of a bitch to me after we broke up, or so I thought. She surprised me with the break-up, ignored me completely afterwards, and it seemed like she didn't care at all. I sent her some nasty texts one day and I felt good about it, felt like she deserved it. Found out later I made her cry. I felt terrible, and learned that even though she seemed like such an ice-queen, she was probably still too torn up about the breakup to respond without emotions attached. Don't assume things about your ex. Honestly, they probably still love you, but that doesn't mean that they want to be in a relationship with you. She was able to do what I couldn't and initiate NC. It was better for both of us that way, although I didn't see it at the time.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1345818024.0,,,True,t3_yqu0k,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/yqu0k/what_i_learned_from_my_heartbreak/,

First, undoubtedly, a lot of the points I make will have been repeated in some of the major threads here. Some have been added intentionally (to be more comprehensive), and some unintentionally (because I haven’t read all the threads in this subreddit). I’m not taking credit for all the things I say here, but I hope you can appreciate the content within.

Secondly, a really quick background on my story for context: 19M here, dated 18F for ~8 months, fell in love with this bitch and this bitch fell in love with me very hard, very fast. Went through a lot (mostly parents) for each other. Both thought we could easily end up together. Intense, passionate, mutual feelings actually did last for most of the relationship. Lots of beautiful memories with bitch, especially at wonderful times like Christmas and New Year’s and birthdays. During last month, bitch changed and become very distant, I clung on because that’s the natural reaction when someone you love starts shunning you with no reason. No one was perfect, hurtful things said from both people, and she broke up with me. It’s been ~1 month, I still love her, so definitely not completely over her. 

I’ve broken the guide into sections so it’ll be easier to find what you’re looking for.

Here we go. 

**The Breakup**

You two break up. The reasons remain irrelevant in most circumstances. Usually, it’s a combination of loss of interest, simultaneous development of interest in different person, boredom, excess conflict, and a lot of bullshiting. But anyway, the break up happens. Most of you reading this will be the people who got broken up with. It feels fucking awful, doesn’t it? You were probably thinking of moving in with that person eventually, maybe getting married, maybe even starting a family. And yet this person leaves your life, often without any hint of remorse. For many of us, we feel lifeless, without purpose. We feel like our world has crumbled, that we have no one to rely on. For me, I lost all my best friends in the process. Thanks for twisting the knife.

**The Immediate Aftermath**

Following the first few days of the break up, you might be in shock/denial. As a result, you might just become very apathetic for the first few days and realize it’s really not a big deal. Ohhh, but it is. When I broke up with my ex, I calmly got out of bed (yeah..*good fucking morning* to you, too), and took a shower and went along with my day. It wasn't until two days after when I really broke down and realized how much my life had changed in that one phone call. So it’s completely normal to feel strangely normal at first, and then completely break down. But more on that later. 

**You’re not alone**

This is the first and most important thing you need to realize. *Yes*, your relationship was unique in the sense that only you two felt those experiences together. That is something the world will never understand. But the emotions associated with those experiences are not. For anyone who’s been in a serious relationship here, we *all* felt (more or less), the same level of love, commitment, affection, passion, admiration when we were with our respective exes. We *all* felt the same level of despair and desolation upon the end of the relationship; some of us are better able to control that chaos within our minds than others. If you feel that your pain is worse than someone else’s, you’re wrong. Obviously, if you compare a ten year relationship versus a ten month relationship, people will feel different levels of hurt, but you’re comparing different contexts here. We all hurt the same here. 

**You’re still moping? How pathetic are you?**

*Just kidding*. Most of us will remain depressed for quite a bit, regardless of the duration of the relationship. I still tear up (read: bawl) on some days, and if you ask any of my close friends, they’ll tell you how much I’ve bitched about that bitch. Whether it was ten months or ten years, the person became a bigger focus of attention than any of our other friends did. We did things for him/her that we never do for our friends. We felt a spectrum of emotions that seemed to belong exclusively to your ex. It’s natural to feel sadness that will never seem to leave since you’re suddenly left with such a massive void. Do you ever feel like you won’t love again? Do you not want to love again? Are you shaken that you haven’t collapsed from all this pain, fear, and anxiety? *Good*. 

I’m glad you’re hurting. Why?

I’m not an ass for saying that (Fine, I am, but not for saying that!), I’m glad you’re hurting because it means that the relationship meant something to you. I’m not talking strictly in the emotional sense. The brain craves anything that gives it pleasure. Trust me guys; I’m a [future] doctor [probably]. Clearly, being with your SO gave you loads of pleasure on a physical and emotional level. We hurt because we miss what made us unbelievably happy, and what gave us that euphoric high. When all of that disappears instantly, your brain isn’t willing to let it all go without a fight. It thrashes and it struggles. But what is really important to realize here is that you *can* gain solace from the *pain*. You need to realize that the emotional turmoil you experience is a good thing, because it means that those x number of weeks/months/years all meant something to you. If your ex walked away from it all without showing any emotion (usually this is just a veil, no one’s a cold-hearted cunt like that), then that simply shows that your ex was dumb enough to waste such a huge chunk of his/her life only to find out he/she didn’t even want to be with you. By that logic, aren’t you the winner here? Sure, the prize is probably the shittiest prize imaginable, but during this low, aren’t you glad that at least you were able to realize how *high* you felt during your time together?

**Frequent this subreddit, but not too much** 

It’s definitely good to read the top posts to gain perspective of how to approach situations like this, but it’s also good not to get too hung up on this subreddit for lingering hopes. While it’s encouraging to see success stories of people who find someone even better, it can be quite off putting to see someone who has been struggling for years after the break up. I’m not trying to segregate those people by any means; people recover at their own pace. But for people who take extremely long times to heal, perhaps professional help is better suited.

**Help out on this subreddit**

I know we’re all focused on our own problems, but take a minute, look around and try and help out those you can. It’s not just a matter of being selfless, but it’s to help you gain some perspective through your own writing. When we write things, our thoughts can’t immediately counter them, since they’re on paper. We’re forced to see what we’ve written in a much more concrete manner, and that has actually led to some really big revelations for me. 

**Coping with the Shitstorm**

*Step 1: Finding a support system*

For many of us, this isn’t difficult because you have completely exclusive circles of friends. For the rest of us with a mutual group of friends, we often end up losing a couple of best friends in this process. It’s like the shitty cherry on top of the shitty ice cream shit sundae. But find a support system as soon as you can. It can literally be anyone who you trust enough to divulge your thoughts to without any boundaries. It could be anything from a sibling to a stranger from this subreddit. Strangers can often help provide the best advice because they’re the most objective as they’ve never interacted with your SO. Further, since you’d have to tell a stranger *all* the details of your story, it draws away the influence of any assumptions that your mutual friends might make. My support system consisted of friends from high school that I was close with, some people that became very close to me after the break up, and then some strangers on Reddit who I’m forever indebted towards. If you’re really having trouble finding someone, message me or something. I promise I’ll reply, even if it takes a while. In the support system, you need to find an attachment figure, a person who you can always vent to, and rant about all the good and the bad of your relationship. Pick a patient person who can sympathize with what you’re going through. Do not always expect an answer from this person, as they often won’t be able to provide you with one, but try and find comfort in knowing someone is willingly able to listen and empathize with you. It also helps in the realization that you aren’t alone in this; others have either gone through very similar circumstances, and they genuinely do care for you and your well being.

_____________________________________________________________________________

Be wholly unprepared. Start in a position of confidence so solid, so complete, that you have begun to define yourself entirely by this relationship. Never quite realize how dependent you’ve become, how much you’ve come to rely on another person for your happiness, until it’s much too late. Only when you begin to feel them slip through your fingers do you start to think about how much they have come to mean to you. Realize that it is far too much, all at once.

Notice changes in them that would be imperceptible to someone who didn’t know them as well as you do. Watch the way they seem distracted over dinner, the way they laugh less at jokes, the way they avoid your eye contact when they touch you during sex. Realize that they always used to look you in the eye, but you never understood how important that was until it stopped happening. Start insisting on eye contact, on more touch, on more engagement.

Notice as they become palpably put-off by your need to be closer, understand that it is a cycle. They will back away from you in a thousand tiny ways, you will insist on your presence being something they feel and see and touch, they will be even more threatened by all that your presence implies. Start to understand that being in a relationship means a constant form of contact with someone — a constant importance placed on their existence and their happiness — and that your partner is no longer comfortable with that. Feel the way they want to get rid of you; cling tighter.

Know the day where the speech is coming. Feel it in your bones when they call you and ask you to meet them somewhere — somewhere public enough that you won’t make a scene. Want with every fiber of your being not to go to this place because it feels so much like walking to your own death, but know that the words are something that you can no longer avoid. Suddenly think of all the things you could have done differently, you could have been more or less of, and imagine that one of them would have been the magic formula to make them still be in love with you. Hate yourself in a way you’ve never before experienced.

Hear them say the words, but don’t really. It’s something about wanting to be alone for a while, needing space, change — but you have gone temporarily deaf. Try not to cry, but feel your throat catch every time you open your mouth to talk. Want to remain stoic about the whole thing, but reduce yourself to begging with only the tiniest bit of resistance. Offer things, left and right, as though you could somehow barter your way into someone’s heart again. Be ready to become anything they want, to lie about who you are and what you want, just to please them and convince them that they are making a mistake.

Want to physically hold onto their leg as they walk out the door, shedding every layer of dignity you came in here with. Think about the people you could call and talk to right now, the people who would understand and start to put this wholly incomprehensible situation into some kind of perspective. Realize that no one could make you feel better, no one could really understand, that you are entirely alone in a way you’ve never really experienced before. Want to just cry, cry until you finally fall asleep.

Hear people all around you tell you that things are going to get better, that they didn’t deserve you, that you have so many amazing things ahead of you. Want to tell them to go fuck themselves, even if they think they’re being kind. Know that the only person who could ever possibly make you feel better has no interest in talking to you, and wonder how in the world you are supposed to continue getting out of bed when such is the case. Let your friends’ words of inspiration wash over you, and occasionally glance at your phone, waiting for the right person to call.

Maybe you knew it was coming; there was a hint of awkwardness, a fight that didn't seem to end properly, a stiffness behind their eyes. Maybe you had no warning; suddenly, the light of your life was abruptly extinguished, and you hear words of hubris like ""I'm just not in love like I was, I'm so sorry..."".
Maybe you cheated, and they found out. Maybe you fell out of love and ended everything. Maybe grad school happened, or a baby. Maybe you were married for thirty years, and cannot fathom a life without them. Maybe you saw them on the bus once, and got a little obssessed. Maybe they're a friend of a friend who you had great chemistry with, but unreconcilable lifestyles.
It could be anything. It could be nothing. There could be no good reason for someone to leave, and yet they do, simply because something isn't right. 

Life. There are many tears, and more reasons for them. Sometimes, a person just need to think about life, and thank god that they were born a functioning human being, and not one of the amoebas living in the neck crust of Honey Boo Boo Child's mother, Mama June. Hail Mary.

Back to the shit-ass-ness...nothing is quite like losing a relationship. It happens all the time. No pain is quite like it. There isn't much point in trying to classify what has happened to you, or to me. It just has. What happened has happened, and there is only one way to go: forward. Onward, and upward. Limbo is not allowed, lest your mind sink into the maddness of wondering ""what if"" and ""if only"" and ""I should have"". 

Maybe things could have been different. But they aren't. They aren't and they won't ever be, not in that context. The important thing is, that there will be a new you. Hold onto the new you, because they will be hovering over you for the rest of your life. Makes friends with this version of you. Don't wonder if true love exists, because it does. Take comfort in this. 

Have faither in the healing power of time. She is an abrupt and terrifying teacher, but very thorough. Learn your lessons and move on. Move on!

Let your past make you better, not bitter. Each one is special, but each one is special (so stay open to the new ones). Don't forget to be fine, because you are. You're fine. You'll be just fine. And that's enough for now.

You guys have been there for me so I'm trying to give back however I can. Right now I feel good, honestly -  probably the best I've felt in over a month. Now I'm not recovered, not even close; in a few hours when I go to bed I know I'll feel like shit again, and again in the morning, but what matters right now is that at this moment, I am okay. 

I think these things can help all of us regardless of what stage we're in, whether the breakup happened yesterday or a year ago (my heart goes out to all of you still dealing with these things). Personally, my breakup started 3 weeks ago but didn't really finish until Sunday. You can check my post history if you really want details, or you can pm me.

Without further ado...

***1) Work Out*** - Yes, everyone offers this advice? Why? Because it works, that's why. Not only is it healthy, but for 15, 30, 45, whatever amount of minutes that you're working out nothing else matters - that's huge. Plus there's all that scientific hormone stuff too (endorphins = good). Don't make excuses - I come home after work and my workout clothes are waiting at the door. I change on the spot. I never shower in the mornings because if I do I know I'll be tempted to skip the workout because I'll have to shower again. Just make it happen. Start small if you need to, it can be as little as a 15 minute walk - just make sure you do something and do it regularly, and go from there.

***2) Deal with the Nights*** - Nights suck as we all know. Here's something not everyone will tell you... don't sleep in your bed. Seriously. I've been sleeping at friends, at my parents, on the couch, whatever. The couch isn't always the comfiest but I don't know about the rest of you it's not like I'm sleeping well anyway. Engage in a passive distraction when going to bed - I listen to music and just focus on the lyrics. It helps keep my mind somewhat focused without being so worked up that I can't sleep. If you're the person that likes white noise, give that a try. If all else fails, watch TV until your eyes close on their own.

***3) Make Daily Goals*** - Nothing too ambitious (though you can!) if you don't want. My list today was morning warmup, workout, buy ice scraper, start a new book, watch walking dead, read about meditation. It doesn't matter if you don't do them all - buying an ice scraper has been on my list for a week now - just make sure you do at least a few and bump the rest to tomorrow. It'll make you feel like you at least accomplished something.

***4) Have a Morning Routine*** - Mornings are brutal, enough said. I lie in bed hitting snooze and feeling miserable, but eventually I do get up. First thing I do when I get out of bed is some quick excercises - pushups, jumping jacks, whatever. Do them for a minute or two, that's all you need to clear your mind and get the uices flowing. Check it off your list.

***5) Positive Thinking*** - It's not easy at times like this but there's ways you can make yourself do it without even realizing it. Sitting there bored and sad and about to type ""how to get your ex back"" into google (don't worry, we've all been there)? Instead type ""self improvement"" or go to something like /r/decidingtobebetter. Read an article. Even if you don't ever put the stuff you read to use this forces you to think about yourself, not him/her, and in a positive light nonetheless.

***6) Open Up*** - As a guy, I spent 99% of my life abiding by this masculine stereotype that we need to be strong and deal with our issues on our own ( you know, the classic stoic). Guess what? I couldn't deal with this on my own, so fuck that stereotype. Break free of it. I've opened up to friends and family for the first time and have become more trusting of people in general, despite the fact things my ex did left me with trust issues. Now I'm not saying walk up to a stranger and lay your heart on the line, but if you have some people you trust, use them. If not, come here, or better yet, do both. I'll even make you a promise, right now - if you don't have someone you feel you can trust and you're not comfortable posting your issues out in public for the world to see, send me a PM. I will reply. End of story. You don't have to be alone in this and you shouldn't either.

***7) Try Something New*** - Anything! I've got a bunch of stuff I'm trying but for example, something easy I'm giving a shot is /r/penpals. Why not? It's not very time intensive, it's easy to do, gives you someone to talk to, you make a new friend, and the best part of all about doing something new - it's pretty tough to relate to your ex. This is something for you and about you. Enjoy it. If you feel up to it, do something a little out of your comfort zone!

***8) Stay off Facebook*** - Now, it doesn't matter if you blocked him/her or not, whether she stills show up on your newsfeed, or whatever. Maybe I'm alone in this, but if you go on Facebook you see updates of people's lives. Going through a breakup and all, it's a safe bet you probably thought about your ex more than once today and seeing all these other life updates will make you wonder what's going on in your ex's life. Even if you resist temptation to look at his/her page, it doesn't matter - they're already on your mind. Just don't do it. If you need to go on quick to see a message or something, do it from your phone. It's less functional and you can just close right out of it after you're done.

***9) Create a New Attachment Figure*** - I don't know how I forgot about this one in the original post as I think it's pretty huge. When you're in a relationship, that person makes up a huge portion of life as you know it. He/she is the one you tell about the random things in your day, the one you complain to about your asshole boss, the one you say goodnight to every night and the one you think will always be there for you. So when that person suddenly disappears from your life, regardless of whether it was your choice or not, there's one massive gaping hole. Nothing is going to replace this person, not yet anyway. However, there is something you can do and it's pretty simple, you can even use draw names out of a hat or something. Just pick someone you can talk to on a frequent basis that won't mind and make them your new attachment figure; it can be a friend, parent, penpal, whatever works best for you. Next time your boss gets on your nerves, text, call, e-mail them, whatever mode of communication you're comfortable with. Actively do this with everything - I'm serious - text them goodnight when you go to bed if that's not awkward. Make an effort to talk to this person about all the little things and with time, it will become more natural to think of them when this stuff happens. Next thing you know, you may find yourself thinking of your ex less often because every time these daily occurrences happen, the first person that comes to mind may not be your ex. Give it a try, seriously.

That's it for now folks. Hang in there, I know it's not an easy ride.

INCREDIBLE!",94,12,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1dc0jb/12_core_boundaries_to_live_by_in_life_dating/,"1. Under no circumstances will I date someone who is married or has a partner.

This also rules out people who have just separated, have been long term separated with no actual divorce on the horizon, and who are not over their ex. You are not a buffer/emotional airbag. You’re not someone to pass time with while they figure out what they do and don’t want, and the moment that you involve yourself in any of the above situations, the person knows that they don’t really have to do anything. If they lie to you and let you think they’re single, abort mission.

I should also remind about ‘lender awareness’ – do not allow yourself to be in a situation where you are sharing your man, whether it’s because you turn a blind eye to his cheating, or you keep letting him break up with you and then take him back once he’s got her/them out of his skin…which brings me neatly to…

2. I will not spend my time waiting around, whether it’s for their calls, or for them to show up after they’ve disappeared, waiting for them to come back, waiting for them to turn into The Man I Think He Could/Should Be, or waiting for them to decide if they want to be with me – I’m not putting my life on hold for anyone.

When a man is interested, you are in no doubt about their interest and they don’t run the risk of losing you. You have to stop acting like every guy could be the one and like there’s a fire – there isn’t. You deserve better than someone’s half hearted interest and there is no excuse for any man keeping you waiting around. He snoozes, he loses. The sooner they experience this, the sooner they learn to treat the women they date with more respect.

This also means you will avoid being in barely there, ‘non-relationships’.

When someone’s interested in you and wants a relationship, you know you’re in that relationship and it’s not ambiguous or a secret.

And never, ever, ever, ever, ever, wait around for someone to decide whether they want a relationship with you. Don’t demean yourself!

3. I will not continue engaging in any relationship where either they or I don’t treat me with love, care, trust, and respect.

Start as you mean to go on. Even though love is not there from the outset, there is no excuse for someone not to treat you with care, trust, and respect. It’s called integrity and decency. By the same token, if loving them means you can’t love you, always choose you. Do not erode your self-esteem by disrespecting yourself in a relationship. If you don’t treat you decently, others won’t. This is a fundamental part of having boundaries. If you can’t date with self-esteem, don’t date until you can.

4. I will not continue dating someone who reveals themselves to be a Future Faker or a Future Avoider.

Whether they tell lies about the future to get what they want in the present or they just refuse to talk about the future, if you’re involved with Pinocchio or you’re with someone who can’t see their way to making plans with you, cut them off as soon as this becomes evident.

Some people just can’t help but talk themselves up a storm at the beginning. They believe their own hype and overestimate their interest and end up making promises they can’t and won’t deliver on. Watch how quickly their personality switches or they disappear when they’re expected to deliver. Don’t waste your life waiting for them to become the Person They Were In The Beginning.

If someone is reluctant to talk about the future, it’s because they don’t want to give you the impression that you’re in it or they don’t want to accidentally commit and give you the wrong idea.

5. I will not date someone who controls the relationship on their terms – I must be in mutually fulfilling, balanced, healthy relationships.

Plain and simple, if you are not on an equal footing in the relationship and one person is dictating the temperature and pace and deciding what does and doesn’t happen, you are in an unhealthy relationship. You’ll know it’s only their terms when you try to instigate your own or balance things out – they’ll shut down/disappear/get confrontational or pretend to agree and then revert back to doing their own thing.

6. I will not allow someone to use me for sex, devalue me sexually, or treat me in a less than manner.

It’s your prerogative to have casual sex but you should only be doing so if it’s what you actually want and are not building up feelings. You cannot work your way up from booty call to girlfriend. Likewise, if your relationship is all about the sex and you want more than this, opt out. Don’t let someone use you as a sexual plaything or degrade you – you must have limits.

7. I will drop guys who manage the bulk of the communication in our relationship by text, email, or instant messenger, like a hot potato.

There is no excuse for this lazy communication and it’s the hallmark of emotionally unavailable people who want to keep themselves distant. It’s not modern relationships and dating – it’s modern booty calls and half hearted interest. It says, I’m not interested enough to actually make a proper effort with you.

8. I will not allow lies to foster my interactions, whether it’s being in denial or listening to bullshit, being fed lies, or getting the truth distorted.

Feet in reality, shed the fur coat of denial and keep yourself on a Bullsh*t Diet. Don’t let anybody dripfeed you the truth, twist it around, or repeatedly lie to you and get caught out. If you accept it, they’ll think they have license to keep lying to you. People who have integrity and respect you don’t lie to you.

9. I will not pursue someone who has either directly or passively rejected me.

Trust me, you know when someone is not interested or is half hearted and using you for what they can get, or has outright turned you down. If they were interested, you wouldn’t still be chasing them!

This means no pursuing them after they have turned you down, been half hearted in their interest, shagged around on you, not bothered to call you, pit you against other women and certainly no chasing someone to convince them that they should be interested in you. You have more self respect than this and you don’t need to be the equivalent of a used car salesman forcing yourself on someone.

10. I will not play Florence Nightingale because it is not my job to fix/heal/help the Walking Wounded, which means no partners with substance dependency/abuse and no partners that have issues that prevent them from healthily engaging in a relationship.

Everyone has issues but there’s baggage and there’s baggage. Let them sort out their own problems and don’t hide behind theirs. Always acknowledge the red flag that is a dependency on something or emotional/behavioural issues that prevent a healthy relationship. If you ignore, you’ll make the ill advised assumption that your feelings cancel out your concerns – they don’t.

11. I will not date an assclown – someone who is unkind/cruel, lacking in empathy, and at best takes advantage and at worst, abuses me.

When someone treats you poorly, it’s not going to get better because you claim to love them but it will get worse if you stick around. Check out my post on red flags as well.

12. I will not make up excuses for other people’s behaviour or make exceptions to my boundaries. My boundaries are non-negotiable!

Do not treat your partners like children even if they act like it. Don’t make it up as you go along either and come up with your own reasons for why you think they behave as they do. That’s projection. Respect your own boundaries, so that either others do, or you recognise when they don’t. But do not make exceptions because you will keep lengthening your yardstick. This guideline also applies to when they ask you to make an exception to your normal rule of behaviour – someone who genuinely has your best interests at heart will not expect or demand that you do something outside of your normal behaviour.

Whether you're initially doing it to make your ex miss you, to punish your ex, to try to get your ex back, it doesn't matter. All roads lead to the same destination: healing. In the end, you may get your ex back, you may not. But you get YOU BACK. 

Posting Dramallama's awesome thread on here for redditors to refer to when they're not sure to go No Contact after a break up or are seriously thinking of breaking No Contact. It's helped me, I hope it helps you.

**Reasons why you shouldn't be friends/in contact with your ex or unrequited love.**

1) It's another way to avoid dealing with the pain of a break-up or loss but you will have to deal with it sooner or later, like when your ex starts dating someone else... and it will happen

2) It shows your ex that you don't have the confidence to walk away from someone that has ALREADY told you that they don't see a future with you

3) It relieves your ex of their guilt

4) It shows your ex that you are willing to settle for less than what you want. You lose your self-respect; they lose respect for you

5) It shows your ex that you are not strong or confident enough to stand on your own two feet

6) It will keep the pain fresh and give you false hope

7) Instead of living your life and healing, you will spend that time analysing your ex's behaviour. ""does this mean he/she wants to get back together?"" or you will spend your time trying to manipulate your own behaviour so that they will want you back (it's not fun).

8) You will have to see how much fun they are having when they are free and single without you tying them down

9) You will have to repress your true feelings because you are the one that accepted this arrangement, trying to let your ex believe that you are cool with it

10) Your ex can sleep with you/lead you on/tease you/hang out together, but if you get ""the wrong impression"" your ex can say, ""but babe, we're just friends, remember? You agreed to that and I don't want to be tied down right now."" Ouch.

11) It will stop YOU from meeting and seeing (with your heart) people that WILL want to be with you. from meeting someone that will not be happy with just being friends. Someone that is so crazy about YOU, that friends simply won't do.

12) You will probably see or hear about your ex flirting with someone else, or worse, sleeping with them. Like a knife to your heart. Gah!

13) It keeps you in a perpetual state of limbo where you are uncertain about what your future holds (in a bad way)

14) It does nothing to help your self esteem and dignity (which is low after a break up anyway) because you are asking yourself, ""why doesn't my ex want to be with me? what is so wrong with me that I'm right here waiting for them and they still turn me down?""

15) It doesn't give you time to get perspective or clarity or to learn anything from the relationship. You can only look at something objectively when enough time has passed. You cannot do that if you are in the middle of the hurricane.

16) It lets your ex use YOU as their emotional tampon (where you have to soak up all of their problems), where you are there for them when THEY need you. But with them it's a different story when it comes to YOUR needs. Also, you may be reluctant to express your needs because you want to be ""cool"" and not put any ""pressure"" on your ex, so they don't think you are asking too much of them. In the end it just drives you crazy because you can't act how you want to act. You become frustrated version of yourself which drives you to be even more clingy. 

17) If there's a true basis for friendship, it will still be there in six months, a year, or however long you need to heal and move on. There's no rush.

18) If your ex is already in a relationship/dating and you keep in touch with them it will give them an ego boost and it will make their new relationship MORE successful than if you weren't around. Why? Because you are a good distraction for what might be going wrong in their new relationship. If their new relationship is only half as fulfilling, they will go to YOU to fill in the gaps, then when they cuddle up to their new partner at night, the ex is fulfilled. But if you go away and make yourself scarce, then your ex must make a choice as to whether his new relationship is fulfilling in all the ways as they would like.

18) It won't give your ex a chance to miss you if you stay in contact, any contact. People only appreciate something when it's gone or when they don't have access to it. Think about someone or something that is in your face everyday - a friend/acquaintance who contacts you a bit TOO much, your favourite food that is always in the fridge, a shirt that you like to wear that is hanging in your wardrobe. You take for granted something when it is available. 

But when you can't have it, you want it MORE. You feel a bit more lonely now that your friend that hasn't been contacting you at all and you realise just how fun they were to have around. Your favourite food has gone out of production and so you start craving some to eat because it's not available to buy anymore. Your favourite shirt has gone missing so you turn the house upside down looking for it because you realise just how great it looks on you.

I'm not necessarily saying that it will make your ex come back, but it IS basic psychology to appreciate something that is not available anymore, and that goes for your dumper ex appreciating the great things about you. It also lets the negative reasons why they broke up with you to fade away, and for the good feelings to return. Even if your ex is begging you to stay friends, this point STILL applies!

19) They can't miss you if you are hanging around like a bad smell. If you take them at their word and leave and disappear into the fog, it WILL make your ex re-think their decision and whether it was the right choice to leave you, even if they only end up considering it for a split second. Doesn't mean that the decision will be reversed in your favour, but they will ask themselves, ""did I do the right thing?""

And when people try to minimize your pain they are doing you a disservice. And when you try to minimize your own pain you’re doing yourself a disservice. Don’t do that. The truth is that it hurts because it’s real. It hurts because it mattered. And that’s an important thing to acknowledge to yourself.

What are your opinions.,89,10,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1htfcn/is_it_true_that_dumper_check_out_of_the/,"I've read countless articles about being dumped out of the blue. My personal experience saw that one, seemingly normal argument, led to me being dumped.

The many articles suggest that a dumper mentally prepares themselves for the eventual breakup. All the small things add up, and their minds are made up. There is a point where the dumper feels the breakup is not salvageable but continues until an end point. 

This post really got to me: [A few posts down](http://www.loveshack.org/forums/breaking-up-reconciliation-coping/coping/177026-dumper-s-vs-dumpee-s-sadness)

&gt; By the time you've been dumped, the dumper has already run the gamut of emotions and has already mourned the loss of the relationship and is ready to move on. Unfortunately, they hide that from you - so from the dumpee's POV, it appears that the person who last week was saying ""I love you"" went from that to indifference in a mind boggling period of time. 

&gt; I see it on here quite often - people who find themselves dumped seemingly out of the blue by someone, and the person dumping them seemed to have become a cold stranger overnight. 

&gt; Trust me, it is never overnight. When you get dumped, you are seeing the end of a lengthy process that was hidden from you until they felt they were ready to let go of you. Unfortunately for you it is the beginning. They have moved on, and you want answers. They finished their healing process (or nearly completely so) before you even knew you would need one. 

&gt; So, does that lengthy process a dumper goes through hurt? You damned right it does. It starts with a dying spark one day. A tiny one. Not even noticeable, but as the days, months, years go by more and more of the fire goes out - slowly. The guilt that you feel when you find yourself falling out of love is crushing. You know you should love this person, but you find yourself not loving them a little more each day. You feel sad that the love you felt is going, and you can't get it back. You are saying goodbye to the relationship and there is this profound sadness that no matter what you do, and no matter what your partner does - you just can't get it back.

&gt; As the sadness is replaced with acceptance, the letting go process starts: the dumper gets irritated with you over things too often. There are sullen silences. The sex goes from joyous to either rote or obligatory, and then slows down to nothing eventually. The dumper begins to feel trapped and ready to leave, but guilty at the same time. This causes helpless anger to boil up inside them - often taken out on the dumpee in the form of nagging, nitpicking or just plain hostility. Sometimes that part is hidden completely though, and the dumper will continue to say ""I love you"" even when he/she doesn't feel it because it is expected, and they know it is what the dumpee wants to hear. 

&gt; Then, its time to let go. This is where you start hearing ""I need space/time"". By this time, its over. Usually the dumper has either found someone else, or is interested in something new in general and is looking for a humane way to let go. If they still have unresolved feelings or the new thing doesn't work out, they will come back for a second chance. Usually though, it is just a long goodbye. 

&gt; Dumpers do feel bad about what is going on. Unfortunately by the time that final goodbye is on the table, that feeling bad has passed to a near impatient indifference. 

&gt; That is why they can say they want to be friends/keep in contact/etc - they are emotionally ready for that, and on some level it helps them assuage some of that guilt.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1htfcn,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1htfcn/is_it_true_that_dumper_check_out_of_the/,

Have I told you lately how much I love you and want to be with you? No? Well, here it is.

•	treat me like crap

•	ignore me

•	cheated on me

•	all the above


**I am convinced that you are**

•	such a catch/brass ring/prize

•	the greatest person in the universe

•	the light of my life

•	a wonderland

•	all the above


**I am sure of this because:**

•	I have no self-esteem

•	I am a raging codependent

•	I like to be mistreated

•	Damn, I like a good challenge!

•	All of the above

**It is impossible for me to keep from contacting you. Therefore, I am choosing to contact you, chase you and**

•	plead with you, pretty please, stop acting like this

•	yell at you in the hopes you turn into what I *want* to think you are

•	lecture at you to show you I really mean it, dammit

•	show you how much I love you and only you because you are so attractive

•	All of the above. Preferably at the same time.

**To have you and only you, I am giving up all hope of ever having:**

•	a happy life

•	a loving mate

•	a healthy relationship

•	the respect of my friends and family

•	all of the above

**It is my fervent hope that you end:**

•	your silence

•	your confusion

•	your denial that we are meant to be

•	your relationship with someone else

•	all of the above

**But if you don’t, it’s okay because:**

•	you are wonderful and I am pitiful

•	you are really great and not worth giving up even though you don’t give me a single iota of attention

•	moving on is hard work and I’d rather chase after you than save myself and build my own life

•	why not?

•	all of the above

**So I am sending this via:**

•	email

•	mail

•	series of texts

•	Facebook status

•	all of the above

**I hope you never think that:**

•	I have standards or boundaries or self-respect

•	I will ever ask to be treated differently

•	You can’t get away with everything and more

•	You have to show me, in any way shape or form, that you care

**Because:**

•	I don’t

•	I won’t

•	You don’t


**I hope you know that I will be here waiting whenever you decide to grace me with your mighty presence for that is the only time I really feel**

•	alive

•	well

•	human

•	itchy

**Until then, take care of your precious self. I will be here continuing to wait on you, pine for you and throw away my life.**

1363673276.0,76,self.BreakUps,1akux5,The most important thing you will ever do is love yourself.,86,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1akux5/the_most_important_thing_you_will_ever_do_is_love/,"I wrote this as a comment in another thread but I felt compelled to post this as an entirely new post because hopefully more people can benefit from it. You deserve to know you're not alone. ~~Because every single thing you said rings true to what I've been feeling.~~ I have a few things to say.

I am going to lead with this:

**The most important thing you will ever do is love yourself.** 
I had this epiphany today and though it is unbelievably hard to face, at the end of the day when we're lying in bed thinking of them—we must stop believing in them. We must believe in ourselves. That we deserve something amazing, something beautiful. That we are fucking worth so much more than they are willing to now give us. We must reach into ourselves to a depth before unknown, and realize that we are beautiful, amazing people and we deserve our own love. Our own respect.

* **Don't do the friends thing.** You're doing it because you're still madly in love with them and you stupidly listen to your heart and believe that there is something to salvage. That you miss their company. It will not help. It will make it impossible for you to let them go completely and will give them the satisfaction of getting whatever they need from you while harming you in return. It condones their behavior and 'allows' them to not hurt like you do. Like we do. At the end you say you're sick of feeling used and unwanted. Those feelings are caused by you fueling the fucked-up remnants that still remain. They will get worse with time if you continue having contact with this person. They will never be who you want them to be; the 'them' you remember is unfortunately not going to come back. We can't make them who we want them to be.

* **They are not going to hurt as much as we are.** There's a song I listen to where the main chorus is 'cuz when a heart breaks no it don't break even.' This is the epitome of why we hurt so bad. Because they don't. And it is a sad realization but one I undoubtedly share with you, that they don't feel betrayed like we do.. They don't feel shattered and devastated. After everything we put into the relationship, it leaves the bitterest taste in your mouth to see how easy it seems for them to just put the entirety of our relationship, the emotional weight, our love, behind them. If your relationship is a true mirror of mine, then you may have yet to realize that the reason they don't feel the way we do is because they've been letting us go for some time. They've already grieved, but because we are not what they now want, it isn't as hard for them to move on.

* **You are not alone.** I promise you, every single word you have uttered is an exact mirror of my heart right now. We are not alone. There are tons of people who have had their dignity stolen from them, the thieves being the people we trusted and to whom we gave everything we had. They leave with our trust, our pride, our hearts and our self-esteem. Within the hellish storm that is devastation, amongst the constant bombardment of waves of tears—we must find solace. It's not that we should or that we can, but we must. We must, at our own time and upon our own journey, have the most beautiful epiphany. *We are worth it.* When it was good, it was great. We were amazing fucking people. And we still are. We must love ourselves. Treat your heart, mind and soul as a temple. Sure, food and exercise are nourishment.. like grounds work. But the beauty lies within. When we realize how sacred it is within our temple walls, when we realize how amazing we are, how fucking hard we tried; when we realize that we deserve as much love as we have to give, as much love as allll the pain we've been harboring, we will find solace. It doesn't mean we'll be better in a day, but once you can truly start to love yourself, believe that you are worth a damn, that what they did was so unbelievably cruel, how they left you in the dust before you could even blink, and now even though you're still trying to hang on for dear life you see no love in their eyes; you will liberate yourself. You won't just get over them, but you will liberate yourself from feeling like you must hang on. You will free yourself from believing they were the best thing about you. Because it's not true my dear. It is once we start to love ourselves again, are able to laugh at ourselves again, are able to have a sliver of fun on our own again; you will realize YOU are the best thing about you. You will remember all those things you loved and all those things that you have to offer that they weren't interested in. You will rediscover your quirkiness. And once again you will be able to start moving, as slowly as it may be, along your path. Because you know that eventually that awesome, grand landmark you stopped at was just a small part of your journey. That in the end your journey is to find yourself.

* **Stop giving in and feeling like you need to hold onto them.** Not only are you condoning the pain they put you through and are continuing to put you through, but you will never be able to once again move upon your path until you realize that you are more than that 'sight.' You are more than the place (the person) you're leaving. It is your journey and you can't stay in a place (with a person) that is not your destination. Your destination is home. It is a place of contentment, euphoria, happiness. It is a place where that hurt won't find you. They were a stop on your path. But we are travelers and our lives are journeys and home is that person that would never leave us so indignant, so wronged, so unjustly destroyed, on a sinking ship with not even a lifejacket. Home begins with loving yourself, being okay with being your own best friend, and continuing on this journey alone. It may be dark and scary at times, especially when we lie our head down at night and first wake in the morning. We will undoubtedly be flooded by overwhelming memories. But the forests will lift and we will feel the sun's warmth once again. And 'must' having to soldier on will become 'wanting' to soldier on. Until we find someone to complement us. Not complete us; but complement us. And until they accompany us home.

No, really. When you think of it this way - they analyzed everything about you in their heads. They took you at face value. Your ethics, your morals, your personality, your passion, your determination, your social skills, your family, your goals, your ambitions; everything about you. And they weighed up that criteria and told themselves, ""I'm better off without that."" 

Sucks to think about, right? I'm sitting here 3 weeks and change into a breakup myself where my ex-gf dumped me because she was ""stressed with her own life"" and ""wanted to figure things out on her own"". She untagged photos of us on Facebook, and blocked chat on Facebook, despite me going into no contact mode. I have class with her. I see her every week around campus. Still, when I get down on myself, I realize that there's an opportunity to be had here. Changing yourself. Molding yourself into what you want to be. The old me is gone. It's time to reintroduce yourself to yourself. 

(S)he rejected you. Everything about you. For whatever reason. But here's where the good part comes. The old you is gone. It's dead. The life you had or thought you had is now over. And you're left with rebuilding yourself from the ground up. Be the change that you want to be. Sit down. Think about what it is you want for YOURSELF. Gym membership? Better job? New wardrobe? New circle of friends? All of that is within your realm of control. The best piece of advice I've received from my circle of friends during this time is, ""Sort out all the stuff you can control. Let the world sort out all the other crap you can't.""

Tell yourself from now on ""I will commit to myself. I will commit to my well-being."" But more importantly, tell yourself, ""I will be brave"". Being brave is the most important thing during a break up. It shows people around you that you're here, and you're here to do you. It shows yourself that there is happiness at the end of this long and dark tunnel. You can't sort out someone else without first sorting out yourself.

The biggest tool you have is yourself. Improve. Commit. Succeed.

Picture this. Take your situation with the breakup. And reverse the role. You were the dumper. How much would it suck to see your ex around, that you said ""I'm better off without that"", and see them dress better? To see them get in shape - get that six pack, get that muscle definition? To have their friends say, ""Wow, (s)he looks good""? How tough would it be to see the new and improved ex? The happy, better looking, rejuvenated ex. I know for sure it would haunt me and I'd lose a good deal of sleep. I'd be kicking myself senseless asking myself, ""Crap, why did I give that up?"". Adopt that mindset. And feed into that. Be the better you. If you can deliver that, then you'll enter that mindset of being the better and bigger person.

And through that mindset, you will discover that you're here. Fighting a silent battle. Where you are the ultimate victor. You're strong. You can do this. And at times, it seems like a roller coaster. That dull feeling comes around and creeps up on you. I urge you to fight through it. Rely on your friends. Rely on your family. Rely on yourself. And through time, those feelings for your ex will pass. Slowly but surely, they'll fade. And the end result will be the new and improved you - the victor of that silent battle - looking better, dressing better, feeling better. And you'll then turn your attention to the rest of the world. And continue that fight. And win.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_13diye,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/13diye/some_daily_motivation_for_those_going_through_a/,

I know it sounds like it's the hardest thing to do. Trust me I know.

From personal experience the best thing you CAN do is to let them go. Why you ask? Because if you can't let them go how are you ever going to self improve on yourself and create a persona of a person that is even greater than it is now? You have to make yourself better before someone else can see it. Give yourself time away from others and be single.

I know it sounds like I'm saying don't chase. It's because I am saying just that. You can't chase after someone that doesn't want to be chased. Force them to see that you're worth being chased after. Don't give into the temptations of seeking after another. Seek the temptation of wanting others to seek you!

I know you feel lost right now but being open minded about everything around you is the best thing you can do. Don't let yourself be filled with this void that feels so empty because they up and left you. I'm not the best at telling advice but I know from personal experience that as of this moment. I dearly want her back too. Only thing is I have to let the bird fly from it's nest before (if or when) she decides to come back. If she doesn't then another bird will surely land in this nest and be like ""hey this looks like a good home I just might stay here"".

I know you may think she is the only one for you at this point but there is no such thing as ""The One"". You have to look at life on the brighter side. See things in the ways which you couldn't whilst in a relationship. Live life positively and GOOD. Never digress into something you aren't.

I thought about suicide too. A few days after we broke up. I decided against it. There's nothing in it that will benefit you, her, your mother, father, brother, sister, friends, cousins, aunts, uncles, and etc. Think of how many people it'll hurt before you decide to do something so rash. You're loved by SO many you just have to open your eyes. Realize that there are people around you that love you more than you can imagine. Embrace them. Open up. Be someone that you never thought you could be.

Even if you THINK she hates you. You don't know for sure. You'll never know unless she herself tells you. Even than a females feelings can be swayed in a matter of seconds. One second they can love you. The next they can hate you. The next they're falling back in love with you all over again. It just takes YOU to make that change. Never go backwards though always STRIVE to be the best you can EVER be.

The only ways I know how to fix your situation is just by doing the things I'm going to tell you now.

- Go out with friends
- Cut contact with them. I don't care if you have to delete them from your life. As in Facebook, Phone, E-mails, texts, letters, EVERYTHING. Put all those things. Lock them up and don't look at them until you can finally one day see them and be like ""Heh.. those were some good times"".
- All the mistakes you made. IT'S OK PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES! We're all human! That's why we're human. Because we make mistakes. The difference is, are you one of those that are going to sit there and do nothing about it? Or are you going to change what you did wrong and make yourself a better person. You tell me. Wait matter of fact hold that thought. You already know the answer!
- Seek new companions (friends) and make them good bonds
- Work out (yes this is definitely something that helped me so much)
- You owe them NOTHING. Absolu-fucking-tely NOTHING.
- Meet new females (YES)
- Date other girls (I know this sounds extremely hard but just try it out. But also give yourself that space needed. Do not lead anyone on as that is the WORST thing you can do. Be respectful of her feelings.)
- Change the WRONGS you did in the relationship and fucking work at it as hard as you can.
- Everything you did RIGHT in the relationship keep at it. Do it even MORE so than you did before. Why in the fuck not? It's what made her attracted to you. Who's to say it won't attract another beautiful lady right around the corner.
- Take time to allow yourself to heal before you jump into another relationship though. Never just jump into something. It's called a rebound relationship for a reason. It's to delay the healing process and it'll only hurt you and the other later on down the line
- Take time to appreciate things around you and see things for what they really are. You'll see how much just a small walk through the park by yourself can do. Even better go for a walk with a friend.
- Man up. Become a man! No woman wants a crying blubbering fool. Be confident in your ability to attract others and attract them properly and well.
- Go out with your boys! Fuck man there are so many things to do in town. Go to a bar, go to a club, hit up a movie, go shoot some billiards, do a poker night, have a drink at the park, go to a friends house play some video games, there are a TON of things!
- Go out with some girls! Go to a movie with them, go to the mall, maybe have a dinner night with them, have some gossip get to know the ins and outs! It shows the women you truly care. It's true though right?
- Go out with people that will be willing to have an open ear. Really it does help a lot trust me.
- Do not be afraid to cry when you're with somebody (that is of course comfortable with you). Or by yourself. It takes time to heal these wounds.
- Time is everything at this point. Do not be afraid to take as much time as you need.
- ALWAYS FUCKING REMAIN RESPECTFUL. I can't fucking stress this enough. I'm always going to be the respectable ""good guy"". Why? Why in the fuck not. I don't care if a girl is going to go for a ""bad guy"" figure. That's their loss. I'm not gonna cry over something that I have no control over. If they want somebody who isn't going to treat them right. Then by god damnit let them. You'll end up with somebody even better and then they'll be like ""Where did all the good guys go. Why can't I ever find somebody like that"". Well guess what you gave that person a chance they didn't want to take it. So now you gave that chance to someone else and THEY appreciate it. End of story.
- Always grow as a person. Never stop!
- Pick up a new hobby it could be anything. There are SO many things you can do in this world it's surprising. Pick up a dance class, mixed martial arts, martial arts, soccer, football, basketball, tennis, bowling, billiards, darts, and etc. Just think of all the possibilities.
- Do not let that hate in your heart grow ever. Allow that person to live the life they want. What more can you do but smile and be happy for them? It sounds like the fucking hardest thing you can do at this point. But if you really want to grow as a person. GROW UP. Be happy for them. You think I wanted to see my ex with a new guy holding hands? No of course not. But I smiled. Shook the guys hand. Smiled at her gave her a hug and said ""Hey what's up"". After that I walked away and said ""Alright I gotta go peace!"".
- Prove to yourself you're better than you really are. Don't fucking digress I can't stress this enough. I've said this so many times already. Never ever fucking go backwards.
- Pick up a job! If you don't already have one. With all the new time on your hands might as well make all the money you can.
- Learn to be single. This is my last one. Learn to live with it. You were single before. You are single now. It's just getting back into the habit of things. But like I said don't move backwards.

All this I compiled up over the last 2 months of my breakup. I learned it the hard way but it was worth learning. I've become a better person and I'm not going to go backwards. I'm going to show that next girl that I AM worth being with. That she'll be like ""Woah damn who is this guy. There's something about him.. maybe I should ask HIM for his number"".

If people tell you that you can't change. Don't believe them. I will never believe that saying until the day that I die. People CAN and WILL change. It's how we evolved as humans and it's how we better ourselves. If a person can't change you are not growing as a person. The moment you believe you can't excel at something and get past that plateau in life you're nothing but a burden on yourself. CHANGE FOR YOURSELF. CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. CHANGE FOR GROWTH. CHANGE FOR SELF WORTH. Most of all Change for your LIFE. The day that I die is the moment I stop believing that I can CHANGE as a person. PEOPLE DO CHANGE. You just have to put in the effort to allow yourself to change. 

This applies to women as well. WOMEN &amp; MEN here on /r/breakups. YOU WERE WITH SOMEBODY FOR A REASON. NOW CHIN UP AND BECOME THAT WOLF THAT CHASES AFTER THE DEER. DO NOT BE THE DEER THAT IS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE WOLF!

DO NOT FORGET. The BEST form of revenge is SUCCESS. Be successful in your endeavors! Do them well. Do them proud. BE SUCCESSFUL!

While I was there, I started flirting a bit with some of the women I didn't know. It was practically involuntary, I didn't have some kind of end-goal in mind, I wasn't planning on getting a number or hooking up with someone. I think I just wanted to see if I could, subconsciously.

I woke up this morning super hung over. I was kinda just laying there, probably still a bit tipsy, and I was thinking about loads of random things. After about an hour, it kinda hit me. None of the things I thought about had anything to do with her. I was just thinking vaguely about my own life, and she wasn't a part of those obscure thoughts.

When I realized that, I did start thinking about her. I've gone through the motions of feeling an intense, indescribable longing for the good times, and anger and feeling slighted and confused for the bad times and the break up and everything that's happened since. In the time since the break-up, I couldn't reconcile the difference between those good times and the person I believed her to be, and the person I was currently observing and the negative ideas. It was like an argument going on in my head, where the sentimental part of me didn't want to acknowledge what the rational part of me was understanding. For whatever reason, even though she wasn't in love with me anymore, I was scared of falling out of love with her, or thinking that this person I so admired wasn't the pinnacle of the human race.

I guess at some point, those two different voices worked something out. I thought about the good times, and I was grateful for them, but didn't long for them. I thought about the bad times, and I didn't get angry or upset. They're just a memory. Then I thought about everything we shared. The things that were a part of me that I shared with her, I've wanted nothing to do with them, they were painful to me. I don't feel that way anymore, those things are still precious to me, they're a part of who I am.

The things she shared with me, they're mine now. All aspects of the person I am are things inherited, on some level, from the people I've loved or cared about at one point or another in my life. Those things come together to form the man I am. I can still like the music she introduced me to, things like that. That's ""me"" now, not ""us.""

I'm not in love with her anymore. I'll probably always care about the woman I saw in her, but in a vague and distant way, it won't be at the forefront of my mind. I've lost touch with so many people in my life, and it's a bummer, but I've always had so many people still around that I've cared about, and that have cared about me.

I'm not perfect, but neither is she. I don't ache to teach her the things about herself that I thought she needed to work on. That's her responsibility. And I need to worry about myself and the people I *do* still love right now. She needs to want to be a better person, and I'm not really concerned with whether or not she ever gets there. I hope she does, but only in the same respect I'd hope anyone would.

I just wanted to share. Today is a good day. I mean, I'm a bit bored, and still hung over, but the boredom isn't depressing. I feel pretty hopeful about the coming months.

It's a bit of a read, it includes my progress, but it might be worth it. Give it a try. 

When you hear or see any glimpse of your ex right after your break up, it hurts. Like a bitch.

But over time, the pain really does ease. The blow still remains, but it gets smaller and smaller every time, and the time it takes to recover gets shorter and shorter. Despite NC, we are sometimes bound to hear/find out something we don't want to. 

I just got sent a photo from a mutual friend of her and my ex both making funny/weird faces. It caught me a bit off guard. I don't even know if my ex knew it was being sent to me or whatever, but either way, it happened. At this point, I'm doing really well with my recovery. I feel like I'd be ready to date other women if I see someone who interests me. However, even seeing pictures of her, or seeing her in person still bothers me. **BUT** it's no longer in the sense of ""Ugh, why did she leave?"" or ""Why can't we be together?"" but more so, ""Get this bitch out of my face because I have better things to do."" 

*And that mindset starts coming a lot sooner each time*. I'm not lying. It's become more of an annoyance, a nuisance, more than anything else. I feel annoyed because I've finally come to the realization of how much I've bettered myself as a result of this break up, and she just seems to get in the way of it. 

We were both at fault for the relationship's demise (as is the case in most), but I did admit to my mistakes, I admitted to my insecurities and where I was at fault, whereas she chose not to. That's fine, it's her arrogance/ignorance, and not my concern to deal with. I know what to fix for next time, when it matters. I don't care for her apology, nor do I care for her coming back. Seriously, /r/prettygirls reinstated my faith in female beauty when I thought I wouldn't find anyone more attractive than my ex. I made a huge realization a while ago. It was a realization that many had stated, but to believe it, it had to come from within myself.* I realized that I have a choice.* 

Now, I can choose to dwell, or I can be a sexy bitch and move onto *better* things, *better* lifestyle, and *better* women. Since the break up, I've worked out every day, and constantly been on a healthy diet. I'm on the verge of looking photoshopped. I had a choice to splurge on comfort foods, but I promised myself that there was no fucking way that I would come out weaker from this. Whenever my parents left the house; at first, I would use that time to mope and cry. Now, I just rock out with some fucking Arctic Monkeys on my guitar. Before, I would cancel plans with friends to stay home. Now, *I'm* the one making plans to meet up with people. I'm going fucking skydiving in August. It'll be epic. There is no fucking way I will step back. Regression is not be an option. *Why would I mope on someone who doesn't matter, only to end up missing the opportunity to meet someone who does?* 

I've noticed that I'm much more comfortable in being alone, whereas I used to get anxiety before. You know how many anxiety attacks I've gotten since the break up? None. FUCKING ZERO. How amazing is that? I had no friends in my city to rely on after the break up (which occurred during my god damn finals), but I not only survived, I got *better*. I've gotten so much more productive with my time. I have tons more money because now I'm not wasting spending hundreds of dollars on someone who would later go on and say she didn't care for it. My hair looks *fantastic*, and I recently bought a whole new wardrobe from my trip in NYC/Chicago because I decided it was time to reinvent. 

I'm not trying to brag, I'm sharing my journey in hopes that it will inspire yours. I know what I've said seems hard to believe, for even I didn't believe them when I was fresh out of a break up. But over time, you do emerge the victor, as long as you make the best out of it. You have a choice. Easier said than done, I know. But work hard now so you can reap the profits later. Use this time to reinvent yourself, and just fucking kill it. Even if you feel you were at fault for the break up (which I highly doubt you were entirely responsible for), use this break up to improve those areas of your life. Use this time to develop your character, not degrade it. Don't let yourself become the villain of your own story. What your ex did to you is no longer relevant. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. You have a choice.

It gets better, friends.",79,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1a7ezx/just_had_the_moment_i_had_been_dreaming_of_for/,"To be brief, my ex left me for another guy and I became the most pathetic excuse of a man on the planet. She was indifferent to me and my feelings at all, and left me a broken husk of a human being. I was moving on at a snail's pace over several months, while she was already giddy in her new relationship. What misery that was. For months, all I wished for was the chance to show her she had messed up, to get back at her. Those feelings and thoughts eventually subsided though, until today.

I went to the local coffee shop we always went to together, after avoiding it for months. She was there with a friend, in a seat orientated so you could blatantly see me walk in, get my drink, and leave. I was fresh out of the gym, a little sweaty and wearing a tank top that showed off my new body. Since I had last seen her, I had lost 10 lbs of fat and put on 40 lbs of muscle. I was looking good :D. As a bonus, I was wearing sunglasses so she couldn't see where i was looking. This was literally the perfect scenario.

I saw her car in the lot and my heart started going for the first time in a while, i had almost forgot the feeling. As I neared the door I thought i was going to pass out my heart and mind were going so fast. I kept cool though as I walked in and laid eyes on her for the first time in almost 7 months. Her and her friend eyed me up a little bit, I don't think they even knew who I was. I then watched the look of realization wash over both of them and caught a double and triple take from both of them as I walked past. I never looked back, didn't say a word, got my drink and left. I watched her watch me walk away through the outside window.

Let me just say friends, elated is an incredible understatement to how I felt. I felt like i had just won my 5th consecutive Super Bowl. This was the biggest personal victory I have had in quite some time. I wanted to come back and tell all of you that even though you are hurting, even though you are down and out, even though nothing seems fair, I feel that after today the Universe balances shit out every now and then. 

There's going to be pain, there's going to be hard times and dark times, there's going to be outright misery and times where you surrender to the power of things out of your control and give up. Through all of that though, there's going to be good times, great times. Times where you realize you haven't thought about them in days. Times when you look in the mirror and are proud of the reflection looking back. Times where you reject your sadness and anger and move on powerfully. Times when you meet that next person that you never expected would sweep you off of your feet. Times where you can say for the first time in what feels like a lifetime that you are happy.

This is all coming from the guy who was a suicidal, cynical alcoholic just a few short months before. I never expected to feel anything but crushing loneliness and longing for the rest of my miserable existence. But here I am now, best shape of my life, happy as a motherfucker, in love once more, and enjoying my ride through this thing we call life.

I guess it varies and changes with accordance to the time elapsed since the breakup. But we all hurt, and we all have an intimate, direct acquaintanceship with this specific kind of pain, of feeling alone and inadequate and damaged goods left behind in the dark and what not, whatever our brains throw at us. 

You might be sad because you're lonely or because you're thinking about how they're spending their day with your replacement.

It's the simple truth.

After 5 months of being out of our 5 year relationship, we broke NC and talked. It didn't make me feel better or give me any answers to anything. The conversation was awkward and forced. She (20) said that things just change but declared that I (20) will always be her first love. Obviously, but what solace can I take in that. That doesn't change the fact that I miss her, the fact that I wish we were still together.

I wanted so badly to respond by saying ""and you will always be my only love."" It took every fiber of my  being to resist, but I did. And that's because I realized that the person I was talking to wouldn't care and wouldn't understand. The person I want to say that to is dead, the person that I could share everything with and talk to easily is dead, the woman that adored me is dead, the woman I loved, and still love (and miss dearly) is dead. She's been replaced by this other person who looks the same, even sounds the same, but it's not her, it's just some doppelganger. The woman I love gave me a hand made gift that said she would love me forever. This other person I talked to, the one who is now a stranger, couldn't possibly be the woman I love. The only logical conclusion is that the person I love has died.

It really is the most depressing thing when you think about it, but it's the truth. But the woman I loved is not the only one who has died. I used to see a man smile back at me in the mirror; he had a sense of hope and a purpose. I've realized that he has died as well. He's been replaced by a broken and aimless man who stares back from the mirror with despair and disgust.

As told to me at a young age by my mother, worked on 3 out of 3 girlfriends.

Breaking up can be hard, and if you are like me you will tell yourself that your ex is “the one” and you need her back, well this is a very good way of doing just that.

First you plant the seed: take a small object, be it a friendship ring, or some other trinket that will remind her of you, tell her to keep it, do not tell her why, just be as nice as possible i.e. “here, Id like you to have this, I had an amazing time getting to know you, and I thank you for allowing me that opportunity” and then walk off into the fucking sunset like the lone rider.

Now you water the seed: Despite what your brain, heart or nuts tell you do not call her, fill your time with; chilling with friends, working out, playing video games whatever you did before having a girlfriend. DO NOT CALL HER. She will call you, whether it be a couple days, weeks, and in some cases months, and when she does, against your current, lonely judgment keep it short, do not say “I miss you” “I love you” “wanna fuck?”
Just be short, and kind, tell her its good to hear from her, tell her you’ve been doing well, ask her how she’s been doing, then tell her that you are going out, or you would like to talk more but there’s things you need to do, (make sure to smile while talking, they can hear your smile) and then tell them good bye. With this they will start thinking that you are over her, that you are doing better off than her, and most of all it doesn’t make you look easy, and instead of having you wrapped around her finger and thinking you are easy to get, it will make you look like a challenge. She will DWELL on that shit, her gears will be turning, and you will start to seem desirable. If this doesn't maker her ask for you back then lets move to the next step.

The sprouting of the seed: After some time, whether short term or long term, whether she’s been single or in a relationship or two (don’t be a jealous prick about her dating, she’s only human) she will look at the trinket you gave her and think to herself “After all this time, after all my boyfriends, this guy (meaning you of course), treated me well” that trinket will be imbued with nothing but kindness and warmth, she will constantly think of you and in the end, she will call you and ask for you back.

The blooming of the flower: Now the plant is fully grown, and you are probably thinking this part means that she ran back into your arms and you are together again, honestly, its what ever you want it to be. In my case, all the ex’s did ask for me back, within a short time, some still ask for me back after 7 YEARS, and once the method worked, once they finally gave in and asked for me back, instead of taking them back immediately like I thought I would, instead I was filled with an ocean full of confidence I never knew I had, it was strange, I turned them down nicely, and continued on with my life, happy and confident and made many friends, each relationship made me stronger. So either the full grown plant is your girlfriend back in your arms with confidence, or you are happily independent and single and full of confidence. You will see what works best for you.

TL;DR
Seed, water, sprout, plant bam boom fucking confidence.

So, I thought it would be nice to share the reasons why we would never have worked out, even if things hadn't ended the way they did, and all the reasons why he isn't ""the one"" for me.

I don't even expect anyone to read these or necessarily relate, I just thought it would be good if I all got these reasons out.

* He *never* had time for me.  Even when things were good between us and he felt strongly about me, we never got to see each other more than once or twice a week because he was so busy.
* He took me, and the nice things I did, for granted.  He rarely reciprocated the good things I did for him.
* He was too reserved for me.  I'm very outspoken and I don't mind someone who is more quiet, but I didn't feel like I could truly be myself around him because of that.
* He never complimented me or told me how he felt about me.  He did in the very beginning, and I don't need someone to compliment me all the time, but it's nice to know that someone feels the same about you or is attracted to you.  I was never really sure about either after the beginning.
* Back to being too reserved, I didn't feel that I could experiment or be honest with him about my sexual desires.  In my opinion, sex is an important part of a relationship, and I didn't feel like I could tell him what I wanted.
* He can't handle ""difficult"" or ""uncomfortable"" conversations and would rather avoid them entirely than deal with them.  He seemed uncomfortable talking about condoms, and was definitely uncomfortable when it came to breaking up with me...so much so that he just avoided me until I finally asked him what was going on.  If you're almost 30 and you can't communicate, that's a problem for me.
* And last but not least, and this is probably the most important: He didn't appreciate me, he wasn't willing to give things a chance, and he is able to cut me out of his life.  So why would I want to be with someone who doesn't value the incredible person that I am, or isn't willing to try to make it work, or doesn't want to be with me?  I shouldn't want to be with that person, and that person isn't right for me.

I'm sorry for giving you hope. I'm sorry for being that shoulder whenever you needed it. I thought I could give you everything, I thought I'd make us happy.

I came in to your life when you were alone. I picked you up, and filled that role and made you complete. I thought I'd be strong enough for you. There were so many problems, but I made sure we worked through them in them beginning. Then later on, it was you who would work hard on fixing things. Things always got fixed with a sorry and a hug. And we always meant it.

Neither you or me are perfect. And we stopped trying to be. We worked on ourselves to be better persons and my immaturity would create problems for both of us. But I wanted to change. I worked out, became big so that you'd feel small when I'd hug you. I worked on my english. Instead of saying 'watsup, I went wid u 2 da mall.. lol', I would say 'Hey, I'd really like it if we talk about this like adults and in the meantime, how would you like a small massage too?'. 

I made you grow up, and you made me polish myself. We fought (who doesn't?) and we'd cry, but someone or the other would come. I'd hate it when some guy flirted with you, and you'd come and hug me to tell me you found it cute and always assured me that you're mine.

I would scratch your back, your head every time we would go to sleep so that you'd have sweet dreams, and you would purr like a cat and drift off to sleep. We had nick names of almost everything dirty so that we wouldn't feel embarassed when saying it to each other. 

I can't continue for now. I will write more. I know you'll never read this. But someone will. Some stranger will know that he/she is not alone.

She still emailed me and the first time she did that, like a knee-jerk reaction, I replied with a sentence. I broke down immediately and realized how quickly you go back to square one if you let yourself do that. That was the moment I recognized how giving into something so simple prolongs the pain. 

Love is an addiction, and when it is not healthy, it is a debilitating disease. YOU deserve respect, YOU deserve the same affection you give... and you have to consider that *each time* you give in to ""taking another hit"" from that last relationship, you give up a little more of yourself emotionally and in every other way.

Think about it this way, right now you may be saying to yourself, ""I can just say one more thing,"" or ""I just want to see a picture of him/her on facebook,"" or ""well, she contacted me, maybe I can just respond."" Those are ALL excuses to ""take another hit"" and you are behaving no different than the destroyed man under the bridge who let drugs take everything he had. Do not think that to him it's not the same to say ""one more hit and I'm going to get up, find a job, start my life again!"" But there he is, after he let himself  lose everything and he is still convinced that he can go for just one more round. 

Maybe you have not hit rock bottom and you still need to hurt yourself more, but *if you want to recover, you HAVE TO CUT OFF ALL CONTACT.* 

You have to kick the habit and start to heal.

I want you all to know that I wrote this not just for your benefit but as an inspiration to myself because I took a hit today (although a tiny one) - I came across something on facebook about her, but it made me feel horrible immediately and prompted me to write this down.

I would just like to say thank you for everyone who have given so much time and support to those who are going through hell dealing with with recent break up or one that lingers on.

I came here in June of this year after the loss of my grandparents and then my girlfriend of 3 years leaving me only to fall into the arms of her bestie from college. A girl I held in high regard as the girl I wanted to be with forever after and was so integrated with on many levels of life with. The end of the relationship was horrible, an utter hell. June, July and alot of August were nothing more then a haze to me. I couldnt not believe I would ever find or feel for someone again. I thought that was it. I was done. I was never prepared to give up with her no matter what happened. The first half of this year was bloody horrible for both of us in various ways which didnt help. But I do presume she had another agenda since she ended up with him so soon after ours ended...if not it was going on during our relationship too. But that is not the point.

The point is, I came here looking for support, for someone to care, to rant. I also have given support to those in similar situations and helped anyone I could give decent advice to. My hell and nightmare this year really could not stack up to other stories Ive read here. The fact we are here to help each other is something bloody beautiful. So I thank you all who have given me support. For those who I could have helped in their time of need of a virtual shoulder to cry on.

This community just rocks. There are no other words to describe it.

Where Am I now.
After the end of the relationship. I worked out, lost weight, got stronger, more confident. I said fuck her. I lost the girl of my dreams. I failed, I fucked up. No she fucked up. I dont want her, I dont need her. I wont accept her hand in friendship for replacing/cheating on me after 3 faithful years and dedication through the hardest of times.  That I deserve better. That I will strive to be better. I took her off a pedestal and said fuck off to her ''need'' to be friends after the break up. Deleted all contact info. Everything. Its good that i cannot recall her numbers and email addresses aswell as facebook/twitter/reddit. Actually made this reddit account so she wouldnt track me. Gave up a year of karma in the blink of an eye. 

I went to the gym, I laboured with my brother. I learned how to deal and work with children(babysat my niece all summer). I got involved with Mozilla and got to attend a conference with them.. more then a dream come true in terms of future employment goes (web engineer student here!)

I returned to college in good form. With a desire to become the best I can be. Study, study, party, study... then sleep). Now, I never thought I would feel again for along long time and that was fine with me but since returning to college I met someone and we became friends over the past month and as of a week we have been dating and having tons of fun. We are pacing ourselves and enjoying finding out more about each other while sharing our interests. Seriously, when your heart skips for a second when I see her.. fuck... I never believed I could feel that again. Its going good and for the first time.. I am not numb, Im happy. 

Guys and Gals

You might be in hell, you might be seeing your first teenage relationship end or see your 20 year marriage end. All you have to tell yourself is this ''I will be alright.. It will be okay''. Take it from me. I fought alot of demons. Im lucky to be here writing this to you. It is time to pass on the torch.

You can lose the love of your life. But life will seriously surprise you. Be yourself, change what you dislike. Find comfort in your skin.
Start now.

I've been in contact with others and been given other advice, but what she said truly seemed to wake something up inside me. 

Not everything she said may be applicable to your situation, but know that there are people who care and want you to make it to see happier days. I've changed a little bit of the wording to make it as universal as possible. 

**So, here it is. I hope you get something out of it like I did.**

""If they don't have time to answer your calls or even simply write you on Facebook, then you don't have time to be their ""friend."" Forget about them as best you can, or at least give them that impression. You know you deserve better.

Now, get up! Wake up! Get out of bed tomorrow morning. Don't sleep in, wake up early, like 9 a.m., 10 a.m.ish. Shower, get ready, wear your favorite clothes and go somewhere! DO SOMETHING. Do not go with anyone; just go with yourself. Go somewhere, see something. BE ALONE. You have been with someone for far too long. You need to learn to live with yourself before you can live with anyone else. So get to know yourself again; remember what YOU are like without anyone else around. It is important to stay in touch with that side of yourself. Spending time alone, at least an hour a day if we can find it, to just regroup and ground ourselves is important for us.

So please do this: Go out and get some coffee, then go somewhere interesting and explore. If you don't want to do that, go do something boring, like the aviation museum. Make a playlist for your iPod without ANY songs you guys shared. No sad music either. Listen to happy music and be with yourself. It will be hard at first, but you will get the hang of it by the end of the day.

After you do that, follow through on the plans you've set up this week with your other friends or go make some plans. Go out with them, be silly, be yourself, and do what you want.

When your ex decides that they have time to message you, you may be in a different space with a whole new perspective of what you really want from this relationship.

Give yourself time to find who you are again. You need that.
It does not matter what they are feeling right now, or what you think they are feeling. What matters is how you are feeling.

And regarding being outside your house as opposed to being inside, you have to get ready, and you have to face the world. Forcing yourself outside is what is going to strengthen you right now and keep you moving.

Take tonight off. This is your last night to be stuck in your mind. Start tomorrow fresh. New page. New day. New you. (I know how corny that sounds… but it's true). Never start fresh after 5 p.m. It simply does not work.

And you don't know when you'll truly be happy with who you are. That's the thing about happiness. You are always the happiest you have ever been, but never the unhappiest. You never know how happy you can be; it's the chase in life. But you will always draw back to a time you are the unhappiest, and every bad moment, every sad or dark time will compare to that. So find who you are tomorrow and then the next day find who you are that day. Wake up, live, and then go to sleep and wake up and do it again. It's the beauty of life; there is always tomorrow. You are brilliant and strong in so many ways, don't let this overshadow the qualities that you are greatest in.
Remember, each day is a new a day. Don't worry if the last wasn't as best as it could be.""",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_xqtqd,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/xqtqd/for_anyone_whos_hurting_and_struggling_to_find/,

1364442536.0,65,self.BreakUps,1b5omv,Everyone says it gets better without saying how. Here's a few pointers how it did for me.,80,15,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1b5omv/everyone_says_it_gets_better_without_saying_how/,"I [28M] really thought I was done looking for someone special with my last girlfriend. We burnt brightly but quickly and I was left a wreck wondering if I'd ever be so happy again. Here's what helped

- Friends and family. 

I cried in front of my mother for the first time in 10 years. I told my close friends, acquaintances, colleagues and strangers (like you guys!). Some had a great advice, some just tried to smile and pat me on the shoulder, some awkwardly went quiet, others said nothing but spoke with actions like made sure I wasn't alone on the weekend or called me more often. You're not alone, there's an army of people behind you that love you, like you and are rooting for you. 

- There will be good days and bad days.

Some days I thought, screw her, I'm better etc, I'm gonna kick ass and be the awesome human being I know I am. Things would be great. Then the following day I would see something that would remind me of her and I'd be down again. I would then beat myself up that I had relapsed and felt pathetic. You're not pathetic. There are good and bad days in work, in sport, in weather and life in general. Sometimes we can do something constructive to fix/avoid these (like stop checking her facebook) and sometimes we just have to accept today was a crap day and tomorrow we try again. It's not about the how good/bad the day was, it's about the overall trajectory, and you're getting back up on your feet slowly but surely (even if it doesn't feel like that).

- No contact is good but not always possible.

I live near my ex so we share a gym and a few bars. Sometimes I would see her car in the street. We had some contact via text, it's not really helpful and will give you more setbacks than comfort. Unless you have to physically see them there's no reason for a dumpee to initiate contact, they have your number if they want to talk. If you do meet your ex, try and be the bigger person. Be friendly but respectful. Desperation and childish behaviour only make things worse. Just be a decent person, if they don't reciprocate, that's their problem not yours. Don't be friends until you're ready to visualise them having sex with someone you know who you don't particularly like (yeh hurts doesn't it?). When it comes to the digital world, block, hide, deactivate, unfriend, clear your history, whatever you need to do, you don't need that shit when you're lying awake at 2am on a ""bad day"". 

- You have more free time now!

Remember how you said you really needed to finish that project for work? That you never read as much as you'd like? That you would like to cook/workout/see your friends more? That you wanted to volunteer? Go do that stuff! Someone loved you for who you are before and someone else will love that person someday too BUT YOU'LL ALSO KNOW HOW TO ROCK CLIMB!

- She/he was not that special.

Think of all the people you've been with (or even had a crush on). I bet they were all different. One had that hilarious laugh, one watched awful tv shows, one had an irrational fear of polystyrene, one did that amazing thing with their tongue... How do you feel about these people now? Do you miss them that much? Do you care who they're sleeping with or if they think about you? I don't. I bet you can list some not so nice things about them too. You enjoyed your time with them, it didn't work out. You don't think about them often but wish them well. It just took time and this breakup will one day be the same.

- Learn from it

I loved how she made real coffee in the morning, even though it took extra time it was worth it. I'm doing that now, it's mine. She introduced me to the joy of swimming, that's mine now. Her secret baked potato recipe, not secret anymore, mine. Be a vulture. Take what's useful left from the carcass and toss the rest. Could you have been more assertive, attentive, secure etc? Put it in your locker and save it for the next game son. 

- (for the dumpees) They chose a life without you. 

Would you keep putting dollar bills into a vending machine that ate them? Would you keep inviting that ""friend"" who flakes on you? No. Because time and love are precious resources and you don't waste them where you don't get a return (or worse, get pain). You deserve someone who loves you back and the person who doesn't, does not deserve your love. Don't waste any more of your thought, love and awesomeness on them, they don't deserve it. They think they can do better. Good luck, so can I.

- Don't rebound, with them or anyone else

Rebounds are cheap. Rebounds are temporary. Ultimately, they will make you feel cheap and temporary. Also, do you know how silly it feels to go for a rebound and fail? It's pretty demoralizing. Focus on you. If you can become a positive, secure, active person, you'll want and achieve so much more than rebounds.

- Feel pathetic? Not yourself? Be better.

Look at r/decidingtobebetter r/getmotivated and remember you're better. At a certain point, stop reading r/breakups and the depressing threads, read r/funny r/happy r/examplesofgood r/mademesmile Do you feel angry at yourself that you've become this whiny sad loser? Use that anger. Life is always going to throw punches at you, now are you going to feel sorry for yourself or are you gonna smile, lick your lips and say ""bring it on"".

 We all have one thing in common, our relationship ended. Most of us have been dumped, but some of us have been the one dumping, either way, -our relationship ended-

Now keep in mind, this is mostly for the people who have been left in the dark, and who are absolutely bewildered as to why someone they cared for so much could possibly do the things they did. This is also mostly from my own personal experiences on how I best moved on.

1. You are -not- alone. Friends &amp; Family


-Everyone- has friends &amp; family, so stop the pity party right now. No more crying about how alone you are. -even if you feel alone-, you have to realize that there -are- people who not only want to help you, but have your best interest in mind. The fact that you're even reading this proves my point. I'm with you, we're all with you. If your flame has gone out we will ignite it once more, this time stronger than ever, so you too can burn as bright as the sun and give others the same light.


Now there's a reason I put friends first, and that's because family is always going to have your side, so their advice will be biased ( which it should be ) but immediately after a break up what you need is to hear as much unbiased advice as you can get, which most often will come from your friends. 

Be warned though, advice is always great to have, but ultimately only two people will ever truly know what happened in the relationship. You, and the person you had it with. While it is not healthy to become blinded by your emotion, it is also in turn not healthy to listen to everything your friends &amp; family tell you. Strike a balance, and try your best to think of everything from an outside perspective. Let logic dictate where it should, and you will be better off.


2. No Contact and the J-word


There is one reason, and one reason alone why you should always do NC after a break up. -Justification- Say that word over and over and over and over again and again. Every day if you must. Know that -no matter what you do, no matter what you say, if you show them via contacting them you give them justification for their decision- If you go to them and become angry, they feel justified because their reasoning will be you're emotional. If you go to them and are sad/crying/want them back, again they will justify themselves and say you need to be happy by yourself etc etc.

This is why you do absolutely nothing. By doing nothing you take from them everything. They no longer have any surface or base with which to support their reasoning. This is both the easiest and the hardest step because our egos -want- us to be in control, and want us to have a ""sure thing"" but the reality is relationships take two or more people to all want the same thing : Each other. If at any point one person does not want the other, the relationship dies.

3. Acceptance


Accept three things : That the person, at this moment in time, does not want to be with you(1), and accept whatever mistakes you may have done(2). I mean actual mistakes though. Sometimes you didn't do anything wrong, it's just the other person is a retard and can't see a good thing. For instance never apologize for being nice to someone, or for caring about them. If the other person has a problem with those things then -fuck them- You need to be who you are, and you need to be fine with it.

Now if you've made any mistakes, maybe you lied about something, or maybe you didn't do the things needed to foster good and healthy relationships etc. Whatever mistakes you made -accept responsibility for them- and change them. Learn from them, because if that golden moment appears that we all so desperately want, and they do come back, you don't want to fuck it up again. However you also need to accept reality(3) : If they didn't love/care for you enough the first time, chances are they will only care for you less the second, or any other repeat times.

 This is especially true if you try to be ""friends"" after a break-up. What on God's earth makes you think they'll care about you more, or even equally, as a friend than as a lover? Being friends immediately after being lovers is just a clever way of condescending, and you should never lower yourself to such a trashy standard. You are not an emotional tampon.

4. Time time time


First off, time is a human concept. The reality is there isn't really any such thing as time. You're not on some clock, and the world won't explode if you don't accomplish X thing before Y date. 

Too many people think they have to ""experience"" this thing, or that thing, and that they only have so much time to do so. For instance how many people ages 16-20 think they just have to go to parties with alcohol to get wasted or smoke so they can be super ultra cool ( I realize this is mostly an american thing, but the point remains!)  That way of thinking is not only selfish, and self destructive, but it also creates havoc for people like us. People who genuinely care.

Realize that you have all the time in the world, but it's up to you to put value on it. Do something creative, do something healthy, but most importantly, do something that you can -share- with others. 

Always wanted to go see the grand canyon? Call some friends and make a plan for a road trip. Always wanted a tattoo? Go out and fucking get it. Whatever you do, do it for you, but don't try to do it alone. Make sure you're out there with people, interacting. Life is like the ocean, you just have to dive in, and once you do it will embrace you just like the water. It has it's dangers sure, but smart choices and a good head on your shoulders will always see you through.

That's the population of our world. The odds that there -isn't- someone out there that is exactly right for you, are so low. So relax, it's ok that this relationship didn't work out. It hurts, sure, but you still have the most important thing. Look down, put your hand on your chest. Yeah, your heart is still there. I feel it too ya know. I'm here. We're all here. Close your eyes and you can see us, and if you listen carefully on a quiet night, you'll hear us too.

You are an addict. No, really, you are an addict. Relationships release chemicals in your brain that are addictive -- and you've had months or years to get used to having your brain awash in them. You are a chemical addict. Most studies agree that we as a species are inherently wired to seek out companionship, and the pain of separation is the species way to encourage you to keep seeking out companionship. You are a companionship addict.

And now you've just quit cold turkey. Lucky you, you with the million dollar coke habit. Your body is now fighting against your brain, you are coming apart, you are detoxing. You would do anything, go through whatever hoops, no matter how painful they might be later, or how you know that it's a bad idea to do it, to re-experience what you had. Sound familiar?

Now, once you realize you have a problem, solving it isn't easy, nor will it be without pain. There's really isn't any methadone, weaning, patches, gum, or pills. It's just you getting up in the morning and enduring it every single hour of every single day until you get over it -- as people have done since the beginning of time. Look around you in a crowded store, and realize that everyone you see has gone through what you're going through now. 

You. are. not. alone.

The best way to imagine dealing with it, is imagine yourself as an alcoholic. You stop having alcohol. Good start. Then you don't put yourself in the position to be around alcohol so as to be tempted. Then you find help and support. You need a person to vent to as you go through the stages of grief and recovery. But that person has to be a little distant, if that person doesn't, it can become a recursive feedback loop. Then you do other things that do not remind you of what you've stopped doing, and more importantly do things that do raise those brain chemicals up; it helps. More importantly, it helps control the mood swings and helps even out you as a person. Force yourself to do these things. It's all too easy to sit on your ass moping and sinking deeper and deeper in that hole than knowing where you’re headed and getting out. 

Go out. Seek out friends. Go out to see a movie. Go out to eat. Go out and eat foods you've never had, in places that you've never been. Go find a bar playing live music even if you just walk down the street and pick one at random. Have a Pepsi and listen to the band. Go out and see a museum. Go to a starbucks, have a decadent high calorie barely coffee and read a book surrounded by people. Learn to play the harmonica, try building an airplane model, do something that isn't just sitting there and letting yourself slowly spiral down.

Do not get into a relationship during this time. Period. Have friends, yes. Masturbate like a coked up monkey, yes. Have pets, yes. But until you break the addiction you should not reengage. You are not ready.

Here are some Great Truths you have to engrave into your soul: you have to be at peace with the possibility of being single the rest of your life. You have to be at peace knowing that your burdens are, and always should be on set squarely on your shoulders, that is not to say you are alone, but be aware that there is a fine line between someone helping you, and you depending on them to shoulder your problems. You have to be able to look at yourself honestly and see your flaws... and then strong enough to seek out help to fix them. You can always be a better you. Mentally, physically, emotionally. You have to know you can do it by yourself at all times whatever happens, however out of your depth you are, you must know how to help yourself. It's not easy. But neither is what you're going through.

Time passes. You still get twinges. Sometimes something will happen and you'll hurt. Then, after a while, after you've mourned, after you're your own person, standing on your own two feet and self sufficient, you're getting help, you're getting hobbies, you're single, you have friends, you're learning how to do things you didn't know how to do last month, or ever before... then you're ready for the next relationship.

The best part is now that you're stable; with any luck you're better able to spot the ones who aren't stable like you. It narrows your dating pool, yes, but quality over quantity.

It's not easy. It's not fast. But anything really worth is never is. To quote, ""the only easy day was yesterday.""

You will get through this. You just have to be the most stubborn son of a bitch to walk the face of the earth.

1370318778.0,60,self.BreakUps,1fmq9i,Epiphanies,69,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fmq9i/epiphanies/,"We're all on this subreddit commiserating the loss of our relationships. Losing a best friend, losing a lover, losing the intimacy, losing something we feel like is irreplaceable. Feeling worthless because they rejected who you are, thinking about the investment and how much time you've wasted, how wrong you were to think they were *the one*. 

When was the last time you were happy single? Were you ever happy single? If you were, do you notice things about you now that you neglected while in a relationship?

I think we all lose a bit of ourselves when we're in a committed relationship. Sometimes because the partner picks up the slack, sometimes because we don't feel the effort is needed any longer, and sometimes because things become, well, extremely comfortable. You've got sex when you want, you've got someone to hang out with you if you want, you've got someone who knows you really well and does things that make you feel pleasurable. Stuff that you used to have to work a bit towards and make more of an effort to satisfy for yourself--if you've ever been happy alone. Of course losing that in a split second gives you the withdrawl symptoms of a heroin addict. 

The drive to improve yourself is self-motivating and driven perhaps by the subconscious desire to be an attractive mate. Once in a relationship those desires become less evident and we lose ourselves. We've replaced things that we did to make ourselves happy with things our partners did for us. Or you've stopped doing things that you liked because your partner didn't like them. Or you've stopped doing them because you used the time to invest more into the relationship. 

You've changed as an individual. You are not who you are when you met and neither are they. Being able to adapt to each other while growing as individuals is the hallmark sign of a good relationship. Being able to grow as individuals in a relationship is also extremely important. Stifling each other will only add resentment about each other. I admit I became more clingy after each separation, afraid that if I didn't show him affection that he would find someone else who did. He became more detached. When you don't have to work for that special something, when it's always there, you take it for granted. Once that happened the spark begins to lose its luster and minor faults quickly become nagging dealbreakers. 

Are you constantly thinking of them having sex with other people? Do you find yourself thinking of them when you masturbate? Do you miss their touch, their smell, the way they breathed in your ear while making love? Well, stop it. They're probably dealing with the misery of the separation their own way. It doesn't mean they didn't love you. We as organisms are programmed to want to have sex. Especially when there is nothing else as easy and quick to offer temporary relief from the sadness of a separation. You might not be able to do that, but that doesn't mean your ex is you. We're all very different and shaped by our experiences and to a large degree our biology. They may have had three one night stands the week after you broke up. But you went to Paris two months later and had the time of your life. Or you went on a great hike with friends and discovered you were able to hike a 14er and they went to the bar and went home with someone who had bad breath. 

The breakup is an opportunity to find yourself. It is an opportunity to improve yourself and discover new interests, rekindle old ones, nurture relationships you may have neglected during the relationship. I enjoy travelling and I plan on going on an adventure or two with friends or by myself to get that feeling back. I plan on wearing some jock-straps to feel good about myself, to go commando style and let their air flow up my pants. I plan on projecting confidence into people I interact with, making people laugh, learning how to interact with others and work on my social skills. Basically you need to do exciting, fun, new things without them. This will give you a sense of self, joy, and uniqueness that only you have and is untainted by the reminder of your relationship. 

I finally understand why people say take a break from dating after a significant separation. If you work on these while single, the next love won't take that much out of you because you still have a huge portion of self that fulfills you. It prevents you from ignoring these issues about yourself that would otherwise go unnoticed if you jump into another relationship too quickly, i.e. a rebound, only to realize they aren't everything you're looking for. It allows you to reflect and determine what you want in a partner, what you don't want, what red flags to watch out for and what to do to keep that spark going. 

Moreover self-confidence, goals, happiness, independence are all fucking attractive qualities to potential suitors. People want those they can't have and if you are happy by yourself they they'll make more of an effort to be a part of your life. That is why playing hard to get works on some people. Except you're not purposely doing this, you're doing this because you are happy by yourself. 

Remember the old adage, ""fake it till you make it,"" well that applies here. You have to slowly restructure how you view the negatives of the breakup into something more helpful, more optimistic, more conducive to healing. Instead of thinking how awful you feel in the mornings, how alone you are, how much you miss them, rephrase it into what skills will I improve today, I have friends who care about what I'm going through right now, there is someone out there waiting for me that will blow my mind. 

Lastly if it's true love it will find its way back to you. I wouldn't hold out too much hope as it's not good for healing but it's nice to think of it like winning the lottery. It would be spectacular but the chances are slim to none. Those of us separating after multiple reconciliations can feel even more at ease as we've tried our best each and every time that happened. Put some of that effort into making yourself into the awesome person you want to be and I am sure people will notice the new you and you will be much happier in the long-term. Turn yourself into someone your ex will regret dumping. The best revenge is living well. But don't ruminate over the revenge and regret too much as you may never get that satisfaction. Use it to motivate yourself until you don't need it anymore. 

Moreover if you've had previous loves, think about those feelings and how hopeless you felt at the time. Then think about how silly those feelings were after you found the next good thing. It really puts things into perspective and proves to yourself you'll be okay.

It's been a week. I did a bit of emailing and pleading but ultimately realized they were futile. I sent a quick letter saying I understand his choice. I don't regret our relationship and I wish him the best. Put some closure to things and get yourself pumped up about this next step of your life. Take it a step at a time, expect taking two steps back, but another step forward. Soon enough you will be a stage where you're comfortable, then happy, then excited. Go for it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/gat40/sick_of_emotional_torment_from_ex_girlfriend/

When I was going through this I got the same advice from several different parties telling me that ""things have a way of working themselves out eventually"". When I would hear this I'd dismiss it because the pain I was going through was too overwhelming. 

I just wanted to post here to tell you all that since the story of my post, where I was genuinely stuck thinking the best years of my life were over and I may as well end it, I have met someone who is everything good that my ex was yet doesnt share any of the bad traits. I am seriously shocked at some of the things my current girlfriend says and does, she is so perfect to me and she makes me incredibly happy. 

To get to the point, I just wanted to say to all of you who are feeling terrible about your break up, that today, right now, is the first day of the rest of your life. You will hurt, you will be sad, lonely, depressed etc probably for quite a while. But you WILL get over it. No matter how much you tell yourself you will love this person forever, one day soon he/she will no longer be the main thought in your mind. It will fade, and as it does, you will feel better. 

You may think you can't live without this person, but the truth is, you can, and you were supposed to live without them. They were just your training wheels for the real thing. Remember your experiences, the good and the bad, and value them. Especially the bad. A painful lesson learned is worth a lot.

One day, and it won't be far away, you, whoever you are reading this, you will be happy. Unconditionally happy. Do not let go of that thought. It may seem vague and distant to you right now, but I swear to you it is true. You may wish your ex was that person you'd be happy with, but if it didnt work out it's because there is someone better waiting for you.

**So you want to get her back huh?  (A conversation with myself)**


So you want her back huh?  You guys have spent 7 years together and she is the love of your life.  She is highly compatible with you and it feels like life situations are the only reasons you’re not together…



Hold your horses.  **You want to know how to get your ex back?  It’s simple.  MOVE ON.**  Assume you’re not going to get her back and live your life.  Be happy.  I know at first you thought that if she saw how miserable you were then she’d want you back.  *This is a horrible strategy.  All that does is create pity and guilt.*  It doesn't make someone want to BE with you however.  The same things that made you attractive in the first place are going to be the same things that would win an ex back.  If you’re happy and living your life you will be attractive.  

It’s basic laws of attraction here.  Think about it, if the roles were reversed.  Has seeing someone sad and upset made you like them more?  No.  Actually, hell no.  Even if you feel bad you still don’t want anything serious with that person.  People like other people who enhance their life, not bring them down.  But if the situation were the opposite and you saw an ex happy and having the time of their life without you, you instantly want them back in some way shape or form.

  
The irony of all this is that when you’re on that journey you completely forget about trying to win the other person back.  You’re genuinely experiencing happiness.

No matter what the cause of a breakup, learning to let go just often isn't easy to do. It could be the one that got away, a first love, a spouse, a boyfriend or girlfriend, or unrequited love. Regardless of the situation, learning to let go of what's over is often a very difficult thing to do and the hurt can often last for years if a person simply won't break the hold.


Recovering from the horrible pain and hurt of a broken relationship is no easy task. When love is found, one naturally wants to believe it will last forever. And it's great when it does. But when it doesn't, the hurt and pain can be devastating. But even more devastating can be the pain and suffering the person experiences from not letting go of what's gone and moving on with living.


Turning off feelings for someone isn't like turning off a light switch. When a relationship ends, it doesn't mean the feelings disappear or go away. Being left alone with feelings of emptiness, loneliness, anger, grief, rejection, and despair can prove to be overwhelming. The person might find themselves attempting to contact the other person, making up reasons to be where the other person is, calling them repeatedly, etc....anything to keep in contact with the other person or have some kind of hold or attachment still with them. And while it's a natural thing to want to do this, it prevents us being healed of the relationship.


In order to let go and live again, the past must be closed. It is impossible to live in the past. You can't look forward to a future when you live in what was, rather than in the here and now. What has happened is gone, and no amount of wanting, wishing, or regret will undo or changed what's already happened and is over with.


To put closure on the past, you have to let go of the feeling that you can't make it without the other person. Feelings of failure, trying to contact the person (unless you have children together), dependency, guilt, resentment, and anger... all of these feelings must be dealt with and brought under control. While they are normal to feel, continuing to harbor them keeps you from being healed of the hurt, and therefore keeps you from living and being happy again.


Often when a relationship ends, one or both parties have the mindset that they are a failure. They measure their self worth by whether a relationship lasted or died. One's self worth should never be measured by another person, but rather how they are. When you love yourself, you will learn that your self worth does not revolve around another person but rather is enhanced by the other person.

While there is just no way to magically heal the pain and hurting of a lost relationship, there are ways to help yourself heal. The main thing is that you have to allow yourself to want to heal, and not keep clinging to something that you simply cannot change.


* Stop beating yourself up over the past. It's done, it's gone, it's not changing. No matter who is at fault for the breakup, no amount of blaming yourself or feeling guilty will undo the past. Forgive either the other person or yourself (or both) and allow yourself to be happy again.


* Unless you have children together, stop contacting the person. Don't try to be where they are, don't call them and leave them messages, don't email them, don't follow them around. Leave them alone! Continuing to attempt to be in contact with them (unless you have kids) does nothing but harass them and keep you tied to the pain.

* Go out on dates with others and actually enjoy yourself. Have fun! And whatever you do, don't spend the date talking about your ex and how much you miss them and want them back. This won't lead to a second date! Go out and be happy, leave the worries behind. You might just find you had a fantastic time. 


Allow yourself to heal from the breakup. Allow yourself to enjoy life again, to be happy. Allow yourself to heal from the past hurts and pain. Allow yourself the freedom to love again. Let go of the past, and be happy.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_s2r5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/s2r5e/letting_go_of_a_relationship_cindy_thomas/,

You've been here before. Look at your blogposts. He's done this to you before, and you kept giving him another chance- no, you used to beg him to get back with you. If you have to beg someone to be with you, isn't that a sign of an unhealthy relationship?

You didn't want a relationship. You didn't want to fall in love. You wanted to just live a single life- asexual, aromantic as you were. (He was the same way.) Then you came into each other's lives and screwed that up. Do you know why you keep messaging him? It's because if you don't, he'll never contact you again. Learn from your mistakes. Stop this...unequal relationship bullshit. Be around people who feel the same way about you! 

You deserve better. That's right. You don't want anyone, and to be honest, the touch of most people just makes you uncomfortable and disgusted. You don't need someone, you don't have to be in a relationship, but stop wasting time on this person who will never give you what you want. This person who will never make time for you, who will never treat you with the love you crave...

Stop it, please. Love yourself. Appreciate yourself. Feel the wind and the sun and the world. Isn't it great? You don't have to be lonely. You've got the whole world to explore. You didn't want to do it alone, but you'll be okay. You're amazing and so many people love you. Enjoy the world and care for yourself, first and foremost! Be selfish, dammit!

My love came back to me. Sure, her mannerisms aren’t the same; her hair’s a different colour; and I call her by a different name. But it’s back.

We take the same walks through country paths in the rain and the sun. I tell her those same stories of my past and future, and she nods and laughs – just like the first time. But it’s not the first time.
My first time is gone. 

My lies and my coldness saw to that. Though I loved her, I would tell her to leave; I’d withdraw and I’d hide the warmth from her. I loved to see how she pined for my heat once locked outside in the numbing night air.

But one day, the scrabbling at my door stopped dead, and when I peered so reservedly from behind my drawn drapes, I saw nothing; I felt nothing. Then grieving.

I would sit up late, and early, thinking about what I’d done. I would scream and shout until I went red, hoping that she’d hear and maybe feel something for me to see. But she never did.

My love is back now though. And every now and then, I see a glimpse of my first in her. It reminds me of how I will see, so vividly, the colour orange whilst chomping upon a Terry’s chocolate treat; a sort of homage to that sad citrus fruit with whom I experienced it first.

So, my message to all of you is this: do not become hung up on ‘the one’. Chase the feeling. There exists the potential in a billion souls. Do not be afraid to ignite that fire once again. Let it engulf your world. Let it envelope your senses. And when that last flickering flame turns on itself in anguish, don’t ever let yourself believe it’s been forever extinguished.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1dloip,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1dloip/i_finally_realised_relationships_are_not_about/,

It means wishing them well on their path through life. If that path leads away from you, love does not hold them back. It wishes them well as they tread that path. You might think it would be nice if they returned, but love is total acceptance of their freedom to leave you forever. Love values their freedom, their personal evolution and their happiness above the pleasure you receive from being with them.

They make soul-binding promises to stay together, love each other, and be supportive for the rest of their lives. Through good times and hardship, in sickness and in health, rich or poor, happy or sad.

These vows are not specific to marriage. When one commits to any relationship, be it a marriage, life partners (where same sex marriage is still, regretfully, illegal), or even just friends, *you silently agree to always be there for each other*.  When one person ends a relationship, they're choosing to break this trust and bond. They've decided that some thing, some idea about you, is so unattractive to them that they can no longer bear with you.

Sounds harsh, right? Well, don't despair yet; it gets better from here.

They've weighed the pros and cons, and decided the cons outweigh the pros to some degree. And that's their excuse to leave. You're not somebody else they met, you don't seem like the same person they fell in love with, you lost your leg in combat and they can't handle the stress of helping you through therapy. Whatever it is, forget about it. **It's their excuse, not yours. Let them live with it while you forget about it.** 

They have left behind somebody that is a loyal person, who was willing to live up to those unspoken promises and trust the other to do the same. You're already the bigger person in this. Stick to NC, move on, and find somebody that you **can** trust with it.

Also, rationalize your breakup. You don't want *them* back, you want **your relationship** back. You want to feel all of those feelings again. You want to have someone to cuddle, to high-five, to play laser tag with. Somebody who, when you look into their eyes and they smile back, fills you with the most warmth you've felt; and, to the same degree, should you ever upset them, seeing them hurt even in the slightest, especially by you, fills you with the most powerful remorse you have ever felt. But you don't want *them*, you want somebody who won't breach that trust. Trust me, my wife left me because of a bunch of complications from a physical injury and a diagnosis of PTSD (really quite minor issues in my line of work); had I been deployed right now and come back in a coma missing a leg, I know she wouldn't have stuck by me and I don't know what my personal reaction would be to waking up with nobody to support me. I don't want someone who gives up so easily. And neither should you, or anybody else.

That's my rant. Thanks to this epiphany, I have had zero feelings toward my ex-wife for three days now, which was an incredible change for me considering it came the morning immediately following three weeks of the most violent relationship withdrawals I have ever undergone.

EDIT: I've come to the realization that the only lingering feelings I'm having at this point are fear. I'm afraid--because I do still love her--that something awful will happen to her and I'll never know, because she's totally removed me from her life. That's all I have left to get over. She's removed me from her life, and I'm not going to make any effort to work my way back in, so there's no reason for me to care if she ever disappeared, because essentially she already has. I have to live my life like she never existed, and once I pass this hurdle, I'll be happy again.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1354255222.0,,,True,t3_13z7jw,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/13z7jw/for_the_brokenhearted_out_there_an_epiphany_to/,

When they fall out of love, or the person they love feels the spirit of love leaving, they try desperately to reclaim the love that is lost rather than accepting the gift for what it was.

They want answers where there are no answers.  They want to know what is wrong with them, or they try to get their lover to change, thinking that if some small thing were different love would bloom again.  They blame their circumstances.  They blame each other.  They try anything to give meaning to what has happened.  But there is no meaning beyond the love itself, and until they accept its own mysterious ways they live in a sea of misery.

You need to treat what love brings you with kindness.  If you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you, be gentle with yourself.  There is nothing wrong with you.  Love just doesn't choose to rest in the other person's heart.

If you find someone else in love with you toward whom you feel no love, feel honored that love came and called at your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return.  Do not take advantage, do not cause pain.  How you deal with love is how love will deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are very different.

If you fall in love with another who falls in love with you, and then chooses to leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess blame.  let it go.  There is a reason and there is a meaning.  You will know it in time, but time itself will choose the moment.

Remember this and keep it in your heart.  You don't choose love.  Love chooses you.  All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life.  Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away.  Give it back to the person who brought it to you.  Give it to others who seem poor in spirit.  Give it to the world around you in any way you can.

Love has its own time, its own season, and its own reasons for coming and going.  You cannot bribe it or coerce it or reason it into staying.  If it chooses to leave, from your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and nothing you should do.  Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life.  If you keep your heart open, it will surely come again.'

When I think back on our relationship, it's almost as if I'm seeing it as a movie, like it didn't really even happen to me. When we first broke up, I couldn't imagine that would ever happen.

So I just keep telling myself it'll eventually happen with this guy. That even though now, even the mention of him is enough to send me into tears, one day I'll be so far removed from him, it'll be almost as if it never happened.

1) Your mind is so used to being attached to this person, that a sudden breakup just feels wrong. You simply can't accept the fact that the relationship is over, forever. Your brain yearns for that familiar face, your heart aches for the routine you and your significant other had. It can't be over, there's still so much unfinished business. It can't be over, I love them. It just can't be over. I do not have the ability to accept that.

2) People always say, there's so many fish in the sea. Get back into your hobbies, workout, be productive. This is all really good advice. However, it means NOTHING. Hobbies are temporary distractions. Thinking of finding another relationship seems so far away. Reading a book and going to the gym will only distract me for a small amount of time. The sheer pain, anxiety, sadness, and nostalgia makes hobbies obsolete. The thought of finding someone new sounds so beautiful but so far fetched. I have to start over? When will I find this person? Do I even want to subject myself to this again?

3) The nights and the mornings. Keeping busy with friends and hearing ""this was meant to be,"" every 5 minutes is cool during the day. You're out. There's hope, you will survive. You have cool friends, you are already meeting new people. Life's not so bad, after all. Maybe you will move on. Maybe I will get over this. Then I come home. The thoughts run rampant. He/she is not here anymore. Those memories that are now replaying in your head? Forget them, they no longer have meaning. The way things ended? Doesn't matter, nothing matters anymore except moving on. I can't move on. When you finally do sleep, you wake up. I found mornings to be worse. What will I do with my day? He/she is not here anymore. That's all I can think in the nights and the mornings. Something is missing. Something isn't right.

4) Are they hurting as much as I am? Are they okay with this? Are they crying on bathroom floors, screaming their hearts out into radios, punching walls, and binge drinking too?  They have to be haunted by our memories. We just spent so long together, they have to feel what I'm feeling, right?

A little background story:
I'm a [f] 23 and he was [M]26, together for two years. I ended things with him. Found out he was talking to another girl. He called me endlessly and begged. He cried. He got his family involved, showed up at my house. Did everything in the book to get me back. Even had the girl call me and tell me I was overreacting. I refuse to answer his phone calls and have maintained NC for a week, now. By far the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

I guess it just goes to show that even though I dumped him and he thinks it has been a walk in the park for me, I have not spent one minute not thinking about him. The constant battle in my head is raging and I don't know how much longer I can hold out. 

Relationships are tough. You put your everything into someone, and when it ends, you can't accept the fact that it will never be the same, again. Peoples' advice only helps out so much, and in the end.. you are left with a gaping hole in your heart that seems as though it will always be there. That is why we come to this reddit community, why we cry, why we can't sleep at night, and why the memories haunt us. Heartache is real and it's hard.

Regardless, here is what happened to me. I'll give you a brief summary because I feel as if people post huge updates and the words of wisdom get lost. 

**My update:**

I dated a girl for 2 years. We were each other's first loves. Hung out every day and I thought I'd never lose her. School starts back up and she one day tells me she needs to find herself and can't be with me. She tells me maybe in the future we can get together but not now. 

A week later I hear through people that she made out with a few guys. I'm devastated. I see her two weeks after that and she has hickeys on her neck. I am devastated again. I then find out she gave a fraternity brother a blow job. I get upset. My fraternity brothers ( I was a pledge) realize this is going to become a problem so I am kicked out. I now have lost a lot of my friends at school. My only friends are back home. I become good friends with her old best friend who decided to pick me over my ex. The friend and I become very close, talking every day. Over the next few weeks, my ex went partying every Thurs/Fri/Sat night. Her close friends were worried she was partying too much. One night she called me four times. SHe then told me she butt dialed me and didn't want to talk to me. Clearly she drunk dialed me and was embarrassed but it hurt. 

 I hear how she is sleeping around and the thought of her now having sex with other guys kills me. She won ""Most flirtatious"" in her sonority. All of this really hurts me. 

We go back home for break and our friends have a party. They invite both of us. Its around 15 people so it is somewhat awkward. I avoid my ex because I don't want to talk to her and she gets upset. She comes up to me and starts complaining about how I blocked her on facebook etc. I walked away. 

Later that night though, we both started arguing. We both got mad and said some mean things, but as a witty and angry person I really hurt her. Do I feel bad? No. I feel no remorse because after she all she put me through and has tried to hurt me I don't care how she feels. We still go to the same college, but I have made some friends who have now tried to get me on track.

The past few months of the break up I sat in my room afraid to go outside. I didn't want to see life for the positive, I wanted the past back. 



**What I have learned and why you should never give up:**

1. To start off.. No contact. You see this a lot yet people always ask ""should I block my ex?"" Yes. In every way. Block on facebook, instagram, twitter, remove the number from your phone, delete pictures from your phone (or save on computer but get it off your phone). GET YOUR EX OUT OF YOUR LIFE. Yes.. It hurts. Yes, it sucks. But if you are afraid to take these steps you are still living in the past. Make the choice to move on. 

2. Change the way you think. I was dumped and she tried to ruin my life by harassing girls I was with etc. I've lost many people because of her. I played victim for four months, hiding in my room watching netflix. I've never been more alone. But you know what got me out? Instead of thinking, ""She hurt me, she left me, I want her back"" I changed my head voice to ""I am choosing to go down a different path in my life. It is scary but it is what I want in the end."" Change your sad thoughts into ""I.."" give you the power. It takes time but I was able to turn all my negative feelings into inspiration because I started living for me and controlled my thoughts, not living a life in my past. 

3. Don't feel pressured to meet new people. This might be contrary to what a lot of people say but I find this true. A period of breaking up is feeling upset. Sometimes you need to accept it. A lot of my depression would come by forcing myself to be social when I wasn't ready and I would end up hurting myself. Break ups are natural and healing a broken heart is natural. It takes time. Don't feel guilty if you feel like staying in by yourself. HOWEVER, by doing this it is important to understand that being by yourself is okay. After my break up I was trying to be social so I could depend on people. Learn to be alone. Learn to be independent. The best possible you is without anyone else. When a new relationship comes along it should compliment you and the person you are, not make you feel whole. 

3b. With this being said, find your friends. When I say social I am talking about meeting new people and parties. Find out who is going to stay by your side. Find your true friends. Use them to talk to when you are down and to help you through this. Hang out with them and realize that intimate relationships are valuable, not just dating but friendships. I never valued having a good friend because I had a girlfriend. I've learned that during this time, all your friendships will be tested. You will be seeing people leave your life and people who come out of no where to help you. Take note of who truly cares about you and your well being and who doesn't want to deal with you when you are hurt. Relationships are tested when the shit hits the fan. Who will help you clean up?

4. Don't be afraid of change. This is a period of change whether you like it or not. Reevaluate who your friends are. Start exercising. Make a schedule to study and stick to it. Be the person you want to be. Start something new. Learn to speak a language or play piano. Gain something out of the pain you are going through, don't be a vegetable.

5. There is no competition. I don't care about your ex. If he/she has a new GF/BF that is great. Who the fuck cares? Don't feel like you need to compete. Do not feel pressured because your ex seems so happy so you should be happy too. Some nights I know she is at parties and I'm at home. This used to kill me inside. But then i realized.. My life is my life and I need to do what makes me happy. Be concerned with yourself and not anyone else.

6. Find inspiration. I've planned to travel this summer with my buddies and constantly find things to look forward to in my life. FIND WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY. Make yourself better. Understand how important school is and work hard. I just got the highest GPA I have ever gotten because I recommitted myself to wanting to go to law school. I know what I want and I'm going to get it. For myself. Not for anyone else. I have a plan, and if someone decides to be a part of the journey I would love it, but if not I know where I am going and will aspire to it. And if my plans fail, I know that I'll just have to find a new one.

Life moves on at the same pace, whether you are happy or sad, rich or poor, single or in a relationship. Think about that. 

Understand that everything will be better and that you'll come out of this looking back and being thankful you were not with someone who doesn't deserve you. To anyone who reads this: I do not know you, but I promise that you are worth love and worth living. Find someone who wants you, not someone who puts up with you. Life is hard and I've realized that things only matter when we value them. If we learn to change our values and value certain things differently, our lives could be drastically different.

Keep on trucking, make progress every day. 

***DO NOT BE AFRAID TO FAIL. Fail so many times you just laugh. Learn to fail and I promise you will be a lot happier.***

I just wanted to try to help some people out. I obviously am not perfect and this might not help you at all but I hope a few of you smile after this. If anyone is just lost, please just send me a message. Im willing to help anyone out if they feel lost. I know what its like.

I feel the constant need to contact my EX. I feel lonely and miss having that connection with someone.

I don't want it to become a place where we take advantage of each other. But from what I can see, this place is full of a lot of sad, lonely single people. Some people looking to fill a hole. And whilst a lot of the advice suggests you need to learn to fill that hole independently, what's the harm in making a connection with a new person and a chance to take your mind of your ex?

I know there's subreddits devoted to dating in various different forms. So this place shouldn't fill up with dating profiles. But how about we dedicate one thread, this thread to people who want to exchange contact details (via PM of course).

If you're feeling hopeless and you've spent the past few hours browsing /r/BreakUps and feeling no hope. Then get a contact buddy! Whenever you feel weak, contact your buddy and spill your guts! become friends.

I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but I feel like it's something I need and seeing as we all feel kind of the same here, I'm guessing is something most of you want to?

Sorry to use a throw away account. I just didn't want to be shunned if this was a really terrible suggestion. I feel quite wrong doing it. But we are all respectful around here. So hopefully it may be successful?

**EDIT: So pleased you all like the idea. Phew! Thought it might go horribly wrong. Well my REAL account is down there on the list. I shall remain anon though.

EDIT: I feel like we need to think through this. Any suggestions welcome. But I feel like if a Female posts, they're just going to get bombarded with PMs and some of the poor Males are going to get left behind lol. No offence. But it's what happens. You know it!

Like I said, any suggestions welcome. And if a new subreddit is needed, then so be it.**

Hi everybody, I just wanted to post my thoughts on how the first month following my own breakup has been. I'm not necessarily posting this because I need advice (although I love the advice I get here and I certainly welcome it!), I'm more or less just sharing. I figured this might be of use to some of you who are recently struggling, and it also might provide some insight for those of you who are making progress well beyond mine. Either way, feel free to share your thoughts on how your first month post-breakup has been! I get the feeling that a lot of this stuff is relatable, so I'd love to hear your One Month stuff.

**The Breakup**

I'm [21/m] and I got dumped 9 months into a relationship by my first love, a wonderful [21/f], who, after several weeks of cold and distant behavior, ended it suddenly and without any interest in rebuilding. For me, getting dumped was an absolute tragedy, or at least that's how I felt when it happened. I was crushed, devastated, miserable, shocked - all those words apply just fine.

**Observations on the Importance of No Contact**

The first month has seen only modest improvements in my mental state, unfortunately. No Contact was initiated immediately, and aside from a couple awkward encounters on campus, I've miraculously resisted the urge to contact her, and I attribute the slight progress I've made this past month to my ability to stay solid on NC.

The most challenging thing about NC is that you are more susceptible to finding other ways of attaching to your ex as an Ideal. The most common example, in my case, has been Facebook. The first week or so, I would scroll through that dumb little News Ticker thing on the right hand side of Facebook every hour, just looking for crumbs of information about her. I imagine many of you have done this too, and in my opinion, this is my Scumbag Brain's attempt at fighting the withdrawal. No more heroin? Let's huff the stuff under the sink. That's basically what was happening. Fortunately, this side-effect of the breakup is now beginning to subside as well. Thank God.

Of course, some things I can't help but see. I guess Facebook can recognize who you are most interested in based on the amount of times you view their page or message them in private. So every time my ex does something like write on a wall or join an event, that pops up on the top of my facebook page. The remedy for this is to either delete this person from your facebook friends, or just change your facebook settings so you can no longer receive updates from them. I highly recommend doing the latter.

**Obsessive Thinking/Dreaming**

The first month has a LOT of obsessive thoughts. I've found that, despite my improvements, I simply haven't stopped thinking about her on a regular basis. She's the first thing I think of when I go to bed, she's who I dream of, and she's who I think of when I wake up. And for the most part, she's all I think about during the day. This hasn't changed or improved at all.

**The New Guy**

My ex left me and immediately jumped into a rebound relationship. It's probably not a serious relationship, but my understanding is that she met a guy while she was mulling over dumping me. He Alpha Male'd her and she probably thought he was charming, so dumping me and jumping over to him was likely a simple process for her.

Seeing the New Guy in person has to be the most challenging thing to watch during the entire breakup. Nevermind that you'll never talk to her again, but now you gotta deal with the fact that she's already sharing herself and her inner beauty with another guy the way that you thought only you could see her. This part sucks, and it will knock you back on your ass. The fact that it happened within the first couple weeks of my breakup actually might be a blessing in disguise. I already was miserable, so this kinda didn't take me down too many pegs. Can't really go from rock bottom to rockier bottom, now can you?

My theory is that we all will get over our exes, but the last emotion to go is the emotion you get when you see them with somebody else. Has anybody here felt a pain in their chest seeing their ex with their new guy/girl? How long into the breakup were you? How did it impact your recovery?

**My New Girl**

I don't have one. That's the worst part about being a guy. We gotta work for our rebounds, whereas you girls pretty much have an arsenal of cell phone contacts and Lax Bro douchebags on your phones, many of whom you led on and flirted with throughout the relationship, and put on the backburner in the event that the relationship doesn't pan out. Such was the case with my ex.

As for me, I still go out and talk to girls, but picking one up and having a rebound does not feel like a comfortable scenario to put myself in. Not yet anyways. Girls might grieve differently, but for guys, I think that sex is quite unnatural after a breakup. But I could be wrong. Girls - when you have a rebound, what is it like? Do you think about your ex consciously while you are having sex? Do you feel worse when you're done? Does it even help? I can't imagine that it helps much.

**Coming to Terms, Accepting Shitty Realities**

The first month involves a lot of letting go, which is what makes it so challenging. Once you let go of being in a relationship, then you let go of your routine that you've been having for the past several months/years. Once you let go of that, you gotta let go of the actual person. This is the hardest part for me, because my ex was a true friend. We talked so openly and honestly with each other, and our emotions were so intimately connected on a personal level. Letting go of the love hurts, but letting go of the friendship is truly a challenge. Expect a lot of inner bargaining here. I found myself saying ""We will be friends eventually, it would be a shame to let our friendship die too."" Well now I'm realizing that it's just gotta happen.

I do not believe that you can remain friends with somebody who has broken up with you. How can I ever be a friend to somebody with whom I once shared such deep, personal thoughts? The barrier that now exists between us, the barrier that replaces the love we once had, has sealed us apart forever. Friendship is not possible after love.

**Crying**

I cried a lot the first weekend I was dumped. Then I stopped. The reason I stopped, I think, is because I entered a period of denial. I refused to accept that this girl was no longer in my life at all. I told myself that she will be there in time as a friend, that she will be there once this love fades. It might take 6 months, a year, or whatever, but eventually we'll be back together as old friends. Wrong. She's gone for good. And when I accepted that, I started crying again. I cried last weekend, and I tear up almost every day for the last couple days. This is where I'm at with the crying, one month in. 

**Talking with Friends/Family**

Talking about it has become easier, but I worry that other people grow tired of me talking about her. A month is not enough time to recover from lost love, but it's enough time for even your best friends to roll their eyes and say, ""Get over it.""

That's why coming here is so therapeutic, because you've got a community of people who not only want to talk to you, but they want to share similar experiences.

Keep talking about it though. Talk to anybody who will listen.

**Some Cool Tips, Tricks, and Life Hacks That Have Helped Me**

Work out at the gym. I go to the gym regularly anyway, but since the breakup, I go 6 days a week. If you don't go at all - start doing it! You won't know how awesome it makes you feel until you try it. I go to the gym feeling like shit, I leave feeling refreshed, and every so often I leave thinking, ""Whoa! I didn't think about her for like 30 minutes while I was in there!"" Not thinking about her for 30 minutes, for me anyway...there's no better feeling in the world.

Another trick. Imagine you had to talk to her face to face tomorrow. Let's say you guys have a coffee date. What would you say to her? Write out a script for what you'd say, questions you'd ask, and what her responses might be. Write it word for word, too - an exact script of every single thing you want to tell her. When you think you've gotten it nailed down, and you think you really told her off good, save the document and put it away in a folder or something. Come back to it a week later and start from scratch. Edit it and adjust it based on how you are currently feeling. Scrap the stuff that might've sounded kinda rude and harsh, and replace it with the feelings you have now. Once it's perfect again, save it as ""Script 2"" and hide it away. Do this every week, and accumulate these scripts. After a while, you'll notice that the tone of your dialogue is starting to become less intense, more aloof, and within these scripts are some great areas for self-reflection.

Another tip, and this one is the most cliche of all, but it's also extremely helpful. Just get busy, doesn't matter with what. I had a shit-ton of errands I had to run yesterday, like literally 10 different places I had to drive to in one day. Took me all morning and most of the afternoon, and it wasn't fun and it wasn't being done with my ex in mind. It's just stuff I had to do. But wow, being busy really helps you not think about your ex! If being busy means joining a club or meeting new people, do that too! Whatever it takes to keep your mind off it!

**Fears for the Future, Post-Month One**

I'm not sure what fears I have for the future. Some fears are stupid, some might be justifiable, some might exist tomorrow.

I fear that I'll continue to hurt forever (I've been told otherwise around 350,000 times).

I fear that she has already moved on without me and is doing just fine, while I'm still here miserable.

I fear that I'll never love a girl the way I loved her.

I fear that my ache when I see her with other guys will linger.

I fear that I'll be alone for a long time.

BUT

I don't care anymore if she talks to me ever again.

I don't care about what she is doing at any given point in the day. Although sometimes I do, but it's getting better.

**Final Thoughts**

What I'm trying to say is that one month is still not enough time to solve everything. Just a few days ago, I was convinced that I had made zero progress. But even after a couple days, I see there's some developments here and there that are much better than they were before.

Again, I apologize for the length of this post. I broke it up into sections that you might find most helpful, and if you actually took the time to read all of it - wow! I applaud your patience, but you really didn't have to!

The ultimate thing here is to hear YOUR stories! Are you approaching the one month mark like I have? Did you just get past it? What was it like for you at this time? If you aren't here yet, what are you most scared of?

Thanks for reading, everybody! I'll probably write a follow-up to this post after month 3 or so, and maybe again after 6 months. Have a great day!

Don't cry, don't plead, don't vow revenge. Control your emotions until you're on your own. No matter how much it hurts never show them it. By all means, cry your heart out when you're on your own, but not on front of them. Cut them off on Facebook, you've no idea how much this helps, seriously. If you agree to be friends, let them be the first to contact YOU.

Now take a step back and look at yourself. Are you not happy with yourself in some way? Job, looks, weight, fitness, hobbies etc? Put your head down and THROW yourself into them. Literally concentrate on yourself and no one else for as much time as you need. You've spent most of your time on another person, you owe it to yourself to be selfish for a while. Getting drunk is not a good idea because emotions tend to spill out, but if you do, make sure it's with your friends on a crazy, hilarious night. Flirt and talk to people. Feels awesome.

If you ever see your ex, be polite and friendly, dont make it awkward. If your ex sees how good you're taking everything, thats the best ''revenge'' you could ever give. They start to realise that you didnt care about them as much as they thought. But I digress, this ''revenge'' should be a by product of your self improvement, not your reasons for doing it.

Thinking/doing these things does not stop the pain, but in my experience, it really shortens the time needed to get over them.

I hope this helps, its what I did and my ex even asked to get back together the other day. And I said no. Greatest. Feeling. Ever.

Thinking about how beautiful it would be to wake up in your arms and kiss you and have great morning sex. This led to me actually realizing something huge: I don’t miss you. I miss our sex. Our mind blowing, no holds barred exploratory sex. You once likened it to nirvana, and I find it very fitting.

I don’t miss you. I miss the way you made me feel. Never have I felt so confident, so sexy, so powerful than I did those weekends we spent holed up in bed. It turns out that all of your other qualities were overshadowed by this, and I know you felt the same way about me. I came second to my sexuality as well and only now can I not be insulted because I finally see that I was in the same boat.

I don’t miss you. I miss being able to call you mine. Now I realize my reasons for wanting you were primarily superficial. You are a very handsome man with a good personality, but you were right—we aren’t compatible. I was simply blinded by your beauty and the fear of losing the chance to wake up to that perfect face and kiss those perfect lips. We both wanted it to be something more, something deeper because our connection was undeniable, but after trying I think we both realized our sexuality was the glue holding us together those months. 

A huge weight has been lifted because now I see that I can find someone who I’m really attracted to on more levels than just sexually (and vice versa). For weeks I’ve been crying and being sad because I thought I missed you so much and wanted you back. Now I am able to see that I don’t miss you.  I miss our sex (and I can find sex again).

I quickly moved out and did my best to move on.

I will admit that I replied to his phone calls and messages when I was feeling weak and missing him, but lately I have realized a distinct pattern: he only contacts me when something is going wrong in his life and once he feels better, he blows me off like I'm some sort of nuisance. In addition to this he has lied and just treated me horribly since the break-up.

So a few months ago I started seeing someone else and he has been such a great guy to me. I have informed him that my ex has been contacting me and he was not too happy about. So last night I decided to let him have it once and for all.

On Wednesday morning, at 2:30 I received a text from him saying that his uncle died and he didn't know how to deal etc. and that I was the only person who would understand I asked him if he was ok and he started a very long, drawn out conversation. The next day however, he decided that he no longer needed to talk and sent me very trite comments like 'i'm fine now, I was just upset blah, blah blah...and then I just snapped. I realized he was just using me again so I sent him this:

""Please stop contacting me. You're just using me. You couldn't care less about my feelings and whenever I needed you (hospital, recovery, birthday, sad etc.) you told me it wouldn't be fair to K if we talked. Yet, when something goes wrong with you, you come to me with all your doubts and insecurities, expect me to give you advice, and then blow me off. You are not a good friend or boyfriend. How do you think she would feel knowing that you were texting me at 2:30 in the morning? I will not stoop to her level and stay in inappropriate contact with someone else's boyfriend. i am sorry you are having a rough time, but seek help elsewhere. i am in a wonderful relationship with a great guy and your communications are compromising it. Stop being so selfish and just leave me alone. I have no desire to be a part of any of your games.""

Today I feel like a boss. I've never been able to tell him off like that. Please learn from my mistakes. Don't stay in contact and don't settle for being friends with someone who was never your friend in the first place.

**The Breakup**

*You've just been broken up with. This person you shared so many memories and happy times with, this person you've depended on for all this time; he/she's leaving now. He/she's not going to be a part of your life anymore. It's over. It's done. So what are you feeling? Shock at first. Maybe you didn't expect it. Maybe you didn't see it coming at all. Maybe it's been long overdue and you've just been spending the last couple weeks or months bracing yourself for this. But no matter what kind of premonition, it still hasn't prepared you for the actual thing. The actual moment when you have to say goodbye.*

Denial is strong right after the breakup. You don't think it's actually happened.

**Post-Breakup: Month 1-2**

*Your emotions are everywhere. You're lost. Maybe even in denial. You don't know how to feel and you really don't know how to deal. You check up on him/her every day. You want to see how they're doing, but every time you check only makes you feel worse and worse. Everything reminds you of them. You can't eat. You can't sleep. You find whatever excuse you can to try and talk to him/her. You really want to talk to him/her again. But every time you do talk to him/her, it's not satisfying. It might even end badly. Every time you talk to him/her you regret it immediately afterwards. Why can't you just fucking follow no contact. Every day passes by slowly. You go through stages of missing him/her to hating him/her to sometimes even thinking that you're fine. Some days you really do think that you're better. But one update about them from a mutual friend or seeing them in a tagged photo on Facebook makes you miserable again. You might delete them from your contacts, social networking sites, etc. but you still try to see what he/she's up to. Every sad song resonates with you. You wallow in sad feelings. When given the opportunity, you unload about your ex and everything to whoever's willing to listen. You ask about him/her constantly, even though you know that it will only make you feel worse if you know he/she's doing fine. Maybe even better. You visit /r/breakups and sad subreddits often, reading stories similar to yours and posting a lot about your own, but really just checking to see if your ex has written or posted anything.*

This stage is when you're most prone to making the biggest mistakes. Your emotions dictate your every action, and it's incredibly hard to control yourself.

**Month 3-5**

*You're able to do no contact for longer now. You stop checking up on him/her as often. You're done with feeling miserable and sorry for yourself, you need to distract or better yourself now. You go to the gym, maybe get a new hobby, hang out with friends more, whatever. You do as much as you can to fill up the day. Sometimes, you even stop thinking about him/her for a little bit. But at the end of the day, when you're all by yourself, he/she pops into your mind again. It's hard to fall asleep, still. You're consumed by your thoughts. Mornings are more or less the same. You wake up feeling kind of empty. Like, something that was supposed to be there is just, gone. You go through the day distracting yourself and everything, but by the end of it, there's a void inside of you. It's like nothing else really matters to you anymore. You're empty. But are you really? You reason to yourself that you're a lot better now. That you can finally be friends with your ex again. Then, somebody tells you something about your ex and a new person. How happy he/she is. It stings and hurts just as much as it did a couple months ago. Maybe you're not completely over it yet, but you still want to talk to him/her again. You figure you're at least good enough now to maybe win him/her back. This is a bad idea. But you do it anyway because you're fucking stupid. Maybe your ex contacts you around this time. You try to be wary and not reciprocate, but you do anyway. You and your ex might fall back into normalcy for a little while. But it doesn't last. You both fall apart again. You're back to feeling months 2-5 for the next however many months.*

You lie to yourself the most around here. You're better, yes, but not over it. It's incredibly easy to relapse at this stage.

**Month 6-**

*If your ex hasn't contacted you by now and you've just been going through the months alone, you're on your way to finally getting over him/her. Hearing about your ex might still bother you, but the feeling doesn't last as long as it used to. You find yourself being nostalgic. Thinking back on old times with him/her and missing them. The feeling doesn't last, but there's still times when you want to talk to him/her again. You go through periods when you just kind of think about him/her fondly, maybe wishing that the two of you could be friends again. You might still relapse at times.*

You're on the way to really getting over your ex here. You might not be over it, but at least thinking about your ex with another person doesn't immediately make you want to commit a felony.

**Post-Post-Breakup**

*You know you're finally over your ex when hearing about him/her with this new person doesn't bother you anymore at all. When you no longer have the need to really want to be his/her friend or to talk to them. You sometimes think about the old times and him/her fondly, but in a way you would any old memory. He/she is important to you, but you no longer bear any unhealthy attachment. This point is when you could genuinely put an effort to daydream or something about your ex, and you wouldn't end up feeling shitty or anything about it.*

By the time you reach the end, you might've found somebody new. From my experience, that has been the only true way for me to forget about an ex in the past. You're able to be happy that what happened between you two happened, and that even if you two are strangers now, you're still able to look back and be thankful for the time you two were the most important people in each other's lives.

I had written her several weeks ago to sort out a legal matter, but I received no response and I left it to my attorney. Out of the blue today, I received a hatefully worded lengthy reply on a host of subjects. As I read it, I braced myself for anxiety and anger and fear, but I felt nothing. I do not mean that I felt nothing as in I was emotionally numb, but hearing from her did nothing to kindle an emotional response from me. She has no more power over my life. I have moved on.

*PRELUDE - IVE FALLEN AND I CANT GET UP*


It's over and you're heartbroken. First, an unexpected message: be grateful that you feel pain. Seemingly illogical yes, but not everyone in this world is able to love deeply and be loved. It's intensely humanizing and humbling. If you take nothing else away, here comes the takeaway: there are two types of pain in the world. Pain that makes you stronger and pain that causes senseless suffering. You need to transform your pain into the former.

*THE PERFECT GIRL - I'VE GOT SUNSHINE ON A CLOUDY DAY*


OK, so you can't imagine your life without her - the future looks bleak. She's the one that got away. You love everything about her. Even when she's outright annoying to others, you think she's adorable. It's a tragedy that you're not gonna be able to share your future together. You think about her when you're walking home at night, when you see something funny on tv, when you hear a song, when you're happy and when you're sad. You can't love, you DONT want to love anyone ever again. Who else is gonna have those cute lil eccentricities that you love so goddamn much??? But, there's hope (and in the human condition, a shred of hope goes a very long way) Countless people before us have endured the EXACT SAME FEELINGS. These very same people went on to have meaningful, joyous relationships full of laughter and fun. And guess what? There's gonna be countless after. Sure, you lack perspective right now because you're caught up in your sorrow. Soulmates? Pshawww. Nada, doesn't exist. You will be fine. You will look back on this as a set of experiences that made you stronger and wiser. And if it doesn't ever work out...the single life aint bad, man. Freedom and all bruskis a guy could ever want. But trust me, you will come out of this happier. Why? That brings me to...

*TIME - THE BEST THING ABOUT THE FUTURE IS IT COMES ONE DAY AT A TIME*

As time passes, you'll find yourself missing her a tad bit less one agonizingly slow nanobit at a time. Time is a miraculous healer - it feels impossibly hard right now because our brains are evolutionarily wired to hold onto hurtful memories to prevent repeating the same error(s). Unfortunately, a side effect of that is gut-wrenching heartbreak. One day soon, you're gonna remember those amazing memories with her, but something wonderful will have happened. You won't have any queasiness associated with them. But, you gotta work at it. You know that 6-pack that you decide to get every 3 months but instead you end up plopping on the couch popping Doritos? Yaaaaaa, about that...you're actually gonna have to work for this...

*KEY STEP - I UNLOCKED THE CHEST, SIR, AND OUT CAME A BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW*


There is one crucial key to moving on and feeling happy again. It's realizing that you can live a wonderful life WITHOUT her. Fully internalize this. Just don't say it to yourself. BELIEVE it. It is true. Not because I say it, but because other people have LIVED it. All sorts of experimental data point to this fact. People fall down and they get back again. But, it doesn't just happen like puff the magic dragon - you have to WORK at it.

*MENTAL GAME - THE MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE*

You control your mind. Sometimes, you tell it things it doesn't believe and it's rejected and the subconscious generates doubts and worries. But here's something believable. You won't ever find anyone like her ever again - this is an indisputable fact. And almost no one likes change. These two issues are at the roots of your difficulty. But that's ok! You'll find someone different and you'll love the really cute things about them.You'll make great memories with them. And when it's all said and done and when you look back on your experiences, you'll realize that it was all meant to be and you wouldn't have it any other way. And if you don't you'll end up killing yourself so any of this won't matter anyways. I keeeed, i keeeed. But, seriously it's just not mental...


*PHYSICAL GAME- THE BODY IMMORTAL*

Go out, be active, and productive. Make things HAPPEN. You're sad right now and that intensifies the already formidable inertia it takes to do anything anyways. But, humans are great creatures - you can be sad and do things all at the same time! Develop hobbies and interests, try to make a positive impact in the world, learn a new skill, network with others, go out and explore. After a while, you're going to be less and less sad. THIS WILL HAPPEN. And gradually, the lack of sadness is going to be your natural state. And then you'll start to appreciate the little things in the world again- and that's when you know you'll have returned to your natural state of happiness. As a small aside, you have no idea how limited your time in this world is - USE IT. It's going to take your mind off her and you'll be doing wonderful things for yourself and others around you. DOUBLE WIN. It's a brand new you - speaking of which...


*IMPROVE - Y U NO MAKE SAME MISTAKE TWICE*

No matter who was at fault, don't beat yourself up over it. If it was your fault, introspect. Figure out all the things that you did wrong and USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE YOURSELF A BETTER HUMAN BEING. So many grand human feats take significant time. The Mona Lisa, the Sistine Chapel, the Internet. The amazing thing about your situation is you can improve INSTANTANEOUSLY. You control your mind and you can think and act whatever you tell it. And stick to those thoughts and actions forever more. Again, this takes WORK, but you need to ensure that all of this not for nought. Remember? There are two kinds of pain...But after you're done and you've made up your mind to live a certain way from here on end, let go. Don't make it harder on yourself - people do stupid stuff all the time, but the wonderful thing about human beings is (among other things) their capacity to change and adapt. Use this to make yourself stronger.

*CONTACT - CAN WE BE SIAMESE TWINS AGAIN*


Ya you wanna meet her, you wanna talk to her, you wanna...DON'T. Seriously, just don't. You're gonna have to take my word for this. Some of you won't and you'll learn the hard way - be my guest. No matter how persuasive and charming you actually think you are, you're not that persuasive and your charm takes a nosedive when you start to grovel. And speaking of groveling? Duuuude... Not only does your self-image take a hit, but you seem about as attractive as Pee-wee Herman. Seriously, don't. Even if she still cares for you, this is no way to success, man. Think about it - would you be with someone that begged you to be with them? Put yourself in her shoes. Role reversal - it's a beautiful thing.

You were my best friend, we would spend so many fucking nights and fucking week ends in bed watching are favourite shows !! You knew my whole family and I knew yours, and they all loved us so much. I never loved anyone as much as you, ever. You were everything, because I knew that as long as we had each other everything would be alright. 

I stopped music for you, I stopped all the tours and all the gigs, because I knew you couldnt take it, I lost friends because you wanted me with you. I gave you my fucking SOUL .

I remember telling myself at the beginning of our relantionship that I was going to make you so happy, I would make sure everything would be perfect for you, I promised myself I would never cheat on you and that I would protect you, and I would do anything to see you smile, and for 2 years, thats exactly what I did. I worked my ass off to make you the happiest girl on earth.

And when you had to move away to Paris for your studies, and I was supposed to go to Dublin, you asked me to come with you, and what did my stupid fucking ass do ? I said ok.

I used to post here quite a bit and I've wanted to do so again for a while now, just to tell everyone how much better it gets, but this is the first time in months I've felt I could even relate to any of you. That was something I never expected, to have gone from such a miserable state, where I thought I was destined to feel that much pain forever, seeing no way out, to feeling so positive and good about life and love, that any advice I tried to give would just come across as condescending and undermining to people going through all of this.

Anyway, to get to what I'm trying to say. I've had a small relapse recently, after further revelations about my past relationship. Nothing serious, so my relapse wasn't so much into an emotional mess like the first time round, but into a fairly miserable state. I almost instantly didn't feel like eating, didn't drink anything but coffee, didn't exercise any more and I was smoking excessively. Not good for my anxiety or my mental state. And I realised probably 90% of the reason why I've been feeling so shit is because of what I've been doing to myself. And I did a whole lot of that to myself after the breakup, that really didn't serve to help me in any way.

Breakups are painful, but some of that pain is avoidable. And trust me, it's not the end of the world so please take care of yourselves. Force-feed yourselves if you have to, even if you've lost your appetite. Take vitamin pills. Drink water and try to exercise. That's the road to getting better, and trust me that's what you want. Don't wallow in self-pity.

Whatever has happened, it does not mean your life is over. And no matter how bad it seems, it gets better I promise. And I know you don't want to hear that. I hated hearing it, it made my breakup seem so trivial and meaningless. But one day you'll look back on that painful period of your life and you'll be glad it happened. Now is your chance to take back control of your life and make things better. There'll be hard days and days where it feels as painful as the first day.

We got past the ""how are you doing?"" stages of the conversation and she immediately started showing off just how great her life was. It's like she was just waiting for this moment to be like ""fuck you, I'm doing great!!"" She sent me tons of pictures of parties at her house and how amazing they were.

Obviously I got a little upset. All I could think about was ""man, how many guys has she fucked in the bed that we use to cuddle up and laugh together and have such great times in?""

Ouch, worst mistake ever. It made me feel like a loser, like because I'm not throwing wild parties every weekend and fucking random chicks.

I broke up with my girlfriend after a 2 year relationship. When we broke up I was completely devastated to the point of breakdown. 

She blocked me on facebook and I followed suit in an act of imature revenge and blocked her.

4 months have since past and I had been making positive progress with myself. I was making an effort to try and socialize, I stopped crying in the evening times (lame I know) and I really felt like I made significant emotional progress.

THEN:

Today I let my curiosity get the best of me. I made a fake facebook account so that I could look at her profile.

I saw a bunch of photographs  of her with her new boyfriend (a guy I know).
I felt so sick and overwhelmed. It was like we had just broke all over again but for some reason it hurt even more.

So now I'm set back months and months. I'm sitting doing anything I can to try and vent the mixed feelings of pain and anger and hate (typing this right now is an attempt to vent the destructive feelings I have right now)

I've gone from feeling pretty ok to being overwhelmed with crazy impulses and fantasies of violent self destruction. 

Trust me, you don't want to feel how I do right now. NEVER EVER make contact with your ex or attempt to snoop on whats going on with their lives.

I've seen a lot of articles detailing ways to get your ex back, ways to make him love you again, etc. But ironically, not too many words about the opposite advice.

Sometimes, it's not a good idea to get your ex back. When you love someone, this is a hard decision to come to. Some find it impossible and go back to the same person over and over again. But I'm here to tell you this isn't always the best decision for you. Whether you're waiting for the one you lost to change (ahem, see below for that one) or you just can't stay away, here are the top 5 reasons why you should NOT get back with your ex.


* **1) It didn't work out in the first place for a reason.**

Think about why you broke up. Think about all the problems you had with your ex. Was he emotionally unavailable  drive you crazy? Was it her incessant flirting with other guys, despite her love for you, that made you end it? Or maybe you just fought constantly over everything from dinner plans to whether or not Pluto is a planet. 

When you're considering rekindling that flame with your ex lover, think about what set you over the edge. What made your relationship unfixable. Is that something you really want to go back to? Time makes us forget all the bad and only remember the good--but you two broke up for a reason. Consider those reasons before crawling back.


* **2) Living in the past prevents you from moving on.**

You may find yourself wanting your ex back because you're currently in a rut. You think back to the good times and wish they were still happening--you remember moonlit dinners, trips to the Cape, and now you're only making dessert for one instead of two (and it's much less gluttonous to eat chocolate cake with others). We all get stuck in the past every now and then, and while a little nostalgia can keep us going in the really bad times, thinking about what happened long ago is no good reason to get your ex back. 

Moving on is often the best medicine after a break up. Dwelling on what's already happened will never move you forward in life--imagine if we as humans were never able to learn from our mistakes. We'd be doomed to make the same stupid mistake for the rest of our lives. If we decided to pick a spouse who didn't appreciate us, we'd be constantly picking that same type of person forever. Doesn't that just suck? Use your ability to learn from your mistakes to make your next relationship better and healthier than your last, instead of repeating your last mistake.

* **3) Sure some couples get back together and make it work, but how many examples are there?**

You've seen it happen before. Your friend or cousin or best friend's bridesmaid's sister had a horrid break up, then she realized later that her ex was truly the one for her. And they got married in a huge ceremony and lived happily ever after. Good for them. But one example is not the norm--that's a huuuuge misnomer. And further, do you even know the details of why the example couple broke up in the first place? Maybe it was something silly. Or maybe they're just the exception.

Much more often, two people get back together and realize all those problems they had before haven't changed. He still doesn't respect her, and she still refuses to pay for anything. Those issues that caused your break up haven't changed. Nothing has changed. Getting back together usually only causes a rehash of why you broke up in the first place. Which then, leads to another break up.


* **4) People don't change.**

I know this is a controversial topic, but I'm willing to put it out there. PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE. Sure, maybe your ex would be on her best behavior for a few weeks if you got back together; but deep down to the core, she's still that same woman who you couldn't make it work with. I promise you, the chances of your ex changing this time around are next to nil. Now, yes people have the capabilities to change--it's not an absolute. People can change their clothes, their hairstyle, even aspects of their personality. But change has to come from inside yourself (and even if you want to change, it is DARN hard). 

Your ex will not change for you. Her personality, her bad habits, the way she truly is when nobody's watching, 99.9876% of the time those are traits people won't change. You are much better off finding a partner who you don't want to change. A good relationship starts when you accept the other person for who they are, when all the walls are down, when you've seen them at their best and worst, and you love them just the way they are.

* **5) Don't settle for somebody who couldn't keep you around in the first place.**

Even if your ex was the one who initiated the break up and left you heartbroken, this main idea still applies. Either way, one of you wanted to break up and the other went along with it. There was something in your relationship that made it not work for one of you, so being with your ex wasn't exactly an ideal situation. So why should you settle for such a situation?

The bottom line is that there was a break up. Break up means something was wrong beyond the little annoyances. And all of this says that you can find someone better for you. Someone who won't want to break up with you, or who you won't want to break up with. Never settle or deny yourself future happiness. Even if you can't see it now, you will find someone else. You can find someone who treats you better than your ex did. But in order for that to happen, you have to move on and not get back together with your ex.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_ss86t,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ss86t/5_reasons_not_to_get_back_with_your_ex_m_rose/,

About a year and a half ago, I had a bad break-up, we'd been together for 4 years and after we'd broken up she'd got with another man. I handled the entire situation so badly, was living in hope of us getting back together, I was far removed from my friends and I must have bored them to death with sob stories. All I can say is I wish I'd known about Reddit and these sub-reddits earlier. 

My last relationship went south nearly a week ago, it was never on the scale and I can't compare it to my last relationship, or some of the relationships here but all the advice given here really helps. 

- Realizing that there's billions of other people out there, what's the likeliness that ""the one"" was right on your doorstep? 

- Breaking contact. Texting only prolongs the ""what-if"" scenario; ""If we keep texting s/he'll realize what a great person I am and come running back!"" Begging for someone back isn't assertive, and it damn well isn't attractive. You're only cementing their decision whilst trying to emotionally black-mail to come back.

- Expecting to get back together in the future is a recipe for disaster. Whether you broke up because they cheated, or they're just not the person for you, or you for them... don't deposition your self-respect because you miss them. ""I'll never get anyone else"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

- If I've tried my absolute best to make something work, and she's treated me like shit in return then why should she have a boyfriend she doesn't deserve?

- Writing a list of things you didn't like about the person really put things in perspective. She never did nice things for me, she was never affectionate and she wasn't emotionally available. Why was I jumping through hoops to get this girl? If I read about my relationship on paper, I'd tell myself to not waste my time and grow a set.

- Squeezing the details and digging won't help. If we've stopped talking and I'm moving on, finding out something that'll upset me will only take me back to step one. Ignorance is sometimes bliss. If she's cheated, then she can live with the guilt on her own without bringing you down too. 

- Oneitis. thedovelamenting mentioned it and they were *so* right. I felt like she was different, special, but how special can she really be? She's obviously not the elusive ""one"", I was just infatuated with her. This was a great link: [Oneitis - Dr Nerdlove](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2011/09/oneitis/all/1/)

- Do the things you couldn't, or felt you shouldn't. I put off seeing a friend of mine who's currently living abroad, because I thought it'd make my girlfriend jealous and it wasn't fair. I'm flying out next week.


Maybe this post was more for me, to get down everything that I was thinking but maybe it'll help someone else. We've not spoken since the day we broke up, nor am I expecting us to; she never even spoke about remaining friends, and in my opinion, it's her loss.  I've been milking it for all it's worth and been seeing my friends more. I hope I haven't come across like I know it all, but it's all the stuff I've learnt from other people right here.

All in all, I just wanted to say thank-you to all the people who give up their evenings to help other people and give advice that really helps. Your friends will tell you what you want to hear to help your feelings, but a stranger'll give it to you straight.

1369771377.0,45,self.BreakUps,1f7xe2,Just an observation,53,8,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1f7xe2/just_an_observation/,"Okay /r/BreakUps. I have been a part of this community for the last 2 months now.  For two months I have shared in your sense of loss, misery, anger, feeling of abandonment and every other possible feeling that might have been aroused in you in these dark moments.

I have read many guides and many posts with pointers for people like us who at this moment in time do not possess the most sound judgement.  

I'm not going to make this a post about a guide to survival or getting better.  Hell, if I knew, I'd already be better wouldn't I?

Without getting into my story much, I'm a 24 year old guy who got dumped flat on his ass by his first real girlfriend after a year and half together. I'm not from the United States. I'm from a country which has the second largest population on earth. Go figure.  My girlfriend left for the states and within 3 months of being in University, 'found herself' and boom, here we are.

So this is a list of things I've observed in myself and I am sharing this to offer perspective to others like me who possibly think they're crazy. Hey, if you don't agree with my observations and think i'm crazy, you're obliged to say so in the comments. Without being diplomatic. Tell me right to my face, /u/doneanddusted, Son, you've lost your marbles. That's right.

Okay, starting off, when you get dumped, you don't really absorb the enormity or triviality of the situation. You're just blind sided and are more like, whoa, wtf just happened there? You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them. You don't think much. You mope, you plead, you make yourself desperate because hey! The prophecy said she/he was the one. No one else will have such a high midichlorian count ever. etc. etc.  

You try hard to figure out what went wrong, why things went so far south and what you can do to fix things. Truth is, there's almost always nothing. Might not be for everyone, but for most people it is. They just upped and left for whatever reason and they're not going to tell you. So you try several ways to look for closure. 

Yeah, that isn't going to happen either. Closure is just us looking for answers to questions that they can't answer. Also, if they can, those answers are most probably some that you don't want to hear. So here is one piece of advice even though I said I wouldn't give any. Closure is just you looking to hang on. That shit is over rated. Except the song Closure by this awesome band called Opeth. Now THAT shit.  That shit isn't over rated. But you get the gist.  Don't clamour for it. You're just inviting trouble.  

Now comes the phase where it sinks in that yes, you've broken up. This is really happening. Whoa dude, I'm no longer in a relationship.  This phase comes when you're thinking about stuff all the time. What happened those past few weeks, what you did, what they said, past life experiences, you plug into your Animus and use experiences from Desmond, Altair, Ezio and every other fucker you can imagine and then it dawns on you. Man, i just got dumped didn't I? God dammit, I got dumped. This phase came to me when I was reasonably stoned [7] and having random epiphanies. Eye opener. What I learnt from this is not profound, but I will share it nevertheless. Don't toke alone. NEVER. One wrong thought and then good luck trying to control your chain of thought.  You're not exactly in control of that train when you're sober. Getting high is only going to give you a repeat telecast of Unstoppable and trust me, Denzel Washington ain't coming to save your ass son.

Okay, here comes the next phase.  You're happily stalking away. Hoping that they're in pain and dejection as much as you. Hoping they're staying up nights crying. By this time, due to aforementioned desperate behavior, chances are, he/she's not talking to you. So you keep in touch like this. Welcome to La La Land. You're not going to find what you like. Remember that guy who she said was only a friend? Remember that girl who he thought was annoying? Yeah, they're partying 24/7 together. He/She looks happier and prettier, more handsome, sexier than Brad Pitt/Sofia Vergara and you're going to just end up thinking, that's it, I'm officially a loser. Time to get out my L badge and get that capital L tattooed on my forehead. Should I get it in Calibri? No, Times new Roman is more dignified. Hmm.  

Then you finally decide to try this thing called No Contact, whatever the fuck that is. Hmmph. Like that'll ever work. You try it for a few days, then you just have to scratch that itch. You can't keep away can you? So you go ahead and scratch it and you know what? Rashes  motherfucker. Boo yah.
  
So then you put on whatever skin cream and spf 500 or whatever that is and go full NC. Looks like these tools knew what they were talking about.  A week goes by, then 2 and hey, you're running along in the wind going weeeeee. I have run out of fucks to give. Happy? Wait for it. He/She asks you how you're doing. It can be a text/call/fucking picture of puppies (look at my post history) and suddenly, all those fucks you were not giving are back.

Then you decide to go NC even harder.  You don't hear from them either. You're doing fine. Almost. You don't obsess or think about them that much and then again, it's back.  Yes sir.  All those fucks. With a big gleeful smile.  Turns out they were just on vacation.  They're back and they're going to take their place in your head.  

Now you are well and truly fucked. Believe me. You are. No. You're not special you jackass. You are fucked. Accept it.  Everything you do, you think he/she is doing it better and in a much grander way. You're playing poker with buddies? He/She is playing strip poker in a penthouse suite at the Bellagio.  You're watching a movie? He/She's fucking acting in a movie.  You're drinking a beer watching porn? He/She's drinking patron and starting their own company to challenge Bang Bros and Brazzers. Yes, you're fucked,

Then you realise, fuck that shit. Logic takes over and you realise, it's just not possible for someone to live such a life. It's not really happening. Your brain is showing you shit cause it is one sadistic baller.  Let logic speak some sense into it. Yeah, science bitch.

At this point, you decide, I'm going to have let this monkey off my back.  This simian fucker just isn't cutting it. Walking like a hunch back, not being able to run, back ache, it's not worth it.  And you tell the monkey to shoo the fuck off. So, the monkey is gone and all's good right?  

Wrong!  it's a monkey for christ's sake.  If it were smart enough, you wouldn't have had to carry it at all. So you have to throw stones at it, pretend to beat it with a stick and tell it to fuck off like you mean it. In your grown up snarl.  

So then, with the monkey hopefully gone, you are back on the path.  But don't get too complacent.  That chimp might be following you and might sneak up on you when you let down your guard.  So for the next hundred miles or so, guard up bitches or you're going to have to carry that monkey again.  And it's not a one trick pony.  You'll have to try newer and better tricks to get rid of it next time.  It ain't falling for the same old sticks and stones.  So you're better off not letting it get the better of you.  

So there you are and the monkey has now finally given up and finally you're ready to run and sleep and do whatever you want.  

I don't know what you're going to end up doing after this, but you just got rid of the monkey, you're standing up straight and are free. So get out and enjoy.  

Like I said, If my observations are incorrect and I'm the only one who feels like this, you are obliged to tell me. If you did end up reading this obscenely long post that is.

Peace and cheers all around.

1352887349.0,51,self.BreakUps,136bf0,"20F: A year after being dumped, I fucking got over it. Completely.",53,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/136bf0/20f_a_year_after_being_dumped_i_fucking_got_over/,"I am a hopeless romantic, so bad that even before I tell someone I like them, I've already planned our lives together. Down to the silliest detail like where we'll live, where we'll work etc...

My last relationship lasted *only a month* and it took me a year to get over it but to anyone struggling with getting over a relationship here's what I learnt that helps.

1. Talk about it. Seriously. Even if it means writing it in a journal.
I have a notepad application on my laptop that I journal in pretty much everyday and I write everything: my feelings, little scenarios I play out in my head, memories we had, promises that were broken, etc.
Writing it down and seeing it on something physical makes the brain feel as though it no longer needs to store it in memory. It also helped tonnes with procressing what I was actually feeling.
1. Read through it. Once a month (ideally i should've done it probably once a week) I would read through everything I wrote and sort of see how my feelings progressed. I guess doing that made me realise this is a process. A long one. A very long one lol (being a year) but it helped.
1. Don't stay in contact. 
This is controversial, if you want to stay in contact okay do whatever works for you. But for me, out of sight and out of my life, made me realise they weren't coming back and after a while... That was okay.
1. I bumped into her a few times and everytime I did, I was surprised at how much I didn't care she was there. Why? Because I played out every possible scenario in my mind and written it down so when it actually happened I was a bit like ""Oh she's there? Oh, well that's shit, nothing like the grand gesture reunion I imagined"". I think the shattering of that hope kinda helped me with moving on. And every time I would realise she wasn't as amazing as I had made her out to be. (This was a very important lesson to learn.)
1.  Everytime I felt like the pain from missing her was crippling, I would go out on my bike and have a really long bike ride in the park. Usually between 30 minutes and an hour. And while riding I would ask myself ""What the fuck do I actually want out of life?"" Most of the time (in fact all of the time) my answer was ""I don't know."" After a few times it dawned on me that I had been planning to spend the rest of my life with this girl but actually, that's all they were, plans. And those plans have been scrapped but that's okay, I still have the rest of my life to live and I may not know what I want now, but I will figure it out soon enough. Also, the fresh air and the feeling of improving my fitness made me hopeful about the future. I don't really know why, it just did. Ha.
1. I forgave myself for everything I thought I did wrong. In my journal, I wrote a really long letter to her (that I was never going to send) in which I apologised for all the times I upset her, or made her angry or neglected her or didn't listen to her etc. Every moment that stood out, I apologised for. I put it down to being inexperienced with relationships and I wrote a little note at the bottom saying next time (without specifying the next time would be with her) that I would try to see things from the other person's point of view and not be so defensive. This helped me realise that relationships are a lot of work and just with anything in life, you have to practice it if you want to get better. I'm not perfect, and that's okay. I'm learning and willing to accept I was wrong sometimes. **It's really important to be open to learning.** Oh and also, after doing this, I realised that this literally is the best I could've done, apologising and accepting my share of the blame. If I could do this, and be willing to be open to change and she still wanted nothing to do with me, then fuck her. I did all I could, and if that's not enough for her, it obviously wasn't meant to be.
1. I binged on break up stories on /r/breakups. I think this was the biggest help. Reading through other break up stories made me realise that I wasn't alone in feeling this shit and actually, I'm glad to be independent and not still in love with someone. I'm glad that I have my life back and my existence *isn't* based on someone else and I'm the one offering advice instead of it being the other way around. It also made me realise that the relationship we had wasn't as perfect as I made it out to be. It was pretty shit to be honest.
1. I stayed away from other people and hookups during my healing process. I literally haven't had sex in over a year now. And I don't mind because looking back, I think taking a step back from it all really helped me break those stupid patterns I would get into of having sex and thinking they were the *one*. Plus during that time, I only met about 2 people i really liked anyway... Instead of me forcing myself on anyone who showed me the slightest bit of attention.
1. I created a playlist of all the most depressing love songs ever. And I would let them make me feel completely and utterly weak. Sometimes I would cry along to them. After a while it became a habit, everytime I was upset, I would know that listening to this playlist would make me feel better. So instead of spending hours and hours wondering what's wrong, what should I do to fix this, thinking about my ex, reminiscing about the times we had, in general being pathetic and reaching out to people who would inevitably let me down... I would just turn on the playlist, be depressed for like an hour, then get on with the rest of my day. (Sidenote: Lana Del Rey - Without You is now the most played song on my playlist ha.)
1. I learnt that relationships are between **two separate individuals**. I can't control what the other person does and I can't make them want what I want. If they don't want this relationship, then I can't force it on them. That's not going to work. It's better to find someone who actually *does* what to be with me. That's half the battle already won in my book.
1. Finally, I read tonnes of scientific articles on the science behind love. scienceofrelationships.com was my favourite website during this time. I guess it helped understanding what was actually going on when I was in the relationship and not just what I *thought* was going on. And they give tonnes of advice which is always good.

I know that this is a really long message but I hope that some of it will be of help to some people. Break ups are hard, really hard. Know that you are not alone and that eventually, **you will get through this**, you just have to want to first.

Honestly, the greatest hope I ever had since I fell in love with her 2+ years ago was that she continue to be happy and if, for whatever reason, that wasn't happening, she try to find happiness elsewhere.

In my heart, I know that it was the right decision. Love doesn't mean control...love sometimes means letting go for the ultimate happiness of the other person. ...and without any expectations. 

Part of my heart will always be with her, as she really is, was, and will continue to be, the most important person I've ever met in my life. I tortured myself with horrible thoughts for months, but all of that has fallen away in place of true peace of mind that now she will be free to pursue whatever it is she's trying to find. I don't pretend to understand everything that happened. I never will. I also don't pretend that it's not painful for me...it is...very. And I have a long road ahead of me to work on myself. 

What I DO know is that we met for a reason, and for whatever lesson I am supposed to learn. I don't know exactly what that is, and losing love is a hard way to learn anything, but I know in time it will become more clear. 

So my heart goes out to all those who are feeling pain and heartbreak right now. Sometimes that best thing you can do is let go and hope the best for the other person, even when you're suffering. In my mind, that's true love.

Recently I've found myself wanting to post more and more and just share with others here who may be in a similar situation as to how I feel.

I was broken up with (22m) by my ex (21f) at the beginning of December, 2012. I didn't see it coming at all. Around me in my life I saw couples breaking up and I was one of those guys who thought it would never happen to me. I honestly felt the relationship I was in was one of the most healthy and exciting ones out of all my friends. It hit me like a fucking truck. I couldn't begin to fathom in my head how this person which I thought so much of could do this to me. She stated that she had started feeling emotional feelings for someone else who she hadn't been in contact with for a long time and that if she could feel these feelings that she wasn't in love with me anymore. She told me she loved me as a friend, in a platonic way, not as a partner. I was told that in the last 2/3 months of our relationship she had been looking at me more and more as a friend and the spark for her had died. For the first month or so I did everything that everyone here will tell you not to do. I text her and called her. I begged her to see me. I got angry with her. I asked for my stuff back. I even asked her mother who I was very close to to help me. Nothing worked. She was cold and unresponsive to me and told me she had moved on and I should do. In my head I couldn't figure out how this person who had been so good to me, so loving and caring, could go from thinking so much of me to not thinking of me at all. This person who was my best friend and my lover, who I honestly wanted to spend all my time with, could just disappear. She started seeing the new guy a week or so after we had broken up. It killed me. This guy who had been completely out of her life for near enough a year was back in her life. I remember still being her friend on Facebook and seeing him getting added to her page. It was hard. It was really hard to deal with.

Towards the end of January I came to the realisation that the person that I wanted to have a relationship with and spend all my time with didn't want to have that with me anymore. It was hard to actually tell myself that and let it go, but I've been doing that ever since. I decided to apply for a visa to Australia and go travelling. On the 3rd of March I boarded the plane and I've been left for a week now. It's hard being out here on my own, especially because not only do I miss my friends from home, but I miss her too. I miss the effortless conversation and how easy our relationship was. The simple things in our routine which was effortless but so enjoyable. Catching up on episodes of 'The Walking Dead' and taking drives home in the car. The way she would laugh and the dimples in her cheeks when she smiled. I could fill pages of what I miss about my best friend and the relationship, but I already have in my journal. Despite the shitty breakup and feeling replaced almost immediately by someone else, I really miss the person that I knew and treasured. It's super hard coming to terms with not having that person in my life anymore. It has been three months and there are days where I forget that we've broken up and I click my phone on and expect your text but it's not there. I look at how good we were and the little problems we had and I just view it all as such a shame that we didn't communicate what few issues we had. We've said our goodbyes to one another and it is hard letting go of you and what you meant to me. I know you'll never be part of my life again and it's upsetting but it is the only way it can be.

Trying to forget someone you love is like trying to remember someone you never knew. That's the reality of this. I can't forget you. I try to. I try to forget you ever existed and pretend I don't miss you. I try to focus on how horrific this breakup left me feeling and how low it got me. I do think about that, but I still miss you. I miss my best friend. I'm 11000 miles away and having a great time but in the mornings and the evenings, when I'm on my own and all is quiet, I'd just like to speak to you like we'd speak six months ago. Each day is hard. It's the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I can't lie and say I've had a day go by since the breakup go by in which I haven't thought about you. We made a promise to never become strangers in one another's lives. I know that won't happen to me because you were the person I knew so well.

For everyone else going through a breakup, don't be too hard on yourself. I was really, really hard on myself for 2/3 months. I was filled with regrets. I had constant thoughts of 'Well if I did that, if I did this, then we'd still be together'. I'll never know if I did do those things then maybe it could be different but you can't live your life on what ifs, you'll drive yourself mad. I couldn't understand what more I could have done to be a better boyfriend. I didn't know what this guy who hadn't been in her life for a year or so offered her that I couldn't. I never will know, we have said our goodbyes and she has moved on. I know in my heart that I was honest and loyal and I truly loved that person as much as I could. Making them happy made me happy and in that selfless act I enjoyed being me. I'll enjoy being me on my own again at some point, I know I was capable of being happy on my own before my relationship, because I was! If you had a long-term relationship with someone, it's going to be hard missing your best friend, but you'll make another one eventually. Just hold on out through that ride and try to be happy with yourself.

This post has been a bit of a mess in the format and how it has panned out but I just wanted to get some thoughts out, in particular to other people. I moved to the other side of the world and I know how it feels to be lonely, sometimes you find solace in reading that there are others in similar situations and how they're coping, and if they're not coping, that people can help them.

Please feel free to comment, add.  Hang in there.  Thanks.

#1- Stay Busy- Idle time is the most dangerous.  Whatever you do, school, work, whatever, concentrate on doing it the best you can.  Take extra shifts, study groups, etc.  Take up a hobby.  Be productive and creative.  Don't get stuck with nothing to do.  This can mitigate the initial shock and get you through the first days or weeks until you can slow down and think a little clearer.  Sometimes one's best work can be completed under severe duress.  

#2- Stay Healthy- I know it's absolutely impossible to eat or sleep normally, but taking care of yourself is essential.  If you can't eat, get protein shakes or liquid meals to at least get calories in you.  Cook easy to eat healthy meals you can throw in the fridge or freeze for later.  As soon as you're able, get active.  It can be tough to start, but soon you'll be able to turn your pain into motivation.  This can be a huge building block in what seems like the arduous task feeling good about yourself again.  

#3- Keep your pride intact- Though you're emotional, think before you do or say anything questionable.  Don't act out of spite and don't do anything you may regret later.  I'm sure there's a million things you want to say to them or want them to know, but if it's over, have the self-respect to accept the situation and move your focus immediately to yourself.  Get a haircut, stay clean and groomed.  Buy yourself a nice jacket or pair of jeans.  While you may feel like death on the inside, keeping up with the way you present yourself to the world can again be a small step in building back your self esteem.  

#4- Clean house- Take down the pictures, get rid of her clothes, etc...This can be one of the excruciating parts, but it's essential to do as soon as you're able.  Save what you may want to do decide on later down the line, but at least get it out of your everyday field of vision.  Clean your phone and computer pics out, take an afternoon to clean up your Facebook.  If it's absolutely too painful, do a full backup then just delete all your pics so you can start over and go back and sort them later when you're more able to handle it.  Whatever you do, DON'T CREEP OR STALK ONLINE.  It only hurts you.  She'll never know, never care, and it's the equivalent of licking a sharp knife over and over.  DON'T DO IT.  If it's too tempting, just lay off the social media for a while.  It is possible.  Trust me on this one.  

#5- Fake it 'til you make it- It sounds so cliche, but this approach can work wonders.  I'm not saying you need to throw parties or anything, but start with the little things.  Smile and say thank you at the store.  Do something nice for somebody.  Do some volunteer or charity work.  Yes, your pain is real, but it can always help to see how it relates to your role in the world at large.  Don't be negative just because it's easy, accept the challenge to smile and project warmth at a single stranger and see where it can go from there.

",56,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/n2h70/may_i_help_you_what_i_have_learned_through_time/,"To the many of you who come here for support,

It's quite depressing but truthful, that most stories and posts here are all about people during their struggles. Unfortunately, when these people become happy again, they no longer feel the need to request or post for support, leaving the subreddit with nothing but sad stories.


I am in my mid twenties, and roughly 5 months ago, I lost a person that I've held closer to my heart than anyone in my life. Heartbreak is just like any other significant life change, hard. It's a two step process, and I want to help you all. This is all advice you've most likely heard, but please let me break it down from another perspective.

The two step process

1)The emotional wounds : The utter chaos of emotions that flutter through your mind as your ""heart"" is denying the acceptance of what's happened.

2) The ego bruise : Denying the fact that there are/were personality traits and flaws in your being that you can either choose to fix, or live on with.
Most people, typically males, tend to deal with number 2 first, and bury 1 deep down. This isn't advised, the emotional wound WILL pop it's ugly head eventually, I promise. No rebound, no other fill can fix this void.
The two step healing process.

1) Take the time to mourn. Cry, cry some more, and talk to friends. I've found that actually trying to make myself sad helped (listening to old songs, old pictures, looking at old love letters). Once you're done mourning, throw the shit away, it's meaningless now.

2) The fun part -rebuilding yourself. There are so many people in the world who ask ""Who am I? What am I about? What are my intuitions?"" These are all common questions everyone asks, but for some reason people dread this process. Why? It's so fun! Discovering yourself! This will determine who you are as a person, use it wisely and have fun!

**“It is what a man thinks of himself that really determines his fate.”** -Henry David Thoreau

To forget and dismiss the time you spent with someone is foolish. Use it to your advantage. Remember and smile. Have no regrets.
You are now on a search for a soul, except this isn't your soulmate, this is your soul.

Believe me, it will just happen one day, when you least expect it: Like dropping a quarter on the ground, and seeing the sock under your dresser that you've been looking for for months.
I know this was long, but believe me, if I of all people can come out, you can.

Since my search:

I've have the dream body I've dreamed about for years (complete with six pack)

I'm incredibly healthy, and loving it! I'm so energetic and my brain feels fantastic.

I'm very clean and organised, (never was), but now I have borderline OCD. :D

I've nailed a good job in a new city

My style has been amped up and I look good and feel good. I've also explored countless new styles of music, food, and culture.

I starting reading and educating myself more (This one is HUGE)

Oh, and I forgot the amount of potential tail is out there.

Do you like the things I've mentioned? Me too! This is me showing you that when you start at square one again, you now have a **BRAND NEW acre of land to play with. PLANT WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE!**

1362007277.0,45,self.BreakUps,19cxv8,The story of how I found myself the last 3 years,51,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/19cxv8/the_story_of_how_i_found_myself_the_last_3_years/,"This is a long story, but I hope that it can help someone (anyone) who is down there in the dark. Let me say now that this story actually has a happy ending. 

To start, we will have to go back a few years. I was 20, and I was just about to move in with my girlfriend. Or rather, she was moving in with me. We had been together for 3,5 years by now, and I felt things were going great. 

When we first met, we lived far away from each other (2 hours drive) and we were both 17. Our relationship had had a small crisis when she wasn't sure what to do with her life after high school (or rather, the Swedish equivalent) but we pulled through, she got into the university in the city where I lived, and we decided to move in together. Things were going great, at least I thought they were. She didn't know many people here, so I tried my best to bring her with me, let her meet new people, but I will admit I was relieved when she started her first year at the university and started making her own friends. I even encouraged her to be there more than she was, so that she could get to know people. After a while she did make some new friends. At the time I was doing an IFR rating in Norway (I am a Helicopter Pilot, and my job was paying for this really useful course, an offer I could not decline) so I spent most weekdays away during a period. During the weekends there were a lot of University parties, so she was away on them. 

After some time I felt we weren't seeing each other as much as I would have liked, so I asked if it was possible to go there with her, but she said they only allowed students. Well, fair enough I thought to myself, and hung out with my friends instead. One day, right before I am going away, she asks me if she can borrow my car while I'm away. She and this guy Eric from her university have been tasked to buy beer and whine for the next party, and in Sweden (for some stupid reason) you are only allowed to by alcohol in special stores, sparsely placed in the city. No problems with me, so I give her the carkey and tell her that I think it's good that she makes her own friends. 

When I get back the apartment is a mess. I can tell that clearly someone has been there, (strange smell in the apartment) and when I ask she first tries to avoid the questions, but then admits that she had been lonely so she has had some friends over when I was away. Well, that was fine by me. She tells me that this guy Eric, her friend Anna and her Boyfriend had been over one night. She says that she felt bad about bringing people over to my place when I am away, but I try to tell her that it's OUR place now. 

A few weeks pass, and one sunday morning her sister calls. She has broken up with her boyfriend. I had planed to go away for the day with a few friends of mine for a long time. When I got back that evening my girlfriend tells me about her talk to her sister. Apparently she had broken up with her boyfriend because she felt that they were more friends than lovers. And she felt that she didn't have time for a serious relationship where she is in life right now. She wanted to be able to focus on her studies, and live the student life. 

And then my girlfriend drops the bomb on me. She felt the same way about us. She says that she will start looking for a place of her own tomorrow. The next day she comes back from school and tells me she found an apartment. I found this very odd, since most people here spend years in line for apartments, and she got one by just walking into their office? She tells me that she has actually held a spot in the line for the last 5 years, and that this gave her the apartment. I remember that I had also been in line for a rental apartment for many years, even though I bought one when got my job. So I believe her. 

We keep seeing each other for some time, but for each time she get's more and more distant. After a while I tell her that I can't do this. I don't want to break up with her, I want us to be together. I can live with us not living together, maybe that's even for the best right now. But I can't not be her boyfriend, and still see her, knowing that she might just as well see someone else when I'm not around. 

She tells me that's not going to happen, and that we should probablt walk out of each others lives if that is the case. 

So we go our separate ways. 

A few weeks later, I found out that she is dating this guy named Eric now. Another few days later and they are officially in a relationship. I start to put two and two together and after by chance talking to one of their classmates, I found out that they had been dating since their classes started earlier that year. While she was still my girlfriend. 

I cannot begin to explain how devastated I was. I would have done pretty much anything for her, and I would have trusted her with my life. And now I find out that she has been cheating with someone else. Not only that, she has even talked to me about him, and had him over for dinner when I was away. I was just too stupid/blind/trusting to realize what was actually going on. 

The following 6 months were a haze. I spent more time drunk than I should have (not in any way so that it became a problem, but still more than one should.) My boss even told me to take some time off, as he felt I was only a ghost of who I used to be. 

When summer came I was still devastated. Some friends managed to talk me into going to berlin with them, and going on a festival with them. It was all kind of fun, but most of the time I keept thinking of my ex girlfriend. And this was 9 months after we broke up. 

But then. Nearly a year after we had broken up, when I was at one of my lowpoints in my life, my friend invited her friend over. An amazing girl. Always happy, with an amazing smile. She could quote all scenes from Pulp Fiction, while my ex girlfriend just thought that Pult Fiction was needlessly violent. This woman was the first person who managed to actually make me happy since my ex girlfriend moved out. I was pretty much in love again. 

After seeing her a few times, I told her that I thought she was amazing, and that she was the first one who made me feel the way I did in a long time. She told me that she was seeing someone, and that while she liked me, she would probably not date me anytime soon. 

Well, it was a bit disheartening, but at least she was honest, and in a nice way too. 

But this was when I realized that this girl had many qualities that I wanted in a future girlfriend. Many of which my ex girlfriend didn't have. 

And then I meet yet another friend of a friend, who is really nice. And I realize that while these ones may not be it, I will love again. 

And I start looking at people in another way. Instead of comparing them to my ex girlfriend (who had been idolized by me the last year) I start thinking about good traits. And I start compiling them. And I realize that many of them had one trait, that my ex girlfriend lacked. And it was the ability to inspire me. To make me feel like doing something I've never done before. Try something I've never tried before. The girl who quoted Pulp Fiction (one of my best friends today) took me to the opera, and we had a great time. Another one got me to start painting again, which I hadn't done in years. 

I started traveling. I went to Kenya, Mexico, Japan, France, Germany and many more places. I even started wokring out again. And not to look good, but because I thought it was fun to go with new friends. 

And then it dawned upon me, that I had changed quite a lot. I realized that when she broke up with me, she left me a broken man, deep down inside of a vary black hole. And that person she left down there would never be able to get up. The only way for me to get back up was to become someone new. Someone better. 

And I was better. I had more friends than ever before. People found me to be a very friendly and kind person in touch with himself and his feelings. 

And now i stand here, 3 years later. In better shape than ever before. Happier than ever before. A better person than ever before. Looking back at who I was at the time, I can really see why she would break up with me, because the person I was was really crappy standing next to the person I had become. 

Still, I could never really shake the feeling that she broke up in a very bad way.  

Until a few days ago.

A ran into her. She looked kind of sad. And weary. And a lot fatter actually. Her face looked tired and her clothes were worn. I didn't talk to her, but she was carrying a bag from from the unemployment office. 

And I pitied her. And deep down inside, I also felt that some justice had prevailed. While I stil care a lot for her, and would help her out if she ever called, I found it very ironic that last time we spoke I was on the lowest point of my life, all thanks to her, and her shitty way of breaking up, and now I am at the highest, and she seem to have been going only downhill ever since. 


Well... It may be a stupid story, but I felt like telling it to someone. As they say, after rain comes sunshine. 

Or as I like to say. Experience is damn tedious to get, but you're happy to have it once it's there. 

And today I am pretty damn glad she did what she did. It broke me. It forced me to start over. If forced me to become what I am today. 

And if anyone actually made it this far into my ramblings, if there is anything to remember from this, it is that the most painful experiences are often times the most rewarding ones.

It's like counting a baby's age in months after the first year. Reverse math, I hate it. Nine weeks. An epicly long time. Especially when we were together for a million years. Or maybe five minutes, I'm never quite sure.

You know the story. You met, you fell in love, they were perfect. A perfect fit, an ideal romance. Friends look on in envy and say how good you are together. You smile to yourself when you think about them. Some days you just miss them so much you feel like your heart might explode before you get to tell them, and they're only sat across the room from you. The touch, the smell, the warmth of their arms. Perfect.

All relationships end. Every single one. Some get the timing right, and make it right to the finish line together. 

But usually something dies.

Sometimes the love, sometimes the person. It happens. Life goes on.

I've said this before, There are no stories of the snivelling princess, feeling sorry for herself and languishing in pain, ever getting the guy. Make them regret having ever let you go, by becoming amazing. If you ever have to cross paths, make sure you look stunning. Make them drool, make then crawl, and make them wish they'd never let you go. You'll feel better about yourself, and in the end you'll realise that you deserved better.
""I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself""

I have lived through the demise of seven relationships. Seven men I have dated have caused my life to come to a crashing halt. 

The first was a jerk. Sometimes I look back and think how I almost married him. Other times I remember how he stayed out all night so I poured his beer down the sink. 

2 years, 11 months, 14 days.

The second was a jerk. I spent the best part of a week and the last of my wages texting him lyrics to November Rain. He lived with his ex, and claimed he slept on the sofa. I only saw him when work brought him over the bridge, and he came for christmas dinner at my parents house. He was half way between mine and my parent's age. 

3 months, 2 weeks, 5 days.

The third? A jerk. So fond of his weed and red bull he couldn't get it up. He used to do donuts in the car park outside my work and get me in trouble with the managers. Due to a conflict at home I moved in. Lived out of his bedroom. Told his mum about how he'd proposed to me on the first date. Suddenly it was time to move out again. 

6 months, 7 days.

You know where this is going now. Four and five were close together, almost overlapping. Traded one for the other in a rush decision after saying the L word too soon and scaring number four away. Four was tall, made me feel like a tiny princess. Climb in his pocket, hide from the world. Like being hugged by a tree. 

3months, 4 days.

I cried when Five would bring me home. Insecure me felt he'd go and never come back, and aftermath of the actions of Four. Got to a point where I lived in his room more often than not. He complained when I wouldn't clean up after his dad's new puppy, and made me do his college homework. When he said it was over I smashed his easter bunny. Jerk.

5 months, 2 weeks, 1 day.

That brings us to Six. He was a stupid jerk. I tied his foot to the bed and then mercilessly tickled it until he cried for help. He brought candles into the bedroom and left me with miniature burns all over my skin. Hiatus whilst he spent a year in canada. He came back in no time at all after falling in love with the girl who would sleep with all of canada but not him.

4 months, 1 week, 1 day.

Number seven. 



1 year, 10 months, 6 days. 

They all have two things in common now. They are all past tense, and they are all human. Not one sits on a pedestal made of gold, no single guy will be perched atop my world on a peak I could never hope to reach. I loved each and every one of them with all my heart and to the best of my ability, completely and forever. They were perfect, once, and in time they became human again. 

It's easy to forget the bad times, and romanticise about the good. Paint a pretty picture of them, as perfect as driven snow, but only if you're prepared to make footprints. Whoever they were and however long you were together, they did, at the very least once, act like a jerk. You did too, nobody's perfect. They see you as you should see them, flaws and all. 


Two steps to self preservation. Make yourself awesome, and see them as human. Be amazing. A great motivation for taking care of yourself is the offhand and cool approach of “don't you wish you still had this?”. If you're going to see them, dress awesomely. Even if you're not, dress as if you might. No hanging your head and crying. Hold your head up high, and if you need to, believe that it's the best way to get them back. Show them what they let go of. Make them regret ever letting go of you and force them to observe as you glide with supreme awesomeness. 


And the being human part. That's the most important thing you can do to survive. Every time you get misty thinking back with those rose coloured glasses, stop just for a moment. Don't forget the good times, but don't forget the bad ones either. Each and every man that has been in my life became a list of good and bad things. I made a point to not forget. Write it down if you have to, paint a picture. It doesn't matter how you do it, just remember that they are not perfect. Make a list. Use it to build your defences around your heart. Protect yourself from the hurt that once was there. In time the hurt will fade, and you won't need to remember the reasons any more. But never forget. At least once, they were a jerk.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_xujyh,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/xujyh/surviving_a_breakup/,

This community was a great help to me in getting over him.

-----

Hey A.

The funny thing about what's happening right now is that it's exactly what I wanted. In my depression after you dumped me, I had those angry moments where I entertained fantasies of you begging for me back only so I could coldly deny you, so I could break your heart as totally as you broke mine. I wanted you to pine for me, to feel the pain of unrequited feelings. 

Most of all, I just wanted you to feel something.

But now that it's actually happening (to a somewhat less extreme degree), I don't feel any of the sadistic joy I was envisioning. Instead I feel bad for you, nostalgic for what we had, and pissed off at what you've put me through.

When you tell me now that you ""know how I felt"" back then, I want to laugh. I cried nearly every day for two weeks when you dumped me. It triggered an existential crisis that made me feel like my soul was ripped away from all connection to those around me. I didn't sleep or eat normally for weeks. It was the most difficult thing I've been through in *my entire life*, worse than the death of my grandfather. And now you're bored and regretting it because things didn't work out with the girl you were after. The girl you essentially dumped me for. Are you fucking kidding me?

I should've seen this coming, because you've always been an indecisive guy. I can barely even stand to go grocery shopping with you because of how slow you are at making such simple decisions. Little did I know that this trait was broad enough to apply to our entire relationship! You say you ""don't remember"" why you were so unhappy in the relationship? Well I do. I remember everything you told me, every criticism, every knife in my chest.

You told me that I didn't go out enough, that I was too dependent on you socially, that I was too complacent with my lot in life. That I wasn't adventurous or outgoing enough for you. You even criticized my musicianship and the way I dress. The truth is that I was borderline depressed, at least in part due to the way you treated me. And your reaction to my sadness was to criticize me for the very things I was trying to change in my life. Instead of supporting me and helping me move forward, you got angry at me and made me feel a hundred times worse.

And now you've seen where I've gotten. New job, new city, new friends, new life. Pursuing my goals with all I've got. Feeling wonderful and living life to the fullest. Dating a new guy, but keeping it fun and casual, avoiding the mistake we made of getting too serious too soon. I created this situation for myself out of utter desperation, trying to climb out of the pit you threw me down. I guess I can't be mad -- why wouldn't you want me back? I've proven you wrong on all fronts. But I can't be with someone whose love is conditional, someone who only wants me when I'm on top of life. Because I know there will be times when I'm sad again, times when I'll look to others to help dig me out, and you have proven that you can't handle that. 

Honestly, I want to thank you. Dumping me was the biggest favor you ever could've given me. Not because I don't think you're a great guy -- you are my friend and I still care about you. But when you broke up with me, it gave me the jump-start I needed to get out there and kick life's ass. My hope is that by rejecting your attempts to get me back, I can catalyze a positive change in your life as well.

He has never had any luck with women so to speak. But today we were talking, and after I told him how I'd given her my entire heart and soul, he gave me a little wisdom. The conversation went something like this;


Me: ""I gave her everything. I loved her like I've never loved anyone, and she just stopped being interested.""

Uncle: ""Well, what do you want?""

Me: ""Want? I want her; I love her!""

Uncle: ""That's all well and good, and very noble and that. But that's not what I'm talking about. What I mean is; what do YOU want?""

Me: ""I don't want anything but her. She's everything to me.""

Uncle: ""Well there's your problem then, isn't it? That's why you can't get over the fact that she left you. You need something to focus on, to work towards. Its always seemed to me that the men who get somewhere with women are the ones who don't make them the focus of their life, but who work out what they want, then work out how to fit them INTO their life""

Me: ""...""

Uncle: ""I'm not saying you'll get her back once you sort yourself out, maybe you won't. But if she sees you making a real man out of yourself and not moping over her, maybe she'll think about it again. And make no mistake; women ALWAYS see, even when you cant see them watching. But even if things don't ever come back around the way that you want them, you'll probably realise that you're okay before long. That what you throw yourself into will fill that void inside you until you're ready to find someone new.""


He gave me a lot to think about. I think he gets his wisdom from the books he reads cause as I mentioned before; he's a total idiot with women. He might actually intentionally fuck things up just to see how much he can take. 

So for all of you out there who are like me and put them before yourselves; who worried more about making sure that they understood that you loved them more than anything rather than keeping your life on track; who let them get whatever they wanted instead of catering to your own needs; listen to my uncle. I think he might just have something there.

Checking their facebook, knowing what they're up to, texting them, yelling at them, asking for an explanation, crying, begging for them to take you back. It's almost torture but you can't help it. 

The truth is, you may never know the REAL reason as to why they left you. Most likely, they will not be honest about it. Trying to figure it out, replaying the conversation in your head and trying to read every detail of their words will not change anything. It's a waste of your precious time and energy. 

There was a life before this person, and there will be a life after them. Do not bear weight on your feet. Do not let it drag you down.

Deal with your emotions, cry, scream, write them down, do whatever it takes to FEEL what you feel inside. You will notice as time goes on, the sad feelings, the hurt, the anger, will slowly subside.

Work out, read, take a new hobby, run when you feel upset, volunteer (it's impossible to feel bad about yourself when you help others.... seriously). This is YOUR life. YOU control it. You are much stronger than you think you are. You call the shots.

We're supposed to celebrate how this lady destroyed her husband's life because she essentially got bored? What about the husband who truly loved his wife and was willing to go to the ends of the earth for her? Just collateral damage in a heartwarming story about one person's crusade to ""find herself"".

I hate how pop culture celebrates divorce and salacious gossip. We never see movies about a tortured couple, setting aside their selfishness to make a relationship work.

Marriage and relationships are about cooperation. They're about sacrifice. There isn't a single marriage on earth where both partners just happened to be absolutely, 100% perfect for each other and 100% happy all the fucking time.

That means Facebook, Twitter, Instagram...even Words with Friends. During my ongoing fight nothing set me back more than seeing pictures of her. I attempted to block her from my news feed at first, but that wasn't enough for me. I still went on her page, and I'd go on her friends page where I'd see pictures of her smiling, drinking, partying, and having a good time. This just enhanced my misery, and really hurt my recovery. You may tell yourself, ""But I'd still like to be friends,"" or ""I just won't look at her profile."" If that's the case, you can re-add them later on once you are fully healed. Even though I'm over her, it would still upset and hurt me to look at her profile, and not having the ability or temptation is a great thing. Also delete all of his or her friends and family. If you have mutual friends that can't be avoided, but maybe block them from your news feed as well so that if you do see them or talk to them, you won't have to worry about seeing your ex.

**Hit the gym:** 
This is what you'll read on countless other threads, and it works. Maybe you can't afford a gym or truly loath it? That's fine, but find some way to physically work out your emotions or agression. Whenever I got a text from her, or she was on my mind I'd throw on some headphones and go for a bicycle ride. This helped tremendously by taking my mind off of her, and giving me something to do.

**Friends and family:**
Friends and family can be the glue that hold you together if you let them. Some of you may not have any friends in town that you can go to, but consider those that are also far away. Right now I literally have no friends in town, but two of my best friends I talk to/text every day and they have really helped me through the process. Be willing to tell your friends or family. And if you truly have no one to turn to, then turn to /r/breakups. We are a family because we are all in this together.

**Anti-depressants/Therapy**
Anti-depressants were made for a reason, and there is a reason why therapists have a job. I'm not saying that either or is for everyone. I tried killing myself after my breakup [obviously my lowest point] but I didn't want to go on anti-depressants so I saw a therapist who I stopped going to last week. Having someone who is unbiased listen to me and talk through my problems helped immensely. Not that I didn't have friends to go to, but it's nice having someone who is solely concerned with helping you to get better, and to improve. 

**The next one will be better:**
This is what a few of my friends have told me. It's easy to think that you've found the one, or you'll never find someone as amazing as your ex again. But you will. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, but you have to be willing to accept it's there. If you focus on your past and your ex, you'll never be able to move forward into the future. You deserve to be loved, and you'll find someone who loves you and treats you the way you deserve to be treated in the future. 

**/r/breakups won't answer everything:**
Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing subreddit and there are some of the sweetest, kindest, intelligent, and honest people out there. We're all going through the same thing, and it helps being able to talk to who can empathize with you. That being said, even if you read all of /r/breakups, you won't find some overreaching truth, or the answers for why your relationship has ended. There are a myriad number of reasons why relationships don't work, so don't waste your time trying to find every reason because you'll never be able to have a definitive answer to all of your questions. 

**Take up a hobby/job:**
It's easy to become paralyzed and not move forward. Dwelling and sitting in your room won't help you to become a better person, and it won't take your mind off of the breakup. Delve into something you've always wanted to do, or maybe something that you enjoyed doing but you've since stopped. In addition, maybe put more effort into work if you haven't been. Doing a goof job at something is satisfying, and it will help you to realize that you are a strong person, and that you can accomplish anything with the right attitude and effort. 

**No contact:**
There aren't one more amount of words, one more amount of actions, ro one more amount of apologies that will magically fix your relationship with your ex and cause them to want you back. Closure is an enticing idea, but it doesn't truly exist. We just have to push some things out of our mind, and turn them into memories. You may think you're doing great after a few weeks of not talking to them, but I hadn't talked to her in quite a while and just seeing her text and responding really threw me for a loop. If you need to rant or someone to talk to, come to /r/breakups. We're here, and we support you. 

From the bottom of my heart **thank you** /r/breakups. You are an amazing community, and I will always love and cherish you. ",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_12q595,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/12q595/goodbye_rbreakups_heres_my_advice/,

When I first came to you I was in shambles, and slowly but surely, I have recovered to a point where I don't need you anymore.  

I'll leave you with an epiphany I had a few weeks ago that gives me a lot of hope. Do not give up on love, because love is real. It's common, even: think about how completely you loved your partner while you were together; think about how you would have done absolutely anything for them. That is love, and you've felt it, so you know it is real. What is rare is finding someone who will return that same absolute devotion to you.  

When the relationship ended, they showed you that they weren't capable of returning that love to you. This isn't even something they can control, necessarily -- you weren't right for one another, just as there are millions out there who aren't right for you and who you wouldn't be able to make it with.

But never forget that complete and total love you felt for them. Remember that always, because one day someone will love you the same way.

If he doesn't want you, nothing can make him stay. Stop making excuses for a man and his behavior. Allow your intuition or spirit to save you from heartache. Stop trying to change yourself for a relationship that's not meant to be. Slower is better.

Never live your life for a man before you find what makes you truly happy. If a relationship ends because the man was not treating you as you deserve, heck no, you can't ''be friends ''. A friend wouldn't mistreat a friend. Don't settle.

If you feel like he is stringing you along, then he probably is. Don't stay because you think it will get better. You'll be mad at yourself a year later for stayingwhen things are not better. The only person you can control in a relationship is you. Always have your own set of friends separate from his. Maintain boundaries in how a guy treats you. If something bothers you, speak up. Never let a man know everything. He will use it against you later. You cannot change a man's behavior. Change comes from within. Don't ever make him feel he is moreimportant than you are.. even if he has more education, or is in a better job. Do not make him into a quasi-god. He is a man, nothing more nothing less. Never let a man define who you are. Never borrow someone else's man. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you.

A man will only treat you the way you allow him to treat you. All men are not dogs. You should not be the only one doing allthe bending.. compromise is a two way street. You need time to heal between relationships.. there is nothing cute about baggage.

Deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship. You should never look for someone to complete you.. a relationship consists of two whole individuals. Look forsomeone complimentary, not supplementary. Dating is fun.. even if he of two doesn't turn out to Mr. Right. Make him miss you sometimes.. when a man always know where you are, and you're always readily available to him. He takes it forgranted. Never move into his mother's house, never co-sign for a man. Don't fully commit to a man who doesn't give you everything you need. Keep him in your radar but get to know others.

1369174195.0,40,self.BreakUps,1eskj6,Don't check in on your ex,45,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1eskj6/dont_check_in_on_your_ex/,"About three weeks ago, my fiance left me for a much older man who was the president of the BDSM club she was visiting behind my back. I went through all the normal stages of a break-up, and now I'm back to being functional and well on my way to healing.

But last night I made a huge mistake. I checked her fetlife profile (it's a social media site for kinksters and fetishists), and there were an abundance of pictures with her new guy. I am so angry for a couple of reasons. Number 1, I loved her until the very end. The affair had been going for a while, and she was basically dating him at the end. It's so upsetting to me that I'm the devastated one, and that she's already got another guy lined up. I loved her so much, moving on so quickly is a huge insult to me, and just emphasizes how little I meant to her at the end. 

Number 2, checking in just brings pain. When two people go from being soulmates and lovers and completely devoted (or at least I did, I can't speak for her) to just being friends, it only hurts. That's why I severed contact. I want anything to do with her until I can think about her without feeling ill. I knew as I was logging on to the website that it would just upset me, and I was right. The instant I saw her profile and saw what she had posted, I felt like vomiting all over again. I installed a router block on the site and set a random password so I can never go back. I knew it was a bad idea to check, and I was right.

Checking in on your ex after you've set a strict no contact policy is a very bad idea. The relationship is over, and prolonging your misery by following your ex doesn't help you heal, and invades his or her privacy. As painful as it might be, it's time to move on.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1369176336.0,,,True,t3_1eskj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1eskj6/dont_check_in_on_your_ex/,

1319048441.0,40,self.BreakUps,lhqph,"If you're suffering, maybe you can learn from my mistakes.",50,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/lhqph/if_youre_suffering_maybe_you_can_learn_from_my/,"A while back, my fiancee (24F), whom I (25M) had been with for almost 6 years, ended our relationship.  A quick summary:  there was another man involved.

I browsed /breakups, I read the advice.  Then I did just about everything wrong.  I'll just get right down to it:

DO NOT do the following:

1.  Have unnecessary contact with your ex.  Seriously.  Looking back, this delayed my healing process immensely.  I saw posts here advocating this, and yet I maintained hope that my relationship with my ex was special, that I could never live life without her.  We went so far as to continue a sexual relationship - after each contact, I was back at square 1.  Point is, no matter how insanely hard it might seem, if you truly want the pain to end as quickly as possible, cease all contact.  

2.  Hit the bottle.  I did this.  Hard.  It doesn't help anything, take it from me.  The last thing you want to have to deal with is alcohol dependency.  Find something else to take your mind off things.

3.  Fail to eat.  Some of us lose our appetite upon having our worlds turned upside down.  I lost 40 lbs in three months.  Treat your body right, or you will regret it in the long run.  Force yourself to down a Kashi bar, or eat a bowl of cereal.  Something, anything.  I found myself almost completely drained from day to day, unable to do much of anything, simply because I was literally starving.  Lying in bed and having nothing to do except ruminate about my ex was about as helpful as getting my face stuck in a bear trap.

4.  Rebound.  I tried everything to take my mind off my ex.  I decided to utilize the ""fuck everything that moves"" strategy to help boost my self esteem and to give me something else to concentrate on.  In my case, it didn't work.  Every foray left me feeling confused and lonely, unable to connect to some truly great people.  It made me feel like villain and truth be told, I rather was.  I hurt people, and rationalized it as a necessary survival strategy.  Take time to yourself.  Figure out what makes you happy, without your ex.  Things I greatly enjoyed got lost simply because of my association with her, but in retrospect the human capacity for enjoyment is enormous.  You can and will find things you truly love that you don't associate with your ex.  

5.  Blame yourself.  This might be the most important thing.  Try as hard as you can to avoid blaming yourself, questioning your actions, or second-guessing the reasons behind the breakup.  As hard as I know it sounds, understand that it is over, and that the reasons behind it are not important to your recovery.  Don't spend sleepless nights wondering how you messed up.  

6.  Don't dwell on the good times.  The little secrets, quirks of personality.  What helped me to eventually overcome this was to realize that everyone has quirks, and that whatever SO you find yourself with down the road will have just as many endearing traits, and that you will build memories with them just as easily as you did with your ex.  Knock them off that goddamned pedestal, because it's neither real nor unique.  I refused to believe this at first and looking back, I sincerely wish I'd have tried so much harder to focus on the things that I knew were wrong, rather than the golden moments that every single couple shares.  

I hope this helps.  The advice on this subreddit is golden.  Listen to it.  Don't do what I did and ignore the collected experiences of many, many redditors who have gone through the same things as you are going through right now.  I wish I could go back in time and smack sense into myself.  I promise you, if you avoid the above, you will come to a better place so much faster than you would otherwise.  Hang in there, be strong, and listen to what others have to say.

Hugs.  You did your best.  Right now, while the rational part of your brain knew all along that it was probably gonna end, that's cold comfort to the emotional part of you, the part of you that worked so damn hard to make it work.

You're likely in a puddle on the bedroom floor right now, having cut class or the internship; it's all good, man, let it out.  Right now, there's nothing else you can compare these feelings to except for when Dad died.  It's all good, dude, you really, *really* loved her, like no other woman.  And that's okay.

Three-and-a-half months from now, it'll all be gravy, dude.  Yeah, she's still the first thing that I think of when I get up in the morning, but it's just merely annoying now, not this crushing burden that you're dealing with.

You, duggo, need to know that your opinion of her is about to drop.  Her behavior in the next few weeks, taken into consideration with the hoops she had no problem making you jump through during in the relationship, will leave her as someone you're just unimpressed by.  Yes, the me *now* totally remembers the good times, but they've *been* over.  Oh, and she's about to piss off our cousin ""Fay"".  Forgive her for it.  The relationship's over.

Another big thing you *need* to know:  she *left* you, and that means you now owe her nothing; stop worrying about her, because you have only yourself to worry about now.  You'll be taking good care of yourself in the coming weeks.  I'm proud of you, man; you make me proud of myself.

And good on ya for cutting out the alcohol during the most intense part of all this!  And for exercising a lot.  You'll soon come to recognize in hindsight why this was so important.

Spoiler alert duggo!  Your intern evals are gonna be solid, your grades will actually improve, you're gonna be in pretty badass shape soon, you're gonna get your garden up and going again, and ""Darren"" is gonna ask you to work the film festival red carpet and you're gonna interview celebrities!  You'll get to where I'm at soon enough, but like boot camp, it'll get better but it's about to get worse.  The insomnia and the heartache are the worst.

Yes, I've been taking care of myself and generally improving everything since the breakup, but know that I did go through a couple of two-week phases where I just didn't give a shit.

I did a five-mile standup paddle race a week into my vacation, and after that, I let myself goooooooo.

I wasn't trying to impress anyone, and enjoyed not having to. I was single (still am), and *enjoying* it.  To me, those empty beer cans, pizza boxes and ice cream containers in my room were decorations commemorating how few fucks I gave. *And it was nice.*

For all of you whose ex rebounded/found someone new :),47,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/r7mef/victory_for_all_of_you_whose_ex_reboundedfound/,"tl;dr: Ex who found another guy as soon as she left me txts me after 8 months and has obviously not progressed as much as I have.

""The best things to ever happen to me were once the worst things to ever happen to me.""

This is for all of you who have an ex who rebounded after the relationship :)

Hello.  I used to be a frequent visitor of this subreddit months ago, after the girl i was in love with stopped talking to me and found a boyfriend (we had a...complicated relationship).  We both did really bad things to each other, and I didn't realize a lot of the bad things I did to her until after she stopped talking to me, and it hurt like crazy to think it was more my fault than I ever thought.

That happened last August 31, nearly 8 months ago.  Last semester was HELL for me, knowing that I was feeling so awful and she was happily in a relationship and wouldn't speak to me.

Eventually I stopped trying to talk to her, and sorrowfully set out to work on myself, not date around and deal with my issues.  I held on to the possibility of her coming back for months after she stopped talking to me, even as she was 3 or 4 months into this new relationship.  That prolonged my suffering greatly.

Now I'm mostly over it.  I still think of her every day, but it doesn't get me down like it used to, and I've been very happy.  I even started dating again, and dating is waay better than it used to be, with my new-found wisdom :).

And today she texted me.

She told me about the things I did in the weeks before she left that she didn't like, things she said she couldn't get over and made her mad, and said that I ""ruined our friendship.""  I asked her why she was sending this to me now, and she responded ""I was upset and I knew you didn't know why...  u deserve to know and I don't want you to do it again.""

r/breakups, I am not the same person she dated.  I am stronger, more responsible, and happier than ever.  I analyzed the shit out of everything in our relationship for months.  I realized what I had done and how it must have made her feel, and I felt bad, but then I got over it.

This girl, on the other hand, the one who jumped into a relationship as soon as shit between us ended, has obviously NOT thought about the things that happened.  She always wanted a relationship.. was always desperate for it.  And since she found someone new to distract her instead of getting over it, she has not analyzed what her mistakes were (a breakup is never 100% on one person, and most of our mutual friends say she did more bad than I did.. the girl had a boyfriend in another city for part of the time we were dating for fuck's sake!!).

She rebounded, and she did not learn from her mistakes.  Picking out small little things that bothered her and saying I ruined everything is NOT what a person sounds like when they are over it... she's never dealt with it.  I dealt with it, I won't make those same mistakes twice, and I'm happier than ever.

So, when your ex rebounds or finds another guy a week after you two break up, remember what you are gaining from taking the time to get over it.  It's been 8 months and I'm STILL not over it, but I wouldn't trade this wisdom for anything.

Life has never been better, because I faced my issues head-on and handled them like an adult.  Don't sweep your shit under the rug.

Had the urge to listen to ""Careless Whisper"" by George Micheals and one verse stuck out to me as being very true. I had listened to the song before, but I wasn't really listening to the message. That verse gave me the chills when I thought about it, so I immediately hopped on here to share with you guys: 

*Time can never mend*

*The careless whispers of a good friend*

*To the heart and mind*

*Ignorance is kind*

*There's no comfort in the truth*

*Pain is all you'll find*

Letting go of a partner is hard, but understand that both of you will never forget each other. George is saying that it is better to be blissfully unaware of the truth of their current situation than to know it all. I, and I'm sure many others, can attest to that being true. There is nothing worth knowing about what your ex is up to at this point, and it's better to stay ignorant than be constantly checking what they are doing or who they are with. I personally made myself suffer by always reading up on my ex's social media and had a front row seat to the start of her new relationship. That shit blew, so do yourself a favor and block them/stay away from them on social media. You never know what you'll find, and it's better that you just stay in the dark.

I didn't lose my virginity till I was 19, I never dated in HS, and my first real relationship was only the second girl I ever had sex with.

Why am I saying all this? Because when that first relationship came around, I was so into it because I hadn't explored that much. I jumped into an extremely co-dependent, emotional relationship, without really testing the waters first. I should have taken it slower, but I was naive. When the time came to break up, I was devastated, and I realized I had been neglecting other parts of my life, including meeting new friends and improving myself.

So, I know many of you are probably in a situation like me, who fell in love with a girl without really knowing what you wanted, and getting too involved too fast because it feels good.

My message to you is this: you will feel bad for a good long time because you lost a best friend and a lover, as well as an easy source of sexual pleasure and physical comfort.

What you need to realize is that you are free now, you are too young to be planning out your life to fit together with another person, and you need to appreciate that you are no longer bound to that path. You can do anything with your life, and you can go and meet plenty of other people and love them.

**Always remember this: you are free now**

**Edit:** I'm glad so many of you found my early morning drunken words inspirational, they tend to be. Anyways, hold in there, things will get better. For me, the knowledge that I no longer have to limit where I can live and what I will do is liberating, even though it hurts to know the person I loved wasn't willing to follow me to the ends of the earth, I will find someone else that isn't scared by that idea, who is more open-minded, who shares my passion for the outdoors and nature, and all that can only come after I discover who I really am.

1367590148.0,39,self.BreakUps,1dmawg,"How to escape the memories that constantly haunt us, (or at least learn to live with them) PLEASE READ",51,12,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1dmawg/how_to_escape_the_memories_that_constantly_haunt/,"Today [m18], I realized that I'm never going to get back with my ex [f18]. For months I held onto hope that we would fix things at some point in our future. I've known I've not loved her for quite some time, yet I still wanted things to finally workout between us, I want what we all really want; for things to go back to the way they were. I wanted to be with her again, to relive those amazing, wonderful nights and special moments we had together. Even now, knowing it won't work, knowing things won't ever be fixed and knowing I don't love her I still miss those moments. 

Hense why I'm making this post redditors, it's the memories that haunt us the most. After having built a strong connection with someone, we've not just built a relationship but we've built a library of memories. Now mix love in this library and you've got yourself a serious problem. Even now, being out of the relationship, knowing I don't love her I can't free my mind from these happy memories and can't help but miss them. I originally asked my self if there was any way to escape these memories, I remember seeing an episode of Doctor Who where in the future they sell a way to erase portions of your memory. Then I asked myself if I would want every memory of my ex erased. To which I arrived at an obvious ""no"". 

Thinking further into the idea, I realized it's not the memories that haunt us but the pain we've attached to those memories from the breakup. The memories are happy memories, while in the relationship thinking back on those past times only made me happy. I'm simply attaching pain from the break up with the memories of my ex. So is there a way to escape the pain and live with the memories? Yes. the answer I'll give will only provide you with a sense of comfort for how much you want to take from it. Only you can finally come to terms with your feelings, no matter how many posts on this subreddit you read, no matter how many friends you talk to or how much you look for an answer else where, it has to come internally. Time, acceptance and change will save you from these painful thoughts.

Time - You've seen the word a thousand times, ""I'm 5 months out and doing alright, it just takes time!"" Yet you sit there, 1 month deep and think ""FUCK that! I'm in so much pain and not ready to go through 4 months more of this shit"". I've been there, all I can say is it will take time, yes, but don't fear the amount of time still left. This is the hardest part to really accept because there isn't really anything to accept, we have no control over it. Time is just something you can't think about, don't focus on how long it will take you tell your normal again, if you've ever heard the saying that ""a watched kettle won't boil"", you can relate. You won't heal when you're constantly worrying about when you're going to heal, but by following the other two ways to help you can shorten that time. 

Change - Again, you see it a thousand times, people telling you to go out, hang out with friends, keep your mind off her/him and try new things and you think to yourself, ""FUCK that! everytime I go out sure I don't think about my ex for a little while but when I come home or am alone I instantly think about them again, there's no way to escape my thoughts, I just postpone them. Well, I have news for you. Although you think you're just postponing the thoughts of him/her, you are helping your mind, you need to not just party and keep your mind off your ex but realize that LIFE is FUN without them in it. You can live again, you can hook up with people again. You don't need that person, so don't just block out them altogether and get shitfaced but realize that you have alternate friends that will provide a shoulder to lean on. So change your actions but also change your thoughts, change constantly moping about yourself and missing her/him. Change the way you address people, change how you feel and think because change is essential for either getting over your ex or growing as a person so maybe they might love you again. You also need to realize that it's not just you that's changing, your ex is probably going through the same tormenting feeling (whether as the dumpee or the dumped). Change is good in ALL ways of life, whether small or big. 

Acceptance - This is the hardest step yet the most important (a step I myself have yet to conquer). When you can accept that you're alright without the only light in your life, you'll soon start to realize that it wasn't really the only light in your life. Now when I say acceptance I don't mean you have to accept that your ex is never coming back, you might be accepting that there is another chance and you have to work for it. Acceptance is important because it lets your mind relax and not be so worked up, it also helps you come to terms with your breakup, for better or for worse. We ALWAYS find it so hard to accept though, we want to fight for our ex, we want them back! Acceptance is important because it gives you the time to really reflect on whether YOU want to get back with him/her. When you've finally come to accept your choice then you'll mind will be at peace and the healing will be almost done. Most importantly, accept the memories of your ex, don't dwell over them, don't let these memories consume you. Acceptance them as a thing of the past as you would accept going to 5th grade as just a simple thing of the past. 

Now as a little thought experiment, think fellow redditors of your grade 9 first love, think about that heartbreak and at the time how distraught you were. How much they meant to you and how you honestly thought you would never love the same again, now think about how much time has passed since then, years, decades, months. Time heals all wounds. Think about change, surely we've all changed so much from grade 9, now just think about in a few years when you look back and you'll realize how much you've changed since now. Finally think about acceptance, if someone were to tell you they just hooked up with a random I'm sure you would give 0 fucks, there will come a point when you'll give 0 fucks about your most recent heartbreak, it just takes time, change and acceptance. 

Finally, something that I saw a while ago that really stuck out and always cheers me up is the idea, ""You're just one heartbreak closer until you find that perfect person for you"" 

Enjoy life redditors! Peace.

1371010679.0,37,self.BreakUps,1g6biy,Why You Should Learn to Walk Away,47,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g6biy/why_you_should_learn_to_walk_away/,"*A friend of mine recently sent me this article, and I think it makes some very strong points about moving forward. It's geared towards men, but the same principles can be applied for women, as well.* 

I’ve made many romantic connections with women. I’ve also lost many of those connections. I’ve met girls who weren’t into me sexually and gotten rejected in various ways. I’ve even had a date ask me if it was cool to get another guy’s number while we were out for drinks.

All of these experiences have helped me grow. But almost nothing has contributed to my self-esteem and success like the times where I was the one who walked away from girls that I knew weren’t right. Think about this for a second…

When’s the last time you chose to willingly end a connection with a girl you were attracted to?

For most, that answer is rare or even never. And it all starts with our male ego.


Needless Pride and the Win-Lose Mindset: Scarcity Mentality
Many men have fragile egos when it comes to women. I’m not judging, my pride used to get the best of me, too. I couldn’t handle the reality of being rejected or losing a girl — it was one of my worst fears. I lived with a scarcity mentality.

Scarcity mentality is the belief that there’s a limited number of opportunities in your life. With women, if you miss out on a single chance, you’ll never get another like it. What happens is that you view your connections as win or lose situations. It’s black or white:

“If I don’t get this girl, I’m a failure and a loser. I’ll be alone forever. But if I do, I’m a real man and a winner.”

You then do everything in your power to “win” girls over. You will chase endlessly, pretend to be a friend for months or years, disrespect your time, and even let yourself get walked over — all because you can’t let go of this one girl.

This is a needy, desperate, and unattractive way of thinking. You are subconsciously reinforcing:

* I have no standards for myself and the women who are a part of my life. I will take whatever I can get whether or not they are right for me.
* I have no options for women. I have to latch onto every chance I get because I am not good enough to find someone else. Women who like me are rare.
* My self-worth is tied to my ability to attract women and their approval of me.
* I think of women as objects to be acquired. Their personalities, values, and mutual respect for me do not factor into my desire to sleep with them.
* This scarcity mentality leaves you unfulfilled and destroys your self-esteem. Instead, you should be trying to build a mindset of abundance.
* 
Setting Standards and Respecting Your Worth: Abundance Mentality
Abundance mentality is the belief that you have plenty of opportunities in your life. More so, that you are worthy of those opportunities. You are in the position of choice.

This is not something most people are born with but rather cultivated. It begins with how you respect and value yourself.

Repeat after me: “I am worthy of…”

* Having my time respected.
* Having my needs met.
* Being treated fairly.
* Connecting with people who improve the quality of my life.
* Meeting women who are willing to invest back in me.
* You have to set standards and want more for yourself. And not just more, but the best for yourself. When considering a woman, you should be asking…

Is she putting effort into building a connection (sexual included) with me? Is she valuing my time? Is this fulfilling my needs and wants? Am I chasing something that isn’t going anywhere? Am I clinging onto this woman only because I’m afraid of being alone and having to put myself out there again?

Often when a guy comes to me frustrated with a specific girl, I ask the above questions. Unsurprisingly, the answer to many is no. My advice is to walk away and focus on finding women who appreciate your worth.

The abundance mentality prioritizes yourself. It leads to fulfillment and a strong level of self-esteem.

Developing the Abundance Mentality By Living It
Okay, so now you understand the mindset of abundance. But just thinking about it won’t actually internalize those qualities in you. You have to practice and live by them.

You have to move on from those who don’t meet your standards. You have to stop wasting time on people who don’t invest in you and spend time on people who do. And you have to consciously remind yourself that there are an infinite number of women available to you and seek them out.

Here are some romantic situations in which you can apply this:

* A girl you met disrespects your friends in front of you.
* You meet a girl and she doesn’t open up to you after 5-10 minutes. That means she isn’t asking you questions, she’s giving vague responses, or isn’t smiling.
* You approach a girl and she rejects you.
* You confirm a date with a girl 24-48 hours before you meet. She stands you up with no  warning.
* You text a number twice and get no response.
* You keep texting a girl to make plans and she never actually hangs out.
* You wait around for a girl who has said she only sees you as a friend or that she’s not looking for something right now.
* A girl with a boyfriend flirts with you often but never spends time with you in person or moves it forward. She claims she’s miserable in her relationship and promises she wants to be with you but doesn’t break up with him.
* You’re in a relationship with an abusive or controlling partner.
* You’re in a relationship that makes you miserable or unsatisfied (emotionally or sexually).
* Your girlfriend breaks up or cheats on you. (I understand this one is extremely difficult but necessary.)
* You have a complete mismatch of expectations that cannot be resolved: you want an open relationship and she doesn’t, you want kids and she doesn’t, etc.
* Instead of sticking around, chasing, getting upset, or getting down on yourself — you must keep pushing forward.

That means not giving her ultimatums. Or begging for her to take you back. Or flipping out on her and sitting around seething with rage. Or resenting all women. Or beating yourself up. Or using those standards as a defense mechanism to avoid meeting more girls.

A man with abundance does not waste his energy when he can use it to further improve his own life. He simply says, “She’s not invested or interested in me, that’s fine. I’ll focus my efforts on someone who will be.”

By doing the above you’ll meet tons of great women, increase your happiness, decrease your frustration, and forge stronger connections. Most importantly, you’ll value yourself and build genuine confidence.

Men with abundance are willing to lose the wrong girl to find the right one. They know that having the courage to walk away comes from a place of power, not weakness. It’s never a win or lose situation to them, it’s always a win-win.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1g6biy,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g6biy/why_you_should_learn_to_walk_away/,

The night is starry and she is not with me.

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.

My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.

My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night whitening the same trees.

We, of that time, are no longer the same.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.

My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.

Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.

Love is so short, forgetting is so long.

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms

my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

I've met a few wonderful people from this subreddit, and they've played a really big part in helping me deal with my situation and getting control back in my life.

Short recap: Me 34M, wife 32F.  Friends 15 years, together 8 years, married 8 months.  Relationship broke down for a number of reasons, trust issues, sexual dysfunction and emotional cheating.  She's been leaving me slowly now for about 2 months I guess, but she moved out of my house almost 5 weeks ago.

Anyway I just want to say you WILL feel so much better in time.  This relationship was my whole universe.  This woman was everything to me.  I'd been in love with her give or take for 15 years.  The thought of an existence without her wasn't even a possibility.  She was my lover, my best friend, my everything.  I hadn't had thoughts or genuine feelings for any other woman for over 15 years - when she left me (essentially to be with another guy) I was crushed.  Beyond crushed.  Annihilated.  The first 2 weeks especially were bad.

I couldn't function on any kind of level.  At work I'd burst into tears at my desk and have to run off to my car so my co-workers couldn't see me.  So I took a week and a half off, and stayed at home.  I don't know what I actually did during that week, because it's a blur of tears, emotions, frantic emails and thoughts.  I was just so crushed.  I had that burning aching feeling I'm sure someone out there right now has..  like your chest is on fire, like you've had a hole kicked right through you.  There's no escaping it, it's all you can think of - it is your every thought from waking to crawling into bed to ""sleep"" .. which is a joke because all you do is think and cry and stay awake all night.  Or if you fall asleep you wake up in a sweat at 3am thinking of it all.. and you can't get back to  sleep.  Then you think about calling them..  or texting them or emailing them.  Maybe you follow through, and then when they don't give you the response you want, you feel worse.  

Maybe you think about hurting yourself.  You know, you're not really suicidal..  but you can't see an end to this pain.. it's not the intensity of it, it's just that you can't escape it.  

Sorry for rambling.. I got on kind of a roll there.  Anyway I hope my words show how badly off I was just *2 weeks ago*.  Honestly at one point I was close to checking myself in to some sort of mental care facility.

So what's changed?  Everything.  I've immersed myself in new and old friends. I've reconnected with some old friends I've had minimal contact with for a while now.  People I neglected because of my marriage.  People I will NOT be neglecting anymore.  Because when the chips were down these people were there for me in ways I never expected.

I made new friends.  Most of them from this subreddit.  I've emailed people, I've PM'd with people, I've facebooked with people.  This subreddit is amazing and I truly believe I've made some friends for life from this process.  

All this has reminded me that I'm an awesome person without my relationship.  Hell..  I think I'm a better person without my dysfunctional relationship.  The old me is back.. the one who has a wry smile and a zest for life.

I woke up today with a smile on my face.  I was halfway to work before I realised..   ""oh yeah..  my wife left me"".  And the smile didn't fade.  I have a whole new life to consider.  I can take any path from here, and I only have to worry about how it will serve me and no one else.  I'm glad she left me.  Shit wasn't working.  We were both fooling ourselves, and now I'm clear of that ""oh god please don't leave me"" haze, I can see now that I can make a better life for myself without her.  Bitch did me a favour by leaving.

So please...  hang in there if you're hurting.   It does get better.  Connect with friends old and new.  Keep yourself distracted.  Exercise, read a book, take a class, cook something delicious.

And if like me you've been fucked over - realise you're an awesome person who deserves better than whatever your ex has done to you.  They're the one's missing out.  You have the strength to do this inside you.  Just take it one day, moment.. breath at a time.  

Happy to answer any questions anyone might have - I hope this gives someone out there hope..  I hope to give someone out there a light in the darkness the way others from here have done for me.

I just want to talk about her, because I miss her.",44,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fli2t/i_m28_treated_a_onceinalifetime_relationship_f33/,"I don't know how many men have had the opportunity to be loved, truly and deeply and selflessly loved, by a woman they admire - but it's something that's happened to me exactly once, and every day I regret the abuse I leveled on the woman who loved me.

I met her three years ago. She was out of my league in every way, beautiful and funny and smart and kind... but for some reason, she started dating me. I think it's because I'm an outgoing adventurer, foolish and unprepared, and she's a shy but perfect companion, savvy and good at planning. She's daring and ballsy and excited by new experiences, she just lets others lead the experience.

All of my friends liked her - some thought she was a little boring, but that's just because they didn't know her well enough for her to show them the exciting part of herself. This is a girl who backpacked with me through Germany and Croatia, who supported my dreams to sail, who loves to hike in the wilderness - a girl who climbed onto the back of my motorcycle and carved around the mountains with me. She has taken many more leaps of faith than I ever could, really, and I never opened my eyes to see them.

More importantly, she did these things because she loved me in a way that I didn't understand for a long time. A bone-deep way. I thought I loved her, and I told her, but I didn't act the part. I was terrified.

She always wanted what was best for me. Could I do that for her? Could I give up my dreams, for example, if they conflicted with her desires? Could I take on the responsibility of starting a family? I could quit my job today and move to another country and live for years doing anything I wanted. Did I really have the selflessness, the generosity of spirit, to give that up to be with this wonderful, caring, beautiful woman?

I didn't.

And, worst of all, once I saw how deeply we were connected, I took our relationship for granted. I treated her like she didn't have the choice to leave. I cheated on her, and found things about her to criticize. I was demanding of her while acting selfishly myself. And somehow, somehow she put up with it for years - every day though, my behavior eroded her love. Every day there was a little bit less between us. And then one day, she didn't love me anymore.

Now, I look at what I have, and it's a good life in many ways. Good health, few worries, fantastic friends and family. I will live, and she will live, and maybe we'll both find something near as good.

But I'll always remember the woman who taught me what love is: tipping the scales in the other person's favor. Playing to lose. Weighing everything and determining that a life, however great, without your love isn't as valuable as any other life with it. And that's where I am now... I have a great life, but without Amy, it feels less than half complete.

In everything I do, I miss her. When I ride in the mountains, I wish she were there. I think she'd approve of my new hammock - I think she'd fit, because we always fit together perfectly. When I visit new places, I notice all the things that she would like. Good books remind me of how we used to sit up in bed at night and read to one another. I can't cook the bachelor's meals she used to enjoy anymore. The funny shows we watched together aren't as funny anymore. When another woman sleeps with me on the bed we chose together, I feel like I'm living another, sadder man's life.

In the beginning, there were points where I put him on a pedestal. But he had a lot of the same flaws that existed in people who I rather disliked. Someone said to me, ""Your ex is only special to you. He is not special to anyone else."" Or something like that.


I've loved another person. I thought relationships were not for me, because of my asexual leanings... but, although it took time, I had developed similar feelings to a person before. I can do it again, if my life goes that way. And if it doesn't, it is not a big deal.


I am a pretty awesome person. I love myself. I know that I can get people to love me by not being myself, but I have a lot more fun just...being me. And even if one person can't appreciate me, many other people do. Sometimes I can't see that, but I do matter to many people. I have helped others and I have made a difference in people's lives.


There's a limited amount of time on the world. Not limited enough to make me curl up in a ball and cry about regrets or something, but I should spend this time on people who are worth it. Yes, people I have loved have left me and have hurt me. No, I am not broken. 


I will not regret the silly things I have done in the name of ""love."" I expressed my feelings, I did not hurt anyone.

I didn't think I'd feel this okay again but something happened on New Year's. I feel like I just woke up. I started realizing that I shouldn't be this sad anymore. It's like, I spent so much of 2012 trying to make someone else happy, focusing on him when it should have been me instead. I lost myself trying to figure him out -- loving someone who didn't love me back (or if he did, he was awful at expressing it). Either way, we're over now and I can accept that. He just wasn't the one for me (even though there were times I really wished he was). 

I've come to the realization that just because he didn't treat me well doesn't mean someone else will do the same. There are so many people in this world -- I can't believe I let one person get me down so badly. So now that 2013 is here, I'm going to make it about what 2012 wasn't: **Me**. I'm going to do things that make me happy. Most recently (with my newfound free time), I started going to the gym and the endorphins I get after doing cardio is so amazing. I just feel so good.

And the best part? I really don't think I want to be with anyone for a while. I just want to focus on me and my happiness. And that should be enough. I think it finally is. I'm spending time with myself and doing things on my own. I'm getting to know who I am and to be honest, I'm starting to love who I'm becoming. I'll be 25 soon and there's no better time to get to re-know who I am than now.

So in the end... it gets better. And it's really hard to see that early on but I promise you, it does. You sort of have to let the pain and heartache run its course but you'll be so much stronger afterward. I was so heartbroken because this was the first person I ever loved and I put in so much effort into trying to make it work and it didn't. And it hurt like nothing else. But it taught me some really valuable lessons -- including valuing my own self-worth and learning when to let go. I'm okay now and you will be too.

Since then, I've been scrambling to find a way out of the heartache and think (after seeing a photo of my ex and feeling *nothing* rather than sick) I've cracked it.

This has no doubt be posted before, so apologies, but I thought maybe it's nice to see that there's another case of going from complete hopelessness to happiness.

*My ex (33M) strung me along for months with the hope of reconciliation. DO NOT DO THIS. Either you're together, or you're not. If your SO can't decide, then take it as a no. The pain of him calling off our ""date"" after a 6 month break was worse than the initial breakup and landed me in hospital.

*Do read ""he's just not that into you"" (even if you're a guy), I had a few epiphany moments with that book, and I had read most of the breakup books available on Amazon.

*Don't be scared to get help. Your pain is real. It's a loss and you are grieving. In some ways it's worse than a death because there is no certain closure. Even one session with a professional can help. I did cognitive behavioural therapy.

*No contact is key. Everyone knows this, but as far as possible, do it.

*I watched every episode of Community all over again. It helped. Try it.

*BELIEVE people when they say it'll get better/they have been through the same thing.

*I'm an atheist and found comfort in this: http://www.katsandogz.com/onjoy.html

*If you think you're depressed, do see a doctor, don't be ashamed.

*Write down all the positives and negatives of your last relationship in two separate columns. Try to do it when you're in a relatively stable place, otherwise your list will just be full of ""pros"". See what you'd like from your next relationship.

*Here's the kicker; you won't find someone who ticks every positive quality on that list.

My list of ""pros"" was ridiculous for my ex, I idolised him in a way. I thought no one would ever come even close, it certainly didn't seem that way after several dates with other guys. Then just over a month ago my Mum gave me the good old adage ""it'll happen when you least expect it"". Mum's are always right about this shit. Always.

That weekend I met a guy who blew my mind. We talked for 8 hours straight at a party. The mental list of ""pros"" from my ex had to be thrown out because it was specific to him; this new guy came with his own unique set of positive attributes that I'd never even considered before; I couldn't have even have dreamt him up.

I'm not saying someone else will help heal all the heartache but he's proven to me that you don't need to find a ""replacement"", you just need to be open to the incredible new adventures that await you as a single person, whether that be a new relationship, vacation, hobby.. anything.

I really do believe that, however one-sided, you will eventually realise why you broke up with said -ex and be thankful as hell that it happened when you're happy again. It does get better.

**""The Good, Better, Best"" method**. Here's how it works. Under GOOD you write all of the things that were good about your relationship. Under BETTER, you write how the relationship made you a better person, and under BEST you write why it was best that the relationship ended.

For example, here's one that I made when I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 3 years:


All of the **GOOD** things

* Wonderful chemistry

* common interests

* very physically connected

* love was real



How it made me **BETTER**

* ""Clean Slate"" policy (no drugs, alcohol, or promiscuous sex)

* I realized how to love someone

* no regrets

* I learned how to love someone long term



Why the breakup is **BEST**

* I'm a busy girl

* I'm young, I still have a lot of decisions to make.

* There could be someone better

* My relationship with my mom is better. There are no longer any trust issues between us.

* I can focus on school, without worrying about future plans


This was one of the most positive things that I did whilst going through my break up. I know it sounds crazy, but I thought the list up outloud as I drove to school and as I drove back. If you simply speak in a calm tone, or remain calm about it throughout the entire thing, you'll immediately absolve the resentment. It'll help you clearly see the positive things that came out of your relationship, even if they don't seem that positive.

You cannot do that to yourself! I did for a month. It was the worst. I didn't shower, I didn't leave my room only to go to the bathroom, and I cried every single day. 

2. Put anything that reminds you of them away in a box and put it out of sight. Even if it was yours before you met them and it reminds you of them put it away!

3. Do something you have never done before. I did a crossfit intro class. It was insane, but I seriously felt so amazing after and didn't cry over my ex that night. Though I was sore for 2 days after, it made me proud. :) 

4. Don't contact them! Seriously. NC is the way to go. I hate to say it but time does heal the pain, only if you aren't talking to them though. At about 3 weeks I finally accepted that him and I weren't ever going to get back together, and yes I cried for hours, but you HAVE to accept that or you will not move forward.

5. Go on vacation if you can afford it. One of the reasons I'm so glad my ex broke up with me is because I would have never thought to go on vacation. Even if I would have thought to go on vacation, I would have never saved up the money because I would have been spending it on him and going out with him...

6. Go talk to someone if needed. If it's a therapist or a friend, talk to someone. Don't keep it all inside. I know a lot of my ""friends"" didn't even talk to me or hang out with me after I got broken up with. I literally had no one to turn to. Though I did make a friend on here and meet them in person. This would have never happened if he didn't break up with me either. 

7. The only way you will know if you are ready to talk to them again is if you think about them with someone else. Think about them traveling with someone else, having a good laugh with someone else, and sleeping with someone else. No jealousy or sadness? Then great, talk to them if you want, but if they start hitting on you or flirting, they COULD (not positively) be messing with your heart. So watch out for red flags. Couples hardly ever break up and get back together. I'm not saying it never happens but it's rare. 

8. Be kind to yourself. Don't starve yourself, be down on yourself, or hurt yourself physically because someone broke up with you. No! This is a time to be on your own, really make sure where you are in life is where you want to be, and if it is, then make it even better!

She would constantly talk about her co-worker and when he started calling her and texting I knew things weren't right. The other night I went through her phone and saw that they were texting each other back and forth and one of the last messages was her saying to him that she's moving out in a few months which was something she had never said to me. I immediately called her out on it which turned into a big fight.
She said nothing sexual ever happened even though some of the texts were sexual. They apparently have developed strong feelings for each other over the past few months. Her co-worker is married and his wife just recently got pregnant after they were trying for years. He's been telling my girlfriend how miserable his marriage is and that he's going to file for divorce which was a complete lie. The next day I found his wife's facebook and sent her a message about it. If I were in her shoes I'd want to know. Apparently he only told his wife that he had a crush on her and that was it. At no point was he ever going to come clean even after he found out yesterday from my girlfriend that I found out. After I sent the message I realized he probably had access to her FB and would delete the message to cover himself which he ended up doing.
A few hours later and with a little research I tracked down his wife's business e-mail and sent the message again just in case. According to my girlfriend his wife immediately called him and ended their relationship and told him to leave. His wife responded to my e-mail saying she's so glad I had the courage to tell her this, that she's leaving him for good, and that she kicked him out of their home. She said she never got my fb message which I knew she wouldn't all along. Last night I came home after all this and my girlfriend gave me an ultimatum. Either I leave the apartment or she does. The apartment is in my name so I told her to pack her things and go to her parents house. The worst part of all of this is the fact that I've been saving up for an engagement ring. I had $2000 saved up and was hoping to get it within the next couple of months. We've had a TON of money issues over the years with bill after bill which has prevented me from doing it earlier.
We talked for a while through text last night after she left and I told her about all of this and how selfish they were. She said she had no idea I was even getting a ring. Kind of hard to say to your SO oh hey I'm getting you an engagement ring. It would completely ruin the surprise. She said at this point she doesn't even know what she wants. I obviously love her but don't think there is a way to ever gain back her trust and move past this. I'm beyond hurt by all of this as I'm sure his soon to be ex-wife is.

I spent most of those years as a guest in someone else's life and I've been feeling resentful of him and angry at myself. I shouldn't have sublimated my identity or let myself become nothing more than furniture. 

Anyways, to stop dwelling on how stupid and used I feel, I've been making lists. Lists of things I can do now that I'm single, lists of my new or renewed goals and ambitions, lists of good things I need to start believing about myself. It's listmania!
 
I wanted to share a few items from my lists with others out there who are going through a breakup. Maybe some will cheer you or resonate with you. Feel free to add some items of your own! 

1. I can buy whatever groceries I want and nobody will complain or criticize me! Plus my favourite things won't disappear before I get the chance to enjoy them!

2. I can go see *my* family and hang out with *my* friends whenever I want and I'll never have to make excuses for an absent partner or worry about entertaining someone who refuses to participate!

3. I can have friends over whenever I want and I won't have to worry if anyone else likes them but me. I can also *not* have people over when I want alone time!

4. I can open the windows instead of turning on the AC without listening to a billion years of whining about the heat!

5. I can get whatever haircut I want and nobody will tell me it looks bad!

6. I can sprawl on the bed like a boss!

7. I can fart all around the house without having to say ""excuse me!"" 

8. I can listen to whatever music I like any time I like!

9. I don't have to feel like having sex! I don't have to pretend to be interested in sex for the sake of making someone else feel good!

10. I can decorate however I want! I even get to choose the dishes!

11. I can stay out late and flirt and have crushes again!

12. I can make as much noise early in the morning as I want and nobody will complain! 

13. I can eat vegetarian food and nobody will complain!

14. I can control the utilities bill! No more ridiculously high heat in the winter!

There's nothing I can write that is going to bring you certain comfort. I was in your shoes four months ago, and I know how it feels to be lost; without purpose; dreading every morning. It is okay to feel defeated, for now. Even the strongest people need rest. Appreciate this time to focus on yourself. For the first time in however long, you're free. Free.

You are going to hurt. You are going to need the support of others. Even if you want to take this battle alone, don't do that to yourself. You may not realize it, but people love you. You may want to turn your back on the world, but your family, your friends -- they're still here. Reddit is still here: a community of people who know [exactly] what you're going through. We can be your outlet.

I can't promise that you are going to feel better tomorrow, next week, or next month. But I give you my word that all it takes is time. Who you are right now is not who you're going to be, because the person coming out of this war is going to be much stronger than the person going into it. Somewhere inside, you know this isn't the real you. Find that person, and take whatever time you need. A relationship can wait.

You may have just lost the love of your life -- but that was the life of your former self. Let go. You won't appreciate this pain now, but there is purpose in what you are going through. Somewhere out there, someone new is waiting for you; someone that deserves what you have to give. You owe it to them to make it through this struggle. More importantly, you owe it to yourself.

I love with my WHOLE heart when it becomes serious and I tend to see too much of the good in people. I have been so sucked into a relationship that I have felt like nothing else in the world matters. However, I never stopped going to school or letting it interfere with my life. Here's some advice on how to pick yourself up after you have hit rock bottom. Take it with a grain of salt, I don't claim to be an expert counselor.

I think of it as ""You either always love someone, or you never did"". You don't really STOP loving somebody. You need to accept that it's okay to still love them, but realize that is a chapter of your life that has now ended. The best cure is acceptance. You will think about them every day, probably for quite some time. I assure you that the day will come when you don't think about them anymore. Or when thinking about them won't bring you thoughts of sadness. You will get over this. Whether it takes weeks, months, or even years. You have a life ahead of you and you need to see that again through a new perspective.

Follow all the advice, get rid of the photos, the numbers, hide them on facebook, avoid them at all cost and initiate NC. It's the only way, only when I did that did I start healing. 

Keep busy, join a gym, take up something new. It can take ages, but it gets better week on week. Some days will be better, some will be worse, but every week is always better. Go out with your friends, get outside and do new or old things. Just do something, remember who you are. It was by throwing myself into a new activity that I happened to meet my new girl, and you know what? I was wrong after day one. It can be better and it can be fun. She wasn't everything, she was just a girl I had a great three years with and we went as long as we could. Life moves on and you have to go with it, that way you'll keep enjoying it. 

I couldn't be where i'm at without the advice I've read here. Everyone reading this who's still hurting I promise you I felt everything you did. I felt like I had to change her mind, that it was a mistake, that no one else or nothing else could compare. That I needed her. I was wrong, you only need you and it's up to you to make sure you start getting the best out of yourself. If you meet another girl, great, have fun with that. But the most important thing to know is that it gets better and you'll be stronger for it.

Every time you break up with someone you get one step closer to that person. You should look at moving on as getting closer to meeting the one."" 


""Every love gone wrong is one step closer to your own true love."" 

""Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so love the people who treat you right. Forget about the ones who don't, and believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said that it'd be easy; they just promised it would be worth it.""

""Nobody is worth your tears, and the one who is, won’t make you cry.""

“I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go. Things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they go right. You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart, so that better things can fall together.”

""Things without remedy should be without regard; what is done is done.""

“You can try your hardest, you can do everything and say everything, but sometimes people just aren't worth trying over anymore...they aren't worth worrying about...it's important to know when to let go of someone who only brings you down.”

""Sometimes what you want isn't always what you get, but in the end what you get is so much better than what you wanted.” 

""Someday, someone will walk into your life and make you realize why it never worked out with anyone else.""

""Every story has an end; but in life, every end is just a new beginning.""

""I'm not sure what the future holds but I do know that I'm going to be positive and not wake up feeling desperate. It is what it is, it's not what it should have been, not what it could have been, it is what it is.""

""Don’t let the past steal your present.""

""Being single used to mean that nobody wanted you. Now it means you're pretty sexy and you're taking your time deciding how you want your life to be and who you want to spend it with.""

""Relationships are like mirrors, it's best to leave it broken instead of hurting yourself putting it back together""

“Watching you walk out of my life does not make me bitter or cynical about love. Rather it makes me realize that if I wanted so much to be with the wrong person, how wonderful it will be when the right one comes along. ”

“It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lost it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.”

“You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do.”

“The thing about happiness is that it doesn’t help you to grow; only unhappiness does that.“

“If you can’t change your fate, change your attitude.”

Understand that no matter how down in the dumps you feel, there are PLENTY of people around you who are there to offer their support. So when something goes wrong during the day, when you have an epiphany, when something funny happens and you feel you need to share it with him/her - DON'T. Call someone else. Anyone else. Come to Reddit even and tell your story. Just don't rely on them to care for you anymore. You have to break free from that.

First, write a letter telling the other person everything you still wish you could say to them and then throw it away. Next, make a list of everything you didn't like. Start with the big things that you wound't have been able to live with and finish with all the small ways they irritated you. Keep this one to refer to when you feel bad, but not for too long. Then make a list of all the wonderful things about yourself that you and your next partner will love about you.

To keep busy, hang out with good friends, vent a little at first and then stop thinking about it and have fun. Do things that you have to focus all of your attention on. Reading, doing puzzles that stimulate your mind, play intense video games, etc.

I also recommend chocolate and masturbation. Good chocolate, don't eat a whole bag of mini kit kats (even though they are in season) but buy some good, quality chocolate and savor every bite. (I like extra dark with almonds and caramelized orange pieces.)

Nearly 6 years together, 3 living together, one year abroad. Started young, he was the first man I'd had sex with. He was patient, loving, giving, and respectful. The years wore on and we began to grate against each other - our respective voices were too loud to hear each other speak. It was too much, and so I left. 

I wanted to believe that we could be friends. After all, he was my best friend for those six years - we were social recluses hiding under the sheets together, away from the world. I couldn't let that go.

Three months later we return from no contact, slowly, sparingly. He begins to cry, he tells me how what I did to him, well, he just couldn't sleep or eat for weeks. I apologize. I fall asleep and he lays down beside me. He puts the moves on me, and it leads to sex. He dwells on it, says it was beautiful but it shouldn't happen again. I agree whole-heartedly, say I wouldn't have, had he not initiated it. He texts me throughout the week, alluding to how great it was.

The next weekend he wants to hang out. Six years and now a muddled friendship, I still let out hope, r/breakups, I did. We had friend fun, you know, that heavy silliness that makes you feel alive? Eating dinner, he told me he crushed on another girl. I paused, I didn't say anything--it wasn't my place, and I knew that. He asked ""why is it affecting you, I can see it's affecting you"" and then proceeded for the next four hours to absolutely destroy me. He would tell me this--he would press on and press on and press on because he ""loves"" and ""cares"" about me and wants to be ""honest""--and he has no obligation to be friends with me, and I need to just listen. 

He had sex with that girl, he liked her, and why should I care? Wasn't I the one that left him? oh yeah, and he had sex with her before we had sex last weekend. He didn't think that maybe it would be important to let me know that he was sexually active before f*cking me again. All of those words about sex being connected to love, how he berated me for 'moving on' so quickly (I really hadn't, still haven't had sex with anyone else). And now, now, couldn't I see? He was over me. I left him. and now he was over me. And if I couldn't put up with four hours of him talking about relationships, then he had no obligation to be friends with me.  - his words. NOW, you know what? he doesn't. And quite frankly, I have no obligation to ever speak to someone who makes me feel like shit - who presses into me with his dick and with his phallic arrogance. 

**TL;DR** For the love of god, don't go back. You will see another side of him/her, and it will absolutely crush you. S/he is not the same and will never be the same. S/he will no longer do anything to protect you, s/he could(n't -edit) care less if you leave and never come back. *You* are worth so much more.

Time flies, people change, people grow, friendships grow, friendships crumble, love is lost, and love is gained. We revolve around time, it's how we grow and learn from experiences that contributes to our being as a whole. We aren't the person we were a few years ago, heck even a few months ago. Things we used to be so comfortable with are now gone from our lives, things we used to know have either stayed or disappeared right before our eyes. 

It's life, the laughter, the love, the friendships, and the people that keep us going. We decide what to make of our life, we decide every decision we make, we decide our happiness. The people we may have been so close to 3 years ago are now distant from our lives, the people we share with friendships right now may not even be there in a few months. Life has such unpredictable outcomes, sometimes we just need to accept the terms it has given us. 

What we take away from all these events constitute our cherished memories. Sometimes, it's all we have. Just memories. Some are bad, and some are good. But having a great memory can bring a simple smile or a horrible memory can bring tears to shed. We keep these memories with us, and it's those memories that make us who we are.

Regret nothing. Your decisions now have made you the person you are now. You are living life as we speak. You are one in 7 billion people on this beautiful planet. Make life how you choose to make it. 

You will love again. You will live an amazing life. I promise. Just keep your head up high and don't lose hope. I know it's hard right now but there's so much more to life than pain and tears. But it will get better. And you will be stronger in the end.

The life and love you once had is gone, so cheers to all the memories.

I pretty much followed the advice I had set out for myself to a T, and it worked great for me. Since the breakup, I've found myself being more social, getting out and doing more things, being healthier (lost about 15 lbs since the breakup, which brings me down a total of 30 lbs since I started dieting/exercising), being more positive, spending more time with family, and concentrating on what's important to me. I've been promoted at work, made some friends outside of work, joined a gun club, built some cool furniture, and have really been enjoying volunteering as a Habitat for Humanity house leader. 

But tonight was special. After enjoying life going solo (really wasn't as bad as I thought), I decided to give dating a shot. I've been seeing a girl for the last month or so. This is actually the only girl I've ever ""dated""... all my other relationships happened during high school/college and the just happened. We had our fourth date tonight at my house - I made dinner and we watched a movie. At the end of the night, I figured I'd be bold and go in for a kiss. I know, waiting for the fourth date probably makes me some kind of wimp, but I was waiting for the right moment... and boy did I find it. I wasn't quite expecting for her reaction to be so positive... it was pretty magical. 

Who knows what the future will hold, but this was a good reminder that all is not lost when a relationship ends. Don't let other people define who you are. Don't be afraid to move on, and try and move on before you become involved with someone else. No Contact worked great for me. I haven't seen or heard anything about her since she moved out in December, and I haven't gone searching. Spend time with friends, find yourself and be yourself. Most of the people who post here are in their 20's like me. You have plenty of time, don't stress out over what you're going through. Breakups are major life events, and you can use these as milestones for changes and self-improvement.

I felt crushed, so sure he was the one for me and -nobody- else. He was my ""soul mate"" in my eyes. My future husband, everything. We talked about getting married, having kids, what our house would be like. We had everything planned out, we were together four years. Over a period of six months, everything died for him, he wasn't in love with me anymore. I could feel the change but was in denial. Many times I thought of posting to r/breakups asking for help, but every time I tried I broke down crying.

I drug the breakup out to a painful degree, texted him almost every day, always hoping for a reconciliation. We went out and dates and hooked up about three times. The sexual attraction was still there, but nothing else, I deluded myself into thinking there was more. In reality, he did lead me on a little bit, using affectionate terms and essentially behaving as a boyfriend. Last week I finally got real closure. I got up the courage to ask him if there was any hope for us in the future, he said no. He didn't see himself ever feeling the same way again. I thought I would feel awful, but I just felt calm and satisfied with that answer. It was a huge relief. 

I haven't texted him since and feel no need to ever do so again. He's a great person and I wish the best for him, but now my future is free and wide open. That's an amazing feeling. I know I can create an even better future than the one we had planned together. 

When you're in the middle of a breakup, it seems nothing could make it better but that one person. It's a false perception. Sooner than you think it's all over, and you wondered what the big deal really was, because that person isn't significant to your life any more. Sometimes, at your saddest point, you feel like the best advice is actually the worst advice, because you're still so in love with whatever satisfaction that person gave you, momentarily. We all experience this, it's almost an obsession. 

The truth is, healing from a breakup can be more satisfying than the relationship itself. It's exciting and liberating! Meeting new people and gaining your independence. Realizing all the time you missed out on feeling happiness with that person because you were angry or upset. It only means better future relationships, a more mature and genuine attitude. It's one of the best opportunities for personal growth aside from the death of a loved one.  Just pull through, and you will get to that point, and be so happy it all happened. The bad moments are some of the most worthwhile in life, if you let them teach you.

1353645958.0,36,self.BreakUps,13njco,A holiday pick-me-up. Advice for those going through a bad time.,38,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/13njco/a_holiday_pickmeup_advice_for_those_going_through/,"So it's a holiday today. 

You had plans to hang out with them, their family. You were going to meet the parents. You had a plane ticket ready. You had planned to bring certain things to share the holiday together. You were going to be a part of the family. But here you are, dumped, and thinking about all things that could have been. All the things you could have been doing.

But wait. There's something to be learned here. Today's a day about being thankful. How about being thankful for yourself? They sat there, ended things with you, for whatever reason, and taught you something. They gave you a reason to be thankful for yourself. That person is gone. It's terrible. It can't be fixed. Holidays are a time to think about the positives.

So sit down. Right now on this Thanksgiving. No excuses. Make a list of the things you're thankful for. Your parents. Your friends. Your dog/cat. Your job. Your new gym membership. All the great deals you'll get tomorrow on Black Friday. And then add to that ""I'm thankful for what I learned"".

You learned a valuable lesson about people. About relationships. Perhaps multiple lessons throughout the course of the relationship. And from that, you'll realize that you're a stronger, wiser person. Everyone is wiser as they move forward and progress through life. Don't sit still. Tell yourself that you want to move forward.

I guarantee you this. Your ex is sitting at home right now. With their family. And you've crossed their mind multiple times. They've thought ""Wow. This holiday feels different."" Hell, they might have spoken to a family friend and gotten advice on how to cope with their decision. Or if they even made the right decision. They're thinking about you. Their pride is there to prevent them from contacting you and wishing you a Happy Thanksgiving. And they're staying busy. Those two things are the main reason why they're not contacting you. But trust me. They're hurting. Whether they admit it or not. Whether it was an amicable split, or a the worst breakup of all time - they're hurting. Just like you.

In fact, think about it this way. Today, this Thanksgiving, your new objective is to win the breakup. Yes, I just grabbed a reference from a popular TV sitcom. Win. The. Breakup. How do you win? By changing your mindset. Improving the way you dress. Improving your fitness. Take time out to find something you enjoy doing. Music, reading, writing, exercise, or a new hobby. All of that is within your realm of control. That realm of possibility. And the possibilities are endless.

It's only natural that you replace something that's gone with something you care about more. And I'm not talking about finding a new person. Find something else to set your mind to that you care about more than the one who left you. This is where your turning point lies. This is where it gets better. This is your catalyst.

If you take this to heart, you're going to look back on this Thanksgiving and said ""That was the turning point"". Instead of associating this day with your pain. And your heartbreak. And your anguish. You will associate this day when you said ""Enough is enough"". I challenge you to sit down and start a journal. Watch a movie. Read a book. Throw on those running shoes and say hello to the pavement. Give your mind a break. It's time to reset. It's time for you to start anew. It's time to gain control of your emotions and feelings. It's time to win this thing. It's time to improve yourself. It's time to show them what they've been missing.

And over time, you're going to realize what you were missing about yourself. You're going to hit that point where you go ""I missed me."" Nobody can tell you when that will be, but it's coming. You should be thankful for yourself. Thankful of your circumstances. But thankful of the better person you are now, and the even better person you can become. It starts right here. This Thanksgiving, you're going to win.

I got dumped by my boyfriend out of the blue almost one month ago now, when I was in a very vulnerable time of my life, and in the last couple of weeks I've really felt myself getting stronger and stronger each day!! The day after it happened I was a mess, crying all day nonstop! Such a change from how I'm feeling today.

No matter how good our relationship was, I'll never think anything more. Your coldness and ridiculousness really took me by surprise. Never gave me a warning, never said ANYTHING to me that was bothering you, or anything that we really needed to work on. Told me it was over with no emotion, and that was it, you were gone. No explanation, no chance of redemption. I've been too nice, something you definitely don't deserve from me.

Guess all those nice things you said were just you blowing rainbows and sunshine up my ass. ""You're the best in bed."" ""You're the first guy I actually really like.""

""I'm sorry but when you lost me as your boyfriend you lost more than just a title. You don't get to keep the emotional guy who listens and who you can call whenever you want to vent. You can't just pick and choose which parts of our relationship you'd like to keep.""

Did I want to be there for her? Of course I did. One doesn't fall out of love just because you are no longer ""together"". It killed me to ignore her when she called too much but at the end of the day, no matter how much you love someone, you have to do whats right for you.

And ladies, if you value your boyfriend solely for the ""best friends"" aspect of your relationship, you need to reconsider if he is the right man for you.

This morning I made a list of things that I want in a future parter. Things that he lacked, and it helped me a lot. Maybe some of you can share your lists here as well. 

I deserve a guy that:

 
1) Respects his family (You didn't)


2) Has the same interests in sports and activities as me (Not just one or two)


3) Wants alone time with me (You had to invite you friends over every time I came to visit)


4) Wants to have deep conversations with me(You said there was nothing to talk about)


5) Understands when I'm upset and at least attempts to cheer me up


6) Doesn't shut down during a fight


7) A guy that makes me a priority and not an option


8) A guy with normal sleeping patterns (texting me goodmorning at 4pm is so fucked up)


9) A guy who loves PDA (not ignoring me around certain people or situations)


10) A guy who doesn't mind giving up a little bit of income to see me (You refused to spend gas money to visit me because you wanted to save for your bro-vacation to Hawaii. Well fuck you.)


11) A guy that wants to see me everyday if possible (Without me asking)


12) A guy that can talk about his feelings once in a while (You were dead on the inside)


13) A guy that's my #1 fan and I, his. 


14) A guy that chases after me (You just let me go)


15) A guy that calls me when we're away from eachother (without me asking)


16) A guy who isn't a douche (You = douche)


17) A guy who doesn't talk disrespectfully about poor, overweight, gay or uneducated people. (You ignorant fuck)


18) A guy that reassures me that he loves me (Words of affirmation was my number one love language)


19) A guy that doesn't always have to have plans 24/7. (Be happy with being still once in a while)


20) A guy that doesn't end it when the going gets tough, but fights for us everyday


Sorry for the foul language. Obviously, I'm going through the hatred phase or whatever. But I hope you guys have lists you would also like to share.

The only way that was possible for me at least, was by focusing on the future. People tell you to live in the present, well for me living in the present was a bad idea because I lost my idea of the future. 

After the breakup, I lost something that I looked forward to working on every day (the relationship). I realized that in order for me to be happy, I needed something I could look forward to everyday. 

So I thought long and hard about myself. I decided that it was time I looked into the man I want to become. I want to get into med school and decided to look into every little detail of the steps I would need to take in order to have a competitive chance at getting in. 

Now with that goal in mind, I feel a very strong resolve. The idea of getting my ex back is repulsive. I have better things to worry about. Love is something I'm no longer needing but wanting. I have come back to living in the present and it doesn't feel bad anymore.

It doesn't matter if you're young or old. Losing a lover hurts like hell but looking into your future and deciding on improving yourself with very specific goals will make you get over him/her faster. Don't just go with the flow...now is the time for you to get your ass up and MAKE yourself a better person. The best way to do that is to imagine the best case scenario in the future that DOES NOT include your ex and pursuing that scenario.

1368270928.0,32,self.BreakUps,1e4gus,Revelations of a dumpee (3 week-status),36,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1e4gus/revelations_of_a_dumpee_3_weekstatus/,"It's been 3 weeks to the day since my (24f) boyfriend (also 24) of 3 years broke up with me, seemingly out of nowhere.

**Disclaimer: long read ahead! :)**







The first few days were no less than hell. I was crushed, gutted, heartbroken. *Everything* was painful. I went grocery shopping, but all i saw were his favorite cereal, the food we loved to cook together, the deodorant he uses. Getting dressed in the morning was a chore: the tshirt I got at that concert, that dress he loved on me, etc. I took down our pictures, but seeing the empty space on the wall were our smiling happy faces used to be hurt just as bad. I missed him SO much, I couldn't get my head around the idea that our future, our life together, stopped existing. I cried almost constantly, I was sick and exhausted. It was unbearable. 

The days went on and slowly turned into weeks. Little by little, with a lot of help from family and amazing friends, I started picking myself up off the ground.

Got my shit together at work, I even got a promotion! The diversion of focusing on a new job (and off course the extra cash) are very welcome. I go out all the time and have a drinks with friends and coworkers, go to parties, have dinner, and so on. I don't always feel like it, but I make myself get out there and (sometimes pretend to) have fun. Talking to other people helps a lot, it puts things in perspective and it's nice to get compliments :)  **Even if you feel like crying in you bedroom, GO OUT. It WILL make you feel better, I promise!**



I still miss him a lot. I mourn our what-has-been and our what-could-have-been. I still cry. The bad days still outweigh the good at this point. HOWEVER I'm starting to see a tiny little spec of light at the end of the tunnel. Here's why:

- The way he went about the breakup (very childish, cruel and immature - I won't go into too much detail) made me realize he is not only NOT the man I believed him to be, he is more importantly NOT the man I want to spent my life with and one day have children with. 
**I don't WANT to get back together.** I deserve someone who loves and respects me just as much as I love him.

- The issues we had were NOT going to disappear in the future. We didn't fight much, there was absolutely no abuse (emotional or physical). On paper and in my mind everything was peachy. But, like every couple, we had our differences. These were always about either his immaturity/lack of initiative or me not getting along with his parents. These things will NOT change, his parents and his personality are stable factors I CANNOT CONTROL.
**Sooner or later, it would have ended anyway.** Maybe years from now, but it couldn't have lasted an entire lifetime. 

- He made his choice to not choose me. HE doesn't want to be with ME. Devastating and heartbreaking as it may be, this is the one that really opened my eyes. I want someone who chooses me to be his best friend and partner in life. I don't know when I will meet that person, but when I do I'll be open to it. **I won't let this break me. I will find love again.**

I'm not over this by long shot. This was my first serious relationship, and MY GOD did I love him. I still do. But these realizations helped me a lot on the long road to recovery. Being single still seems very alien and scary to me. I miss being in a relationship as much as I miss him as a person. I can't even begin to picture myself dating someone else anytime soon.

But, every now and then, I catch a glimpse of that little light I talked about. Sometimes, single life doesn't seem all that...bad. I used to be overweight when I first started dating my now ex-bf. Since then, I lost a lot of weight and gained a lot of confidence. I get hit on quite a lot (don't mean to blow my own horn!). Maybe I should start enjoying this a little more?

If you made it all the way to here, I sincerely thank you :) and I wish you all the best. Just days ago I couldn't believe it myself but **it WILL get better!!!** You have to keep believing it will. Stay strong! :)

How to get over him",37,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/yam1a/breaking_up_how_to_get_over_him/,"
Getting over him.

It will be difficult.  It will feel often like you’re moving backwards.  Do not give up.  In fact?  Give in.  Give in to those feelings.  Feel everything you’re feeling so that it can leave you.  That is the goal.

Brave faces and stiff upper lips will only get you so far, and then, just like a dieter with the strongest of wills, they will break, and they will give their body what it needs.  You need to do the same.  And what your body needs is to grieve.  It needs to be allowed to feel its pain in its entirety, so do not shut it down.

There may be times when your pain has to take a back seat.  I understand this.  Sometimes the job interview, final exam, best-friend’s wedding is just unfortunately planned and you need to rise to the occasion.  I understand and support this, but only if this is the exception, not the norm, and you allow yourself to surrender to your emotions during your necessary process of healing and self-discovery.

Be patient with you, be kind.  Treat yourself like someone you truly love whose pain breaks your heart.  Feel the hurt, write it in a journal, let it go.  Do not re-think all the mistakes you made, all the mistakes he made, it is over.  Do not remember only the good.  Cherish it for what it was, but leave it in the past.

Watch your breathing; learn to return your focus to your body, your heart.  Learn to sit with yourself.  You will be okay.  You may always love him, but you will learn to love yourself more.  Just. Give it. Time.

Time is your new lover.  Time will let you be as sad as you want.  Time will let you pretend to be (sometimes actually be) okay and then let you come home, wash the make-up off your face, and admit to yourself that you’re not.  Time will not say, “I told you so.” Time will just sit with you.  Eventually, you’ll need less of it.  Eventually, you’ll feel whole again; but for now, know that you are whole.  This pain is a part of you, a part of the whole you.

Go gently.  Be kind.  Breathe in and breathe out.  This too shall pass.

Obviously I run the risk of her finding this one as well, but truth be told, I doubt she'll be able to find it and if she does, oh well, I already feel like shit. In any case, my ex-girlfriend and started talking again last week (Wednesday to be exact) and hanging out and acting like we used to. However, when she started talking to me again she made a note that she was talking to another guy and made it clear that I was simply a choice and that she was going to be making a decision between us two by the weekend. I know it is absolutely beyond stupid to be involved in something like this, and you should never allow someone to be their choice when you make them a priority (especially an ex-girlfriend). However, when it comes to love, logic seems to go completely out the door. 

In any case, we've been hanging out, going back and forth about our past and what happened. She continued to hold a negative stance, doubting everything and remaining extremely pessimistic, but I've persevered and remained positive and optimistic. I've always been a positive and happy individual, trying to make the best of every situation all for HER happiness. I always wanted to be sure that her happiness was absolute paramount to every situation, even though most of the time she was just generally unhappy and bitter for no reason at all. She continued acting this way while we've been talking again, and I knew where things were headed with how she was acting but I loved the comfort of having her around.

Last night I was hanging out with a friend, we were texting, things were all fine and dandy until out of nowhere she turns sour and becomes very short with me. She starts saying she doesn't feel like talking right now and passively making me feel like shit. I shrugged it off and ignored it since I was with a friend, fell asleep, then woke up to her linking the breakup post and saying to leave her alone, screw off, that she isn't the one in the wrong, how  she regrets seeing me, how she can't believe I needed to seek a pity party from strangers online and how I'm pathetic for it. She even said that she is going to act like I was never a part of her life, and holy fuck is that a dagger to the heart.

I love to see the mourning and the pain. It means you dared to feel, to remove yourself from the emotionless mass that's only looking to score, stick and move. We all are going to hit a point where crying or talking about it with friends and family gets tired. Enough is enough.

There's one little trick I've been using to get past my ex that's left me too tired to think of her: 10 pushups, or 5 pullups, or 10 crunches. With every thought you have of her/him, remind yourself of how you'll have to pay that down when you head home, alone with your thoughts. 5 thoughts today? That's rough - I owe 50 pushups. I walked through her neighborhood and can't see those restaurants or bars without thinking of those ""good times""? Well, looks like I'll be sore in the morning.

See how long this keep up before you do one of two things. 1) develop a distaste for thinking fondly through the Pavlov's dog method (*I do not have scientific backing for this, but I'd like to hear evidence against*) or 2) wake up one day, feeling better about your body through exercise and release of endorphins, and get that chip back on your shoulder. 

Enough shit. The pain and suffering will give way to anger and soreness. Maybe this isn't the absolute healthiest way to deal with this emotionally, but where's the harm? A mild distraction at the start will give way to better habits and overall better health.

They are your past, and it is time to start living in the present, and looking forward to the future.

Let us face some facts:

The fact that you're hurting this bad right now is because you feel like you've lost the ""love"" of your life. Haha, excuse me - I just pooped myself a little there. This girl, or boy was not the love of your life, and if you don't believe that, look at your situation. You've broken up for a reason. It doesn't matter if it was you, or your ex that broke up. Fact is you've broken up, and seriously - it is time to move on.

This isn't a romantic movie starring Adam Sandler. This is real life, and lettuce be reality my friends - chances are you won't get back together with your ex, and even if you do chances are you won't work out and then you'll be back to square one, hurting, yet again. 

Time heals all wounds - you've heard it - and it is true. Little by little, you'll start living again, you won't be constantly thinking of your ex, heck, there will be a time when you'll be laughing and cringing at how patethic you acted, and you'll thank yourself for dodging a bullet, and I mean a bullet from rocket launcher friends, a huge surprising bullet. 

Although it is true that time heals all wounds - you have to capitilize it. You have to take power of the situation, and let go and accept defeat in others. First of all - give up with your ex. Don't waste more time hoping for a better future. It isn't worth it. Somethings you just can't change, and this is one of them. What you can do is to make up your goddamned mind. It is time to grow and it is time to stop hurting. It is time - to start living for yourself. 

Now - listen to me friends, delete your ex from all social sites. You don't want to be reminded of the past. It's the past for a reason. Stop all contact. I don't want you to be friends with your ex, and I don't want you stalking their life. You're done with them. Time to act like you are. Instead of wasting so much energy on them, start spending it on yourself. Remember all the things you wanted to do, but never had the time to do? Well, it's time! Keep yourself occupied, keep yourself busy, and keep yourself happy. Soon, you'll come to realize that your life didn't revolve around your ex, and that you can live for yourself, love yourself, and when the time is right love someone else.

Now I'm not saying there is a magic pill that'll heall your wounds. What I am saying though is that there is a time when enough is enough. You just don't want to take more pain, and that's when you'll have to realize that ONLY YOU can make a difference. Others can't help you, I can't help you, only you can help yourself to grow and learn from this experience. You can only move on when you first accept that it's over, accept the pain, accept the good memories, and move on. 

Remember - pain is temporarily. It might last for days, or months, but it will go away. I apologize for the language, and gramatical errors, but I just realized that I've learned so much from being here, and it help'd me so much to come over my ex, that it was time to give something back to you.

Also, you spared my family and friends from hearing more than they had to about everything by letting me get it out of my system here first.

I learned so much more about the relationship, the breakup, and what I want out of future relationships because of ALL OF YOU.

Now, I've gotten to the point in life where I wanna talk about something else, which to me, is undeniable progress.  Yeah, I still think about her everyday, but the breakup no longer dominates what's on my mind.  I'm not much of an internet poster, so I'm gonna delete my account tonight.

For those who just broke up:  Fill the void.  And know that the void will gradually shrink over time.  And while the void keeps shrinking, keep filling it anyways, and soon it'll be so small that you'll sometimes forget that it's there.

I want all of you to take care of yourselves while you're going through this, and to know that we'll all find happiness again.  I recovered from Dad's death years ago; I'll be fine moving on from this breakup.

Keep your chin up !,37,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/y2cjv/fellow_redditors_keep_your_chin_up/,"Almost everyone here is going through a 'heart break'. Whether your relationship was for 9 years, or 1 month, we can all agree that giving so much of your energy/love to a SO just to have them shit all over your love is one of the worst feelings in the world.

So, now that it's done. You're letting yourself go. Sure, go binge eating. Eating all that chocolate can surely do good for your appearance right ? Spending all your time playing video games and redditing ? Why not. That's surely how abs appear on a body right ? 

WRONG.
You can do those things, but only for a certain amount of time. Binge eat and spoil yourself for a maximum of two weeks and then get back to a routine of being active and doing SOMETHING with your time. Remember, that it takes 28 days for something to turn in to a habit. You dont want binge eating as a habit do you ? 

Go out there once more. I know it's hard to do, but meet new people. Set up online dating accounts if you have to. Find new hobbies, and WRITE DOWN A LIST OF EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT YOUR EX. I found that this helps a lot. Every time you think of them, re-read this list. Re-read it until it's memorized in your head if you have to. They were not perfect, because they didn't realize the pure love you had for them. It's their loss.

Also, even in your darkest days, days where it feels like you can't move on. Days where you feel like they were THE ONE. The only one that can make you truly happy. Think of this.

YOU are NOT heart broken. Because if your heart was truly broken, you'd be fucking dead. 

Also, once you are fully recovered. Don't come back to r/breakups. You'd just get more depressed seeing everyone else's depressing stories.

Basically, I broke-up with (what I believed to be) the love of my life about 2 months ago (she cheated..twice), i'm sure if you clicked this you have already read most of the things  such as no-contact (which I vouch for) and time (only remedy) and reminding yourself that what you are feeling now, no matter how you feel (for me...it felt as if (if you could sit and imagine with me) being stuck in a lost dimension of black void, there is no sky, there is no floor, there is just the sense of falling and despair, as if there was no end or point, just a tragic misfortune to be born alive)


Basically, I was a mess hahaha, but honestly, here is what helped me move on quickly for the most part

- No Contact (This includes trying to find out any information on what they are up to, if you have bad self-control like me, download the program K9 and block such websites)


- Facing the reality, and laying the blame on no one, humans are imperfect, mistakes happen. You will feel better, time will make things better, day by day, don't dwell on the past or future, do what you can for the present to help direct you in a positive and productive path.


- Things like Soul-mate and etc, I have a different perspective on it, Actually let me give you a quote since it is well put,

 “We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, “This is the problem I want to have.”
I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way.
Let our scars fall in love.” 
― Galway Kinnell

- Accept that things happen for a reason, and there are millions of people out there who are compatible with you, who will treat you better, and who also understands the pain you went through - and would never want it to be experienced by someone they love as well.

- You need to limit your mindset and choices, if you keep doing what-ifs you are only hindering your own healing process.

- WORKOUT, STAY ACTIVE, EAT HEALTHY (HUGE help for me, big confidence booster)

- If you have a porn/masturbation addiction please look up benefits of NOFAP (Relevant for me since it helped me heal as well)

I don't know where i'm going with this, I just wanted to let anyone know, even if this serves as a temporary distraction from the pain, that it WILL get better, slowly but surely, and you will be happy again (Harvest that pain into productivity... force it, just do it - if that means working out or reading books, or going out there to find a job - just do it)

“There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must of felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life. 
― Alexandre Dumas

""The depth of our despair measures what capability and height of claim we have to hope.""

 But a few years later she met another guy. They were engaged for 5 years, with plans for marriage the next year. One day he cheated on her and she found out. She took him back (because she was madly in love with him) and he told her he wanted to move from california, to chicago. She agreed because she loved him that much. A few days after they sold the house she fell in love with also, he called her from chicago and told her he was staying there and had found somebody else. 

But because of this, she went to stay with her best friend (m) and they lived together for two years before becoming romantically involved. another two years later and he proposed to her. And now she is very very happy and with somebody who actually treats her right. in fact he spoils her.

I know she's not perfect, I can see her flaws and how difficult things would be for us, but at the same time she was perfect to me. I simply loved her unconditionally, and rationally made the choice to want to spend the rest of my life with her, through thick and thin. I confessed my absolute love for her, she told me she didn't feel the same way anymore, we had no future together, and to move on. She did. Someone else is going to get the future that I wanted with her, the one we talked about.

It's been 4 months, I can't move on. I don't see the point. This is more than just a loss of a loved one. It's the loss of my future children, the loss of the only life I wanted to live. Every day I keep having suicidal thoughts rationalizing that there's no point in living knowing that in the back of my mind I will always be wishing for what could have been. There's a difference between living and being alive. Something is just wrong with me. I will be seeking help but don't have access to it for a while so that's why I'm needing to vent now.

**Your (ex-) partner is not as much a part of your identity as you think they are**

After leaving him, all the things I thought would be missing from my life really are just open spaces to create and expand my own identity. I thought the people around me would view me as a failure, but friends came out of the woodwork to offer support. I thought I could never run a household without a partner who contributed so much, but now I am just less lazy about housework. I thought my life would somehow be less without this person, but really I just have more space to be myself and grow without hesitation or having to check someone else. It's a very liberating feeling, and it took a couple weeks to really realize, ""hey, I may no longer have this person here with me every day, but my life has not drastically changed. I am still me, and now I have many more opportunities to be a better me.""

Never give up.,31,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g0n01/be_strong_be_encouraged_you_can_get_through_your/,"Just wanted to share my experience.

My first real heartbreak hit me like a truck. Was with my ex for 3 years and when it finally hit me, it was rough.

Physically it felt like I was hit by a truck. My chest would tighten when I thought about him and the relationship, all the time that was invested, the things that were lost, etc. (and i thought about this pretty much all day at the time). My stomach hurt, it was hard to eat.

Emotionally, it was draining. I cried at the drop of a dime or struggled incredibly hard to not cry while I was at work (retail) and sometimes had tears in my eyes while talking to customers.

This lasted a week or 2.

Then one day while I was thinking about what I was going to do with my life without him, I realized, **I WAS DOING JUST FINE BEFORE HIM AND I WILL BE FINE AFTER HIM.**

I started really thinking, what *WAS* I doing before him? I remembered my hobbies and the things I liked to do with my friends. I remembered what I REALLY wanted out of life.

And then I realized that I wasn't doing anything I really liked while I was with him. Our relationship was toxic on some levels and the rest of it was just work. I overlooked a lot of stupid things that he did that i would NEVER let anyone else get away with.

It was like a film had been lifted over my eyes and I could really see clearly.

I started refocusing and doing all of the things I liked doing that I never really did while I was with him. Walks at the beach, drawing, studying more for my classes, focusing more at my job, friends. Lots and lots of friend time.

And whenever any sadness would try to stir me up, I kept on reminding myself that **I was doing just fine before him and that I'll be just fine after him.** I realized that my world was not stopping because of him. 

There was so much more life to live!

New York
November 10, 1958

Dear Thom:

We had your letter this morning. I will answer it from my point of view and of course Elaine will from hers.

First—if you are in love—that’s a good thing—that’s about the best thing that can happen to anyone. Don’t let anyone make it small or light to you.

Second—There are several kinds of love. One is a selfish, mean, grasping, egotistical thing which uses love for self-importance. This is the ugly and crippling kind. The other is an outpouring of everything good in you—of kindness and consideration and respect—not only the social respect of manners but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as unique and valuable. The first kind can make you sick and small and weak but the second can release in you strength, and courage and goodness and even wisdom you didn’t know you had.

You say this is not puppy love. If you feel so deeply—of course it isn’t puppy love.

But I don’t think you were asking me what you feel. You know better than anyone. What you wanted me to help you with is what to do about it—and that I can tell you.

Glory in it for one thing and be very glad and grateful for it.

The object of love is the best and most beautiful. Try to live up to it.

If you love someone—there is no possible harm in saying so—only you must remember that some people are very shy and sometimes the saying must take that shyness into consideration.

Girls have a way of knowing or feeling what you feel, but they usually like to hear it also.

It sometimes happens that what you feel is not returned for one reason or another—but that does not make your feeling less valuable and good.

Lastly, I know your feeling because I have it and I’m glad you have it.

We will be glad to meet Susan. She will be very welcome. But Elaine will make all such arrangements because that is her province and she will be very glad to. She knows about love too and maybe she can give you more help than I can.

And don’t worry about losing. If it is right, it happens—The main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away.

Love,

Fa

While it meant a lot in my life, there's so much else...so many things that are important, why waste time on something so silly?

This may have made me feel so much in a short amount of time, but hey, there are so many things in this world. There are so many things that might want me, so many things I can do for others, so many ways I can help. This is a breakup. Yes, it really hurts that this person does not want to explore all of these things in life with me, but damn if I'm not a strong person. Everyone sees it in me. I am strong, I've gone through a lot, I am intelligent, I am insightful, I am perceptive, I care about people and about living creatures. 

It is time for me, not to stop feeling, but to get past this. I cannot wallow in pain forever, or just sit around waiting for him to change his mind. I love him, but hey, I've got a lot to offer this world. Maybe I can channel some of these feelings into art or something, I already have, and maybe these feelings will help me relate to others.

Every bit of suffering helps me understand more people, I like to think. Sometimes I think he broke up with me as a gift... I would not have done it to him, but I've been through quite a bit since it happened. I am not the exact same girl I was. I had to take a look at myself and at the things around me. I'm not a mature, perfect individual by any means, but I don't regret anything that has happened... I learn from it. I wouldn't have done so much for myself, to help myself, without this breakup. I had to take a look at myself and try to make myself feel better instead of just focusing on the needs and wants of other people.

I need to, at least, stop thinking about him and the breakup as much. It is time to stop dwelling, and instead time to return to well...part of who I was before I ever fell in love with anyone but mostly this new me... maybe not ""someone's"" or part of a couple or a partner in life but... just me. This person, this person who I've neglected to love as much as she deserved.

A poem shared with me by my English teacher was...
Love After Love by Derek Walcott

Search it. I was going to post it here, but I screwed up the formatting.

Now, whoever is reading this. I love you. I know, I don't really know you as much as I'd like to, but you're a fascinating individual. You've been through a heck of a lot too, haven't you? No matter what realizations you go through or where your path leads, you're fantastic! You don't have to feel the same way I do right now, I am young and still learning.

1363710332.0,31,self.BreakUps,1allzb,Woke up to a text message this morning.,36,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1allzb/woke_up_to_a_text_message_this_morning/,"I, 22 male, cannot figure out even remotely where to begin.

When I was sixteen I met a girl just a month or two younger than me, we'll call her Jane because I think she's a redditor as well. We hungout and flirted a lot, smoking pot and doing badass things that badass highschool kids do. 

Shortly after turning eighteen, we started dating, and the chemistry was instantly clear. She didn't take my virginity, nor did I take hers, we both had a bit of sexual experience. Our sex life was on fire, 5 to seven times a day was the usual, the record was 9 times in a night.

It wasn't just sex, we were like the same person, we always got along, no matter what happened.

We started living together, and after about year of that, we started fighting. Brutal, screaming fights with both of us verbally abusing the other. About anything and everything. I'd like to think that she started about 90% of the fights, at least in the start, but she would tear me apart for the simplest reasons, so I started growing resentful. I hated being treated like shit all the time, so I started being an irrational prick as well.

I came home from work one night and the house was empty. I went out and got drunk, told myself I was finally single, woke up the next morning and felt the lowest I have ever felt in my life.

After a few weeks we started talking again, she had moved in with a friend about two hours drive from here. She moved back in, and it everything was just peachy.

That lasted for about two days. We fought again for a couple weeks, I woke up one morning and realized how bad it was getting. I said to her ""Listen, I know it's getting bad, but I am going to make an active effort to make this work. You are the only thing I want in my life, please, just let me quit this job and find something new, and I promise things will be different. Just give me this chance"".

At the time, I was stuck working in a hotel 60 hours a week, doing 5 peoples jobs. I was only 19 or 20 and it was burning me out very fast.

I left for work after I said that, and texted her while I was there. Making sure she knew how I felt, ect, ect.

Got home from work 14 hours later, and she was gone again.

Of course, like clockwork, we start talking again, Every couple weeks I would drive the two hours to where she was living and we'd get a hotel and pretend to be normal for a day or two. Things started working out being fun again. The hotel I was working at got shut down and my attitude on life completely changed.

After a couple months of that, she started cancelling at the last second on me. I decided to let it go. It killed me.

Fast forward a year and half.

We never really spoke for this whole time, I knew she had a boyfriend and I was out slutting around myself. I never stopped thinking about her. I knew I fucked up. It was my own stress and mistakes that made her leaving. I had the same reoccuring dream where I would beg her to take me back, and she would just smile, and then very calmly spit in my face and push me away.

These dreams tore me up more than anything in the actual relationship did.

 I got a text out of the blue a few months ago. She start talking, completely friendly, nothing relationship wise.

Very casually, she slips this into a conversation ""My cars being a peice of shit because my fiancee's mom put the wrong gas in it"".

Fiancee.

I'm drunk at the bar when I see this. I immediately profess my love via text message. I tell her about how I never stopped thinking about her.

She tells me the feeling is mutual and how she doesn't really love her fiancee.

I'm on cloud nine for day while we text back and forth, and call each other constantly, I feel brand new. She's going to college in the city she's living in, I'm doing good things with my life, everything is working out.

We start making plans to move in together again. I start looking at apartments in her area, I bought a car, I put away almost every dollar from my paychecks and budgeted like a motherfucker.

She starts growing distant again. I tell myself that the novelty is starting to wear out, but we are getting along better than we ever have before.

I start talking to a girl I met a while back. I tell myself it's fine because ""jane"" has a boyfriend and probably isn't going abstinent for me.

I went out on a date with this girl a couple weeks ago. Best first date I've ever had. Dinner, a movie, then a bottle of wild turkey and wild sex in a motel room.

I stopped texting ""jane"" as much because I'm starting to have feelings for the new girl.

 I realize how big of a fool i've been to let ""jane"" play me for so long. I'm always the person to say ""I love you"" first. I'm always the person that calls or texts first. I'm the one waiting hours for a reply.

I open a draft e-mail, and begin to explain that this will never work. I will never put myself in the position to have my heart torn out, and to be lied to. I put it all out there. 

I realize that breaking it off with a girl via e-mail or text message. We both have too much time invested this.

I made the mistake of instagramming my meal on one of my dates with ""new girl"". This was a mistake because I hate when people do this, but it was a delicious steak salad.

I get a text message a couple days ago: ""Who were you out to dinner with"".

I reply: ""Nothing really serious if that's what you are asking""

""I wasn't asking if it was serious. Look, I can't do this anymore"".


I thought I would be devasted. I'm relieved. I'm shocked, thats for sure, but this lie that has been the last six and half years of my life is over.

I wish I would have sent my break-up e-mail first though.

I drank a couple celebration beers and a smoked a few celebration dabs of oil before I wrote this, so I apologize for the bad formatting and grammar errors.

I think i might have a few more weeks of coming back here before i say goodbye. But before i leave, I want to help anyone i can along the way.

I have been coming here for about 2-3 months maybe. not even sure anymore. I am still very much in love with the person i broke up with. I miss her and would kill just to hold her again. but the reality is, she is gone from my life and there will never be a moment where i can see or talk to her again. Am i ok with this? no i am not.. do i have a choice? no i don't. As much as i miss her, there isn't anything i can do to get her back. All i can do is accept this, and move on.

1) First off.. its ok to cry. girl/boy, man or woman… crying does help. let it out as often as you can. it is a good way of flushing your pain out.

2) be as social as you can.. talk to as many people as you can about your problems. as for advice.. ask for companionship. let others know you need their help. the people who matter the most will surface throughout your hardships. This is the moment you see who your real friends are.

3) if you don't have any friends.. go out and make new ones. step outside your comfort zone for a change. what do you have to lose really?

4) be active.. work out.. play sports.. this helps trust me on this.. your body and mind will thank you  so much

6) no contact!!!! do not contact your ex for any reason. this will only hinder any recovery. if you want to contact your ex, understand that you will have lost weeks or months of effort all in a single text message. 

this is the point in your life where you find yourself. i am currently fighting the biggest depression of my life after losing my ex, but the way i see it, i might actually come out of this a better man for it. 

you will hurt.. you will cry.. your moods will go up and down like an elevator. there is nothing anyone will say to help you out of your darkness. you must be willing to make the effort though. the more effort you put into your recovery, the faster you will heal. 

Thank you to everyone who has helped me.. i hope that one day i can be happy enough on my own to find a new love. i still need some time to recover fully, but i know in TIME, things will be ok one day.

Yet another sob story! Woo! Who's excited? Anyhow, my (well I guess ex as of this morning) girlfriend (22yo) told me that while I was on a business trip not too long ago that she made out with her best friend. We were on the rocks recently as it is, and now I don't feel the same about her. In my eyes (I'm 25), she cheated on me. Most of my friends seem to think that it's different if it's two girls as opposed to her kissing another guy. Some of them would say that they would be turned on even. My now-ex has said the same things to me. I guess this is my own issue, but I see all people as equals. Male, female... gay, straight... I don't care. You're either monogamous or you're not.

Since this has come out, she has been spending more and more time with her slutty little friend. That might seem mean, but it's the truth. Her friend (we'll call her Stacey) was dating a good friend and business partner of mine for a few years. My friend recently went to Europe for schooling for two months and during that time, ""Stacey"" was fooling around with somewhere around 3 different people, my ex-girl being one of them. He found out about one of the guys she fooled around with and broke up with her over it. He has no idea about the female interaction, but I feel like he probably wouldn't care much at this point. He's moved on already. 

My problem here is that since she made out with this girl, she has been spending more and more time with her. I understand that they are friends and she needs support especially when we aren't doing so well, but I can't help but have the sneaking suspicion that it's this person who is driving an axe through our relationship. This is not to say that I haven't done wrong in this relationship before, (not cheating by any means mind you) as there are bumps in every single one... but since she has come out about kissing her friend she has completely shut herself off to me. She claims that she wants things to work but doesn't give me the time of day. I just feel in my gut that her friend is manipulating her.

Last night, we went out to dinner with a mutual friend who is a neighbor of ours. She proceeded to not acknowledge me anywhere, or talk even, and my friend stopped us both near the end of our night (around 10:30pm) and called us out on our shit. We were already winding down to go home at this point, but she freaked and ""couldn't believe"" that he could say such a thing, or that we wanted to leave so early. When we got home, she went over to his house and bitched him out for two hours about saying something like that to us in public. This is totally out of her normal character! She is kind, sweet, and funny. Something has changed.

Either way, at some point between leaving the neighbors and coming home, she got WASTED. Woke up at 3am this morning before work to her throwing up all over the place. Bed, floor, etc. Totally blackout drunk. Came back from the bathroom and asked why I had stripped the bed. That bad. Got up a second time at 4am and threw up more, same questions. Again at 5am. I got almost no sleep last night and had to answer to my CEO this morning as I was late. Anyhow, I told her this morning that I deserve some respect and that I was done. She started packing, I left for work. 

After typing all of that, I don't even know why I'm posting this anymore, I guess I just had to get this out. For the last 3.5 years, she has been the most amazing, funny and understanding girl I have ever been with. Recently, she has turned into a cold-hearted bitch. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. So I guess my question to you is this: am I in the wrong because I felt like she cheated on me?

TL;DR: Girlfriend makes out with female friend while I am on business trip. During a fight, she proceeds to tell me about this (drunkenly). I tell her I feel like she cheated on me but I am trying to forgive her, she shuts down and 3.5 years comes to an end. Am I in the wrong for thinking that all people are equals?

You owe them **no** consideration.  **No** thoughts. You are **not** in their debt. You owe them **nothing**. You are **free** from them.  Do whatever **you** want to. 

They left you.  They are off in their own world now.  By God I hope you aren't talking to them/looking at their Facebook.  If you are - BLOCK THEM.  Don't even think about, just do it; because after you do then you are forced to re-friend them to see anything, and you sure as hell ain't doin' that til you are over them.

Why you broke up is irrelevant.  They *hurt* you.  Do not let them hinder your success in life.  There are *many* people out there who are going to like you and want to be with you, don't let your ex delay you meeting those people. If you do then they are winning.

I think it's a shame that no one encouraged him to discuss with me. All he did was give me a ""trial week"" that I had no idea about and during that week he didn't discuss anything, issues or fixes. I was kept in the dark and then suddenly, he just ends it and stops talking to me. (The no contact rule should only really be used to get over someone who you don't want to be friends with again in my opinion. It's more damaging than people realise..)

(I had some depressing issues in my life making me miserable) But I realise that there is not much of a chance now to work things out since he is absolutely set on his decision.

It really pains me that he wasn't able to confront me and try to work things out. Don't cut a knot when it can be untied. I have lost an amazing guy and I know that fighting for him just pushes him away further. So I am taking this time to improve myself.

Obviously there is some good advice on here, but remember that your baggage and situation is completely unique and might not be the same for someone else. Just be mindful that some people don't look at the situation from all angles or get unbiased advice, so your advice can actually end up being the make or break in someone else's life.

I know you will never read these words; they need to come out of me.

I love you more than words can say.

You have been my soul mate, my best friend, my everything, and unfortunately, for a time, my caregiver.

We have been through so much… so much joy… so much pain.

We have been together our entire adult lives.

Cancer, was never part of our plan, nor was addiction. I know the damage that was done; I can no longer punish myself for it every waking minute of my life.

I have always believed that despite the complex details that make up whatever it is we were facing… we simply needed to ask a single question to figure out what to do next…

That question was simple; What do you want?

I have always and continue to respond, I want it to work out.

It seems that at this point in our relationship you can’t say the same.

Your silence speaks volumes; your expressionless face tells me your answer.

I am realizing you let go a long time ago, I didn't notice because I was holding on so tightly.

I can’t continue to fight for something that is no longer mutual.

To continue to do so will rip me apart.

I no longer hold you to the vows we spoke 20 years ago.

It’s not fair to either of us. I am so so sorry.

I’m letting go.


*** I originally wrote this in September of 2011, after a 24 year relationship. I meant every word of it. I post it now because I believe my heart only recently caught up to my my brain.

 Since this writing I have experienced the unbelievable. I have survived what I was told was not survivable. This incredible journey to where I am today, has made me what I am today.

My point.. In the beginning of our end, when she asked for a divorce, I was so despondent that I made my first call to a suicide hotline number... Fast forward to now.... And today I can say without doubt, I love myself and I am the strongest person I know. It's the first time in my 45 years that I say this. My future has an excitement to it that is beyond words.

So to my friends who hurt so so much, cry all day and see no future. 

Look within, you will never find your strength in someone else.

Dig deep. Then dig deeper. The power is there, you have more than you know. I promise you...

1355970218.0,28,self.BreakUps,1557va,(28M) blindsided by hoodwinking wife (31F).  Things aren't always as they seem...,33,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1557va/28m_blindsided_by_hoodwinking_wife_31f_things/,"Hey Reddit.  Falling on hard times and just wanted to put my thoughts down into writing... to share my story and perhaps do a little venting.  Thanks in advance for reading.  

In my experience, many people segue into romantic relationships without getting to truly know one another first… Instead they wind up getting to know one another in the relationship.  Consequently, the couple eventually discovers their values/expectations/goals/interests/etc don’t align in healthy ways and in the long term, resentment builds and things go sour.  It's happened to me in past relationships and I'm sure it's happened to you once or twice.

See, I thought I had something so much different with my wife.  We knew each other for five years before we even started dating.  I feel like we had a unique opportunity to foster a relationship with a strong foundation of trust and a deep mutual-respect.  We were best friends.  We wanted the same things out of life and out of each other.  Everyone always said we were the perfect couple.  We both thought so too!  We were a fantastic together.  With my heart of hearts I loved her, and she loved me in kind.  We had been married almost a year, and I thought things couldn't be better.  I knew I would be spending the rest of my life with this woman.  

Welp.  So much for that.

Time machine to two months ago.  She returned from a long business trip and I could sense immediately something was off.  She was distant and withdrawn.  I asked if everything was okay.  It took some prying to get it out of her, but the end result was she felt she was no longer in love with me.  She feared she was wrong about me; that I wasn't the “right person for her” after all.  She said I neglected her needs, that she gave me every opportunity to tend to them, and that I never made the proper effort to do so.  While I was blindsided by this revelation, I was understanding, patient and graceful.

I held myself accountable for everything.  I took responsibility for not being my best self, for not being her “ideal” husband, and for not meeting her every need as a partner.  I identified things that I could do better, and I made a concerted effort to work on these things because I wanted my wife back.  I vowed to improve not just for her and for our marriage, but for myself.  Cue self-improvement montage: Started personal counseling, read self-improvement books, sought advice from friends and family.  I gathered the tools to set myself up for success in the marriage and took action.  At that point, however, it was too late.  After many days of discussion, she had all but convinced me that my efforts were in vain, and that I was solely to blame for the dissolution of our relationship.  I encouraged her to participate in marriage counseling with me, but she refused.  There was nothing she needed to “work on”.  

She herself never pushed specifically for a divorce, but it was implicit that was outcome she desired.  She wanted me to arrive at that conclusion myself, using only the information she had given me.  She continued to lead me down a path where divorce was the only option because I was not “the one”.  A path where I was the dysfunctional party and she was the victim trapped with someone she didn't love.  I was going to have to live with that for the rest of my life.  That I just wasn't good enough for her, and that if I truly loved her I had to let her go.

It turns out she had left out one salient detail.  Imagine my surprise when I find out the whole time she has been blaming me for all that is wrong with our relationship, she has been having an affair with another man.  Not just sleeping with him, but surreptitiously pursuing a relationship with him, booking clandestine vacations, making long term plans.  Actually apologizing to him about having to be sneaky, and needing to take care of her baggage back home.  Can you believe that?  I have become her baggage.  I am nothing more than a loose end that she needs to take care of so she can move on with her life with this new man she now “loves”.  

I feel completely hoodwinked.  I trusted her like a retarded loyal dog and she cheated on me.  While that alone is a huge slap in the face, she practically blames me for driving her to do it.  Who fucking does that?  She takes absolutely zero accountability for her actions, and she shows no remorse.  Sure, she was “sorry” when she got caught, but I think it was “sorry” THAT she got caught, not that she threw me under a bus and played me like a fiddle.  She claims that she still loves and respects me, but her actions speak for themselves.  That’s not love and respect, that’s complete and utter contempt thereof.  Just a complete dereliction of character…

I feel slightly vindicated, however.  It feels good knowing that I dodged a bullet.  That I wasn't entirely to blame, after all.  That when the going gets tough, I’m the kind of person who gives 100% to fight for a cause I believe in, and she’s the kind of person who jumps to the next best thing because it's easier.  The kind of person who spoils what they have by desiring what they have not… Never satiated.  The kind of person always chasing that fleeting excitement.  The kind of person who will probably never be really, truly happy.

I’ll be fine.  My life has come crashing down. I've been spending the last few months trying to pick up the pieces, trying to figure out what the hell just happened.  But fuck the pieces anyway.  I’m a good man with a huge heart and a lot of love to give.  I deserve better.  So do you all.  Just move on.  

Cheers, thanks for listening.

TL;DR:  Thought I found the love of my life.  Yeah, I was way off.  Just a lesson that things are not always as they seem.  Life goes on!

**EDIT:** It looks like my words resonated with a lot of you who have gone (or are currently going) through a similar experience.  I'd like to share what has helped me stay positive through this shitstorm.  Like I mentioned above, I've spent the last two months trying to figure out how my life devolved into such a nightmare.  But I quickly came to realize that sulking in your perceived failures blinds you to the solutions, and to the happiness you (and the people around you) truly deserve.  Right now it’s impossible to see that proverbial light at the end of the tunnel when it’s so muddled by the range of very normal human emotions you’re experiencing.  It’s a process you need to ride out.  But through this process you must remind yourself that no matter what: that light IS there, even if you can’t quite see it yet.  Moreover, it will still be there when you’re ready to approach it.  It takes a lot of strength and courage to pick yourself up, dust off and start moving forward.  Once you start doing that, things will get better with time.  I know that for a fact, my friends.

I tentatively wrote about my own experience in a very very low moment (didn't really give too much away).

But i think i've just had a breakthrough and i wanted to share it.

I was very much in love with my now ex of 2 years. I still am probably as it's only been a short time since we split. But I have slowly been trying to heal myself (hit the gym, getting out with friends). I had kept in contact with my ex over the last month while we were both travelling from home.

I realized that I was waiting for his emails/fb's and was bending myself inside out trying to decipher a hidden meaning (he kept saying he was thinking of me).

A couple of days ago I asked for a Skype date and we had one. I told him I loved him, wanted to be with him and wanted to work out our issues (truly, i was blind sided by our breakup, but with the perspective of a month, I see that i was glossing over a number of issues that WERE big). He told me he loved me, a part of him wanted to be with me, but he didn't think it would work. I sort of knew this was coming.

Throughout this breakup process he has said much the same thing. He has said, ""i'm not saying we can never get back together, but not right now.""

We had dinner just before we both left and when he drove me home I asked him point blank if he wanted to be with me. His response: ""Not right now.""
Me: does that mean no?
Him: no...

All of my friends and family have said this is unfair and his confusion/indecisive speak has been stringing me along.

Finally today I made a decision.

I am not attracted to someone who doesn't know point blank that I am the right person for him. I have felt this about him for months, but now I know that I don't want to be with someone that doesn't want to be with me.

He doesn't deserve me right now.

And it is over.

The breakthrough is deciding for myself that I don't want to be with him.

During our Skype conversation I told him we needed to have a period of NO CONTACT. I deleted him off FB. I told his brothers (two of my closest friends) what the score was.

When we were saying goodbye over Skype he was teary, and so was I. But we blew each other a kiss and that is that.

He can't have me. I'm worth more than indecisive fear. We were talking (I was talking) about moving in together at the end of the year.

I can't be with someone who balks at the gate.

Make the choice in your mind to be happy and to be single. They don't deserve you. Maybe one day they will, but if they haven't figured it out - then you are better off.

I know everything seems awful and you just want to text/call/facebook message them one last time. Those lonely nights in your bed seem daunting and everyday is dragging on... Don't do it! 

I'm only 22f and I've been the dumpee(?) of 3 long term relationships.

I knew what I would become if I kept in contact with him. So I deleted and blocked him from FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, FourSquare, Tumblr everything - I am non-existant to him online and that is the only place we'll ever run into each other.

I've had my family and my best friends by my side the whole time cheering me on, I've taken care of my body, my diet and my life. I've never felt so blessed. 

There will be another love in your life. You WILL get over this. 

Make the effort to see your friends: Old, new, forgotten. Even if you haven't been the best friend you could have been because you put yourself on couple island, or if the last time you spoke to them you fell out, a true friend will always want to catch up with you and make you feel better. 

I found out that he was already sleeping with some girl we both met at a party. I did't cry. I was barely even sad and that just shows how far I've come. 

You are not lonely. I know it feels bad now but go for a long run or walk with your headphones. Play something that makes you happy. Meet up with your friends and eat healthily. 

If you ever see them again, don't look like a snivelling mess. Look like you've OWNED the opportunity to take control of your own life without an SO. You are awesome - remember that.

My goal is to simply share a story with those who might be interested in reading it. I could go on forever but I will try to keep it concise. My closer friends and family know the majority of the story, but as the 1 year mark approaches, I haven't been able to fully separate myself and move on from the past.

**Prehistory:**
I met a girl, who I now cannot name, maybe 7 years ago at a job we both worked at. I cannot name her because her name has sort of become like a poison to me. She is simply known to me, my friends and family, as *she* or *her*.

In the beginning we started out, like many people, as friends. We both saw each other get into and go through stupid relationships but we, devoid of religious connotation, kept our purity. After that, we both mutually felt we could offer each other something more. During the summer before we were official, she used to come over and we would make supper, watch TV shows or movies on my laptop, and sometimes lay on my bed in a head-to-head way, not in a *together* or spooning way. I never thought anything too deep about it at the time, but as the summer wore on, suddenly we were hugging goodbye, I was walking her to her car, she was arriving with cold Starbucks drinks on hot summer days, etc. This seemed like a very natural progression, so we discussed where we were headed. We both said we wanted to be with each other. At this point we had been good friends for a little over 1 year and were working towards a relationship status for about 4 months. Who better to be in a relationship than your best friend?

**The Dark Ages:**
I was due to fly to the USA from Canada 2 days after we were officially together to attend a friends wedding. She used this time to tell her parents about it. Evidently they did not see the ideal aspect of two friends being together due to a small age gap. Normally I dislike the idea of a girl being in high school and being with someone older who is out of high school, but we had been friends prior, so it seemed natural to us. Additionally, I had been to her house (she lived on a farm 40 minutes outside of town) over a dozen times, met her parents, had supper with her family many times, etc. so I clearly wasn't a terrible person out for ""only one thing"" and we had a prior friendship as our foundation. We ended up *sneaking* to see each other after either of us got off work or before she went to school, etc. but one night her mother saw my car parked next to hers in the mall parking lot (having a lime green car was kind of detrimental to sneaking around). Her father phoned me the next day and wanted to talk with me. He said they (he and her mother) felt I was too old for her, but if ""it's meant to be, then it's meant to be"", and if we wait (until she's 18) and it happens, then they would give their blessing. I guess they were hoping we would lose interest or be deterred. We resolved that we would wait 6 months until she was 18. We talked on the phone for hours every night, which her parents knew about, but couldn't really stop. Before her 18th birthday, her parents asked what she wanted as a gift and she said to see me. They relented. A sort of awkward birthday supper at a restaurant ensued and I tried my best to not remember the time we had to wait to be with each other or hold it against them. I told her when she'd discuss being fed up with their decision, because it wasn't deterring us, that they are only looking out for her and I wasn't even worried because when you willingly wait for someone and when they willingly wait for you like that, how can you ever feel any differently than *you are made for each other*. The first day we were together again, I put a ring on her finger. She knew it was coming and was anxious with excitement when I told her to close her eyes. Her huge smile as I slipped the ring on her finger burns in my mind.

**Post Dark Ages:**
Finally we were free. When we would meet, she would jump into my arms. I would spin her around. When either of us would leave, we hugged so tightly and make hearts with our hands as either of us were about to drive away. We gave ourselves to each other and as time went on, things got better and better. Devoid of ego or elitism, I used to be almost *envy* myself(?) because of what I had with her that many people likely would never experience. She used to talk about how chivalry was dead, but once we were together, she realized it wasn't entirely dead. I treated her like the princess that she was (which became a nickname of sorts) and she used to talk about me saving her from a world of stupid ineffectual and inconsiderate people (we lived in a fairly redneck town and she went to a fairly redneck school). The saddest part up until this point was how I, before being with her, used the nickname Tinuviel for someone I was with briefly before, which I could not just recycle. She then became Evenstar because I draw silly parallels between things to give them more significance. Aragorn fought a war for Middle-earth and only afterwards did Elrond allow them to wed, I fought a war against time to wait for her. Arwen waited for Aragorn, she waited for me. I portrayed this in a drawing I made for an Xmas gift to her during The Dark Ages:

As her graduation drew near she determined she wanted to be a teacher. She was accepted into a university that was 2 hours away. No worries, we are strong enough that if we could go 6 months not seeing each other, 2 hours away doesn't matter. Typically drove there on weekends. After a couple years I ended up moving to that city and we moved in together. This was the moment we had been discussing for years. On our first night she falls into my arms, looks up at me with her beautiful sunlight filled brown eyes and softly says ""Finally, we made it..."" I kissed her and carried her to our bedroom where we christened the bed.

As the days passed, things just got better and better. We celebrated our anniversary, birthdays, carved pumpkins and had a tiny Xmas tree. Being too excited for Xmas, she wanted to open gifts early. Her gift to me was new cologne which she promptly sprayed onto me, along with lingerie which she modeled. It was the best Xmas ever. Having family in other cities, we spent the first half of the holiday with her family and the second half with mine. She always liked visiting my family. So we came back after the holidays were over and she wanted to move to a larger apartment. No problem. We found a nice one and moved into it in mid February. She even brought her cat from her parents house. I thought now she had everything she wanted: A larger apartment, a room to study in, a bigger kitchen, her cat. She seemed happy and still every day when either she or I would return home, we would hug and kiss in greeting as we always had done. All throughout our time living together, she would watch wedding shows and proclaim things like ""I can't wait to get married to you!"" and ""When we get married, you will totally have to design our invitations!"" In truth, a marriage proposal was only about a year away from that point in time. That way we could be engaged for about a year or a year and a half then get married after she was done school. It was the plan we both had. We couldn't wait for our future to unfold.

**Prelude to The New Dark Ages:**
It was her birthday just over 1 month after we moved into our new apartment. As mid-March drew closer, I got tickets to one of her favourite bands. For that night I had bought a couple really nice cuts of steak, grilled them up to near perfection along with a side dish, then we went to The Trews and talks about how it was the best birthday and how great I am. Soon after was to be the release of The Hunger Games. Having read the book, she really wanted to see the film. I decided to read it first and finished it in 3 days before opening night. We went to purchase our tickets from a kiosk and she did something she never had done before... The debit machine wasn't accepting the card as I was trying to swipe it. She took the card, tried to swipe it herself, and as it didn't accept it, she threw my debit card on the ground. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but what's the big deal to throw it on the ground? I, I guess, didn't know what to do. I was close to calling the night off, but suck it up and learn to let things go, after all, sometimes people have bad moves, plus we were in love, so it's easier to forgive and forget. She apologized. Days later she was becoming visibly despondent. She never acted like this before. What do I do? ""What's wrong?"", ""Nothing""... ""What are you thinking about?"", ""School""... "" but she was still smiling and laughing for the most part. She was still eating the suppers and breakfasts I was making, and after I did the dishes, as was a nightly thing, she was still receptive to me rubbing her feet, or legs, or even a full body massage, which became basically a nightly routine. I often gave her massages, often to work out the pain of her working on a cement floor at her job, or to help her relax after studying or tests from school. I was always elated because I got to touch her body. It didn't matter that sometimes I would rather have been playing League of Legends instead of giving her a 30-45 minute massage every night, but we were in love.

After a few days of despondency, she wrote me a letter to read when I got home from work, by which point she would be at work. The 3 page letter apologized for her being so distant, that she had an initial feeling of being unsure of us which she CONCLUDED was actually a feeling of being unsure of her future in terms of career, living location, etc., but that she the ONE THING she was ABSOLUTELY sure of was in fact ""us"". She declared me to me a pillar in her life, her soulmate, her confidant, the love of her life. She didn't know where she'd work, where she'd live, but the one thing she knew was that I was the one thing in her life she was certain of. She said she was scared to death that she ""almost threw it all away."" When she arrived home, I gave her the biggest hug I could.

**The New Dark Ages:**
We were set to go to my hometown and visit my family for the Easter break, but less than 3 weeks after her last bout of despondency, she became extremely distant. On April 1st she woke up fine, went to work, came home, we made quiche and had one of our ""naked naps"" during the afternoon. She woke up distant and disconnected. ""What's wrong?"", ""Nothing""... Over the next few days she would gradually stop looking at me to the point that when she responded, she wasn't looking at me at all. She still ate the dinners I made. I went to sleep on the couch but she wanted me to sleep in the bed. I said ""You aren't coming with me this weekend, are you..."" she said no. I asked if she was leaving. Tears filled her eyes and poured down her face within seconds. Her lips trembled and her voice uttered an almost inaudible ""Yes..."" I asked her why. She said something about not being happy. I asked why. She couldn't answer. Not because of her cutting the eternal bond she so cherished, but because I don't think she actually had an answer. I asked if there was someone else. She said no. Then why throw it all away? I'll never know. She left it at that. She's not happy but she can't give me an actual reason as to why. ""Is it me?"" I asked, ""No, you are perfect..."" she said. So what's the problem? Was she unfaithful at some point? I won't ever know... She asked if I wanted the ring I gave her back. I said ""No, it was a gift, like my heart...""

That night I was out until 4am walking. It was something like -15 out and I was freezing after being outside for around 7 hours. I tried sleeping in my car. I can't go back inside, but it's too cold, I can't stay outside. I go back in and try sleeping on the couch but I can't fall asleep. Did the night before actually happen? Was it all just a dream? Ashamedly check her phone to see if there are texts from anyone else. There are none. Check her email, check her Facebook, no messages except one to her Grandma asking if she can move back in... Why am I on the couch... I ask her cat what's wrong with ""her"", but a meowing response doesn't clarify anything. As the dawn breaks, I shower for what will be the start to a long road emotionally tolling road ahead. I grab my pre-packed bag from the bedroom. She is there. The tuft of brown hair that I miss so much is poking out of the covers. Did she miss my warmth? I kiss her on the forehead and whisper ""I will love you forever..."" and leave.

I get to the office. I call my Mom and in tears I said that ""she"" is leaving. My Mom is appalled. She can't believe it. My Mom loved her almost as much as I did. I go back in the office, my co-worker arrives soon. I burst into tears as I tell him too. At length my manager comes on Skype and asks how it is going, I say terribly. She video calls immediately and after hearing about it, tells me to leave work and drive back to my hometown. My hometown is 7.5 hours away, and the city I lived in prior is 2 hours away. I stop here and talk to the 2 friends I lived with prior. They are surprised at the news, and SO KINDLY offer me the option of moving back in. I will never forget their kindness during the shittiest moment in my life, when they took me in and helped me.

The weekend passes and there's no word from her. I don't eat any food or get any sleep. I throw up about 15 or 20 times over the course of 5 nights, most of which is just a thick sticky liquid that burns my throat and makes me wretch into throwing up even more as it passes over my taste buds. This is my journey...

**Picking up the pieces:**
I drive back to the apartment. A 7.5 hour drive in dead silence without any music after not sleeping or eating. I walk into the apartment and find a mess. Things left and discarded. Evidently she only took what she wanted as the couch was left, dirty pots and pans, her leftover food from that weekend, empty soap/shampoo bottles, and the litter/food from her cat on the floor... No time for sweeping for this ditch, I guess. There's also discarded notes on the counter including one I left her a few days prior: ""Remember last night?"" which is now unable to even be thrown away, just left in a garbage bag on the counter. Something I find interest, though, is that when we first moved in, we switched chairs and chair mats. She exchanged the floor mats again, but didn't exchange the chairs. I could never figure out why...

I discover that as she took was what she wanted, a lot of her stuff still was left behind: Blankets, old laptop, skates, unused cat litter box, a empty bottles of soap/shampoo. Why... I pack up my computer, clothes, go to work and get my work computer, and drive to a town 2 hours away to stay with my friends, which began a now year long time to recover. Fortunately each city town had a branch for the business so I could go between the two.

Unfortunately I am now forced to make the 2 hour trip back and forth to move my stuff. I know where she moved back to, so apart from 4 trips total to move myself back to the town 2 hours away, I take 3 full loads to her grandparents house. She thanks me over text and says ""hope you are doing well""? How could she possibly think... I also took 3 full loads to Value Village. At least the guy receiving these loads is blown away by my generosity... Goodbye to the stuffed elephant, Cornelius, that began our elephant obsession.

Like a fool, despite her name being on the lease as well, I kept paying rent out of my own pocket for that amount of time, because we were in love... Maybe she'll come back. She said if she feels different she'll let me know. Maybe she'll realize. Maybe she will remember those times when I would hold her so tight. I was in too much of a messed up mental state to even think about the rent really, though maybe that's what she was hoping for? I wonder if there any ""what have I done..."" realizations afterwards, or if it was only an emotional weight released from her after she left. Live and learn, I guess. I'm thankful for my friends, who were mostly online friends, as sort of sad as it sounds, who talked to me all throughout the healing process. These select few friends I have known for over a decade online and we have basically all grown up together. I'm thankful for them.

**Arrakis:**
Knowing I would be miserable and spiraling downward, I knew at the start that I would need something to concentrate on that wasn't just League of Legends. I was determined to at least learn a new skill while as I was pining and lamenting for the past. I had a guitar, so I began learning how to play chords and eventually songs, but I couldn't get her out of my mind if I tried. Sometimes I still can't. I'd go to sleep and invariably dream about her. Scumbag brain to the extreme. Everything is fine and then I awake to personal tragedy. I'd wake up from a restless sleep, go running for about 3-5 kilometers, come back, puke, wretch and gag, shower, go to work, come home, play guitar, play League of Legends, go to bed and dream of Arrakis. Why Arrakis? Because she read The Lord of The Rings. I have read that book every year for years. It was sort of like ""my place"", she was the Evenstar, but she never read Dune, so it was the only place I could try to escape as I laid in bed. At length I bought a new acoustic guitar, and in the stupid way it goes, the brand name I bought is the same name as hers. Kind of expensive, but in screwed up logic, it seemed to make sense. I can try to turn the name into a tool for good after she destroyed the angelic quality I found in it.

One time in particular about a month or two after the event, her name flashes on my phone. My guts hit the floor and I almost passed out from anxiety. She said she still has my ski pants and gloves, which were left at her family's camper at the ski hill, and asked if I wanted her to drop them off. I couldn't believe it... She was asking if I wanted ski pants and gloves back when she left me to deal with all of her stuff, the bills for rent and utilities, the heartache... Having had the read receipts on my phone, she knows I read these, and as I didn't respond, she said ""I assume by your silence that you don't want them?"" Why would I ever care about ski pants and gloves... 

Taking my newly acquired freedom into account, I have been able to travel a bit more. I went to visit a friend on the Internet over the summer of 2012. It turns out she had been through a not dissimilar experience as I had (her long time partner ditched out, but not anywhere near as 'suddenly gone' as my experience). We had a good holiday, but she became sort of attached and wanted to be more. I didn't. I couldn't. Well, I could, and in a way I suppose I was drawn between liking the idea of her and liking her. I admitted to her that I ""liked the idea"", but I definitely wasn't ready for a relationship and I'm still not. A few people I know had said ""the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else"" but I only ever wanted to be with one person. I found that bliss, but something happened and I don't think I will ever fully escape the despondent lack of panic in her eyes the last time I saw her. But, at least I can sleep better these days, as is indicated by my lack of iPhone bandwidth usage since last April. I no longer need to distract myself by playing documentaries of things from YouTube while going to sleep:

http://i.imgur.com/JRVMDFS.png

For what would have been our anniversary in August, I had written a letter to her and dropped it off on my last trip back to that town to get my stuff. A friend came with me as emotional support and ended up walking the letter to the door as I was almost passing out while as we pulled up to her grandparents house. In the letter I, unnecessarily, explained the unfairness of being left to deal with everything and how insane it was to think I'd care about ski pants or gloves. She undoubtedly already knew this, but whatever. I also said ""I give you to what you never had the courage to me give me: An honest goodbye"" and wished her family well. I wished her the best, but to never again treat anyone else with as much disdain as she treated me with.

**A boot stamping on a human face forever:**
While adventuring through this long road of recovery, I try to concentrate on what lessons I learned from the experience. From my perspective, things were great, suddenly they weren't, no real conversation was ever had as to why. Suddenly she was gone and I was left with the apartment, largely populated by her things, bills, and so forth. So what do I learn from this? That no matter how much effort and love that exists, people can leave and ditch out on any real responsibility? I don't know what really happened to her in the end, and without anything to actually *be mad* about, aside from her actions, I find it hard to pinpoint what the actual issues were, which makes it harder to separate myself from the situation. I feel like I can never trust anyone again. You can give someone your heart, and for years say you love them, they love you, you call each other your soulmates, but I don't know how to just disregard and forget about all of that... After so much searching, I realize that the only lesson learned is how to be afraid. I likely won't ever think of someone ever again as ""the one"" because I won't ever go through such ordeals to be with them. Such things really give you a sense of being ""made for each other"". Whatever comes next ""will be what it will be"", but it won't ever be as intense, I imagine.

In this time of recovery, my passion for her went from love to disbelief, disregard to utter apathy. I can't escape her brown eyes in my memory, and my dreams are still sometimes plagued with her presence. In a way it feels like it happened yesterday, in another way it feels like it was 10 years ago, in a way it feels like it never happened except in dreams. I feel like I wish there was justice to be had. That her family would knew about it in more detail, that her friends knew, that anyone she meets later on knows, but instead I feel bereft. I could die tomorrow and the person who once called me soulmate would never know and probably wouldn't even care. I am running out the clock and looking forward to a point in time when, in a way, I will feel like Winston from 1984 after he has been tortured, broken and finally loves Big Brother, but more importantly, has no reaction towards Julia's presence. At least for now, I have endless motivation for songwriting, and when finally I can look wards the sky and appreciate the sunrise, I will have new skills and experiences that I have found along the way.

And so, out of each others focus, we go on with our lives...

It was mostly due to commitment issues. He started feeling pressured and trapped, then started distancing himself which caused me to become clingier and overall sadder. We never had super crazy fights, we weren't destructive, and we did get a long really well. But I think it just got to the point where he needed to decide if he was in it for the long haul or not, and I guess decided he wasn't.

I did think about breaking up with him too, at some points, and I think it's possible I would have done it eventually if he hadn't. It just really sucked being with someone who had a hard time talking about the future, or wanting to plan it. It felt like a mind game sometimes. A few months leading up to our breakup he did start to talk about things in a more permanent way. He started making subtle mentions of a future with us in it together. That's what ultimately stopped me from ending things. In retrospect, I think this had to happen and would have happened no matter what.

Regardless, I was absolutely DEVASTATED. I think I was in shock for at least 2 months. Nothing felt real for a long time. I cried all the time. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I kept going to school and work but I was never there mentally. I had to stay with friends because I couldn't handle being home alone. I think forcing myself to go to school/work and leaning on my friends is what helped me get through it initially. Being newly single was enough of change that I think I had to keep routine in my life and not let EVERYTHING fall apart. And my amazing friends were there for me for everything. They listened to me blab for hours, or cry, they took  me out to movies, went out for dessert, they did everything. I am so incredibly grateful they were there for me. 

I tried to go NC but I definitely texted/called/emailed/FB messaged him at least once a week, usually crying. Sometimes he'd ignore me, sometimes he'd respond. He was never mean to me but sometimes he'd be cold. Or sometimes he'd try to be understanding. But mostly he ignored me.

About 3 months after the breakup I completely flipped out and sent him a message with a lot of angry and hurtful things. I was just really angry that he left me, wouldn't talk to me, hadn't returned my belongings. I was just such a mess and was acting impulsively. I regret sending that email because it wasn't necessary nor is it accurate of what I actually think/feel about him. Since then, he has now gone to ignoring me completely which also hurts, but I understand. I guess I just hope one day he forgives me in his heart, knowing I was just going through a hard time. 

Immediately I started taking steps to getting better. In the last 7 months I've lost weight, started working out on a regular basis, continued doing the things I love, got into new hobbies, went overseas, plan on going overseas again this summer, went on a whole bunch of dates with different people, etc, etc. I feel like I'm closer to being the kind of person I've always wanted to be, and I feel like my life is definitely what I want it to be. I genuinely do have a great life with so many amazing opportunities.

I still get sad sometimes though. Because I really did love that man and I really did want to spend the future with him. Besides his issues with commitment, I honestly found he was everything I had wanted. Waaay before the breakup I had so many moments where I thought to myself ""Wow, I'm so happy I'm with this guy. He's pretty much everything I've ever wanted"". I guess it's accurate to say I was pretty madly in love with him. 

I've spent a lot of time hoping he'll miss me. He'll call me and want to get back together with me. That he's the one. But it hasn't really helped me move on. And I don't think it's going to happen.

I've decided that: if he's the one, if he loves me as much as he had always said he did, if we're going to be together again someday, there is literally nothing I can do or say (or have done and said) that will change that outcome or make it happen sooner. Same if it isn't meant to be. There are only 2 possibilities of what will happen next: one day we get back together, or one day I meet someone who will make me just as happy (if not happier). In the end, I will be happy and loved.

*I wanted to conclude my experience on /r/breakups six months after I got dumped. So I'm going to hopefully make this my final post here! It's long, and I don't recommend you read it all. Just go through whatever sections you might need the most.*

**The Breakup**

I [22/m] got dumped by my first love [21/f] after a 9 month relationship. After several weeks of cold and distant behavior, she ended it suddenly and had no interest in rebuilding. We were really crazy about each other, then one day things changed, and it ended a few weeks later. I found out several months later that she had cheated on me repeatedly, used me as a rebound relationship to get over her first love, and spun a thorough web of lies to cover up both.

**No Contact**

I’ve maintained No Contact from the moment she dumped me. Six whole months of not seeing her. Although it was hard at times, I don’t regret it at all and I will continue to mirror the enthusiasm here on /r/breakups about the importance of NC. She hasn’t once reached out to me, so it seems obvious to me that me reaching out to her would’ve been needy on my part and, from her perspective, not something that she wanted to have to deal with. Please, please, please give them space. Chances are they don't want to hear from you anyway.

**Six Months Later - Revelations**

By the time Month Six rolls around, I think you’ll find that there aren’t any major breakup-related events that really are going to shake up your world. The only thing that still thrusts my ex back into my thoughts is when I occasionally run into one of our mutual friends on campus. But that 'weird feeling' lasts for like 30 seconds at this point.

The time for discovery around now is pretty much over. You’ve learned the most within the first three months, months 3-6 are pretty much you on your own again, figuring out the old single routine again.

**Deleting from Facebook**

I had spent about six months with my ex still on my Facebook friends list. I had a really hard time keeping myself from looking at her Facebook profile for the first month or so. It broke my heart every time I saw her on Facebook.

Do yourself a favor and delete them from your friends list.

I was drunk watching basketball a couple weeks ago, and something compelled me to delete my ex, her family, and every friend of hers off my facebook. At first, I woke up the next morning really regretting it. She no longer has any way of contacting me, I have no way of contacting her, her family, or her friends! On the one hand, deleting them all felt like a drastic measure and a huge mistake, but after two days of guilt, it actually has done wonders. If you have read my entire ‘saga’ on here, one of the lingering feelings I’ve had has been the desire to one day sit down and talk to her about everything that happened. I never got that type of resolution, but I felt like I was really at a point where I was ready for it, and I was ready to talk about it without getting emotional. By deleting her from my facebook, I made the possibility of this meetup completely reduced to zero. And that really upset me. My ego doesn’t want her to get away with what she did. She used me, she cheated on me, she lied to me, and she did all of those things on a regular basis. And she thinks she got away with it with her hands clean. I wanted to tell her I found out about it, and I wanted to tell her that I think very little of her because of it, but now I won’t get the chance at that sort of retribution. And yes, as immature as that may sound, this fact really bothered me, and in some ways it still does. That's the last thing that I'm still bent out of shape about - the fact that we never talked. 

**Emotions**

I'm not sure if there's anything that could happen now at this point that would get me *really* emotional again. Some things still bother me, and I still get bummed for an afternoon every once a couple of weeks at most. But I doubt there's anything by Month 6 that will really, genuinely make you as miserable as you were in Months 1-3. Eventually you just build a tolerance to your own shitty thoughts. I cried and felt the hurt in ways I never thought possible. I used up every possible method of grief. Now I feel like I’m numb to it, and in a sense, just exhausted by all of it. Six months later, you're not going to get up out of bed, take a deep breath, and gaze out into that lovely Spring day, listening to the birds chirping. You're going to wake up and get back into the routine, but the difference now is that you're battle hardened. And you sort of don't give a fuck anymore. You sure as hell aren't happy about the breakup or anything, but you're definitely in a better place in Month 6.

**Dreams**

Haven't had a dream about her in months. Actually, I've been having dreams about other girls a lot these days.

**etc.**

You don’t get over it, you don't feel peachy about it. You just don't think about it as much anymore.

You don't feel the urge to talk about your ex, but damn - if your friends mention your ex's name - you're still gonna have your two cents to throw in, and then some! 

Six months is a long freaking time. So much stuff has happened in the past six months, *good* stuff, stuff you never expected would happen.

**Self Improvement**

All the goals you set for yourself in Month 1 will be, if you're like me, new parts of your routine. New wardrobes, new gym routines, new diets - I've kept them all, and I've seen results. Even better - I don't do it with her in mind anymore. I do it for myself, and I do it because it makes me happy!

**Final Thoughts**

I've finally realized that I simply will never 'get over it' completely. The term 'get over it' has been the bane of my existence since breakup day 1. All I think of is when will I be back to normal. And the answer, the one I feared the most, is the one that's regrettably the truth: There will never be a time where this person doesn't mean anything anymore. Everybody in your life means something to you in some way, and to think that those you were in love with would cease to hold any importance is just silly.

Maybe it’s because she was my first love. Maybe it’s because she cheated on me so much and crushed me in a way I haven't felt before. But the important part is that not only have I accepted that I won’t ever ‘get over it’ but that it would be a waste if I did. 

To me, getting over it meant getting to a place where I was no longer mentally impacted by our relationship - at all. Getting over it meant she was somebody from my past who I completely forgot about. The final lesson I’ve learned here, and perhaps the most important, poetic, and beautiful lesson of all is that I’ll never get over it in that kind of way. She’ll always be a part of me, and the effect she had on me is permanent. The times we shared were life-changing in many ways. I do believe that everything happens for a reason, that every person and every situation we encounter, no matter how small, has some sort of purpose for all of us as individuals. I’m a believer in destiny, that some shitty breakup that literally affected me more profoundly than anything else in my life, happened for a reason. The universe had to teach me about love and about how important love is. I know now that love is the most important thing for humans to have, and I’m thankful that I got to experience it. And despite all the horrible, horrible emotions that this breakup caused me and the challenges I continue to face because of it, I can’t help but get excited when I think about falling in love again.

**TL;DR – It will take a while, but eventually you’ll come to terms with the fact that you’ll never just “get over it.” These ugly feelings will continue to fade, you'll stop being ""in love"" with your ex, but you have to accept the fact that this person you lost changed your life irreversibly. Maybe your life changed only a little bit, maybe it changed a whole lot.**

Thanks for everything /r/breakups! I’ve gotten lots of PMs from you guys over these months and it makes me sooooo happy knowing how much I’ve helped so many people. I love to hear from you all, especially the people who gave me so much advice last Fall when I needed it most. My guess is that they've journeyed on to greener pastures, too.

This is not really a treatise, it just sounded funny to me. It's a long rant about my reflections regarding moving on from heartbreak and healing, triggered by my recent call to my ex after keeping a steady 5 month NC. You might laugh at the supposed foolishness of this post's title, you might not. I understand that this analogy can seem a bit silly, but please, don't write off this post this instant moment, and try to bear with me, despite its great length. The gum analogy is merely an instrument in trying and explaining my point. I write for you and for myself. I have randomly added some links to songs that came up in my head during the writing process that I have related to during the last 7 months of heartache, it's just some kind of quirk I have with associating things with music, so you don't really have to click them, but they're there for the curious listener. I've added a TLDR in the end but I don't think it really covers up my point. So if you can, and are interested, please, give me a try. Also, I apologize in advance for any defects in my English, as it is not my first language. 

**So here goes for nothing:**

For the last 7 months I have read so much on heartbreak, and like many of us on this subreddit and on other heartbreak forums, I was always trying to find that ""special"" post that will somehow shed some splendid light on my experience, and help me in coping and moving on from my heartbreak. A conquistador of the broken heart new world, if you will, scouring the endless plains for the city of gold, the gold that will enrich me with the knowledge of how to move on from this seemingly never-ending pain, suffering, longing. 
I have yet to have found this golden city, and unfortunately, as much as I would like it to be, this post is not the enlightening post that will heal all. The thing which contains this power, I have come to believe, is, as much as we all hate to hear it, time. But to this equation of time I want, via this post, to add the component of what I would call rational, with the help of cognitive training. 

**The curious case of the tasteless gum**

Today I was chewing a gum. At a certain point during this very important event, I got into a session of coughing, must have had to do with an ill-timed swallowing of saliva or something of the sort; whatever was the cause, I extracted the gum from my mouth with my left hand in order to be able to take a few healthy sips from my bottle of water. That I did, and the coughing madness came almost to an immediate halt. Content and happy I carried on to return the chewing gum into my mouth. But surprise surprise, it was glued to my hand, really really hard. 

Despite this natural physical fact, I, in my stubbornness, decided not to give up on this gum, and I proceeded in trying and forcefully ripping it off the palm of my hand. The result was that of a complete chaos; my whole hand was smeared with gum, it was all over my fingers. Everything was gooey and every movement of my hand left trails of gum all over the place. My left hand was rendered, temporarily, unusable. 

Luckily, I was on my way home, and the cold weather and fair coat I was wearing could somehow conceal my clownishness. Rushing to the sink as I entered my house, I spent around 15 minutes, more or less, in trying to clean the endless bits of dry gum on my hand. It was very-very exhausting, and I deeply regretted not just throwing that gum away the moment I decided to drink water. 

Why would I want to get back to chewing this gum, which at the moment, was completely tasteless? I have been chewing it for around 40 minutes or so, and its flavor was long gone by the time my water-demanding cough session began. Why put it back in my mouth? I could, for example, take another gum, or, better yet, stop chewing altogether, because your jaw starts getting tired after a while. 

Yet, I wanted that gum back. Why? Inertia. I was so used to the gum that, in that certain moment, I couldn't even bring to my mind the healthy thought of letting it go for it has ceased filling its role. I was chewing that gum and therefore I must keep chewing it! 

The chewing of this gum has ceased serving any purpose, it has done its part, it's over and done. You keep chewing it because you are so used to it, because over time it has become what you conceive as your role, but the gum itself, it has ceased filling its role, the only thing it might give you, provided it's not one of those healthy gums, is a good cavity for your dentist to fill.


**Heartbreak, tears, masochism, more tears, NC, texts from ex, birthdays, breaking NC, catharsis**

Seven long months ago my SO of 22 months then, declared that our romantic relationship has come to an end due to her making out and subsequently starting something with some other guy. I was broken, shattered, destroyed, put here any other word that you are probably accustomed to using and relating to since your heart was broken. A huge incubus on my chest every morning I wake up and realize that [she's gone.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DbUfH8s2MM) 

I was Carthage obliterated by the Might of the decaying Roman Republic, and since, everyday was another grain of salt being poured on me, enlarging my pain, making sure nothing will grow. I wallowed in regret and pain, going about my normal day I was suddenly struck with sweet memories, deep waves of sadness ensued, a teary eye. [She is now somebody else's girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NAgxNtbzlw).

My nights were plagued with images of her and the faceless guy who proved, in her eyes, to be better than I, experiencing the best sex in the whole wide world, in a way that demands the ancient Hindus to rewrite the Kama Sutra. Nothing had any taste anymore. Everything was associated with her, and this seemingly bottomless pit of despair. 

After a period of masochism, I went NC. Blocked, deleted, and refrained from checking on the various social networks. I did not notify her of me initiating NC, hence, two months after my disconnection from her, she started texting me, asking if I am doing okay. I ignored all these texts, over a period of 3 months, because I was afraid to ""drag myself"" right back into it, because the notion of speaking to the ""new"" her was so frightening to me that I just decided to keep silent. It was painful, I cried, but I went on, hoping to heal. 

Yet I was miserable. I missed her. I thought about her every single day. I was wondering how she is doing. What is she doing. I was [wondering who's kissing her now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56V_RjJhCQs&amp;feature=related), though I knew [I didn't really want to know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbC6bMeSk9Q). 

As her birthday was coming up, I started getting tense; many neurons were thrown into the campaign of thinking about whether to contact her or not, and if yes – in which forum? I've decided to contact her and wish her well because birthdays were always such a big thing for her, because I knew that I'd eat myself if I wouldn't, I wanted her to know that I remember, that I still care, and I always will, and I will, because once I love someone, I love them for good. 

But another incentive, a much more covert one, was standing behind my will to contact her. It was the preserving of this latent hope for a miracle. This one percent that, who knows, she might want me back, but she is so afraid because I ignored her that she will never tell me. The 0.0000001% that she is currently lying in her bed wetting the pillows, acknowledging the great mistake that she has made in giving up my love.

After much thinking, I decided to call her on her birthday. It was a really really big thing for me, as you would probably be guessing by now, reading this long and tedious post that began with a chewing gum. She answered, sounding a little surprised. She wasn't cold or distant, as she was on our last phone call initiated by her in late June giving me the [lowdown]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EoK4OelZU) that ""it's over"", following the really long love ""don't-leave-me-I-can't-live-with-out-you"" letter I mailed her, accompanied by flowers and chocolate. The next two days after that call in wretched June of 2012, were spent listening to [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65EoK4OelZU), silently crying with pauses between each round of fresh tears to let my eyes rest for a bit, thinking [I can't live without her love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5XS1CZV9w4).

You know these quick conversations you have with people you know, from a distance? Like old high-school friends, people you've studied with, worked with, that you come by and speak and catch up and then go about your ways, not giving that occurrence much thought. So I felt that our phone call, was exactly like this, for her. She did not realize just how significant this phone call was for me, nor did she care much, I reckon. 
 
It struck me with full force, that this person is completely in a different place. She moved on. She skyrocketed to the moon of moving-on long ago, while I was left in my crater, pining for someone who, emotionally, was worlds away from me. It baffled me and it still does, as it does you, I bet, how people can just stop loving you. It's an interesting, painful question, but unfortunately I don't think there is any one definite answer to it. The only annoying answer I can provide is: they just do. They stop loving you, they stop seeing you in that certain light, they move on. They move on while you remain stagnant, devastated, asking why, over and over again. 

**[E=mc^2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzqim-RHq7Y) (minus one)**

This is not some big world-shaking discovery, and it does not take an Einstein to think it. But I believe that at times the pain is strong, in an almost addictive way, that you fend off any bit of rational. Because why would you accept it? They're the one that got away, they're your everything, they are all, they are the universe, the Olympus of emotions, the good morning text, the only shoulder in the world that really means something. 

Why would you accept it? Your pain is so strong it blinds you. I ached hard after I called my ex. I ""broke"" five long hard months of the NC that I so promoted with so much vigor and conviction in authentic belief of this certain route. It hit me that while, physically, only 15 minutes of a car drive separate us, emotionally, it is 15 light years. It's over and done, she's moved on, she's in a different place. 

Therefore I asked myself this question: what will I do now? Where will I stay? Do I have anywhere to stay? Do I have anything to cling to? Will I remain in this imagined bed of misery and sorrow, the one in which I've been stuck in for the last 7 months? It makes no sense. I have to move on, I have no other choice. I stand in front of two roads diverged in a yellow wood, knowing that one road will bring me nowhere; it's a dead-end path, I must take the other one because I have no choice, it is frightening, I don't know where it will bring me, but this is the only choice I have, unless I, for some reason, enjoy bumping into dead-end signs. 

**Conclusion**

Six days have passed since I called her and there's no other way to put it. I can't believe that I am writing this but I am: I feel better. Two days ago I felt genuinely happy. It was such a good feeling that I haven't experienced for more than 7 months. It was so good I documented on a (real) note-pad. Indicating the exact time and date I wrote that I am genuinely happy because of this and that, because of the equation I came to think of. I wrote how amazing it feels to be genuinely happy without this heavy burden of misery, to remind myself that I was genuinely happy after my ""world collapsed"", that it is possible. [I could be happy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQfUYZ0mS1M). 

And I want you to know: this is so liberating. **THIS IS SUCH A RELIEF**. A new text message arrives; I do not jump, thinking that it might be that holy person. A new mail arrives, no more repressed excitement, that ""I know that for 99%, it isn't her, but who knows, there's still the 1% that it is!"". No sir, that 1% is gone. [At last, I am free](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo0LYX6COv0). 

This is not a quick fix, I won't lie. There's still pain, there's still sadness, but it's different, it's like I had some kind of illumination that changed the way I think about it. It still hurts but the pain is different, and it will subside with time. 

You might say this is a cold rationalizing of a broken heart and how to deal with it, I might agree, but believe me, I am not comparing the object of your broken heart, this special person, to a chewing gum, to something you chew and throw away, I'm only using it as a metaphor. It's a chewing you'll always remember and possibly cherish. I am not by any means disregarding the deep, strong, hurtful feelings of heartbreak, believe me, you can check my posting history; **I KNOW WHAT IS IT TO HURT OVER SOMEONE WHO LOVED YOU AND STOPPED LOVING YOU**. **I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO IGNORE EVERY THOUGHT THAT MAKES SENSE JUST TO PRESERVE THIS LATENT HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF EPIPHANY AND SHOW UP ON YOUR DOOR TO HUG AND MAKE UP, THEREBY MAKING THIS HORRIBLE WORLD A MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER PLACE IN A MILLISECOND**. My epiphany was to realize this will never happen! And to accept it.

And if you are hurting now and it is fresh it will keep hurting. If you were dumped/replaced/left/abandoned yesterday or today or last week or last month or, hell, even six months ago, you are probably thinking ""yeah, [but not for me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_f_mMJAezM)"", brushing me off. You are the special one. You are the one who'll never recover from this horrible thing called heartbreak. Forever alone and all that nonsense. 

But eventually it will happen, you will recover, want it or not. I wish I could somehow hit a switch and make you see what I am seeing now. I wish I could end your pain by physically injecting some of that insight I had over to you. I can't, and I won't deceive you, it'll keep on hurting, it is a function of time no matter what, but by writing these words I hope that, maybe, somehow, it will sink into your system, provide you with another option for a way to look at what you are going through.

I apologize for the length of this post. I am not deluding myself that many have read it, but want to believe that they have. I hope that if you read this long, hopefully not tedious post, you have found some substance in it. Believe it. You have substance. You mean something. [You are loved](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B8j9XDOMic). [You can do it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow_NGabKR6k). You will do it. Despite all the pain you still exist, you are still breathing, the birds will sing tomorrow morning. I know you don't give a damn, I know that you only want that special fish, but the fact that there are [other fish in the sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA0IUwtKwhE) is as solid as the fact that the sun will shine tomorrow.

**TLDR (which is actually also quite lengthy, yet, readable, and if you read the whole post, keep reading, there's some advice + a motivational passage)**

I don't want to do this, I really don't, it devalues everything I wrote. If you are hurting and having trouble moving on, please, take a few minutes and read the whole post. still, I will summarize my post because I want to hug you all and I know how painful it is and I wish that you could find some sense in my ranting, so if you managed to ignore my pleading to read all of the post, what I'm saying is that basically:

* When you keep loving someone who stopped loving you, it's analogous to never letting go of a chewing gum, one that has lost its flavor long ago. It's only natural that you'll keep on loving them even when you know that their love for you has ended, there is no ""turn off love"" switch, we all wish there was, that is obvious, but if you think rationally it might help that thing called ""time"" to heal and move on. 

* Miracles mostly only happen in fairy tales; let go of the 1% that they might want you back. 

* I let go of that 1% by calling my ex after 5 months of NC. I realized she's in a different place, a very different place, and that I have absolutely nothing to cling to. Please put down your pitchforks! **BY NO MEANS AM I ENCOURAGING BREAKING NC!** I am a great supporter of NC, and it has helped me too, I felt ready to ""break"" NC because I felt enough time has passed for me to be able to receive that blow of ""reality"" from contacting my ex and seeing who she is; that strike of reality helped me move on. 

* Your mind is strong and [it is the only thing you have](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Snv88jCtjY&amp;list=FLcUKXmMVvLOynJhb-L-13Vg), use it as a defibrillator to bring you back to life. Use NC as an aid on your way, not as a sole purpose. Be honest with yourself, do you use NC to actually heal or just to lessen the pain until the person who broke your heart will get a nightly visit from fat old Cupid, threatening to sue them in the higher court of love and justice, if she/he will not return to you in 24 hours and confess their mistake. If the answer is positive, have I got news for you: it won't happen. Get it? It's done, kapisch? Alles ist vorbei. Now wear your sneakers and go out for a run. 

**Some practical advice about things to do, all under the theme of feeling better** 

* Talk to friends and family, you might be surprised to learn how loved you are and how people can listen and give good advice, even if you don't like the advice they're giving. 

* Rekindle old friendships. **I JUST CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THIS MAKES YOU FEEL**, aside for the fun and benefit that is in earning a new (old) friend. **DO IT. CALL THAT FRIEND. NOW**. You'll be surprised how happy they will be to talk to you again and hang out. 

* Listen to music you love. 

* Start Meditating. Look into mindfulness. Live in the present moment. Appreciate the small things.

* Exercise. 
 
* Remember that there was a YOU in this world before you came to know the person who broke your sensitive little heart. Remembered? Good. Now start to go back and do what that person who was you before the heartbreak used to do, whatever it is, fishing, singing, writing, reading about German metaphysics. Do what you used to love to do, even if you don't feel like doing it. For example, I really liked writing. I couldn't write anything the last 7 months because all that would come out was misery and pain, and why write anyway? It serves no purpose because it will not bring her back to me. So here I am, I am now writing candidly to you, disclosing my what you probably perceive a weird, horrible musical taste. I will force myself to keep writing even when I don't feel like it.  

* Watch HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".

* If it's cold and dark outside and you're feeling miserable, PM me. I assure you I will return to you. You can also PM others. **YOU ARE NOT ALONE**. It might sound weird to you but I feel a connection to the people on this subreddit, it's a sincere place, so down-to-earth, filled with good intentions. It's funny that there is so much love in a place where the theme is the loss of love, the massive pain that love brings. 

**And finally, some words of wisdom from one Marcus Aurelius (from his [Meditations](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html))**

*Do not spend your thoughts upon other people, nor pry into the talk, fancies and projects of another, nor guess at what he is about, or why he is doing it. Think upon nothing but what you could willingly tell about, so that if your soul were laid open there would appear nothing but what was sincere, good-natured and public-spirited. A man thus qualified is a sort of priest and minister of the gods, and makes a right use of the divinity within him. Be cheerful; depend not at all on foreign supports, nor beg your happiness of another; do not throw away your legs to stand upon crutches.*

*If, in the whole compass of human life, you find anything preferable to justice and truth, temperance and fortitude, or to a mind self-satisfied with its own rational conduct and entirely resigned to fate, then turn to it as to your supreme happiness. But if there be nothing more valuable than the divinity within you, if all things are trifles in comparison with this, then do not divide your allegiance. Let your choice run all one way, and be resolute for that which is best. As for other speculations, throw them once for all out of your head.*

This will be the first time in 9 years, that I'll be celebrating the holidays without her.

Dating is a completely new thing for me as well.  But the women I've had the pleasure of being with, have shown me that my ex was not good for me.  They encourage me in new ways, and show me strength, compassion, and kindness.  

I can't say I'm falling in love but I feel loved.  On occasion, I feel like damaged goods simply because the pain is still so fresh.

My advice to you, keep your head up, go out and do something fun, go out and be with friends even though you don't want to go out and be social.  I force myself to go out with friends, to meet new people, I bury myself in work, I go for long runs &amp; bicycle rides, I go to the gym and swim.  

Get out and make yourself happy.  Happiness and love aren't going to drop out of the sky into your lap, go chase after it and hold it close.  I know all of you will find it, just keep looking, and look in new places.

Then you're not done.

So often losing a significant other is treated with finality, as if it were the end of someone you could be.  As if it were a closed door.  There is truth to this.  However, even at your worst you have to understand that the end of a relationship opens a hundred doors for every one it closes.  What you pay in pain you gain in potential.  

We are each filled with infinite potential.  We could live a thousand different lives, embrace a thousand lifestyles, master a thousand professions.  In the grand scope of this, how can we let one relationship make us feel as if we are somehow ""over?""

Recently, I was forcefully removed from a relationship of nearly 5 years.  When I met this girl, she had just entered college and I had just earned the right to buy beer.  How could I ever believe that 21 year old me, with scraggly hair, a filthy dorm room and no job could POSSIBLY be the last version of myself capable of standing on his own two feet, of being happy without a lover? We can live without them.  The idea that we can't is a lie we tell them to emphasize our love.  Eventually, we internalize it.  It's still a lie. You are you, nothing and no one can change that.

How many of you are wondering ""how long until I feel like ME again?""  It's a terrifying question.  For so long, ""me"" has been half of an ""us.""  But there was a ""me"" before ""us.""  A ""me"" with passions, ambitions and dreams far beyond marrying a girl.  This is where the magic and the terror begin.  Because you're not completely wrong.  There is a lot of empty space where that person used to be.  But what they gave you came at a cost.  You made compromises.  compromises to your dreams, the town you wanted to live in, the people you made time to see and the hobbies you pursued.  You don't need to compromise anymore.  You can fill that space with any activity, person or place you choose.  In what other situation do you suddenly get such freedom to change your future?  The new you will be forever touched by the lover you lost.  The contributed to everything from your worldview to your taste in music.  But that doesn't mean that they own you.  They own you no more than you own your apartment; you decorate it to your liking, but the rooms are the rooms and eventually you'll move on. 

There isn't much we can do to dull the pain of heartbreak.  The best we can do is to offset the tragedy of losing someone else with the joy of rediscovering ourselves.  Your heart will force you to mourn the loss of your support system.  Your potential DEMANDS that you celebrate the loss of your excuses.  So cry, miss them, tear up their photos and have a terrible night's sleep.  Then celebrate the fact that from now on no one gets a vote in who you are but you.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_141ed9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/141ed9/the_real_silver_lining/,

I based everything I ever did around her. We were happy, living together for 3 years.

I've lost weight, my skins cleared, I'm tanned and most importantly, I don't think about her. 

I recently saw her out at this bar we/I was once a regular at. She was with the guy, I said ""hi"". Kept on walking. I deleted my facebook account as soon as she dumped me, she hadn't seen me since. I looked at her and saw that she had gained weight. This is harsh, but my god it made me feel better. 

I remember when we first ended it, I couldn't get out of bed for a week. Literally, I lost my job because of it. My studies were falling behind and I felt like nothing at all mattered. I saw her face everywhere, I saw things that reminded me of her EVERYWHERE. It fucking sucks man, I know that feeling. Don't let it get to you, get angry at them. Getting angry helps. Think about how shit they are, think about how shit sex was (if it was shit). Think about how much better YOU can be. Look at all the negatives and see the change as a positive. Because it is, sometimes change is the best thing for you and you don't know it. Routines can be broken. 

You're better then them, you're better then anyone. Have faith in yourself and keep pulling through this shit. This world is small but has a fuck load of people on it.

Then I went on living my life. I just want you guys to know it does get better. Honestly. This subreddit was so important to me when I was in the depths of my depression. So keep your chin up.

My sister put it best when I mentioned it to her. This is EXACTLY what [her face](http://images.wikia.com/mk/images/4/40/Are_You_Fucking_Kidding_Me_HD_by_CrusierPL.png) looked like when I told her about the message.

EDIT: She mentioned how she noticed I checked her linkedin profile and wanted to know if things were OK. I heard she got a new job, so I figured I'd look. I'm not sure why me checking her linkedin profile is a sign that I'm not doing well, but whatever. 
Anyway, I didn't ignore it out of spite. I ignored it because that's what I wanted to do. It's no longer about her and I. It's about me. If I want to speak to her, I'll do it when I'm ready, and if she chooses not to respond, so be it. There's nothing malicious about it. It's just over. 

EDIT TWO: We dated for a year. I'm 23M, she's 22F. The breakup was mutual-ish, probably 65% her, 35% me. But it doesn't bother me anymore.

It's like the eighth wonder of the world. You'll be here soon, friends, don't give up after making it so far. If they wouldn't give you a second chance, or if they didn't try to work things out, fuck 'em. If they cheated on you, why even waste your time. Fuck. Them. You deserve so much more than that. Don't sit around shedding tears over someone who won't shed tears over you. 9 times out of 10, they cried their tears before they broke up, and now they are ready to get back out there and fuck the first person who shows interest. Trust me, it hurts me to say it, but I've found that it is resoundingly true.

Go ahead girl, do what I did, don't say I didn't try to warn you though. Ignore the experiences I shared, yours will totally go differently, I just wasn't careful enough. I'll just chuckle to myself from the sidelines, watching as your ego and self-esteem get pulverized into a fine powder that blows away with the slightest breeze. Get fucked up all the time, it's fun right? Smoke all the weed you can get your hands on, nothing wrong with that. Someone hands you a random drug? Fuck it, YOLO right?? Fuck being serious about schoolwork, that shit's for squares. The future is the future, but here we are in the present. Gotta have all the fun and sex we can, only stupid people get in trouble! 

Go get those tats, I wish I could be there in the future when you try and tell your kids how it shows your angst, originality, and free spirit mentality. I wish I could be in the background when you bring home your new boyfriend. The new boyfriend you have just weeks after breaking up with me, saying that a relationship wasn't good for you right now. I'd love to see your parent's faces as they look at all of the tattoos he already has, the gauges in his ears, definitely money well spent. I would pay 1,000 dollars to have a picture of your father and brothers' reactions when he says that his career is being a musician. They'll be able to tell, this kid is going places. You picked a winner, pat yourself on the back. He's so dark and sensitive, he has such a deep and romantic view about life, your family just doesn't get him.

It's a great idea to have a boyfriend at a different college, that shit never fails. There's just no way he would cheat on you, he just isn't like that. I mean who would be tempted to cheat on a girl that he barely knows, that's more than an hour's drive away, with no link but himself to you. Nah, you guys have been going out for like 3 weeks, it's definitely enough time to have such a bond, and such deep trust and understanding. He'll be able to resist and fend off all of those sexier, more confident girls who aren't looking for anything but a quick fuck. He's different than the rest. Why would he say he loved you if he didn't mean it?

I want to be there when your heart breaks. When he dips it in liquid nitrogen and shatters it on a marble floor. When you find out he's been with someone else, or he dumps you for someone better. When all of the memories of me come flooding back to you. When you realize just exactly what you left behind. A real guy, a guy who truly cared, a guy who would swim the Atlantic just to be with you. When you reach for my hand but it's no longer there. When you call out for help, but all you hear is your own voice, dancing away, alone on the icy winds. When you search for me, but all you find is a trail of footprints leading endlessly away in the snow. When you know I left you in the cold like you deserve, like you did to me. 

You think you know pain, you think your past was hard? You don't know pain until you would weep over someone who you thought you knew so well, instead of over a much loved family member who you had to bury not too long ago. When you know how fucked up and wrong it is, but you just can't stop, because you love them so much. When you pull out your hair, when you try to reach out, but nothing greets you but silence. A silence that has physical substance, that traps you in its inescapable embrace. As it pulls you under and fills your lungs with it's oily viscosity. When the first thought when you wake up, and the last thought before you fall asleep is how shitty of a person you are, and how bad you fucked it up with the greatest person you've ever met. Then the dreams, the terrible, endless dreams of betrayal. Then we'll be on an even playing field.

I hope that soon you realize, like I have, what a terrible, damaged, twisted, fucked up human being you really are. You weren't fucking kidding when you said you didn't deserve me, I wish I had listened. I wish I hadn't wasted all that time talking to everyone I could. I wish I hadn't wasted all those days looking for some magic words to make me feel whole again. Whatever though, the past is the past. I know for a fact that best case scenario for you two is that is doesn't work out. At this age, nothing does. I've watched year long, 3 year long, 4 year long relationships crumble like dust in the wind. I should have been smart enough to see it coming, but love is blind. I kick myself for being such a desperate psycho over someone who doesn't care.

I'm off to an endless shore. To where I have a comfortable life, with a comfortable amount of money. Where I can go out to the bars and not give a fuck. Where maybe I can find a person that really cares, where I can find a person who feels the same way about me as the way I felt about you. A place where I can truly be happy, where I can find that inner peace that I've been so desperately seeking.

Close to the end of the day, I've been thinking of you. I've been thinking about you more and more. How you're doing, and how you look like cause I swear sometimes I've forgotten. I've forgotten what you smelled like, what it felt like for you to hold me. There it is inside me like a well, gaping, where everything good I felt about you used to be. It's like a wound that doesn't know how to close or heal, it sits there thinking it doesn't hurt as much some days but then I touch it and I'll be surprised to feel the sting, to feel it raw. We could've been everything we thought and hoped for at the beginning. I was there, so terrified of losing you, I was on my knees, I wanted you to tell me you'd never leave. Then you were there. Were. I don't know when you left and neither did you. You woke up and looked around and realized you were convincing yourself to stay. Not because you felt the same way but because you didn't want to disappoint me and you didn't want to disappoint yourself. We weren't who we hoped we were, just white lies convincing themselves they were true.

I miss you so much. I say that knowing that we were absolutely wrong for eachother. I say that knowing that I would never come back to you or the relationship that felt so one-sided, I felt alone within it. Knowing all that doesn't stop me from missing you like fire, for wishing that it could have been different. I know it'll be okay, I know it'll be better. It's just different without you. But I'll be different without you. Stronger and wiser. I made my mistakes, I behaved selfishly and irrationally. I held on too hard instead of being fearless and letting go. Regardless, there would have been no pushing you away if you had wanted to stay. I stayed, I was willing. I don't know if it was because I liked you way too much and didn't like myself at all. I couldn't love myself and you couldn't love. I'm at peace knowing this was the only way it could've turned out. But I miss you sometimes, and nothing, no logic or truth, no wisdom or any amount of anger, can make me stop feeling it. 

Here's to everything we were. May we shine brightly for ourselves and someone else the way we once did for eachother, may we never lose that fire nor have it extinguished, may it burn and shine as fiercely in the beginning as it will in the end. Our fire's gone out. Too bright, too hot, too fast.

You've got a great job in your hometown, you're about to buy a house, and you have vacation plans all this summer.

And here I am, 3 months before I graduate and I don't know where I'm going.  I haven't gotten a job yet, and I'm not sure I will get one in the same place as you.

So you left me, after a great relationship.  We never fought, hardly argued.  We pretty much had the same way of thinking.  We were happy.

But you left, cause you don't know if I'm coming.  Because you can't be responsible for me choosing a career location based on you.  Because you're too freaking narrow to try.  There are 5 other major locations within two hours of your town, but that would require you going out of your way for me for a couple of years.  And we both know you won't do that.

I need you more than ever right now, the guy who I can trust with anything. I'm worried about the future, I don't know what to do, I don't know what's going to change, and you left me.

",32,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/rrzsh/hey_everyone_i_just_want_to_tell_you_that_it_does/,"So, first I am writing this while procrastinating but I know this will help some people and I want to help those that are struggling. 

Real quick, I am 22 M and I had a 2.5 year relationship that I thought was perfect. I planned on spending my life with her, she meant everything to me.  In retrospect, it wasn't the best relationship.  She left me on and off about 5 times in the last year and a half, still I am not sure why I stood for it.  The final break up was 2 months ago and she left for good, so I am here to tell you how I feel after 2 months. 

Initially, after the break up, I spoke to her for about a week, maybe 2. It was extremely painful and made me cling to hope that she will be back. About 2 weeks after the break up I asked her if she likes anyone new, she told me yes. I asked if she has been on a date she told me that she isn't going to answer that. I felt as if I had been torn in half, my heart sank.  I told her I can't speak to her anymore and that I need space for me.

I recall telling her that I hate her or that I want to hate her, I was angry at the time and felt so hurt by her already liking someone else after she had told me she wanted to marry me. So after 2 weeks of no contact I sent her a text telling her ""I know I told you I hate you, but I do not.  I thought that was something you should know. I hope you are well.""

2 more weeks pass and I see her on campus and I speak to her briefly, my hands are shaking while we speak. I asked if she ever thinks of me and she said she wonders how I am but not more than that or in a way that we are getting back together. I asked if she has moved on and she nodded and said yes.  I then said ""So it's gone forever?"". I am not really sure what she said, it was a strange mix of nodding and being unsure, but to me it is a yes. 

I have been going to counseling on campus and that does help. 

But something has happened recently and I'll try and tell you what it is. I have been writing down my thoughts and how I feel. I keep track of when I think of her and how often/how long and how intense it is on a scale of 1-10. It helps me to track my progress of moving on. And that has helped immensely. 

But what happened was, for the first time on Saturday Night, I was sitting in my bed and I noticed I didn't feel anything. Before that moment I walked around and breathed with a shadow of sadness and hurt surrounding my life but on Saturday night it was gone for the first time. I just sat and smiled. I enjoyed it. I was ok for that night. 

The past few days have also been better. Of course, I still think of her and have strong periods of missing her but I am getting better. I know it. I can now wake up in the morning ready to face the day. As a matter of fact, I didn't wake up and think of her today. She was always the first think on my mind when I woke up. I would walk to class wondering if I would be lucky enough to get hit by a car, I don't feel that way anymore. It has passed.

The thoughts that I hold on to that make me feel better are that the relationship wasn't right for me and I deserved to be treated better. I look to the future and that I now have the opportunity to have someone love me they I would love them. I felt and sometimes still do feel as if I am constantly battling with myself to remind myself it is ok to move on. I sometimes would get sucked back into hope and thinking how great it was but instead of looking at the wonderful memories think about the ones that hurt you. Remember the times that made your heart sink while you were with them. It helps. 

The last thing I want to say is get the fuck out of your comfort zone. Walk some where you would normally drive to, say hello to strangers, spark up a conversation with them. Go outside and run as fast as you can and when you feel like you need to stop run even fast. Wake up earlier, go to bed earlier, change your routine, change your room, take on new challenges and do something new. Live your life and new experience things. 

I have tried some new shit and done new things and it helps you figure out who you are.  And it feels great. I am going to start something called geocaching, look it up. It gets you outside and it an adventure!

Things do get better, I am proof of it. The world is your play ground, get out there and go play in it.  Don't give up hope that things get better, I know how dark it can be but the light comes back on...it just takes a little time.

I've read enough of these to see short is best, so...
We were together 4 years. She (20something) broke up with me (old enough to break the age divided by 2+7 rule).
Please put away the pitchforks, we both knew the potential problems and for us, they didn't exist.

Our common ground and our differences made for a really strong relationship. We talked of marriage, and world travel, and babies.

We lived together for a time, but financial problems ended her back with family after a short time. Her family loved me, by the way.
The time living together gave us the chance to learn the everyday things about each other, and that made us that much more sure that we could be together permanently.

The breakup happened because I kept stalling about taking that final commitment of marriage. I think I was enjoying the freedom of not being married (I'm divorced) so much that I was afraid to get into it again. I would have been happy with living together permanently, but marriage had left such a bad taste in my mouth I didn't want that.

I loved her. I loved her more than anyone I've ever cared about.
It's my fault she left. Totally mine.

She wanted to stay best friends. I agreed because at least I'd still see her. And she wanted to, because ""I don't know what I'd ever do if I lost your friendship.""
DON'T DO THAT GUYS IT'S A BAD IDEA.

She started dating (one single guy) within weeks and sleeping with him soon after. I learned this from her own lips, since we were still ""best friends"", so I asked. She told me, and it cut me through.

I told her I couldn't be friends with someone I had loved so long, especially seeing her being intimate with someone else so soon, and I've cut her off completely.

It's only been a couple of weeks now. It still hurts like nothing else. I've watched both my parents die, and I don't remember that hurting as much as this.

I broke my own rule of peeking at her Facebook. I was starting to feel JUST a tiny bit better, and I looked and she posted a pic of them kissing. Ow, ow, ow, that hurts so much oh god it hurts.
It was weird, it hurt more seeing the picture of them kissing, than when she told me they were having sex.
I guess because one is abstract and the other is RIGHT THERE.

Anyway, damn, this hurts.
I wish I could get her out of my head.

Those gifts we seek to receive and give, those gifts of warmth and trust, we're allowed to give them to ourselves. We need to know what our gifts are, what they let bloom in the universe around us.  It's not easy, but it's worth it, and in reflection, it wasn't so hard.

Hello. 

I miss you. We haven't spoken once since the night you left. Trust me, it's not because I don't want to. I think about you every hour of every day. You're ingrained in my life and I can't seem to shake you. All I want is to send you stupid cat gifs and meet you for sushi before you run off to whatever thing you decided to prioritize over our relationship that night. I deactivated my Facebook and deleted your emails and texts, but I still find myself digging for scraps of you wherever I think I might find them. A new podcast, a key chain, the small candy-filled stocking you gave me a month ago, the nerdy necklace you were so proud of finding, that dress you liked so much on me, the bar we danced at last St. Patrick's Day, every street we've walked together, every restaurant we tried, every toke we shared... I see you in all of these things and I can't seem to stop. 

I am angry. I'm angry that I tried so hard after you gave up, because you gave up 6 months before you finally let me go. I blamed myself. I told myself if I DID better, if I WAS better, you'd want me like you used to. I told myself if I just gave you everything you'd ever asked of me, then you would want to be in this relationship with me. In the end, I'm not sure why you weren't happy with me anymore. I gave you every last bit of myself and then some, and it still wasn't enough. I know you're sorry. I know you didn't want to hurt me. I know the reason you dragged it out for so long is because you were worried what it would do to me. But quite frankly, I don't care. I gave you EVERYTHING, and you couldn't even give me one day a month. All I ever did was love you and You. Broke. My. Heart. Your good intentions don't mean anything because at the end of the day, you have broken me. 

I am sad. I'm sad because you have left a tremendous void in me. I gave you so much and when you left, you took it with you. I'm working to patch up those holes now... I'm learning to play an instrument, I'm reading a lot, I'm looking for a new job, I'm working out again, I'm making new friends, I'm meeting new people. I'm doing all the right things and going through the motions in the hopes that, one day, I can actually feel good doing those things. When I'm not sad, I'm just numb... apathy has never looked good on me, and you know that. I can't wait to CARE again. 

I am worried. I worry that I won't find someone I care about as much as I cared for you. I feel positive that I can find someone who will love me better than you did, because I was never terribly important to you... But I'm afraid I'll never let myself care about another person that much again. In a way, I am almost hoping I don't. Why would I open myself up to someone like that again?  I guess I'm worried that by opening myself up to you like that, I might have ruined myself for someone who actually would have been worth it. 

I am relieved. I feel relief because, after four long years of always chasing you, I can finally rest... I can finally stop and breathe and let myself stop wondering if you'll never care for me the way you should. I know you said the words, but your actions never followed suit. You never gave of yourself, you never opened up, you never let me in, you never put me first, you never thought what you could do to bring me happiness. I was always thinking of you, and you were always thinking of you, and no one was ever thinking of me... I am relieved because, for the first time in four years, I can be as selfish as you always were. I'm going to take these next few months and really spoil myself. I'm going to buy new clothes, enjoy good food and wine, take bubble baths, flirt with men, be the center of attention... And hopefully, once I remember how good it feels to love myself, I can love someone else again. 

I am done. I'm writing this letter because I know I need to let you go. There will be periods of withdrawal, desperation, pain, longing, fatigue, and emptiness... But there are so many good things to look forward to, as well. I am young, pretty, and healthy. In the last two and a half weeks, I've gotten more attention from more people than you gave me in several months. I am worthy of so much more than you were capable of giving. When you walked out of my life, all you did was leave space for better things to come in. 

I am resigned, determined, and optimistic.

Remember, though, that there is always a silver lining in every cloud, and there have been positives due to your breakup, even if they're hard to read at first.  So, let's list all of the *good* things that have happened because of our loss.  I'll start.

* I'm much healthier now that the relationship is over.  It was the kick in the pants that I needed to get over my fast food addiction and general laziness regarding working out.  I've always been skinny (140lbs/6'0) and used that as an excuse not to be active.  No more.  I've cut out an addiction that I had to coke and soft drinks overnight, my fridge is now stocked head to toe with food that's good for me, and I'm very careful about what I eat now.

* Linked to the one above, I've started working out much more often, trying to gain weight and put on muscle.  Being a swim coach for a long time (and dating a swimmer) meant that she would push me to eat very small portions, and I'd follow along, assuming she knew more than me.  Turns out, at my weight, I wasn't even eating half the calories needed per day in order to put on lean mass.  I would have never found this out if she hadn't have left and I took my fitness into my own hands.

* Holy shit I'm *rich*.  No more gifts to purchase, no 4 hour drives up to see her at her school, no more making financial decisions based on if it will help her life out or not.  I had to sell back a wedding ring and resort tickets that I'd spent the past year and a half saving for, so now I have a financial security that I haven't had in years.

* I learned not to let my entire world revolve around a single person.  It hurt, and still hurts, but I'm getting better every day and realizing the flaws we had in our relationship, and things that I can work on as well to help improve the next one.  I will never again let another day go by without finding some way, however small, to improve myself as a person.

* I'm free to move!  I hate heat, and she loved it.  Living down south meant that I was stuck somewhere warm in order to keep her happy, even though I've wanted to move somewhere with a cooler climate for years.  I hate my city, and now I have the freedom and financial security to change that!

If that wasnt enough to destroy me, in the same day, i learned she had a new bf.. its nice to picture 2 guys banging the girl you love most in the world. its just the best image you can fall asleep and wake up to. anyways.

its been 3 months since ive seen her and about 3 week since we have last spoken. I have had many ups and downs over the last 3 months, many of which almost sent me to my early grave. Suicide was becoming more and more of a viable solution. 

Well this is it.. i have had enough Michelle. i dont know when i will stop missing you and loving you, but mark my words... IM DONE TALKING ABOUT YOU. As much as i long for you, you really arent worth my energy. You werent worth it then and you sure as hell arent worth it now. IM SICK OF YOU.  so, here is my last post about you... here is the last time i will ever mention you to anyone... from now on, you are dead to me.. Obviously i cant stop loving you or missing  you, but i will make sure you arent controlling my life anymore. I will miss you and love you in silence, until the love i have for you burns out..

people of breakups.. you will get better. you just have to want to get better.. cry and let it out as much as you can until talking about it makes you sick to your stomach. 

I am now done with this subreddit. i am very sad to leave as many of you need my help. I will always be here to help you people, but i just think that subjecting myself to the constant depressing threads will only hinder my recovery. 

i wish you all the best.. i really am sad to leave.. i hope that all of you will make it out ok... I still have a long ways to go, but i DO WANT TO GET BETTER. I want to fuck the shit out of a new girl and make her love me more than my ex ever could. i deserve it.. and so do all of you. god bless every single one of you..

I thought that everyone in this subreddit needs to be aware of what sadness is and why we feel it:

""When we lose someone, either through death or a break up, or a dissolution of friendship, there is a space where there once was something. We feel as if there is something missing in our lives, and for many of us, there is. This is why we feel sad over loss.

But sadness is a helpful thing. Don't be afraid to be sad. The reason we feel sad is because it takes our energy inward and makes us focus on what's going on inside of us, it helps us reflect on things that maybe we need to change about ourselves, it gives us a different perspective on the circumstances before the loss occurred. Sadness only becomes problematic when it does not go away, and we call this a form of depression.

It is totally ok and normal to be sad. Do not fight your emotions, that will only bury them and force them to come out at inappropriate times. As hard as it is to be sad right now (I understand you, I just had my heart broken on tuesday by the girl I thought I was going to marry), it is a totally necessary part of this process.

Don't be afraid of your emotions. The only way to change them is to simply let them flow through you. Accept your sadness as a way for your mind to bring itself back to peace, its natural state. If you are still feeling crushing sadness after what feels like too long to YOU, then seek help, either from a therapist or a trusted friend/family member. Not to say you can't seek help right now, but what I really want you to take away is that you cannot run from your emotions. They are built in survival mechanisms that help us, they don't hurt us.""",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_pk76g,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/pk76g/a_note_on_sadness/,

I know this... I had my heart basically ripped out and stomped on more than once. Some breakups were so bad I was depressed for a few months after. But It does get better, I promise. I had given up on love completely... accepting the fact that I would be forever alone. Then I found this quote.

*""Good things fall apart so great things can come together.""*   

Simple, I know. But it changed everything for me. It made me realize things will get better from here... And they did. I no longer went out looking for a boyfriend... I forced myself to take time to heal my heart, live the single life. **That was the best decision I ever made.** I went on to find someone who loves me for me, and didn't treat me like the assholes I previously dated. I am happy, in love and getting married soon. I found someone who is truly an amazing person. We connect, communicate and do things together as a team. Yes there are some hard times between us, as no relationship is ever perfect. But honestly, I couldn't be more blessed to have him. **You sometimes have to remember that love never gives up, the people do.**  


Now I know you are dealing with all sorts of emotions right now, and things seem bleak, but please don't give up. Relationships are difficult, and it takes effort...

Like everyone else here I used to come here while going through the hardest part of my breakup, it was nice to see I wasn't the only one going through hell and reading about others stories was very helpful. 

After some time I found myself coming here less and here then stopped all together, it made me realize I was doing progress with myself.

So I just wanted to share some thoughts about how I to cope with some things. Please don't take this as me saying thats how things works, this is merely based on my experience, I just hope someone can relate.


**From the moment you get the news that it is over:**

This will without a doubt shatter your world, and its okay this is normal, a million thoughts will race through your head, there will be questions and tears and you will most probably become completely irrational in your actions in your words. 

The key is to isolate yourself for a bit and to deal with it, you are in a shock status, in order to not affect the situation any further by doing or saying something irrational to your ex just leave to be by yourself.

Its okay if you cried and begged your ex not to leave you, we are only human, but at some point you have to become an insanity wolf, and by that I mean turn yourself into a some kind of cyborg without a heart which is crucial for the next step

**If you live with your ex**

This is not easy, but if possible sleep on the couch, a different room or at a friend while you can get your own place. You are full of crazy emotions but reserve those emotions for when you are alone, you need to prove that you can stand on your own two feet and not just become a vegetable, for yourself and in the eyes of your ex, they need to know how it will be without you and somewhat impress them that you can do it.


You want to be strong and you want to show that you are capable of taking care of yourself. Do not get me wrong, inside you will be a wreck, but you have to put your heart aside and find a place, do whats necessary, search everyday and visits everyday. Your ex will be distracting you during the process but I can't stress enough how important it is to realize that this is now business and you need to protect your primary asset (your ass), and your living situation is something that should become a priority. While this is not fun it is important because this will allow you to become independent and growing into the best person you want to be.


Sometimes there are some sexual tensions, whether you wish to give in to them is up to you as long as once its done you return into business mode and continue with NC afterwards and are prepared to deal with the emotional pain it will bring after.

**Feelings**

I don't even know where to start, I wouldn't wish this kind of pain on my worst enemy. Everything becomes meaningless, you will lose your appetite, you feel like the time spent together was a waste and you see your future as something nothing short of just empty and black. But things will get clearer and clearer everyday, it will not be overnight but the cloud that is blinding you from any happiness will slowly start to fade away and you will be able to stop the pain eventually. 

You have so many questions to ask your ex, so much anger, you want them back, its going to be a whirlpool of emotions and thats okay, but you have to identify them and classify them. 

You have questions, early on you guys are gonna fight and these questions are gonna come out, accusations of cheating and of lying, insecurities etc.. thats normal, take the answers to satisfy that part of you that needed them but do not take them at face value (dont dwell on them, whether you trust you are being told the truth or not, it doesnt matter) your primary goal should still remain focusing on yourself and on getting yourself back together, learn to just drop it. 


I know for example that when I am at work, I am not thinking rationally, I am at my desk with my music (which can be mood altering) and often lost in my thoughts (mostly about the breakup) and I found myself being caught up in them and I acting on them, impulsive anger or just being emotional which often resulted in breaking NC and regretting it, so I make a mental note to never trust my judgement while at work.

 Consequently I often find I have my most rational thoughts while in the shower (rational does not mean necessarily happy, it means its rational which could be accepting the breakup and crying about it, which is perfectly fine as it can be liberating but it can also be starting to understand who you are and where you want to go)



Dealing with the fact that you lost your best friend, this is probably one of the toughest aspects of the breakup, but you need to realize that something went wrong, yes you shared everything but you were growing apart, communication and trust were gone, think about it as two persons trying to communicate while being on different frequencies, its just not gonna happen. 

However, here comes the importance of NC, both of you need to be left alone with your thoughts in order to think about them and learn from them, both of you made mistakes, and you both probably have regrets, now is the time to ""grow"" into a better person and define yourself, rebuild your values and priorities. Even if you wish to one day go get back together it is still important to let the other person alone so they can think about themselves and their mistakes and who they want to be as a person.


It is very hard to not be sad about the fact that you can no longer share things with you ex, but you can still share stuff with other friends, don't forget about them, they will help you greatly dealing with the breakup. Share books, videogames, music, funny links with them. 

Once you suppress the urge to want to share something with your ex then everything will become MUCH easier. Put the focus back on yourself and on surrounding yourself with cool info. Which brings us to

**Focusing on yourself**

Everybody says this, hit the gym, delete facebook, work on yourself. It sounds like a broken record but it is so true. You need to cut contact, block their facebook, you do not want to know what they are up to plus you might misinterpret lots of things which will lead to more fight and more emotional pain. block them, unsubscribe from their friends, if you have any accounts together like netflix, cut it all out. You should not feed your desire to know, it will make you paranoid and will add to the emotional pain.


You also need to become the person you always dreamed on becoming, maybe you were in a relationship for so long that you feel you don't have total control over who you are, you are not confident with yourself 100%, its important to remember who you wanted to be when you grew up, what your passions were and the career that you wanted and the way you wanted to look. Being in a relationship can be draining, you focus solely on it and you lose track of yourself, thats why sometimes breakups can be a blessing, it can be that kick the ass that YOU needed whether its career wise or as a person.

Working out really helps, you will feel much better mentally and you will become hotter and this will just be another step towards becoming awesome and showing your ex what they will miss.

Surround yourself with things you like, you should not feel lonely or bored because there is ALWAYS something to do, a game to finish, a book/comic to read, things to clean, jobs to look into, blogs to discover, start bookmarking interesting websites, watching a new show or more movies, friends to see. I live by the rule that there is just not enough time for us on this earth to do everything we ever want to, so start somewhere because possibilities are endless. 
Even if its just writing down emotions or thoughts, making lists (I love making lists, I make lists of the shows/movies I need to catch up on, lists of things I wish to accomplish, things I need to get done this week, anything that I think I need to get done in order to be happy and become the person I dream on becoming)



Accepting that it is over sounds harsh, I prefer to say that you have to accept that there are reasons why it didnt work out, if they hurt you, use that anger to prevent yourself from contacting them, being angry will remind you of why it did not work and it will allow you to not even want to contact them. Over time the anger goes away and you won't even care anymore, but never forget why it didnt work, you have morals and you have values, dont let anybody take them away from you. There is a fine line between being forgiving and naive, make sure you are not being stepped on, you have to remain fierce.


I am myself still dealing with my breakup but I made progress, I am now fully focusing on myself and in my own being, it feels amazing to be honest, I get to customize everything around me to be to my liking, wear what I want, come home at any time, it took me a while but I finally came to the conclusion that too many things were said and done for this to ever work, and I don't mean this in a pessimistic way but in a realistic way, I am not saying it can never work but it just cannot work at the moment, not until we both grow. I also broke NC recently after a month of being strong, it set me back emotionally, I was a huge mess after, I was starting to picture us back together and finding myself wanting to text about random things we usually talk about (which is why earlier I was stressing the fact that you need to get used to the fact that you cannot talk and share stuff), it took a few days to shake the emotions away and but now I know why I was a mess, it was because I was missing connecting with him and talk about things, which I was perfectly fine not doing for 2 months (having a blog helps express yourself I find, even if its just posting stupid pictures)


Also, not being spiteful is very important, you might find yourself lost while being single, wondering if you should start hooking up with people or not, often triggered by the fact that you want to get back to your ex, prove to yourself that you have moved on, or show them you are doing well, but if this is not something that you are actually ready for or really want, do not do it, all you are doing by this is lying to yourself. 

Personally I haven't seen anyone or hooked up with anyone since my breakup (its been 7 months) and I don't feel like I am nowhere ready to get intimate with someone, I am way too busy trying to figure out my own life and I am still hopelessly in love with my ex, but its okay to be alone, there is no pressure whatsoever. Before any decisions you make always ask yourself ""Am I doing this for myself or am I actually trying to get back to my ex?"" if the latter, then don't do it.


I can't lie about the fact that what I am scared the most is about finding out he is dating again, BUT I tell myself that if he does, well good for him. Ultimately I love him and I want whats best for him, good on him for finding someone who can deal with his crazy shit cause I sure cant fucking deal with it and it will for sure not be because of the lack of trying. That goes without saying that there is a part of me that is hoping they will realize how good they might have had it before.



I hope this helped some of you.

1340604973.0,27,self.BreakUps,vk73r,LOVE,31,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/vk73r/love/,"""The greatest irony of love: Loving the right person at the wrong time or having the wrong person when the time is right; finding out you love someone after that person walks out of your life. For some, they think that letting go is one way of expressing how much they love that person. Some are afraid to see the one they love being held by someone else. Most relationships tend to fail not because of the absence of love, but because love is always present. It's just that one was being loved too much, and the other was being loved too little. Most often, we fall in love with the person we think we love, but to only discover that for them we are just for past times. While the one who truly loves us remains either your friend or a stranger. 

When you think of your past love; you may view it as a failure; but when you find a new love, you view the past as a teacher. In the game of love, it doesn't really matter who won or who lost. What's important is that you know when to hold on and when to let go. You know that you love someone when you want him or her to be happy, even if their happiness means that you're not apart of it. Everything happens for a reason and for its best. If the person you love doesn't love you back, don't be afraid to love someone else again, for you'll never know unless you give it a try. 

You'll never truly love a person, unless you risk for their love; love strives in hurting. If you don't get hurt, then you won't learn how to love. Love doesn't hurt all the time; though the hurting is there to test you, to help you grow. Don't find love, let love find you; that's why it's called falling in love, because you don't need to force yourself to love, you just fall. You cannot finish a book without closing the chapters. If you want to move on, then you have to leave the past as you turn the pages. 

Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. But why is it that the greatest irony of love is letting go when you want to hold on, and holding on when you need to let go? You can never find the right person if you can never let it go of the wrong, but at the same time the moment you feel like letting go, you remember why you held on for so long. **Sometimes you have to forget what you want and remember what you deserve.**

To love is to risk rejection, to live is to risk dying and to hope is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing at all. To reach for another is to risk involvement, to expose your feelings is to expose your true self. To love is to risk not being loved in return. 

How to define love: Fall but do not stumble. Be constant but not too persistent. Share and never be unfair. Understand and try not to demand. Hurt but never keep the pain. 

Love is supposed to be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire you and give you joy and strength. But sometimes the things that give you joy can also hurt you in the end. Loving people means giving them the freedom; whom they choose to be and where they choose to go. Loving someone means giving them the freedom to find their way, whether it leads towards you or away from you. 

Love can be a painful risk. To love means that risk must be taken, no matter how scary or painful, for only then will you experience the fullness of humanity of what we call love. If you're not ready to cry, if you're not ready to take the risk and if you're not ready to feel the pain, then you're not ready to fall in love.""",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_vk73r,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/vk73r/love/,
1324056938.0,26,self.BreakUps,nfczi,there are not enough success stories on here.,28,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/nfczi/there_are_not_enough_success_stories_on_here/,"A lot of you are sad. A few months ago, I was right with you, posting sad stories, rants, and pleas for help with getting over the person I loved at the time.

However, the stories that made me feel the best were the stories of people who posted on r/breakups to encourage everyone. The ones that said it can and WILL get better.

So, here's my share. Breakups are horrible, there's no doubting that. Some days I honestly felt like I couldn't go any further because my former sig-o wouldn't give me the time of day anymore. I felt like no one cared.

Here was my big mistake: I shut everyone out of my life except for him. I was so focused on winning him back that I forgot about the many, many people in my life who still loved me. And when I finally let people in, it lightened things immensely. It still was hard, but I didn't feel so alone.

I've been feeling horrible for a good three months about this. My ex put me through emotions I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I was the most miserable I've been since my parents divorce years ago.

However, this past Sunday, something changed. My ex came to see me, and told me some things I didn't want to hear (won't go into it, but let's just say they involved other people). I was sad after they left, but...I suddenly realized that I wanted to be better. I chose to be happier.

And, as if by some miracle, this week has been the best week I've had in months. I've focused on myself....I auditioned for a community theatre, flirted with other people, got my hair done, and successfully planned a full corporate party. And since I've been focusing on myself, I haven't been thinking about them. I've been thinking about MY happiness. And when they do cross my mind, I remember how happy I am, and wonder why I put myself through that unhappiness for so long. 

Remember, the most important person in your life is and always will be you. Don't let anyone bring you down. Focus on yourself right now, and sooner or later, happiness will come and you'll be much better off. I keep telling myself the right person will come along, and when they do, this kind of unhappiness won't happen. 

So, what have I learned? 

-Don't shut others out of your life. They're there to help you.
-Focus on yourself. Do things you like. Sooner or later, those thoughts will take over all the unhappy ones.
-Don't waste your time on someone who keeps you as an option. You are a priority.
-Go OUT! Even though I didn't have any intention of going home or dating any of the people at the bars/coffee houses/etc, the attention you get from dressing up and feeling confident is a wonderful remedy.
-You CAN choose to be happy. You just have to be brave enough to do so.
-You don't deserve 'no's and 'maybe's. You deserve an absolute 'yes'. :)

My ex wasn't and isn't a horrible person. He just made some poor choices dealing with me. Don't attack your ex: I did, and it probably made things worse. Just leave it be, and if karma wants to remedy the situation, it will. Focus on yourself, and not on your ex's problems or shortcomings. 

Tonight, I am going out with my best friends, and I intend to fully enjoy myself. I am single, but there's no 'void' in my life. I can fill that with my own happiness, and someday, the right person wil come around.

Long ass summary ahead.

**Where I've been:**
3 months is a lot of time to think about what happened and that would be true if I had spent as much time thinking about 'what' happened, and why it happened, as I should have. Problem is, we had a super fantastic relationship, and there was no warning.. I mean there was no warning before the warning.. so to speak. I got the ""lets take a break"" request out of the blue. That was my first warning. It was also the quick slide to everything ending. To be sure, this went from amazing, to over, extremely quick. So mostly over the last 3 months, I have just missed her. I 'think' I am still in love with her, but don't know for sure. I still have NC going full force, and while she has broken it, I have not responded. Nor will I. If I can sum up the last 3 months in a few words, it would be.. intense, and emotional. Not just for the breakup, but for many reasons. Life goes on, and mine continued forward in some pretty amazing ways. Some taboo after a LTR, others, by the book.


**What I have learned:**
First, Reddit /r/breakups is the most amazing place. I hope all of you appreciate it as much as I do. Without you guys, I would be lost in a sea of shit. Really.  I feel emotionally connected to a lot of you, and I have NO idea who you even are. That's not a bad thing. All of you in one way or another, have played a role in my life.. even if it was just a few typewritten words, you have helped.


I've also learned through analysis, some things about my Ex.. without going into too many details, and without disparaging her too terribly, I have come to realize that my ex, is a broken person. I KNEW this going into the relationship, but I didn't KNOW it to be a constant. There was nothing I could trend out, and unfortunately, I thought it would be different with us. Isn't that what we all think? I was naive, and made a very poor decision in taking on the relationship. One that I will regret forever. Trust me when I say this is not because she left me. This is because it's true, and it's something I pretended was not true in 'our' case. It ended up being very very true.


**How I am doing now:** 
I have lots of good days, and too many bad days. Really bad days. I pine for what was, and way too much for what could have been. My confidence, which is generally pretty solid, took a beating, but I am slowly working on getting it back. I no longer hold out hope that we will get back together, which is good I guess. Things are starting to fade, and turn gray. I have more anger for what she did to me, than sadness. Which is also good. At this moment, I choose to not forgive. I am more comfortable with anger than I am with accepting what she did. I don't walk around angry. I am a very happy, upbeat person, but the anger toward her, actually feels good. I am forcefully committed to NC. I have badly wanted to stray, but won't.


**Where I am going:**
This girl I have known for a year or so, kind of, sort of moved in for the kill once my relationship was officially over. She broke off hers (yes, I understand the tragic irony of this) and we have been seeing each other for the last few months. It's been amazing.. really, it has. Though it has done nothing to help me get over my ex, and that's actually not what I am asking of it. To be honest, I am not sure what my feelings for her are, or if they even exist. She is in the same boat, but we continue to float on. I have no real expectations for where this is going. It could be over in a day, week, month.. who knows. Maybe it will never end. Bottom line, is that this is life. Constant change. Sink, or swim.. when given the choice.. or even when given no choice, I will always choose to swim.


**My fears:**
3 months in, and things still suck. I think it will easily be a year before I am over her. So many things to dread in the future with her.. like seeing her for the first time, seeing a picture on social media, inevitable things like dating someone else, marrying someone else, having the kids we were supposed to have. I fear all of this. I hope in time I can accept it, but acceptance will come at the cost of great pain, that is for certain.


**My Hopes:**
That I move on to a happier,  more fulfilling life. I am an optimist, and if I want it, and work for it, then I am certain that it will happen.

I just don't understand how ""loving myself"" more is supposed to just fix the fact that I miss him as a person.

I [21M] had thought that i would already be back together with my ex [22F] but that hasn't happened. I've been very postive and working on me and my life but then it hit me; though i was doing all this for me, I couldn't really move forward with my life cause i still pictured her in it. Yes, I still want her back, and i still carry a little hope, but to truly move forward and find happiness, you need to picture your life moving on too.

An exercise i started doing was that for a few minutes a day, I'd write about me. 

Get out a sheet of paper or start a new word doc and title it with your name;
write what you like about yourself, but do not use negative words like not, or any contractions with it.
write about what you want your future job to be and how to get there.
write about what you reallly want out of a relationship.
write about what your actual dream girl woud be like (Don't just describe your ex cause God knows they weren't really that perfect)
You can go on ahead and write out what you would want your wedding to be like. 

The most important thing is that it's all about you, your future, and how you want to live your life.

It's really helped me clear my head and set new goals in my life.

I'm not 100% over her. if she comes back, that'd be great, but thats a want and not a need.

Good luck!!!

last year i went through the same thing you guys are going through.
im fucking awesome now... ive never had this much confidence in my entire life. the breakup might have been the greatest thing to happen to me, even if it hurt me the most..

take as long as you need to grieve.. but give yourself a time limit.
the longer you wait in this grieving period, the more time you are wasting.. 

do things that make your life better... 
1) exercise is a must.. i dont care who you are and what your body type is.  dont sit there rolling your eyes at me.. stop feeling sorry for yourself and get your heart pumping. you will feel a lot better.
2) take up a hobby you never had the guts to take... spend some money if you have to.. spoil yourself... 


there are a lot of things you can do get over a breakup.. just realize you will be better one day.. and in the history of life, you arent the first person with a broken heart.. and you wont be the last.
take comfort knowing we all have been there, and we all have escaped the misery of a breakup..

goodluck! live long and prosper...

and if there any canadian girls in here that need a shoulder to cry on ;) LOL.. sorry!

The relapses are still a common occurrence. Previously, every time I wrote about my feelings here I felt better, so I'll give it another shot.*

I still think, you know...about the first time we talked at the end of chemistry class...how we slowly started to talk more and more...I remember every friday we would chat for hours until one of us got tired enough to say good night. 

I remember the day we had our disastrous first date. And of course I remember that magical second date where we had our first kiss on a sidewalk that snowy night...how invincible I felt at that moment, as if nothing in this world could take me down. I still think about the next few weeks, where we would have lunch together, how we would hang out at your place...I still think about our all night phone calls every Saturday.

I realize after our breakup that you no longer are the person that I fell for. That person is long gone. You're so callous towards me now...its something I've been trying to be myself towards you but its impossible for me...so I just avoid you, because every time I see you walking down the hall way, for a brief second my reflexes tell me to hug you, kiss you, call your name and tell you how much I love you...but I know I cannot do that, because I quickly realize I do not love you, I never loved you, I loved someone else, someone who no longer exists.

1368768569.0,25,self.BreakUps,1ei320,"I told a bartender this story, he told me in the 10 years that he had been tending bar he had never herd anything like it. Figured I would share.",37,12,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ei320/i_told_a_bartender_this_story_he_told_me_in_the/,"So here is my story. It's worth a read.

So I [24 year old Male] had been dating this girl, Jessica [22 F] for about the past 6 months. About two or three months ago were sitting down watching tv on the couch. when she gets a text, and I causally glance over and notice that it starts out ""hey baby..."", so I ask who it is? And she confesses to me that that this is a man who wanted to offer her a job as a prostitute. soo... yeah.

My first thought was that it wall all a joke, but it was a serious job offer. So at this point i have my keys in my hand about ready to drive her home, and break up with her than. but over a long talk she agrees with me that selling her body for a living would be a bad idea, and would be like cheating and such. and promises me that she will never talk to that man again. And I, like a fool bought into it.

so things were strained by this, but I was a good boyfreind and trusted her, I didn't poke around in her phone searching for texts. or anything like that. and I did what i could to put the event behind me. 

fast forward to the beginning of this month. She just graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelors in evolutionary anthropology, and has a job offer working for the Detroit zoo as summer camp instructor. Not the best job in the world for a college grad but foot in the door none the less, and a good stepping stone between now and grad school.

As a bit of a gift to herself she decided to go backpacking around Puerto Rico, she left on the 8th and got back on the 15th. and I'm thinking ""great, your leas doesn't expire until the end of the month, ill take the 16 off and we will make a day out of it. She tells me she cant, and for a day and a half she wouldn't tell me why. 

Eventually, she told me that on the 16 she was getting flown out to Arizona for a 2 week interview at camp shane, a fat camp for children, and that she will be back on the 28th but if they make her a good offer she will stay the entire summer, but that she was treating it like a 2 week free vacation. So I'm skeptical as fuck, but i remember when we first started dating she applied to the place. So once again I decide to trust her.

So her laptop has been having a few issues, and I make my living as a computer programmer so she asked me to take a look at it while she was in Puerto Rico. She gave me the password. and on the 8th i drive her to the airport and she leaves. Now I took the day off to get her there, so in my free time i decide to work on the laptop. 

I was working and had to delete a file. so I opened up the trash to get rid of it. And low and behold there are a bunch of naked pictures. all of her with her lip piercing witch she got while we were dating. And this is the first time I have ever seen any of them. So I track them back to where they came from, A chain of emails talking with a brothel in Nevada, the moonlit bunny ranch. and at the end of the chain a message from a MadamSuzette (apparently somebody who runs the place) saying they will have an opening on the 16th and inviting her down. 

A little bit more digging and i find a post from her on there forums. Jessabell is the name she picked for herself. and there are a few of the pictures that were lying in her trash. posted up for the world to see in a thread she had created as an application to become a legal prostitute...

Anyways I sat on this information for a good week, I felt like shit for snooping around. But convinced myself that it was for the best. And on the 15 when she got back, I kept my word to her and picked her up from the airport. And when we got back to her place, I asked her where she was going the next day, ""Arizona"" she said. ""Jess don't lie to me, where are you going tomorrow?"". Once again she said ""Arizona, camp shane"", ""So than why is your name on a list of girls that will be working at this bunny ranch on the 16th?"". So she finally tells me that she was lying to me. So I tell her I never want to see or hear from her again. And in the most monotone voice, she just says ""Ok"" and walks away. no emotion what so ever.

6 months of my time, money, and emotion wasted on some whore. Only to have her run off and suck dick for a living. With any luck she comes back with all the STD's and a kid in her belly. thats the least she deserves in my eyes.

I was so pissed that she just walked away, i wanted to let her know just how mad i was at her, i wanted to ask her how she thought this story was going to end, some 22 year old girl who was kicked out of amry ROTC for depression, and still taking pills for it, was running off to become a Prostitute. Part of me that still cared for her wanted to beg her not to go, but there was nothing else i could do at that point, she had already broken the only promises she had ever made to me, and than lied about it on top of that. 

Anyways I feel better getting this all down in words, I'm still pissed. but it will just feel better to have this story out in the open. thank you for reading. I know my spelling sucks, forgive me. but its nice to know somebody will take the time to hear my story.

I received the ""can we talk tonight"" text while at work on Friday. My heart sank to the floor because I knew what was coming. I dropped everything to find a secluded space in my office building to have what would be the same conversation that I've had two times before. I would profess that we keep trying and she would tell me that she no longer can.

We had a trip planned with my family to Mexico in two weeks. My parents decided to take my sister and I as well as our SO's to Mexico (first actual family trip ever) for some fun in the sun to break up the winter doldrums. On top of that we had finally started to plan on moving in together after 5 years!

Now we've had a troubled past, including a couple break-ups in the middle of the 5 years. But to really understand the story I have to unload it all. I totally understand if no one makes it all the way through... it is 5 years long after all. 

Year 1:
I had just came out of a terrible relationship with a woman who had so much baggage it was impossible to survive. I tried for almost three years to be her rock, to be the one person that she could count on but alas it wore me to the bone. And so I ended it. Now while I was sad about leaving her, deep down I knew it was what I had to do and in past relationships I've always known when it was time to cut my losses and move on.

I had just started a job at an art supply store after college with one of my buddies. When I went into the interview I saw the girl that would be my everything for the next 5 years. Lets call her ""B"". She was so light and happy that I couldn't help but be drawn to her. We would make eyes at each other every time we were in the same room. It didn't take long before we went on our first of many dates. Now while I was totally digging her I also felt guilty about essentially replacing my previous girlfriend with this high on life 21 year old. But it felt so good, so easy that I just went with it. She was so affectionate and so sweet that every moment felt like pure bliss compared to the mess of a relationship I just came out of.

Year 2:
At this point we are head over heels for one another, almost every waking moment is spent with one another. Entire weekends spent in bed talking and holding each other with not a care in the world. We could do everything or nothing and it didn't matter as long as we were with one another. This would be the best of us. The era we would for the next 3 years try to resurrect.

Year 3:
She turns 23, and like most of my friends and myself at this age, she goes a little crazy (quarter life crisis?) and gets a little confused about where her life is headed. With no real career direction, and a new birth control pill making our sex life lack the luster it once had, the boat begins to rock. She doesn't know what she wants, and she is scared. I do my best to comfort her, I don't push with my frustration of the lack of intimacy because I didn't want to be the over-bearing boyfriend that begs for sex. I try and be patient, and do romantic things for her hoping to reignite a spark. But I feel her becoming distant, and in the coming weeks she ends it.

I'm a wreck, I can't eat, can't sleep. I send countless texts trying to get her to change her mind. I try to remind her of all the good things about us and how special our relationship is. But nothing works, my sad sap texts turn into angry rants. But this only pushes her further.

So during the following month I try my best to go NC, but I start torturing myself by looking at her facebook page. I see ""friends"" of hers liking all of her posts and writing flirty messages on her wall. Its becoming apparent that she is moving on.

I see her at a concert one night. My buddy decides to drag me out of the house like every good buddy should. I see her with someone else, and I become that pathetic X you've seen in so many movies. I confront her against my friends advice. And it does not end well. I end up professing my love to her in the streets of Minneapolis while people pass by judging me with their stares. She tells me to move on, and so I turn away and walk through the streets crying like a crazy person. 

I proceed to send emails in the coming days asking all the questions that I don't want to know the answers to. She denies her new relationship is anything more than friends, and I take a little comfort in this.

Then the next guy pops up on her wall. I see she posts pictures of them at an apple orchard (one of our fall traditions) and it hit me hard.
We have countless conversations about us, but she never budges. I finally try to accept it and move on. 

At this point I'm a career man, working in a field that I actually went to school for. I had frequented a bar for happy hour a couple times a week and became friends with the bar tender, we'll call her ""S"". I could always tell that she had a little crush on me so I asked her out to a concert. We hit it off, and for the first time in over a month and a half I was feeling good. It was a great confidence boost.

We went on a few dates before ""B"" caught wind of us. She had a realization (more likely became jealous) and wanted me back. We met up one night and talked about everything and what had been happening during the last month of NC. She admitted that her ""friend"" wanted more, and she let him have more. This crushed me, but I was so elated that she was finally back that I tried my best to put it past us. We decided to tell the other people in our lives that it was over and that we were getting back together. ""S"" took it ok, she was confused because we were having such a nice time with one another. I told her I was going to give ""B"" another shot, and she reluctantly accepted.

We were back! Having passionate and amazing sex, talking about future plans, fantasizing about moving in together. It was so great, especially having thought those fantasy's would never be a reality again. She said she would never do this to us again, and that she wants only me until the end of time. I had a wall up still, but hearing her say those things that I waited so long to hear made it come crumbling down. I had my girl back.

Now it was her turn to cut her guy free (lets call him ""J""). She seemed reluctant considering it was her idea. She told me she had sent him an email, but seemed more upset about it than I was about cutting ""S"". And so began my life as an insecure snooper. 

This would be the cancer of our relationship. And would also reveal a giant red-flag that I never should have gotten past.

I got into her email and saw what she wrote to him. She told him that she didn't know if she was doing the right thing, and that she was sorry. She also said that its hard for her to do this because she was able to talk to him about things that she couldn't with anyone else. It hurt me that she had let him into areas of her life that apparently I have not ever seen. It made me upset that she was so unsure about us to this guy, but to me it was all kisses and rainbows. Maybe she was just letting him down easy.

So at this point instead of raising a fuss about her seemingly reluctant breakup email with ""J"" I decided to just keep snooping like a creep. She says that they have cut contact and that it is over, but her emails say something different. She doesn't say anything bad in her emails to him, mostly just saying thank you when he would send her YouTube videos of sad songs that reminded him of her. When I would ask her if he had tried to contact her (knowing all along that he had) she would lie and say no. So now my girlfriend is a liar, and this further fuels my need to snoop and find out what is really going on. Our re-united honey moon has started to fade now that I've become so crazy with the developing secrets between us. 

Its become a drug to snoop at this point, I must know everything if we are going to continue. And that's when I get shot in the heart with what feels like a canon. I find a chat transcript with a guy that I have never even heard of (lets call him ""C""). They are making plans for him to fly out to Minneapolis. I look at the date, and its three days after she first broke up with me. Who was this guy?? How did they meet? Further digging reveals an ass pic she sent him around the same time. At this point I'm trembling and am about to puke all over myself. I hit a wall. I have to confront her, even though I know in doing so I have to admit to breaking her privacy and snooping through all of her emails like a crazy fuck. But I need to know what the hell is going on, so I pull the trigger.

She becomes super defensive, and freaks about me breaking into her email, totally disregarding all the shit I found. However, I would not let her turn the table on me because in my mind what I did was the lesser of the two evils. She told me that ""C"" was just a Internet pen-pal that she has had since she was 15, and that they were never inappropriate with each other while we were dating. She said she sent him the picture out of a moment of insecurity, having just broken up with me. I thought it was fucking weird that shes had a pen-pal for 8 years that she told no-one about, especially me. So shit is hitting the fan everywhere, and we are a mess. I've almost forgotten about the ongoing communication with ""J"" at this point, having been blindsided by this new information. I tell her that if we are to be together that she has to cut ties with these people. And she reluctantly agrees.

So we try and carry on, because I am a moron and don't know when to throw in the towel. She is no longer the sweet innocent girl that I loved so strongly for 2 years. And I am no longer the trusting boyfriend who thinks his girl can do no wrong. Now I knew what she was capable of and so I remained vigilant. She changed her email password so that was no longer a resource, so I started looking at her phone when ever I would get a sneaking suspicion. And again, she was still communicating with these guys. Nothing flirty, pretty innocent on her end actually, but that didn't matter, she said she wasn't going to anymore and now she is. I try and catch her in a lie instead of throwing myself under the bus again. ""So have those guys still been trying to talk to you?"" Her: ""No"" Me: ""Are you sure?"" Her: ""Yes"" BOOM. I tell her i looked through her phone, and she becomes irate that I once again violated her privacy, and I'm fuming because I caught her in a lie. This happens a few more times, ending every time with her saying she will ignore them and me saying I won't look through her phone.

Gross huh?

This routine lasts a couple months, and then she ends it. I am heart-broke once again and hell-bent on getting her back. I do all the same things as last time, I call her, trying to get her to come back to me, to give us another chance. Its her birthday in a few days and I spent most of my last two paychecks on a new camera for her. I was so excited to give it to her on her Birthday, but she was already gone. I call her on her birthday and don't get any answers, I remember laying in my depressing apartment at the time like the saddest piece of shit you can imagine. The morning comes and I'm miserable, I drag myself to work knowing that it would be another long day. Then in the afternoon I get a text, its her, and she is wondering how I am doing! Wow, she contacted me?! We talk and I can tell that she misses me... I'm so happy that she's initiating conversation without me berating her with texts. I tell her I still want to make things work, and she says that it might be too late. I ask her why and she tells me that she made out with another one of her ""friends"" on her birthday (lets call him ""M""). I always had my reservations about this guy but she constantly reassured me it was platonic and that he was ""the most feminine guy she knew"". So I freak out, and hang up on her. She proceeds to call me over and over again and I just ignore her. The next day I agree to a meet up because I'm weak and still want to be with her. I'm heartbroken and angry to find out that she hooked up with this ""friend"" only a couple days after she broke up with me. She says it was stupid and that she was drunk and sad and that it meant nothing. My mind tells me to get the fuck out of this situation, but my heart just wants her back, so we re-unite. The passion has come back and I'll do anything to keep this girl.

A week goes by and I start to doubt that she only kissed this guy, so I press. With much hesitation she finally confesses that she slept with him. I'm devastated, disgusted and in shock. She pleas with me to stay with her. That it didn't matter, that it was a mistake. I'm crushed, and at a complete loss. I tell her to leave so that I can think, she texts me in the following days, texts that I would have given anything to receive just days before. I felt like I would be a total chump if I let her back in, but as the days past I caved in and let her back into my life...again.

We got through it, we mended, she was constantly reassuring me. Its probably the hardest thing I've ever been through, forcing myself to forgive and forget. To not visualize the act that spun over and over again in my mind. To believe that it wasn't planned and that it only happened once, and that it meant nothing, and that it wouldn't ever happen again. It killed so much, but we were broken up right? right?? (Writing this paragraph makes me feel so stupid)

Long Year huh?

Year 4:
Man we have come through some shit! Has it made us stronger? Am I fighting for the best relationship of my life or am I just fighting for the fight at this point? Are we just torturing ourselves? 

Social Networking:
We have gone through so much and are in a fragile state. Facebook starts to cause problems in our already problematic relationship. She is still facebook friends with all of those ""friends"" that she has been involved with during our break-ups. I would get jealous when those ""ghosts"" from the past would pop up on a feed or like something that she posted. We had lots of stupid arguments and then came to the realization that we should just delete our accounts while we were still trying to re-build our trust. Done, deleted, fuck facebook. Who needs it? This is what saved us or enabled us to continue on with our relationship. She always had a problem cutting people out of her life. She didn't think it was fair to them and didn't want to come off as a bitch. I figured people would understand, unless they were still trying to make plays. So we cut it all off, no more social networking. No snooping no nothing. I decide to just trust her instead of police her and have faith that nothing was going on behind my back. It was a relief.

The next two years are bliss. I stop snooping completely. We go on vacations, my friends and family start to warm to this woman who has broken my heart over and over again. I'm happy. We feel strong like we've fought this long painful battle and survived. We talked about the future again, how we want to grow old with one another, how we should take the next step and move in together. We'd spend at least 5 nights out of the week together, just the two of us. We go to concerts, out to dinner, art museums etc. We start saving up for the next trip we are going to take together. Everything is perfect. Well almost everything... the sex had started to dwindle, and when we did have it, it became a routine. Granted we generally both got off, but it just wasn't as exciting. We both noticed this and tried things to spice it up, but after 5 years I realized that sex is kind of a roller coaster. Some months we had lots of sex, other months it was once a week if that. I figured it was normal, and that every relationship goes through it. 

Her 26 Birthday approaches and I want to make it special. I contact her best friend and asked her to help me get a hold of her other friends via facebook (because we were still facebook free 2 years later). She does and we have 15 people confirmed to have a great time celebrating her birthday. We go back and forth planning all the different things to do and who all to invite, we are going to give this girl a great birthday. Then two days before ""B"" texts me and says ""babe, I don't feel like celebrating with all those people, you mind if we just go out to dinner and then cuddle on the couch?"" (our routine). ""Not at all"" I say, in fact that sounds great to me (thinking to myself). So her b-day arrives and I give her her presents and take her out to sushi, and do everything in my power to make her night great, but she is in a poor mood all night. She just kind of sulks through it all. Doesn't want B-day sex, doesn't want much of anything. I give her a nice long massage and just figured she wasn't in the mood.

A couple of days pass and we get into the age old social networking argument. She is now friends with all of her past ""friends"" on Instagram (her only social networking site), ""but that's ok because there is no messaging and its just about sharing pictures"" I get upset and say ""why the fuck is it so important for you to have contact with these people when you know what it does to us?? Is it really worth it?"" She proceeds to tell me I'm possessive, and that I don't trust her, I reiterate that I just don't see the point, especially given our past. Why re-open wounds? And yeah at this point I feel like a possessive piece of shit.

At this point the switch flips, I've seen this before, not for over two years but I recognized it right away. She says that she doesn't think that we should move in together this spring, and my heart sinks, once again forgetting about why the argument started and instead just trying to keep her from throwing everything away...again. We both shed tears, and in my heart I realized that the end was nearing. With our trip to Mexico just three weeks away, the pressure was on. We ended up getting into the weeds, and I think we both knew what was coming. We were both so nauseous that we stopped just short of breaking up, and decided we couldn't keep talking about it. We ended up going out for a much needed bite and then back to my place where we tried to continue our conversation. Once again we hit a wall and just agreed to not talk about it for the night. 

The next day she comes over again, and I can tell she is on a mission. I ask her if we can resolve this and come to an agreement, and after a long couple of hours she said she wanted to keep trying. I was happy to hear this even though I knew we were far from being out of the woods. I told her that now is her chance to end it all, and to not be afraid of hurting me if she thinks its best. She said no, i want to keep trying, and so we made plans on how to get through it all. We held each other for the rest of the night, both seeming relieved that we had somehow dodged our fate. I woke in the morning to her giving me kisses as she left for work and I was relieved that we were still on the same page.

The following week we tried to act normal, we did the things we loved doing together, we laughed and played video games. I gave her a foot massage while we talked about how we were going to liven things up in the future. We cuddled up on the couch and continued to be us for one more night.

The End:
A couple of nights go by without seeing each other, and my car needs to go into the shop. I ask her to give me a ride to work and then pick me up and take me back to the shop once it was done. She was more than willing to hall me all around the city and I was great full. While driving she placed her hand on my leg and smiled, she talked about how she wanted to see where I work one of these days and meet me for lunch. We were making future plans, talking about our up and coming trip to Mexico and reconnecting. On our way to the shop I offered to go back to my place to ""reconnect"". She was uninterested, and I didn't press. So she dropped me off at the car shop gave me what would be our last kiss and told me she loved me. I watched her drive away thinking ""hey we'll get there again"".

That was the last time I saw her, and probably will be for quite some time. Writing this has been very therapeutic, and you would think with all we have been through, all the battles we have fought along the way that I would be prepared for the end, but I wasn't. She's gone again, and I don't have anything left in me.

We used to spend super bowl Sunday together. I know you are out watching it right now. How can you not think about me and know that I am alone here.

Why did you just leave? We were good together. Why are you scared of getting through the rough parts. That's what relationships are. I always was on your side and have you numerous chances to make things work. Why can't you do the same for me now? You know I'm hurting a lot and I know you have felt this pain. But it's incomparable. I have too much going on already that all I think of is that you make me happy. I never held anything against you and I know I was not the best person in the last few months. I need to find myself. I want to be the person you fell in love with because that was the person I was in love with. I with we could mend things. I have never wanted anything else so bad in the world. Even if it's a few months of just seeing where it goes, it would make me happy now. If it doesn't work then least I know I tried and you gave me that one last special gift that would make my world. 

I sit and wonder why things are the way they are. I was always a fighter and now I feel I can't with this. I am trying to ask for happiness during this time. I wish you would understand that I'm completely lost and have lost hope in everything because we were what kept me grounded. I have thought of ways to rid this pain, but that won't do good. I am asking that warm kind heart you have locked away to think about what you could do for me. 

I never wish anything bad upon you. I wish you never have to feel this way about your life. It's a dark place. I wish if you ever did you would get that chance you long for. It's the least someone could do for a special person. 

I think about the funny expressions and noises that I eventually started doing myself. I think about how you laughed at the weird faces I made when I drank something I didn't like. I miss how you watched my toes move. I miss how you could tell I was in pain by looking at my eyebrows. I miss your laugh. I miss you saying "" wanna smell something epic"".

I don't know if this will be useful to anyone but this is my story and it's both painful and freeing to write it down. I'm 35 years old and every major relationship, both platonic and romantic have resulted in broken trust from lies and manipulation. In every single one, except for my childhood, I've failed to stand up for myself, to draw a line and say that it's not something I want to have in my life. I've been the quintessential doormat. Until now. This is my life and I call the shots now.

**My Childhood**

I grew up in a small religious cult in a big city. My story goes the same way that a stereotypical cult story would go. If I were to tell you the details of my childhood, I'd tell you about all the denial, manipulation, lies and sexual abuse. I'll spare you though. It's enough to know that it happened and as you can image was pretty damaging.

I have 5 brothers and sisters. The oldest three, myself, my older brother and older sister were sexually abused. My parents were in extreme denial. Everything under the surface was rotten and we all knew it, but it was hidden from the world and hidden from ourselves. It has had enormous ripple effects that last to this day. I remember the complete meltdown of the cult when everything came out. The cult leader was ousted (but never arrested, charged or has had to otherwise pay for his moral and legal crimes). My father had completely abandoned his role as a protector, turning over all his responsibility to the cult leader. Looking back, I remember my abuser more clearly than my own father. From the onset, my parents taught us to give everything away, including things that are necessary for our own happiness. 

**Early Adulthood**

I married my ex-wife at a very young age. I had just come back home from a stint in the military and she knew exactly what to say to get my attention. She was insecure and very good at emotional manipulation. Unfortunately, she was also a cheater. She cheated right after we were engaged. I took it, believed her story and reasons, put aside my own self and devoted myself to making a good marriage, one where she wouldn't feel the need to do that to me ever again. Six years later, she cheated with her boss, so I left her, intending to finally end it. I came crawling back 2 months later. I lost myself in the marriage but I hung on anyway. My marriage finally ended after 12 years in August 2011 after she had a full blown affair with her best friend husband. Throughout it all, I kept ignoring my instincts and my gut and let her lie to me. I let her define my reality. It was too painful to handle, so I decided to leave her despite having two small children. 

If you're curious, this is my post from that time period, in all it's painful glory: [Is My 12 Year Marriage Really Over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jru8r/is_my_12_year_marriage_really_over/)

**Post Marriage**

After I ended the marriage, I met someone I had previously worked with and started dating her. She is stunningly beautiful and we shared a connection that felt exactly right, initially. I thought I had found someone who really valued honesty and trust. We shared some special things that were (and still are) real. She knew about my past and my fears of being in the dark about what people do and promised me she would never lie to me, cheat or disrespect me like that. 

Yet, from the very beginning, I felt like there was something she was keeping from me. I brought it up gently in the beginning because I was afraid of ruining something due to my trust issues and insecurities. She told me in the beginning that while she liked to do cocaine, it was very infrequent and that she cherished me more than any drug. I had no reason to doubt her at that point so I took her word for it while telling her it wasn't something I was comfortable with having in my life. She promised she would stop.After the conversation, I felt glad she was honest enough to tell me. It encouraged me because it felt like it was a healthy conversation.

But, she continued partying hard and would avoid my questions about how her evenings went so I began to suspect that coke was a bigger deal. After one incident where she went out partying all night with her gay best friend, I brought my concerns up. At first, her responses were perfect and made me feel that it was just residual stuff from my failed marriage (and the crappy way it ended). Nevertheless, I struggled with feeling like she was hiding things so I used my highly develop skill of denial to ignore it. I ignored my instincts and by extension, turned over my own well-being to another person.

It didn't work very well because nothing changed and I begin to feel that she really was lying to me. I started pushing for the truth and her responses changed to where she was not just lying, but adding more lies to old ones. Then, she began to get angry and defensive, turning my accusations and suspicions into something that was monstrously unfair, saying that I was hurting her by not trusting her. She manipulated me into feeling bad about questioning her.Even though I knew the relationship was killing me, I continued. It's what I know, after all.

I posted on r/relationships an embarrassingly number of times, crying for help but refusing to listen. I didn't listen to any of the advice there. Instead, I looked for ANYTHING to rationalize staying with her. I threatened to leave if there were any more lies but I never followed through. In retrospect, that was an enormous failing on my part. I was empty, weak and let her continue to lie to me. She had no real reason to stop and every reason to keep doing the things that hurt us. I'm not excusing her actions, I'm taking responsibility for my role in allowing that to happen.

Here are some of the more choice posts:. These are all me.

**Now**

I found the strength to leave her yesterday morning. We had a nice New Years Eve until she got completely and utterly wasted at a party we went to. I knew then, that the situation would never change, that she had drinking issues that had to be dealt with by herself.I don't think she was sneaking drugs, but it wouldn't matter anyway. She was a different person. Outgoing, flirtatious and even joyous.

At 3am, after she had passed out on a couch, I attempted to call a taxi, but it took forever because hey, it's New Years Eve, everybody needs a taxi. My phone battery died so I had to use hers. While waiting to get through the busy signal, I saw that she had recently deleted most of her texts but despite clearing her history, I saw that just a few days ago she had been arranging to meet her best friend (the same guy who ALWAYS has drugs) in a nearby town to go shopping with her.This bothered me because she never mentioned meeting up with him. She said she wanted to run out for a bit to go shopping (the truth) but left out the very important part of hanging out with her friend. Was she going to buy or do some coke? I don't know, but it means that even now, after everything, she was going to keep hiding her intentions and actions. I also saw that as recently as a few weeks ago, when I feebly broke up with her, she called the same friend several times right after I left. He clearly came over, they did drugs, drank heavily, etc. She lied about that, too. She doesn't know that I know this information and it doesn't matter anymore. 

I sent her a goodbye note last night, which I will post below. It was hard, but ultimately everything came down to one thing: ""self respect"". I'm not a martyr, nor do I want to be one. This isn't me. I can no longer allow someone who says they love me to lie and attempt to manipulate me. It's something I would never do to someone I truly loved. It's true that we all lie, we all cover up, we all manipulate but it's matter of degree and length and what the lies are intended to hide. I think I know what her reasons are. She has addiction issues. It's hard, I know. I have them too.I don't know how serious it is and I don't know the extent of what that's led to while we dated (I don't want to know), but it just doesn't matter anymore. I don't care about what the ""truth"" is. I care about taking care of myself. I don't need to catch her lying. I don't need to feel justified in breaking up. I was justified a long time ago.

It also doesn't matter how much I loved my girlfriend (who I loved with all my heart). If I'm being taken advantage of, that's a line that's simply not acceptable. How can I ever trust my own self if I keep letting others hurt me? There IS no other right answer to this. I will no longer hide from reality and I'm taking responsibility for myself. 

Taking responsibility for my failings also means I need to recognize that I didn't handle my (justified) angry reactions to the lies and manipulation. I could have fostered a more open and supportive environment to talk about the problems between us. I suspect it would not have made a difference but I should have been better nevertheless. I won't pretend that I'm NOT angry. I am. The different is that I'm going to fix it, not hope that someone else will.

Ultimately, it's important to me that I say goodbye in a way that is healthy and from an open, honest and real place. No anger, just the reality as I see it. I feel good about what I wrote. I wanted to be kind and I sincerely hope she understands that someday.

&gt;[Redacted],
Against my better judgement, I'm writing this email. I'm not expecting a response. It will be for the best if we stop communicating after this. If you do have a response, I'll read it, but I won't be replying. I care a very great deal for you and continuing to talk would simply hurt too much. As hard as it is, my decision is final. Much of what I'll say here won't be a surprise to you but I think it's important I say it anyway.

&gt;This is entirely about trust and I have none left. I've been completely consumed by trying to keep myself invested in our relationship when really, it's impossible. Without trust we don't have a relationship. 

&gt;It's hard not to take it personally, but because I don't know anything about what you're struggling with, I'm going to err on the side of what I do know about you and say that many of your actions weren't meant to hurt me. So please don't worry, I'm not going to accuse you of anything. I'm just explaining why I can't continue with you. I'm just going to use one example from May.

&gt;I recently went back to my email's gtalk chat archive and re-read your response when I confronted you about buying drugs for your friend [redacted].

&gt;Of course, initially, you flat out denied doing what I suspected. Your next response was to turn it on me. You told me it was none of my business, that I wasn't ready for another relationship, that you were heart broken and I was being completely unfair. You then inferred it was impossible for you to regain my trust. This was in May. Re-reading the chat made me feel manipulated and played, [redacted]. I'm not going to make any assumption about it being sub-conscious or not, but it doesn't matter.

&gt;I cannot accept that from a person who says they love me, no matter what the reason is. You know how important this is to me. If you take away anything from this e-mail, it's this paragraph. 

&gt;The thing that kills me is that you have so much to offer [redacted]. We have a great connection, but it's always missed something and I can't fix it on my own. You're not in a position to fix it either and I completely understand that. I think going to therapy is going to be extremely important as you deal with what you need to deal with. 

&gt;I debated about providing the comfort of a relationship to help you, but it would probably be harder for you. In a way, I've not been the best influence. I've tried very hard to make you feel loved and looked after but I think it's shielded you from having to deal with your own struggles. 

&gt;In addition, I often made threats of leaving if there were more lies, etc. I never followed through, until now. That alone was not good for me and it wasn't good for you. I fully accept that blame for that.

&gt;[redacted], I'm not interested in anyone but you. What I wanted was a relationship with all of you, not some of you. I loved every part you shared with me, but I didn't get the best of you. You aren't getting the best of yourself, either, and that has to be something you do. 

&gt;Whatever motivations or reasons are behind it, it simply comes down to not being able to accept the dishonesty and the attempts to make me feel bad for confronting you. 

&gt;I don't know what else to say. I'm not angry at you, I know who you are and you're not a bad person. I've always admired you. And even though in the end, I don't feel like I was treated very well in some areas of our relationship, I have nothing bad to say about you. I loved what we did have and I appreciate all the wonderful things you DID do for me. They meant a lot to me.


**The End**

Here's to 2013 and to the rest of my life. My own life. Love the way that sounds!

We aren't talking about homocidal feelings, set those aside for now because they have no place in the healing that this might accomplish. Those words that you wish you could utter in their presence to tell them exactly what the breakup meant to you.

I will start.

After the breakup I thought things would be fine. I agreed that it would be best because I knew that attempting to keep someone by my side that did not also want to be there would hurt us both more than words could express. However your actions afterward have shown me more than anything that you have no respect for what we had. 

What you have done was so hurtful, and we both know I would have never done anything like that to you. Why? Because I respected what we had, even if you no longer wanted it I still felt that it deserved all the reverence that a year long relationship required.

My heart goes out to you, because unfortunately I still care. Even if I do not want to. I hope you have a good life, because all humans deserve an ounce of happiness. I will not forgive you, nor will I forget this happened, but I can and will move on and the hurt you caused will one day heal. Let us both hope that is the case for all the other hearts you damage along the way, for am I am patient and loving man, and you might not be so lucky the next time.

That is mine, and simply writing it was a healing process. For those of you who have something that was left unsaid, this post is the place for that.

It works because your subconscious mind can't tell the difference between something strongly imagined and something that actually occurs.  

Ask yourself these questions: What do you miss about your ex?  Specifically, what actions and activities?  How did those make you feel?  

Here are my answers:  
&gt; What do I miss the most about her?  The sensation of snuggling with her.    It made me feel loved, cared for, valued and comforted.  

Pick the emotional state that means the most to you.  For me it would be ""valued"".  Ask yourself ""how does it feel when I am [emotional state]?""

Imagine that emotional state as vividly as you can.  Can you imagine how it feels?  If not, can you remember a time you felt this way strongly?  

Now, let go of any mental images and hold onto only the emotional state.  Repeat to yourself ""I am [loved/comforted/valued/whatever emotional state]""  

With this tactic you now have the ability to feel any emotional state you want, all on your own.  Do you miss how he/she made you feel?  Now you can generate that emotional state within yourself.  All it takes is a bit of concentration.  

I used it to overcome depression.  At the time I could only imagine ""feeling happy and full of energy"" for a few seconds at a time, but the more I did it, the longer I could hold onto the emotional state.  It was only recently that I realized that this ability might be repurposed for breakups.

It's very easy to blame yourself and tell yourself you're worthless after a breakup. You get into a slump because you were validating yourself with another person and they didn't want you, so it's natural to feel pretty bad. The problem is if you keep feeling sorry for yourself they just look better and better in comparison and you start thinking ""Man, that girl/guy is awesome. Why did I have to mess that up?!""

If you actually start by looking at yourself and saying, how do I want to be better you can do wonderful things. Join a gym, take up a new sport, start looking after yourself better, take vitamins, dress nicely and you will start respecting yourself more and then you get to a better place.

You can actually look at your ex-partner and see that you are just as good if not better than that person and you will find someone new and better.

A full period of human gestation. It seems impossible to consider that I could have grown a complete human being in this time, have supported the differentiation and multiplication of hundreds of billions of cells, yet somehow failed to break free of this chokehold you have on my heart.

Though I wish you weren’t, you’re still here. My entire life remains torn through and dripping with the blood paint of you and I. You’re in my bed, you’re in the anatomy books I tortuously revise from, you’re in the library I hide in to study (read: procrastinate, and yep – you’re in that too), you’re on the streets I stroll down with the necessary-but-not-sufficient men I vainly use to forget you, you’re in the medical school curriculum I peruse, you’re in the journal articles that I read, you’re on the buses that I catch, you’re in every Lana Del Rey song I hear, each night when I sleep you are in my dreams. You’re everywhere but at the same time – every experience, each occurrence, is painful with the absence of you from it – because really, you’re absolutely nowhere. You’re long gone in the gonest sense of the word. You are nothing to do with me anymore. You’re somewhere else, with someone elses – moved on, smiling, laughing, reading, sleeping, thinking, doctoring – without the briefest interruption of me. I am certain that this is how you experience it – the post you-and-me world. It’s okay. I have to believe that one day I will experience your version of that world. One day I will go 12 hours without thinking of you. One day I will go one week without crying and aching just to see your smile, to hear your voice. One day I will be able to walk past the restaurants we haunted without that small but noticeable pain in my stomach that twists and pricks and reminds me of how much I still miss you.

Sometimes my negative certainties even extend back to the actual you-and-me world – they whisper to my most insecure self, try to convince me that you never loved me. Not in the way that I loved you. But you did. I swear you did. I remember how we were, how you looked at me, how you kissed me, how delighted you were to see me or hear my voice, how you told me that you didn’t have a care in the world when I was in your arms, that you loved me more than you’d ever loved anyone before (although when we were over you added the caveat of ‘so far’).

I know it’s too much to hope that you think of me and feel a pang of missing me, of some regret; my post you-and-I bad behaviour solidly precluded any such sentimental musings on your behalf – I was a veritable walking, talking sign of ‘you made the right decision!’. So instead I just hope that every now and then, something may occasion you to think of some happy moment with me, causing you to smile.

I know that I should want good things for you –that I should hope that you find a pretty and interesting girl, settle down, have a family – all of the best things in life. Only I can’t hope that. Well I can. But in that oil painting of your happy life with the pretty and interesting girl, I want that girl to be me.

If I thought it would do any good at all I would compile a dissertation with graphs and statistics and logical constructions on why you should come back to me. On why we, whilst not perfect, were as close as it gets. I want to draw the curve of you and I and extrapolate out a happy life together. I want to scream at you that you never gave us enough time, enough data points – that you made a decision based on an incomplete analysis. I want to believe that if only I can find the right words and arrange them in the right order and pair them with the right diagrams that I can convince you. That you didn’t really stop loving me. That you just cauterised that part of your heart, subjugated it to ill-reasoned arguments about ‘different relationship styles’ and ‘life schedule clashes’, and that with the right words I can redirect the blood flow and resurrect the dead tissue and you will remember how much you loved me and how happy we were. But the rational part of my brain knows that that approach, like this outpouring of emotion, would be terrifying to you. Off-putting. Cringe-worthy. Awkward. Because you don’t love me anymore. Not even slightly. I know I should feel embarrassed. I mean, I should have felt embarrassed after the first desperate, heartfelt e-mail you never replied to, let alone the second or third. Love really does just make you crazy and foolish and ridiculous.

I’ve heard that you won’t get over somebody until you completely accept that it’s over. I think I have accepted it, I know you will never come back. Yet I can’t move on. You were just my favourite thing in the entire world. I loved you more than I ever thought it was possible to love anything. You gave resonance to all those (previously seeming) ridiculous love stories and tortured poetry written by pale faced dead people. I was never so perfectly content as when you were close to me, in my bed; my demons were still out there, lurking in the background, but to borrow a phrase from Bukowski - for a moment they didn’t have me by the throat. I am terrified that I will love you until the sun sets in the east and rises in west.

You will never read this – or if by some sick twist of fate you (a) stumble across it on the internet and (b) actually care to read the whole thing… you will never identify it as being written by me or pertaining to you – but I swear that I will write this out and carry it around with me forever in a sealed envelope – and if I ever see you again I will give it to you, no matter how old we are.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1360161159.0,,,True,t3_17v8cc,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/17v8cc/my_still_broken_heart_excruciatingly_honest/,

To me, that date signifies the completion of a year of me being dumped. I was unceremoniously removed from my lover's life when she decided that I could be an option for her, and just out of the blue stopped caring for me. Sure, we had our share of troubles running up to the moment when she dumped me, but I still don't think the reasons were big enough to forget 5 years worth of memories. Memories that were built painstakingly - that first touch, that first smile, the first kiss, the first sex, losing our virginities to each other, our first orgasms together - all shattered that fateful night of 1st January 2012. I was broken. More so than I've ever been. It's therefore only fitting that I let r/breakups know how I feel a year on.

I've been reading stuff here on /r/breakups ever since I discovered it just after my breakup. I've received a lot of inspiration from like minded folks who've also had love snatched away from them. I posted about my breakup last year from a throwaway account. I don't have a link to prove it, but I just thought I'd give back to the community and let people know how I feel a year on.

**DOES IT GET BETTER?**
The answer to that, in my experience, is yes and no. On some days, I genuinely felt that I am better off without my ex, while on other days, it tortured me to think that I'll not have her around anymore. Being a more emotionally inclined person, I had more painful days where I moped about how I'd love to have her back and take care of her and have her love me back. From that point of view, I'm not even a single percent healed, as I still feel every bit of the pain and sorrow as I did that night. I've cried myself to sleep countless number of times, and have woken up with nightmares, or some expectation of contact from her side, just as much.

**TRIGGERS, TRIGGERS, TRIGGERS**
The smallest of things have started impacting me the most. Things that a regular person wouldn't note. However, I see such things and immediately my mind makes a connection to the past, where me and her shared something similar sometime. And the whole weight of the world then comes crashing down on me. A suffocating heaviness in my chest, a feeling of desparation, and just out and out pain overcomes me everytime something triggers my memory into thinking of her.

**MAINTAINING NO CONTACT**
Perhaps my biggest folly over this one year has been the fact that I've been very weak in maintaining no contact. Even when I've personally made up my mind not to contact my ex, I've succumbed to answering her calls/texts, just so that she doesn't get ""yet another reason"" to hate me. Maybe that's out of some deep-seated insecurities in my psyche, or that my self respect has been diminished so much ever since getting dumped, that I've partly ceded control of my actions to her. She's called me when she's needed me, even said that she still loves me on multiple occasion, and then gone back to being cold and heartless the very next day. I've felt used, manipulated, and emotionally abused. I've doubted and hated myself millions of times, just to appease to her wants and her will, without paying any semblance of attention to what I was doing to myself.

**TERTIARY MISDEEDS**
I picked up smoking, after having been against any form of it for 23 years of my life, and reached to levels where I was doing a couple of packs a day. I started doing weed, another thing that I'd never done before. Luckily for me, I've now sworn off of smoking ever since 2013 started, and have been good with it and honest to myself thus far. But the fear of another relapse always lingers on.

**HOW DO I FEEL?**
Alone.
Abused.
Distrustful.
Lonely.
Afraid.
Doubtful about myself.
Quiet.
Shy.
Hurt.
I still cry myself off to sleep every now and then. I still dream about her. I still itch to text/call her (but don't anymore). I know that if she wants to come back, I'd at least consider doing it. I miss her companionship. Miss going to all these new places with her. Miss being in a couple.

**AM I STILL IN LOVE WITH HER?**
Yes.

**WHY THIS WALL OF TEXT?**
Because I just want to let out all the feelings somewhere. I can't talk to friends as I feel like I've burdened them enough. My family doesn't get the point of how hard this is on me (especially considering it was 5 years long, and a first love). Because I don't want others to make the same mistakes I did. Perhaps, I'm overly emotional and let myself by attached way too much, but I feel people out her can use a little of my experience at least to help them through the rough times. I'm sorry if none of this relevant.

I'll try to make this quick. My [21/f] ex dumped me [21/m] eight weeks ago after what I consider, in hindsight, to be a very nice relationship (up until the last few weeks when things started falling apart). 

Now I've been posting and checking up here every day, offering advice, receiving advice, and this community has really been awesome. I've learned a lot. I initiated NC immediately, blocked her facebook after a few weeks, and haven't spoken to her at all aside from some awkward hello's in passing on campus.

Things are so much better! I'm taking care of myself now, I'm doing all the things here that I've been instructed to do, and I'm loving it. I can honestly say that, as of right now, I'm just immersing myself in my school work, and I'm happy :)

But there's some demons I'm still having a hard time with, and I was hoping you lovely folks could offer some advice and share some stories of your own. The main issue is that I still think about her once I wake up in the morning, and I usually have these five-minute intervals or so where I just have these inner dialogues with her. I think of what I would say to her, what she'd say to me, and the questions I'd ask her if we ever sat down for a Coffee Talk. I have these conversations with myself maybe 10 times a day, and they come and go, like I said, for a few minutes, and then they pass after a few moments of me reciting some of the burning questions I've had. Is this normal, considering it's been 8 weeks?

And if it's of any importance, the questions I usually ask are things like:

* Why did you lead so many guys on without telling them you were dating me?
* What are some things that I may have done to contribute to the end of the relationship? (Because honestly, I'm not sure if I know, and I want to find out so I can improve myself)
* Were you being honest when you said x, y, and z?

And then every once in a while I'll think about the good times we shared. Maybe once every few days. And maybe once a day I'll think about some of the hurtful things she started doing at the end of the relationship, and this kinda hurts to think about a little bit. And I'll also think about who she's fucking, and that hurts a bit, but fortunately I've gotten better at not being bothered at that sort of thing.

Now, I know it's been 8 weeks. Maybe that's been too short of a time to fully recover. But I'm also going to start reducing my time on r/breakups by about an hour each week. I want to slowly wean myself off coming here, and I downloaded a Procrastinator Site Block app on Chrome to help me resist the urge. Not sure if you guys think this is wise or unwise, but I think it's time for me to start moving on from here.

Anyways, I'd sure appreciate some advice. Thanks everybody!

**TL;DR - I'm improving a lot but I still think about her in regular bursts throughout the day, where I'll have inner dialogues in which I ask her various questions about the relationship and what happened/why it failed**

We ended on bad terms, but good terms.  It was strange.

Its now been a 3 months and I have learned a lot about what happened and about myself.

I need to live life for me.  That's it.  If someone wants to be with me then they will like me for who I am.  

I feel like I have moved on, but sometimes the urge to think about her is very strong.  It usually only lasts for 10 minutes or so a day now.  Much better than the first few weeks where it was almost all day.

I'm going out to clubs, talking to random women at malls and other public places.  Its quite nice.  

I am doing all of this on my own terms.  There is no longer any kind of pressure from myself to be in a relationship.  Its like I have been there done that.  Life is so much better with this kind of mentality.  

I don't feel lonely.  I don't think I have ever felt lonely in my life.  I can't even comprehend what that even means.  Even if I am alone for extended periods I can still hang out with myself, I'm a cool guy to hang out with and I do look pretty handsome.  This might change, who knows.

There are a lot of things that I have discovered,

* I can't help other people unless they ask for it.
* Things are better when I pursue what I want out of life.
* I can't be around people that I don't want to be around or that act like they don't want to be around me, no excuses.
* If I like order and structure in my life I should accept that completely and not change my way of living for someone else.
* It's true that if you feel like you don't love someone then you just don't.
* Don't make excuses for other people even if they have brain problems.  They should be able to cope.
* If someone breaks up with you in year 3 by saying they want to sleep with other guys don't try to save the relationship.  It will die.
* Life is not set.  You make your own path.
* If someone is telling you that you have some sort of disorder, screw them... go find someone that wont label you and judge.
* Your parents relationship will not define your relationship.  Different times, different culture and different areas.
* If you have to choose between relationship and career, choose career.  I felt like crap when I didn't.
* Hold on to your own beliefs/morals and don't adopt others just because you want to fit in.
* If you feel like your SO wants to break up with you but doesn't have the guts to do it or even talk to you about it... Break up with them.  It will save you a headache.
* Don't be miserable or in a dirty unkempt sloppy state just because you want to relate with someone.
* If your SOs family puts pressure on you to stay with them... don't listen to that BS.  They do not know the majority of the story and its really none of their business.


I am happier and post breakup has actually been pretty awesome.  There is still some awkwardness floating around with mutual friends.  Its pretty easy to navigate though.

I have to admit, I have had some moments of sending her messages where I'm not being honest about my own well being, but whatever.  I guess I'm trying to make it seem as though I'm not doing as well as I really am.  I need to get over that.  Its slowly working its way out.

I just don't give a crap about other peoples issues and its a very nice and welcoming change.  I just focus on myself and be the best person I can be.  

It gets way better.

I'm not QUITE there yet, but such posts, being social, tending towards optimism, and weekly (budget) therapy has really helped me out.

Anyhow, the temptation to text/call/write/email the ex while you are trying to get over them is a terrible struggle. My relationship was somewhat lengthy with a very good friend, and the breakup was very messy, many breaks in a row with her eventually breaking up with me.  Two months into a necessary-for-sanity cutting of ties, filled with lovesickness and over-analytical-regret, I wavered and explained to a friend my romance-laden and/or emotionally-dependent plans to break the silence between my ex and I. My friend told me this:

""Why would you try to teach Spanish to someone who doesn't want to learn it?""

It feels harsh at first, but when you let it sink in, it is very helpful. I could shower my ex with flowers, poetry, gifts, etc, but SHE had decided that things should end, that she was better off not only without the bad that I brought to the relationship, but also the good. She doesn't want to learn Spanish. For better or worse, it doesn't fit in her life at this point. It is a pointless venture.

And that doesn't make the language any lesser for a person not wanting to know it.

It's easy to feel crushed by the bad you later regret bringing to a relationship, but don't forget the good. Keep trying to improve yourself, improve your language, and trust there will be willing pupils in the future (once you feel ready to learn, as well, of course).

Anyway, there's my attempt at paying-it-forward. Thanks to all who have done the same. It has been indispensable.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_10ijry,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/10ijry/excellent_advice_for_those_struggling_with/,

This is a letter to let you know exactly where I stand right now. I don't think we can be friends. I don't even think that we can be civil. 

Thank you for not having the minimal amount of decency required to fully admit to everything even after there was nothing left to lose. The entire time that I have known that you have existed only one thing has remained consistent, your ability to surprise me with how low of a human being you are. Even 2 months after we ended it, your lying continues to haunt me. 

It is unfathomable to me, that you have chosen two courses of action: 1. to selfishly put my health at risk because you cannot control your impulses and 2. (and this is the absolute worst) put my health at risk because you are too much of a coward to admit to what you did. I have to find out THROUGH A THIRD PARTY something that could be potentially life altering. 

You are an intelligent person. And I hope to whatever higher being there is out there that you were intelligent enough to use a condom whilst fucking a prostitute in a third world country.

I was married for 9 years to a woman I loved without end.  I have two beautiful children.  One day on the way to pick up our kids she tells me she wants a divorce.  I am devistated, I lost weight, I got sick, I cried for days.  I could not understand, I was blinded.  I hired someone to look for me, she was cheating.  By the time we were ready to sign the papers she was living with him and engaged(her friend told me)-she announced it at the signing.  The day at the attorneys office came, I parked next to her in the parking lot.  She got half of everything and the kids.  I watch her as she walks out, she gets in her car and notices the envelope I put on the steering wheel.  In that envelope are pictures of her and him, his rap sheet-domestic abuse, child abuse, felony drug convictions etc.  She looks over at me in my car as I light up a cigarette and smile-maybe not so hurt after all.  Her eyes are full of tears, I had never revealed that I knew any of this until this point.  I crank up here I go again and drive off.  Turns out somebody tipped off CPS on her living arrangements and his convictions.  You see the custody hearing was two weeks away, and when CPS showed at her apartment she had a black eye it was a done deal(I knew she would confront him and it would lead to fight).  I got full custody of the kids, she had to pay me child support, her new ""relationship"" was decimated, and he went to jail.   I ended up meeting a great woman and we are very much in love, she is also younger than my ex.  My ex will not even look at me now, she never even comes around to visit the children.  She lives in a crappy apartment by herself now.  She thought she took everything from me, turns out she took it from herself.

Why is that so hard?” Perhaps we try too hard, we over-analyze, trying to “figure it all out.” We’re too hard on ourselves. Many times it’s not the attachment that causes us pain. It’s detachment that hurts. 

I don’t want the cheese, I just want to get out of the trap.
SPANISH PROVERB

How does one avoid loss in the first place? Contrary to popular belief, it’s not attachment that causes loss–attachment feels fine. It’s detachment that hurts. Learn to let go.

Some suggest that to avoid loss, one should never be attached to anything. They give the example of a hand in water: when the hand is removed from the water, the hand leaves no impression. These people say the reason the hand leaves no trace in the water is because the water is not attached to the hand.

On the contrary, while the hand is in the water, it is very attached to the hand–surrounding, enfolding, and embracing it. Allow yourself to experience life as fully as water experiences the hand; then, as completely, let go.

Yes, the water leaves a little of itself on the departing hand, as we leave a little of ourselves with the people and things we touch. For the most part, however, when it comes time to go, let go.

The hand can no more hold the water than the water can hold the hand. As soon as one “wants” to leave, there is no attachment. Hand and water both accept the inevitability, and part “clean.”

There is a title for a book on raising children I’ve always liked: Hold Them Very Close, and Let Them Go. This I find good advice for all experiences:

Hold them very close, and let them go.

I had been with a girl for over two years through some combination of dating and hooking up. Out of the blue she broke up with me and like many of you I was destroyed. All I could think about was what went wrong and all the things I could have done to change what happened. After a while I took the very same advice many of you get here; let it go, better yourself, and in time all the pain will fade.

There is a reason that advice is given so often. It works. And it worked for me and after a month I was happier with myself than I had ever been. I was eating better, working out, and generally feeling awesome. I ended up seeing the ex out at the bar one night, and we had a short but civil talk. The next day I received a series of texts from her that essentially said ""we should be friends with benefits.""

Without thinking I jumped on the opportunity. And things were great for a while, it was pretty much like we were dating again but without the official title. After a while I noticed things just didn't seem right though. And here is where I made my ""it's so obvious that it isn't obvious"" revelation.

We broke up for a reason. In the time we spent together before the breakup we were being ourselves and we were happy. But people change, and it got to a point where she didn't like who I was. It's horrible to learn that someone you love doesn't love you back, it's why you can't stop thinking about them. It's hard to see in the moment because your thoughts are clouded by the desire to just have their affection back. You want them to love you just as much as you love them.

That's why I jumped at the opportunity to be back with her. In the end it did nothing to help me though. Without her I had made myself into a better person, someone I loved. With her back in the picture all my focus began going back to her, and it impacted me poorly.

When we split again I had none of the feelings associated with the original breakup. I'm not even angry, I just don't feel anything towards the situation at all. I owe it all to the realization that at the end of the day it was me who had to be happy, I needed to take care of myself. Not to sound like a pig, but there are three girls currently vying for my attention and its due to the fact that I value myself so highly. Being the best person you can be is the ultimate attraction to the opposite sex.

So the takeaway from this rambling post is this: Your relationship is broken for a reason. You won't be able to find happiness through anyone but yourself. And above all else if you really want to find someone that loves you, you have to first love yourself. If you don't why would anyone else?",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_t4po8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/t4po8/maybe_this_will_help_some_of_you/,
1333649114.0,24,self.BreakUps,ruydk,Come motivation,30,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ruydk/come_motivation/,"Last year I fell in love with a girl. I did absolutely everything for her and she was my source of inspiration, happiness, security, everything. 

Then a couple of weeks ago we broke up and the first weekend she was gone she slept with someone else. I didn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I could do anything at all. 

Today I am writing to say that it has been absolutely horrible, but that's ok. When you fall in love with the right person, you SHOULD have these feelings when you lose them, you SHOULD feel like you want to reach out and contact them. But THIS WAS NOT THE PERSON. Whether or not you believe it now, the best thing to do is to repeat to yourself that you deserve someone that feels the way you do now, and that this person was not it.

I have cut off all contact and have talked to many many friends (some of whom are going through the same thing). I have drawn inspiration from this subreddit specifically because of the top motivational posts.

Every day I get up and I think about myself, when I start to think about her, I immediately say ""STOP! What do YOU need to do for YOURSELF?"" This is no longer about him/her because they are *not part of your life anymore*. This is hard to grasp because you're in love, but that's healthy and a GOOD thing because you can feel this way - just not with this person. 

If you have been through a breakup before, you know for a fact that you will develop feelings for someone again. If you haven't, you can trust ALL the people on here and everyone you ever meet that it WILL happen. It's a NORMAL and NATURAL part of life to experience a breakup because breakup means it was broken and it didn't work. 

Please do not continue being in a relationship that caused you so much pain, that is not what a relationship is. A relationship should the the way you wanted it to be all along - love, compassion, affection, sex, fun, and the occasional misunderstanding and even argument (but not at the rate it happened before you broke up).

Please take this time to understand when it went wrong and how to recognize that in the future. You do not want to repeat this with someone you will learn to love in the future (and you will!!!). Take this time to get a new haircut, go to the dentist, start being active athletically, whatever it is you always wanted to do!

For me, I got an email from her today. I want to read it, re-read it, then respond and then talk and everything. BUT I know what will happen if I do that. I put my hand on the hot stove before and I know I can't trust her with my feelings. I am writing this to express that one of the most difficult things now is letting go, but piece by piece I am making that effort and even though I fall into a panic and I become desperate, each time I say ""STOP"" is easier and each time I recognize that I have a lot to focus on because this is *about me* now. There is a person in your life that you need to take care of right now and it's you and they have been neglected because you focused on someone else who did not appreciate it. One day there will be someone who treats you like you treat them and the balance will be struck. That is not today and you have the opportunity to grow and love yourself.

You want to attract someone in the future? Become confident, independent, and admit and accept that this is a relationship that ended. It was nothing special, it was great for a while and now it's over. A new chapter began for you and once you put in enough time to grieve (please let yourself do this, you will soon be sick of it), you will recognize that it was just a person and not something to worship.

One last bit of advice, do yourself a favor and hide EVERYTHING that represents your past with this person - pictures, gifts, etc. Now, if you have things that you used to do together that you still want to do - GO DO THEM, soon you will replace your memories with them with new memories that don't have them (and it will be hard, but it WILL happen).

You will be alright, trust r/breakups, we've all been there.

Dear Mr. Starfish:

For a time, I was stupid in love with you. Or at least I thought I was. And I believed you were stupid in love with me. It's okay that you weren't. 
 
The details of our story are like everyone's story really. After the break-up I sometimes missed you, other times not so much. There were days when the NC drove me crazy. And there were times I simply had forgotten what transpired between the two of us; it may seem cruel to admit, but there were times I would even forget you.

It took a while to figure out (and even longer to accept) that we were both keeping each other from growing and becoming the people we were meant to be. 
Okay, okay, cliche...but it's true. [: 

You were all-wrong for me, even though I tried to color you with an all-right crayon. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't excuse the fact that you cheated on me or the manner in which you broke up with me. After all, I am a human being with feelings. 

And you, too, have feelings and I sometimes overlooked them. I cannot begin to understand how difficult your life was/is/and will be. I'm sorry for any drama I added. 

But enough sadness and/or hate. I want you to know that I did stay in my Masters program; I write my thesis in the fall. I teach freshman composition--no words will ever describe the joy I find in my job. 

And I got married.

For a time, I thought you were supposed to be my husband. My expectations, I'm sure, put a lot of pressure on you. For that, I apologize. Our relationship was so intense it was sometimes hard to see reason. 

I'm writing this because my husband was helping me organize my junk and he found Starmee, squished at the bottom of a box. Seeing him, obviously, made me think of you. And I thought of fond memories--
rainbow sorbet, Minecraft, and cheese pizza. But those are memories from a long time ago...and have no place in my world now. 

I threw Starmee away, not to be mean, but to lay to rest a relationship that was too dramatic, too selfish, and too exhausting for its own good. Admittedly, jj would have been devastated; but, she only existed as a product of our imagination. A lot of our relationship existed in our imagination. 

I'm glad it's over. I'm glad because life is good. And I choose this life over any life that we would have undoubtedly faked for one another.

I do hope you're happy. I mean that in earnest. [: 
I hope that you are well and that you can surround yourself with people who love you for what you are, not what they want you to be.

Goodbye Mr. Starfish, [:

Best, 
JJ
  

NOTE: I know that this subreddit is here to help others, so I say this to anyone who has read this far: don't give up. This took me a very long time to write. When the break-up happened I wanted to never leave the house. But I did. I picked myself up and started a new life. I lost weight, I met someone, and now I'm happily married. Always remember, YOU MATTER!! Just because some dumb boy/girl broke up with you doesn't mean you suck, it just means a temporary sucky thing happened. You all rock! Thanks for the rant space!!

This was back in October and was a very messy, prolonged, horrible break-up - we tried to make things work and start again over Christmas, but the trust was gone, and it just was not the same. I knew that it would be the best for both of us to part ways.

A good friend gave me a month's free gym membership, and I just want to tell anyone going through similar pain that something like this will help you so so much.

For me, the mornings and late nights are the worst. Waking up in an empty, quiet room and wondering how to fill the void and a long empty day still feels awful. But knowing I've got somewhere to go and new classes to try out helps so much. It also helps the sadness of going to bed alone as by the time evening comes, I'm so tired and worn out I fall asleep pretty quickly.

I can't recommend this enough, Reddit. :)

Obviously it's a long, long grieving process, but I feel that this has really started the healing process for me. I LET the break-up hurt me. I sit on the bike and think about all the tender moments we had together. I think about his little quirks and stupid multi-coloured shirts and being wrapped up in his coat with him in the cold. I think about what he might be doing at that moment in time, and those little freckles on his arms and his ridiculous shower singing. Sometimes I even listen to songs that remind me of him on my iPod - and then I sweat out all those memories. I let it hurt and I let myself grieve and feel that gut-wrenching pain, and then I work-out vigourously, and sweat it out of my system. This pain, and everything I learned from the last two years is part of who I am, and will help me to be a better person.

I really hope that you guys who feel the same will try something like this. Reddit has helped me SO much over the last few months, and I just wanted to put something back.

Give it a try :)

Good luck, and much love.

It won't EVER happen because only YOU can help you.

Crying myself to sleep for quite sometime, hating her, hating myself. I was stupid enough to keep seeing her until like a week ago... Every-time it just brought back all of those horrible emotions.

So I wanted to make this post so people that are currently in post-breakup mode can listen to me(hopefully).

If you just came out of a relationship and feel like shit, it gets better... May not feel like it at the time but it does. If you're still in touch with your SO and you can't stop thinking about them... Stop all contact, go outside, meet new people.

There is nothing worse than staying in touch... It doesn't matter if you were the best of friends... That you had such an amazing bond. For now, you need to move past that. For what ever reason, that is now over, not forever, but for now at least.

So for the sake of yourself, stop talking to them, you need to cut contact and move on.

I know that isn't easy... That you love them dearly, care for them... That you want it to be like it was... Hell, writing this past paragraph has bought a tear to my eye and its been over a week since I last shed a tear...

Cutting contact is for the best. Finding yourself again and being independent is fantastic.

Just wanted to throw that out there...

First of all let me readdress how sad it is that I won't be able to reddit for quite some time. 
Second, my ex gf [18] just came home and she asked to see me saying she can only see me this saturday or sunday before I leave, having maintained no contact for several months finally broke it to agree to see her because it would be nice. Today she tells me she is too busy today to make time for me. 
Hense how I made this post, fellow redditors I can't really stress this enough. I now know not to hold onto any desperate hope that we might fix things, why? Because she had no time for me. 
In a relationship it is SO important that both sides mutually feel the same way, YOU, yes you deserve someone who wants to be with you. At any point, at any time. You should be able to go over to their house at 3am and be able to wake them up, you should have them wanting to see you across the country if long distance.
The want to see your lover is one of the strongest and most powerful parts of relationships. It's that sense at the back of your head all day that you miss them and want to spend time with them. 
Every healthy relationship needs it, someone who has all of the time in the world to spend with you. 
When your ex can't give you any of their time or make time for you, it's time to move on. I've just realized this today. If they aren't willing to dedicate their time towards you why should you with your time towards them? Stop worrying about whether you can get them to love you again and start worrying about whose going to love you next. 
Love, a fellow redditor.

1366005170.0,24,self.BreakUps,1cdhm2,[18M] Farewell r/BreakUps,27,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cdhm2/18m_farewell_rbreakups/,"I came to this subreddit when I was still with her, but I instinctively knew what was coming. In the coming days and week, I posted here, asking for advice, refusing NC and hoping desperately for some magic salve. 

I occasionally came back to to read a post or two, but I found that if I was in a great mood beforehand, I'd leave gloomy.

I wanted to impart some advice before I leave here (hopefully for good, but if not, you'll see me again at the next breakup). This sub is one of the best places to go when you're in desperate need of advice or help. This is where I went when I needed advice and urgently. But think of it like you would an aspirin. If you have a splitting headache, you should take it for pain relief, but you shouldn't take it constantly to prevent pain, but change your lifestyle or find a less harmful medicine in the longrun (since aspirin will hurt your digestive system a bit). 

When you feel ready, I'd recommend talking to close friends in real life and relying on them, and using this subreddit as a cane, but not a crutch. Everyone heals differently, and you shouldn't be afraid to stay as long as you want. By all means and certainly, you should. But know that, at some point, you need to go, whether it be weeks or months. Remember, by the nature of it, r/BreakUps is going to be pretty gloomy and depressing.

Some other things I've learned: it does get better with time, like everyone says. You will feel better as the days go on. If you don't, you need to gently tell yourself to move on. The pain dulls over time. Eventually, you hit a plateau, where it just lingers dully. There are days when it feels like you're just a week or two out of the break up, but there are also days where you feel freer than ever, ready to embrace your life and its path in all its fullness.

The key is to move on. I found that I couldn't until I had some closure. When I talked with her, and I finally knew what had broken us up (the main out of one of the many, little things that contributed to it), I actually felt at peace. Beforehand, I wanted to constantly talk with her and lie to myself that I was moving on and just trying to be friends. After I had my revelation, I felt rested. I also wanted some time away from her to think and just heal. I can't stress enough how important closure is.

If you had one of those relationships that you felt was perfect in every way (which I did), it's also helpful to sit down and force yourself to think about the negatives, what he/she did that you didn't like. Maybe list them, commit them to memory. Something wasn't meshing, so make note of what was causing it. 

Whatever you do, do not look at porn. It'll only amplify your pain further, since you're trying to fill emptiness with just more void. It'll cause you to miss the person more and linger on the more tender memories, for better or worse. It holds only pain, and I really, really suggest you don't use it to put a bandage over your wound. Treat your wound with dignity and give it the treatment it deserves.

Lastly, in terms of making it hurt less, I really recommend you talk with people and hang out with friends. I spent more time playing a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online RPG) because I had online friends on there who I could talk to, and just being 'around' people helped me feel better. Plus, when I needed to vent and talk about how bad I felt, there were people to listen and to sympathize. If there's one great thing about break ups, it's that everybody's had them. Spending time with irl friends is great too. 

I implore you, cut off your connections with him/her for some time. Slowly delete the saved messages, store your notes and work on living by yourself. I'm on this part now, and it's helpful. I'm also working on some exercise to try and improve my confidence and body. Having little goals like this are great too. Go on a walk in the park or hike a bit. Just sit next to some trees and talk it out. I personally did the last bit. During a free period in school, I drove down to a huge tree somewhat far from the school and just sat there, and talked. Not only did it feel great to act spontaneously, but it was calming to be alone in nature. I really suggest you try finding a peaceful spot, away from the world, and just working things out and relaxing.

As a final bit, don't try to forget everything from the relationship. It means a lot to you. Remember both the good and bad moments, and cherish it, but hold it as a photograph. It's a memory, and treat it as such. You will make plenty of new memories, and you will look back on this fondly, but you'll be glad to be where you are in life.

Take the love that you had and love yourself. Treat yourself to some long warm baths or a nice iced coffee. Sleep in a bit, cry when you need to and spend time with friends. Not going to lie, this all fucking sucks, and it's the worst thing ever, but if we're going to be here, let's make the most of it, because I promise you, you will climb out of this valley into a lush field with mighty mountaintops, and you will be for the better because of all your experiences.

It wasn't until I saw a counselor that I realized it was an unhealthy relationship, although I honestly did nothing wrong or unreasonable. I felt, ""what did I do to deserve this?""

I started taking anti-depressants a few days ago. I'm on a ""urgent"" wait list for a psychiatrist (Canadian health care...).

Last night, perhaps from the initial side effects of the anti-depressants, on top of some situational factors related to my ex, my best friend, and school, I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal. I called a hotline for the first time. They interviewed me and transferred me to different hotlines. They sent people over and offered to take me to the hospital.

I thought those crisis lines were supposed to help, but they only made me feel weaker and I lost hope in confiding in anyone after they left. I cried myself to sleep and woke up a few hours later with heartache.

I broke No Contact and wanted to have a phone call with my ex for closure. I was ignored. I called him. I called his sister. Everything was ignored.

1357057512.0,23,self.BreakUps,15rwre,How to cope: Turning yourself off emotionally,27,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/15rwre/how_to_cope_turning_yourself_off_emotionally/,"Hey guys,

I wasn't going to post this, just add it to my journal; but I did find inspiration here in the past and thought I might share it in case it helps someone.

I wanted to discuss a coping mechanism with you and see what your thoughts are. I'm still not sure it's the ideal way of doing things but it is effective. The impact on my sense of humanity and empathy is hard to measure though....


**General idea**:

I've found that I can turn myself off emotionally, and I'm fairly certain everyone else can (otherwise we'd all be crying and vomiting at 6pm news everynight). You can pretty much notice the difference in the eyes, like something is missing. You stare at people like they're objects and analyze relationships and everything more logically and objectively. This method is also very closely related to improving yourself, which many people here recommend in order to keep busy and move on. When I'm turned off emotionally, I find it easier to focus on challenging tasks and learning things. I'm going to set up a concrete guideline to help prove my point by drawing on my own experience with my former lover.


                                            
events:                (1.a) meet (1.b) sex (2) tells me he's in love 

feelings twd him:   (1.a) friends    (1.b) fwb  (2) love

feelings twd ppl:     (1.a+b) uninvested, transactional    (2) kinder, empathetic


(1) **The ""off"" phase**:

So basically, I've noticed that before he told me he was in love, I was more self-centered, aka, invested a lot of time in improving myself. In fact, now that we're broken up, the things that give me the most consolation is thinking about the awesome new job I'm going to start and all the things I'm going to learn, experience, etc. When I think of these things, I'm immediately emotionally removed. But the analysis is almost inhumane; before phase 2, I would see people as toys to test out psychological principles. I was like a walking, talking Dale Carnegie. I would learn languages to test these principles out cross-culturally, etc. I was also less affectionate towards my friends and family, and didn't necessarily appreciate them as much as I do when I'm in love. I keep a detailed diary and chronicle my life and analyse what I do wrong and how to improve. I also put sex in the timeline to stress how love and sex are really completely different.

(2) **The ""emotionally on"" phase, aka love**:

And bam! Shit changes. I see people more as human beings, I'm kinder, more affectionate, more self-sacrificing, less analytical and more ""feelingy"". My learning direction changes too. It is less driven by my own initiative and starts to conform to others and to him in particular. I take up his interests and learn them better. I have an unmistakable glow. And to emphasize what an on/off switch this really is, we stayed friends and I didn't have any of these feelings until he told me he was in love the day before I left the country. And that was it, there was no turning back. I was laughing and calling him sappy, but inside things had changed. One second I was happy to put an end to the relationship, accepting that it was a great experience and that all good things had to end. The next second I'm attached to something more eternal, less physical, less dependent on time and place, something that weighs you down and lifts your spirits at the same time. I'm no longer just me, I have this other person with me all the time, in my thoughts, dreams, and hopes.


**Principles**:

- Give yourself some time to cry and then turn yourself off emotionally. This is the best way to move on in my opinion. I realise I end up colder towards other people, and yes, I'm more numb. But I'm also more analytical and I get to revel in that side of me again. I'm back to being me.

- You cannot rush into a new relationship: This requires that you turn yourself on emotionally, and inevitably, your emotions for the other person will turn up. I don't think it is fair for the new person you are dating, and I don't think it's fair to yourself.

- You can have sex with other people, but don't think for one second that this will help you move on. You can have sex while emotionally turned off.

- Enjoy your off-time by rediscovering yourself and your interests and realigning yourself to make sure you're heading in the right direction.

- Seeing the person again: I know everyone is a proponent of the no contact rule, but I think it's fine to stay friends as long as you keep yourself emotionally turned off. Your former lover will notice the difference and might be hurt by it, but they fell in love with your initial turned-off persona anyway. It's what brought you guys together in the first place that can make for an awesome relationship. They will wonder where the look in your eyes went, but they have to know you can't give it to them.

- How to practice turning yourself off emotionally: Once again, I think the best practice isn't to break contact. It's like this. Say you're on a diet, you can get rid of all the bad food in the cabinet or you can teach yourself self-discipline by emotionally removing yourself from food. Which is the better way? Which is the way that actually fixes your relationship with food? The second obviously. Try taking his old sweater or her old shampoo bottle and stop seeing it as his or hers, and as a sweater. Stare at it until all you see is an old sweater.


**Reservations about the method**: 

- Evolving beyond your ""me"": I don't necessarily think being ""me"" is as important as individualistic societies might have you believe. I think it's important to have a sense of self, but I also realize that letting others bend and shape me makes me a better human being. I lose this when I'm ""off"" and ideally you would be able to maintain the balance between you ""me"" and your ""other"" during your relationships rather than having to rediscover yourself during cycles of breakups. It's a difficult balance to maintain in shorter relationships though because the beginning of a relationship always has a learning curve. It's like learning to drive. At first you need both hands, but slowly you feel more comfortable taking a hand off to eat, drink coffee, change the radio station, etc. 

- Meeting someone new: I also find it very difficult to get into new relationships this way. Surely someone might fall in love with your turned-off persona and break your wall, but people don't necessarily want to deal with that kind of hurdle. I'm okay with this given that I want to focus on other things right now, and I'm young, but this might be a problematic coping mechanism for someone who prioritises loving relationships in their life.

- Too cold? Finally, I do feel like I'm emotionally scarring myself. Yknow, if it don't kill you, it only makes you stronger. But what I'm thickening here is my sense of empathy and ability to love, and I feel like I might get too cold/insensitive proceeding this way. It's kind of scary. I think a potential way to counter this is to volunteer to a cause or charity, so I might consider this.

**In conclusion**:

This is maybe just a long-winded way of saying invest in yourself and give yourself time, but keep your heart open, but those sayings were always so abstract to me. Laying it out like this helped me grasp the way to move on and what pitfalls I should be careful about.

She was the first person I had sex with and the only girl I have ever felt incredibly close to. She left for college and I stayed home to go to community. I've been pretty good the past two months that we've been broken up about being nice to her when she texts me and making the conversations short but the one thing I can't escape are the thoughts of her with other guys and the little things. Her laying on my arm on the drive home, cuddling on the couch, I miss it all so much. I was holding on to the idea that she missed me too, until today. I checked her facebook and she's been partying every night and has pictures with multiple guys. She is also wearing sluttier and sluttier outfits. I guess she's not mine anymore...

Most of the time, when you dump somebody, and they sink into post-breakup depression, there's a little bit of comfort in knowing they're not over you, and if you fuck up completely on your own, at least maybe they'll take you back.

I was thinking about it tonight, and I realized that the easiest way to get even with your ex is to move on. You don't have to rebound, or start sleeping around, but just show them you can be happy without them and you won't stoop to being plan B. They might even panic and try and take you back and you'll get to say no to their face (and trust me, you want to say no here).

1) Get all of the pain and anguish out of your mind and body. For me, that meant writing-- a lot. I wrote pages and pages of things to myself and also what I would like to say to my GF on my computer. And I left it all there and just re-read it, re-wrote it, and got out a lot of the hurt onto my computer. Most important: Don't send anything you write, just keep it to yourself.

2) No contact. It goes without saying, but there is no point in contacting someone that dumped you. If they want to get back together, they have to be the one that makes the effort.

3) Get rid of everything. All of the pictures, texts, gifts, etc... I managed to do that around day 5 and you just have to clear your mind and 'blank out' while you just hit the delete button over and over. Another big thing for me was washing my sheets and vacuuming my house. I had long blonde hairs everywhere that ceaselessly reminded me and my sheets still smelled like her. Anything that could remind you of your ex needs to go. If you still hold onto hope that you'll get back together, trust me, this stuff isn't that important and you can take new pictures.

4) Work out. I highly recommend taking a group class of some sort so that you're out with other people. Preferably take one with hot guys/girls that give you something to look at, and you also get a release of endorphins to help your body get a little bit of a high. It's also nice to just completely focus on something for an hour that takes your mind away from your pain. I'm male, so I ended up taking yoga because nothing is better than girls in yoga pants.

5) Talk about your situation with friends and family over the phone. I'm lucky to be close with my brothers, parents, and cousins. A lot of them have been through all sorts of heartbreak, some of them even worse than what you're going through. A lot of them can give you great advice and comfort. I'm super thankful to have an awesome mom who has been through some serious heartbreak, and I never failed to feel better after talking to her. It's great to talk over the phone too because it's not so terrible/embarrassing when you start to cry. This is a great release and highly recommended.

6) Join a dating site. I personally was using Match before I met my ex, and had good results with it. This was the thing that really brought me back to reality and started to make me feel normal and hopeful again tonight. I went on the site and noticed that, yes, there are other good people out there who are looking for love and have been hurt just like you have. There's no reason to waste another day on this earth wishing for something that isn't meant to be. Trust me, I cried and cried lamenting the future that might have been with a girl who I knew I would be happy with for the rest of my life, but there are a LOT of other people out there who would be happy to meet you and share their life with you. I spent plenty of time this week wishing and second-guessing, but at the end of the day you have to believe in your own worth and know that you deserve someone who will give you their whole heart with no reservations. You deserve to be happy, and it's up to you to reach out and find those people out there who will love you and appreciate everything about you.

I was devastated. I would cry constantly, get incredibly angry and take it out on anyone within shouting distance, pushed away all of my friends and family because I was convinced that they couldn't understand how I felt, drank of the point of blacking out almost nightly, picked up the nasty habit of smoking cigarettes because of all the stress.

Over the past 4 months, I've got my drinking under control, kicked the cigarette habit, go to the gym to try and channel some of that anger and other emotions into kicking my ass and getting myself into shape, and spend time with my friends and family who I know have got my back. It's a work in progress.

With regards to my ex, I tried stretches of no contact, some lasting longer than other. The most recent stretch went on for over 3 weeks until last week I found myself talking on the phone with her. We spoke for over 2 hours. 

In those 2 hours, I told her that as much as I'd want to, I can't keep contact with her anymore because it wasn't a healthy thing for me to do. She sounded a little upset that I was trying to cut off all communication with her and not the other way around. She proceded to mock me, saying that I would break and that she would be expecting a call from me within a few days. I told her not to hold her breathe and promptly ended the conversation.

Fast forward to today, I'm walking home from the gym, sweating like a whore in church when who do I see at the bustop at the bottom of my street but my ex. If this was as early as last week, I would've gotten weak in the knees and would've approached her and talked to her or at the very least said hi but not today.

Today, I adjusted my baseball cap, wipe the sweat from my brow, turned the volume up on my iPhone and kept walking without so much as looking at her like if she were some random stranger in the street. 

Today, I feel like a million bucks because I know she saw me and was paying attention how little attention I was paying to her. I know it kills her that I'm sticking to my guns and refuse to so much as even acknowledge her sitting across the street from me. I know it kills her that she was wrong. She could never stand being wrong.

Today, I took an incredible step forward towards getting over her. If she wants nothing to do with me, fine but ultimately it's her loss.

I'm a good man and it's about time I start treating myself as such.

And the latest week i finally had some complete good days. (by going out, meeting friends, talking to friends&amp;family)
But i make myself no illusions there are and will still be very hard days also. But I think from now on therewill be more positive days than sad/lonely depressing ones. And why is that? because I did what i thought i had to do. 

No Contact is important, but i was struggeling with questions. I knew why she broke up, but i didn't know why she behaved the way she does. 

- a couple of days after the breakup we still talked, but suddenly she stopped contact, 
- She had no struggle to not contact me
- she looked like she already was over our relationship
- but she said, if it's possible i really want to be friends again -&gt; needs time, probably lots of time.

The no contact was killing me so one day i just send her a text, asking if we could talk over telephone. She agreed.

I learned the bitter truth: She was already over me or trying to move on when she broke up.
i asked her if she missed me even a little bit and her response was no. I don't really miss you and don't often think about you. Dead honest.
She really wanted to move on and i was the one holding her so thats why she needed distance and very less contact.

I already knew there was another guy who is in love with her, but she doesn't know what she feels, She said she felt good with him, but she has trouble really feeling comfortable.
She wants something else, i know i wasn't the best for her (but i'm working on bettering myself, not for her but for me)
She is lokking how she feels by hanging around with him, texting him and thinking about him. and that's why she behave like she does. She doesn't miss or think about me because there is someone else filling that spot.

The situation is hard to discribe but i understand her very much. Our relationship wasn't healthy anymore and most because of me. I really am happy she takes her time to better know the guy before starting a new relationship. she tries to not make this a rebound.

Still even before our relationship we were best friends, and in the future i really hope that can come back. helping each other with problems and stuff! but it will take time, time heals!

It will be hard to be able to accept she could ending up with someone else, having the intimate moments we had together with that someone else, but yeah by talking to her i feel i'm ready to move on. the moment she will show up with someone else will be hard but i think i will be able to handle it. i hope so :)",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1i9zpy,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i9zpy/nocontact_is_important_but_i_needed_answers_too/,

Part of the reason why being dumped was so difficult was because I thought I we were going to get married, and so did you. I thought you were ""the one"", and I'd never have to date again. We were going to have 2 kids and 2 dogs, a nice house in SoCal with a fenced in yard, and the careers of our dreams. What made you decide that I wasn't good enough for you? I'll never know, but what I do know is this: the man who I thought I was going to marry is not the man I know you to be now. You showed me a whole different side to yourself. The lying, foolish, naive, put-your-dick-on-craigslist-two-days-after-we-broke-up side of you. If I married you, I would be marrying that side of you too. 

So, you know what? Being a complete cock and dumping me in the most painful and drawn-out method possible was the best thing that's happened to me in recent memory. I may miss you a little, but what I realized is that that's not *you* that I miss. I miss who I thought you were. And now, instead of missing you like crazy and pining over you every waking second, I hate your guts and want to knock out your teeth with a golf club. It hurts realizing that I wasted a year and a half of my life dating a complete fuckhead and that I was wrong about you, but I needed to learn this lesson.

You made me realize that I have settled for less in every single relationship I have ever been in. Now, I have the chance to get to know myself again and learn to accept only what I deserve. You, on the other hand, have to tend to your new girl and don't get the growing opportunity that I have. That's enough revenge for me. I am a strong woman, and I'm above laying in bed crying over some pathetic guy. Especially if that pathetic guy is you.

When I'm ready to find the *actual* man of my dreams, I know I will be the best person that I can be. I have some growing to do too, and after all of this time I feel like I need to get to know my awesome self again. When I was with you, I wasn't the best version of myself. Now I have the chance to find her, and I'm already on my way there. You used to be my best friend, but now my best friend is ME. And we get closer and closer every day. In my eyes, you will always be that douchelord that turned my world upside down in the worst possible way at the worst possible time, and that's ok. I don't love you anymore, I'm glad that I can see you for who you truly are, and I'm putting you behind me forever. I'm moving on to bigger, better things, and if you never dumped me I just might have been stuck with you. Thanks for showing me that I deserve more.

Have a nice life, asshole. I know I will.

I wanted to tell you that it gets better. I am 2.5 months into the healing process of a breakup after a 2 year relationship. I've done the tears, I've done the hurt and not understanding, I've done the denial. And now I'm here.

I'm okay.

Let me give you a background. 24F, moved to a new city 2 years ago, fell in love with someone almost instantly. They became my world. Seriously, my world was so interwoven with theirs, I didn't have my own life, just an extension of theirs.

I had a 2 month project come up overseas. He breaks up with me a week before I go. Cue 6 weeks of crying everyday. Not understanding. Disappointment. Rejection. Misunderstandings between he and I. 

I initiate no contact. Break it every 2 weeks or so. Hide from social media. And then it's like a switch flips.

Now i'm here. Back from a rejuvenating 2 week vacation with a best friend. Tanned, happy, at peace. No but seriously. And in a few days i Head back to our mutual city.

It does get better.

Your ex is just a person. They aren't the right person for you right now, and they don't deserve you right now (if they are hurting you).
But guess what? They are still great in their own way, and you had the awesome experience of getting to know them. 
They probably taught you things you didn't even know you needed to learn, and the breakup will teach you something more. Be thankful that you met them, but remember, you walk your path alone. You will still be walking it even without them.

It's okay if you didn't always handle yourself with dignity in the process (it IS a process) and you can't be judged by what you did yesterday, or last week or last month. Only how you take on today.

I'm taking on today with a smile on my face, and love in my heart, for the person he was to me and the memories we made. I will hold them dear to me, but I won't wallow in them.

I'm telling you that you can feel this way too. Turn the situation around. It does get better. They all say it, but it is true.

We broke up in May of last year. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to go through. It destroyed my soul but at the same time, I knew it was the right thing for both of us, Especially me. I didn't cry after that last time I spoke to you when we slept together for the last time but I felt numb for weeks. A robot, emotionless, uncaring, selfish and non-functioning. There was nothing. I couldn't smile or laugh, people at work would constantly ask me if I was alright and I'd force a twisted half-smile and shrug it off. All I felt was emptiness

Then the pain started. Everything reminded me of you and being reminded of you caused me a sharp pain in my soul like I've never experienced before. It wasn't sadness or grief, just pain. I was still a robot at this stage.

Then reality hit me one day and I tried contacting you several times over the period of a few months. If you didn't ignore me, you sent back something cold which just caused me more pain. I am sorry for doing this to you. I understand that you didn't want me to talk to you but i felt compelled. I still loved you. At this point I cried a lot. To the outside world everything was fine but at night time I would lock myself in my room and cry. 

Then the pain slowly but surely vanished and was replaced with a burning desire to change. This is the part I can't thank you enough for. I got a promotion at work, I joined the Gym, I started eating healthy and, most importantly I felt happy again. I started hanging out with a girl from work and we'd have a great time together. I had a new lease on life and things were going great

I asked the girl from work if she would be my girlfriend and soon enough, a relationship formed. Then I remembered you. All the memories came back and I realised I couldn't be happy with someone else yet so I broke up with her after only two weeks. She was absolutely devestated and I still remember feeling vulnerable, sad and lonely sitting in my car after just having been called an asshole and having the door slammed in my face. So I texted you again. I wanted to open up to you and feel you comfort me like you used to so I told you what had happened. You responded angrily that you didn't care and told me you didn't want to hear about it. I'm sorry also that I told you I broke up with her because of you. It was unfair to put you in that position. I took myself on a long drive crying my eyes out the whole way.

A few months passed and I'd forgotten about you again. Luckily I managed to keep up all of my positive changes and life was going great again. I met lots of girls and had been enjoying the single life much more than before. I was flatting with my best friend and I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. To top things off, I was back at school again and learning something I love. 

Fast forward to the day before my best friends wedding. I text you. This time we have a mature conversation and I begin to think that we might have a chance of being friends again one day. The problem is, I get too excited and realise that I can never settle for just being friends with you. I'm far to physically attracted to you. Now all I can think about is having sex with you one more time. Our contact ends up fizzling out and I'm left feeling like an idiot for being rejected by you again in your subtle way before I can even ask.

Now, I'm doing absolutely fantastic. My life has transformed completely and I've got so many exciting things going on all thanks to my new lease on life. ________, you breaking up with me is the best thing that has ever happened to me. You put me through an amazing journey and I found myself. I found some old photos of us together by accident that I used to have sitting on my bedside table and desk today and it made me reflect on the amazing times we had together. Our relationship was amazing to me and I've realised that I would have never felt all of the pain I did if the relationship was never wonderful to begin with. I don't know if I will ever send you this letter but it's helped me provide myself with closure to know that finally I can say I will never come back to you, but you will always have a special place in my heart.

Thank you so much for everything Kidface,

Love,

MrGodsgiven

1357704292.0,22,self.BreakUps,16894k,What is love?,27,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16894k/what_is_love/,"Love to me is commitment, joy, laughter, sadness, pain, nostalgia, friendship, devotion, loyalty, the look in their eyes when you know they're one of the closest people you will ever meet in your life.

I suppose the fact a relationship ends means that one or both people in the relationship cannot endure or work through the problems that naturally arise when you become this intimate with someone. 

Happiness without sadness is empty. Pain without pleasure is the same. They're two sides to the same coin and at the end of the day I want to be with someone I know who will be there for me, in the good times and bad.

Like anything good in life, it requires work. The gradual peregrination towards perfection (lofty ideals I know) takes time and isn't without its setbacks.

I know in my heart that things happen for a reason and that if it's meant to be then things will work out eventually.

The heartache from a breakup will eventually heal, but the scar remains and I hope everyone will be able to remember the fond memories that it denotes. Because the pain you feel now is a reflection of the joy you experienced with your partner. 

Stay strong guys and gals.

1355917347.0,20,self.BreakUps,153s6h,Read this and listen to me because I just had an epiphany.  Sorry for the swearing.,24,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/153s6h/read_this_and_listen_to_me_because_i_just_had_an/,"**~A little back story~**

We met during our first days in university and it didn't take long for us to hit it off, and eventually get together.  We fell in love and we were each other's first.  We waited to make sure.  **It was perfect.**  Since we were both living away from home eventually we moved in together along with a few friends.  Ya... it was a big deal.    

We made it a couple months past 2 years together.  Obviously, I was devastated.  My entire world crumbled before my eyes.  She just didn't *feel* it anymore.  But a glimmer of hope, *she wants to be friends*.  

**~2.5 months later~**

Keeping in contact was a **fucking mistake**.  I thought I could do it.  I *wanted* to do it.  I **needed** to do it.  **It all went to shit**.  Listen to me, I've been there.  It doesn't work.  When you're emotional you don't think straight.  I was also very stressed out from exams, *but that's life*.

Long story short, I've alienated her.  I've been a different person, **and she's distancing herself from me for it**.  No contact.  It felt like I had my heart broken *twice*.

The truth?  *She's right*.  **I need to get my shit together**.

It was like the flick of a switch.  Feeling so down, and for so long, it really digs into your consciousness.  And you realize *nobody is perfect*.  Not you, not even **her**.  There is no better time than the present for improvement.  And I'm *21 years old*, I'm not even done university.  **I'm gonna fucking live a little**.  And then I sit down and play video games half naked on my bed *without her* **and fucking enjoy it**, then make a post on reddit about how *damn* good I feel for once.  **Damn good**.

I realized all the things I wanted to fix about myself for her, *should have been for myself*.

If you are wondering, yes **I still love her**.  I am thoroughly convinced I always will.  Does this bother me?  **NO**!  Love is a strange emotion, and life is a strange experience.  **It isn't fair for either of you if you idolize her**.  You can't force love.  I am channeling my genuine care for her into *friendship*.  I want nothing more than to see her happy.  Right now, at this stage in our lives, *we need to be single*.  The feelings need to subside and reality needs to set in.  *There will be love for me*, from someone else.  Then *maybe* we can work out a friendship.  **And we can enjoy an amazing single life alongside each other**.  Why am I moping around?  **I've got the best years of my life ahead of me**.

I'm not out of the woods yet.  This post is a **warning**.  As I said, I kinda... fucked it all up.  I've shown her a side of me that wasn't me at all.  *I was weak*.  And I forgot that **she is hurting about the breakup too**.  It's not all fun and games when you have to break someone's heart.  For the sake of her, and for the sake of yourself, **be strong**.

My only hope is that I can improve myself to who I want to be.  A person she will *enjoy* being around.  She may not *love* me, but **she still genuinely cares about my happiness**.

I've sent her my farewell message.  I've told her I need to get over her, **and I will**, I've apologized for my behavior *and the stress I caused both of us*.  My only hope is that, *months from now*, **when all the wounds have healed**, she will accept me for what I am.  Someone that just wants to experience life with her, **whatever that holds**.

**And if it doesn't work out, it was never meant to be at all.  That's just life.  Live it.**

Thanks for everything.,29,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/12njbn/its_my_time_to_go_breakups_thanks_for_everything/,"Eight months. It's been eight months and I still find myself checking r/breakups almost daily. I do it more out of habit than need at this point. Helping other people and giving them the best advice I could really helped me through a rough couple of months. In order to keep doing that, however, I had to dip back into the past. I had to drink from the well of my own suffering over and over, and to do my best at keeping myself sane while doing so. It isn't healthy though, I can't do it anymore. I realized today that it's time for me to do my final purge of this breakup. I need to get rid of the last part of the cancerous mass that has been holding on inside me, hurting me needlessly. I can't keep coming back here. 

During the days and nights I don't think about her at all. I don't have any hopes to see her again and I honestly don't want to. I no longer think of ways I can make her jealous or other means of petty revenge. She appears in my dreams sometimes, but only as a minor role, she is no longer the antagonist. My hostility went from a roaring bonfire to a few last smoldering embers. I don't endlessly replay scenarios that won't ever happen in my head at all times. I don't want to beat the shit out of this new guy anymore, nor do I want to publicly shame her. I don't want her to contract some unknown African virus and die painfully and alone. She isn't 'good' or 'bad', she is simply dead to me. Gone, never to return.

I've said all I could have ever wanted to say, done everything I could have possibly done. All of the people I've talked to, even some of her good friends, know what she is, and so do I. Her tarnished if not blackened reputation is the best I could ask for, and I am completely satisfied with it. Nay-Sayers and shit-talkers are luckily people I couldn't give a fuck about, they consist of mainly failures and children in adult bodies. My conscience is clear. 

I am able to distinguish my real ex from the dream girl I made her into in my mind. Even though I still think about the dream girl, I remind myself that she wasn't ever really there and carry on with my day. I haven't looked at any of her social media pages in quite a while, not sure how long but I stopped counting. I don't get riled up about it anymore. My friends sometimes bring it up and make fun of how pathetic I was, I can't help but laugh too. I've had some 'casual encounters' and am currently speaking to the 3rd girl I've seen since my ex. I've learned to have little to no expectations, but I can't help but stay hopeful. I am nearly fully restored to my former self, my pain is never present. It can still hurt if I let my mind drift, though.

My mind drifts when I come here. I begin poring over these posts and I remember with sparkling clarity the words that were said, the actions, the searing pain of the emotional knife stabbing me in the back. All of the events of the darkest period of my life leave the dusty box in my mind I placed them and start flashing before my eyes. Sometimes when I am writing a response I stop and turn catatonic, paralyzed by re-living the pain over and over. My throat closes and tears make their way out of my eyes. That old feeling of being punched in the stomach says hello once more. Sometimes I think about it all night and into the next day. I'm so done with that though, my apologies to any I promised to respond to and left hanging.

My final advice to them and to any other readers is to keep going, don't give up. Quitters never win and winners never quit. Even if you don't believe it, tell yourself that you will make it and that no matter how weak you are now you can and WILL be strong. Read all of my posts and turn them into your inner mantra like I did. If you are feeling good and think you are over it, don't have a moment of weakness. Don't think that just a quick peek at their facebook or sending a friendly message to them will do anything but fan the flames of your dying pain. Even if you think it won't, it most certainly will. It's a mistake a made far too many times, it always set me back.

Well, this is it guys, I am finally doing what I've been telling myself to do for almost 2 months now. Once I make this post, I will never come back. I am leaving my pain in the past where it belongs, try to start doing it too. **This is only as hard as you make it. Stay focused and intent on getting better, it will happen in time. I hope soon that many of you will make a post like this. After, you can strive freely into the future, taking only the fond memories of your ex and the harsh lessons learned with you. You will be a better and stronger person because of all of this pain, you'll earn that.

I refer to it anytime I get that sad little feeling like something really wonderful was lost...don't be a victim of selective memory. 

Reasons **NOT** to love (my ex)

* She's selfish, she puts herself and her feelings first.
* She needs to be liked and adored, the center of attention.
* She's not happy with herself.
* She's quick to get anger or upset, then begrudging and unforgiving afterward.
* She's bossy, It's her way or the highway.
* She'll Whine about mundane things, nothing is just okay.
* She's petty, always keeping score. (yes, I realize the hyprocrisy)
* She can be extremely catty, speaks harshly of others when they're not around.
* She's sloppy and unpredictable when drunk. She projects her anger and insecurity over previous D-bag boyfriend on to me.
* She's introverted, doesn't socialize well, a perpetual homebody.
* I don't ever remember her apologizing, not once. 
* That's probably because she always thinks she's right.
* She absolutely cannot take criticism, AT ALL.
* She argues irrationally, without presenting any evidence and then when I press her, she can't stay focused.
* She's indecisive about trivial things like what to wear or what movie to watch, but jumps into big decisions like inviting her mom on vacation with us.
* She is perpetually stressed out, She worries about everything, like every-fucking-thing.
* She doesn't particularly like anything that I do in terms music/movies /sports and hardly feigns interest.
* She doesn't appreciate me for me and was always trying to change me.
* She's obsessed with looks/weight to a crippling degree.
* Refuses to deal with heavy emotional baggage from brothers suicide. (I realize this one is heavy, but it became a relationship burden)
* She has an immature and dependent relationship with parents, in which she allows them total access.
* She's unrealistic and unclear about her expectations in relationships.
* She's a poor communicator, She let's all of her anger and emotion well up until it's all feeling and little content.
* She lacks romantic passion and intimacy skills.
* She had a tendency to be jealous, needy and clingy
* Worst of all she separated our dogs and DESTROYED the comfort of my home after 2 years at the drop of a hat and with little explanation and no more than a half-hearted apology.

So Pretty much she's a huge bitch. Why did you ever fall for her? Remember when she was psycho about dating you in those first few months? Red flags dude, heed them. She's unstable and you're muuuuuuch better off without her.

Remember, you don't miss her. You just miss the companionship. There will be new companions, and it won't take much for them to be a vast improvement.

A success story for all you lonely hearts out there.,26,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/w1ymw/relearning_to_love_myself_a_success_story_for_all/,"It's been roughly three months since the news came out about my ex's affair. It's been two months since I told her to get the hell out of my life and never come back.

In those two months, I did a serious re-evaluation of myself and my life. What was I doing, who was I doing it for, and why was I still doing it.

I realized that as much of an ""awesome person"" as I knew I was, I was still validating myself with the existence of a significant other. It was shitty, but true. And upon making the realization that me and my ex rushed in for all the wrong reasons, it became a little more clear that I was only with her as a crutch. The ex before her had fucked me up REALLY bad. Three years and an amicable split? Sure. That's a nice way to end it. But I was alone again and I couldn't function properly.

So I simply went for the low hanging fruit. She wasn't the best looking thing in the world, she went out of her way to approach me, and I was just worn down from looking for myself. So I said yes. A year later, she's off with some other guy. Maybe I had that coming for making a rebound out of her. Regardless, it was over and I was glad it was over, wether I'd admit it or not. 

That point of clarity came and I began functioning again, for myself. What makes me happy? What have I always wanted to do but never done? What the hell was it gonna take to get back to 100%.

So I started back into some old hobbies that made me happy. I reconnected with old friends. Started going out and making new ones. And by the first month's passing, I was no longer begging myself to get out of bed. I was just happy to be alive.

At the point of clarity, I was content. I started talking to another girl. We became fast friends, and decided that while there were some feelings there, were weren't going to make the same mistake again, and we've been taking it nice and slow. If things blossom, things blossom. But she's of a similar mindset to I at this point: ""I'd rather depend on myself than anyone else. I've never let me down if I tried not to."" 

And that's been incredibly valuable. I've started seeing myself looking at goals and achievements in life. Things to really push for for myself. Things that make me happy just by being. The ultimate light at the end of the tunnel was knowing I have to do things because they're what make me feel alive. I'm not sure where I'm going, I'm not sure when I'll get there, but there aren't any more stops on the trip. If someone wants to hop on, that's great, but I won't be making any pitstops to appease them.

Long story short, just because you're single doesn't mean you're worthless. Live life for you, let the people come to you, and most importantly, remember that this is **YOUR** moment. Take it and run with it. The rest comes later.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_w1ymw,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/w1ymw/relearning_to_love_myself_a_success_story_for_all/,

I need your help.,22,0,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/trynq/my_girlfriend_of_4_years_slept_with_another_man_i/,"   My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years and 7 months. Neither of us had ever been in a real relationship before. We were each other's firsts in many ways (yes, including sex). We met in first-year of university and became inseparable. Our houses were a block away from each other once we moved out of university-residence, and I eventually moved into a house with her and we lived in the same room together for two years. We know everything about each other, trust each other, value each other's opinions and sincerely care for each other's happiness and well-being.

---
   About 4 months ago my girlfriend left our university town where we attended school together to study abroad for 5 months in Australia. We talked often over Skype while she was away. This was not the first time we'd be separated over long distances for an extended period, but it was the longest of those periods. I was coping reasonably well - I felt lonely at times, but I had friends and work and school and activities. However, about 2 months in I confronted her over Skype because I had noticed she was becoming slightly more distant. Little things like she rarely - if ever - being the one to make the Skype call if we were both online, and just being a little less available to talk. I asked her what the problem was, and she told me that (even before she had left) she was having these *feelings*. Basically, with 4.5 years under our belts, 3 of which we spent in the same house, 2 in the same room, marriage was a very real possibility. She told me that she loved me, but that she had this nagging doubt, that what if we had only got together out of convenience or something; maybe we weren't perfect for each other. She told me that if I asked her to marry me, she couldn't say yes, because she thought she'd have this gnawing doubt forever. She told me she wanted to take a break for a few weeks - ostensibly to prove to herself that she was wrong and that we had something special. She wanted me to come visit her in Australia - as we had planned - and travel around together, despite the fact that the ""break"" would be on-going up until I arrived on her doorstep.

---
   I told her I couldn't do a break. If she needed to do this, then it needed to be a break-up, because I couldn't possibly feel at all emotionally available to other women if I felt like we were still together in any way. So we broke up with the plan being to check in with each other in two weeks. (The only distinction between a ""break"" and a ""break-up"" was a psychological barrier for me.)

---
   I went on a few dates, but never kissed anyone; just polite, friendly conversation. I didn't really give off any vibes of romantic interest I suppose. Then, I found out last night, from her (because I asked and she's incapable of lying to me) that within a week of our official break-up, she had slept with another man. Apparently she had been getting close to this guy for a month or two, and they were attracted to each other, but didn't do anything until we broke-up officially. When she told me (over Skype) that she had slept with him, it felt like my brain was in a vice. I was dizzy and full of rage. When I calmed down, we talked for a while, and she now wants to get back together. She says she realized what an idiot she was for ever breaking up with me, and that she now understands how amazing our relationship was. I told her that while I'll always love her, I'm not sure I can be in-love with her after that. Despite the fact that we were broken up, I feel utterly betrayed. She wants me to fly to Australia, where she still has academic obligations for a little while longer, so we can be together for the month she has left, and to do some travel there together.

I'm 24m and she's 23. We were together for 3 years. We did plan to get married. I hadn't proposed, but I was having a custom ring made to propose. Good thing this came out early and saved me $10K on the ring and howevermuch on the wedding, I guess.

Two weeks ago she went out drinking with friends on a Friday night and ended up sleeping with some guy she met at the bar. She told me about it once she saw me and I dumped her on the spot. 

Fortunately my name was the only one on the lease and I could afford rent by myself, so she moved out immediately.
Obviously I was - and still am - taking the breakup hard, but I knew it was for the best. Then, the next thing I know all my friends and family are mad at me. She went around telling everyone that the guy she slept with raped her, and they decided I'm a bad person for dumping her for getting raped.

I can't talk sense into any of them. We ran in the same social circles pretty much and she was really close to my family, so I'm getting pissed on by everyone. What am I supposed to do? Is just letting it blow over best?

When people are in love they tend to overlook the negative things about the other person. It's hard to get over someone when you think they are perfect. Truth is, no matter what you think, they are not perfect. A good way to convince yourself of this fact is to make a list. List all the things you don't like about ex. Be brutally honest and don't leave out things that are petty or shallow. You'll be surprised how long the list can get. Now whenever you start feeling the pain of loss, refer back to the list. Remind yourself that it's not the end of the world that they are gone.

I've been through worse. Almost exactly two years ago now my wife of 5 years ran off to another state leaving me with our son. Obviously that was very painful. She treated me badly in many ways though, so maybe it was for the best.  
  
This breakup is the second worst I've been through, and I've been cheated on before in my late teens. We met in January 2011 and clicked so well. Intellectually we were just about perfectly compatible which is rare for me. The passion was there…in spades. We could simply lay together holding each other blissfully. She was great with my son and I looked forward to her possibly being a step-mom one day.  
  
But alas, the real world has come between us and she broke up with me over dinner last Wednesday. I'm devastated and have barely eaten or gotten out of bed since (it's now the following Sunday). I have no easy way to dismiss her as bitchy or backstabbing or any of that, because she isn't any of that - just a beautiful person who's no longer mine. This cruel world has come between us and our lives just don't intersect. Gradually we started spending fewer and fewer weekends together, because she had been feeling this way for some time now, holding it in. My plan for Wednesday's dinner had been to talk to her about how we need to start taking some more proactive effort to get our schedules to click together. Well I didn't get to have that talk because she broke up with me first.  
  
To be a bit more specific, one major reason for the breakup is she's 35, not getting any younger, and she wants a baby of her own. I just don't know if that's something I want. It's not that I don't want one, I'm just not sure at this time, not ready to say ""yes"" to that, and I don't know when I will be. My situation with my son makes life complicated already...  
  
Another reason which is hard to explain if you don't know me, is I'm the world's worst procrastinator. I don't take life by the reins and move forward, I have a lot of anxiety about change…and she put up with this for a while but couldn't take it anymore. She wanted a life with me, but I didn't know how to make it happen. I've been going to a therapist since my wife left, and I called her the other day - she agreed to help me focus on conquering this major problem of mine. It's something I really want to face, for me, for my son, for any future women who are even half as good as this one.  

Maybe there's even still a small chance I can win her back…I know to be realistic though and not expect anything. We still talk and let each other know how much we adore each other. Right now we're trying to figure out if we're still going to try to be friends or what. I know that rarely works but who knows. For now I'll just say RIP D &amp; N - such a hard one to let go…",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_ro1mh,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ro1mh/yet_another_broken_heart/,

Please share more advice.,25,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/il3ay/breakup_advice_please_share_more_advice/,"As most of you know, breaking up with someone sucks.  I'm going through a break-up myself right now (I'm 26m she's 23f).  It's not the first by far, but it sure feels like it.  I've been staying up the past few nights reading posts from others who are currently in my shoes.  I'm finding that the advice most people give stays relatively consistant across the board and thought I'd share the commonalities.

I think what it boils down to is that maybe instead of focusing on what to do about the other person, maybe we should focus on what to do with ourselves, which I feel is the hardest thing to do.  Essentially it is a matter of changing the things we can control versus the things we can't.

Here's what I've found:

**Knowing When It's Over**

This is probably the single most important thing about breaking-up.  In a nutshell, it takes two people to be in a relationship.  If one person is adamant about wanting out, there is not much the other can do about it.  Trying to hang on to something that is clearly broken (from either perspective) will only prolong the pain and emotional weight of the break-up.  Most of the time severing all ties and communication is the best way to go.  This means phone, email, social networks, everything.  The first few days, weeks, or months will hurt, but it *will* get better in time.  Having a keen focus on other things will ease separation anxiety, which brings me to my next point.

**Self-Improvement**

Reading post after post, I realize that this is one of the biggest factors in becoming better.  I think most people will agree.  I don't think you will feel like doing this instantly; I don't right now, but the sooner the better, really.  Fellow redditors constantly say, ""Hit the gym!"", but it's for a good reason.  Not only are you doing this for your own benefit, but it also works to put your focus on something else, relieving stress.  Endorphin levels are also elevated when you work out (they are chemicals in your brain responsible for making you feel good).  Also, focus on work, school, or whatever will keep you busy.  Right now for me, it's writing.  Writing this helps keep my mind occupied and reading it will hopefully help someone else as well.  Additionally, if you had a particularly bad break-up, you know what they say: Success is the best revenge.  Just something to think about.

**Memories, Photos, and Songs**

Depending on how long the relationship lasted, you may want to get rid of all the things that remind you of the relationship, unless you are a person that has absolute control over your emotions (but perhaps if you were, you wouldn't need to visit /r/BreakUps?).  These usually only work in hindering your focus as well as capturing simply the good times.  You wouldn't take a picture of yourselves fighting, would you?  Additionally, drowning yourself in sappy songs, or songs that remind you of the person might feel good, but they only work to facilitate negative feelings (which is what you want to get rid of ASAP!).  

**Facebook, Twitter, and More**

Again, depending on the severity of the break-up, simply blocking that person from posting on Facebook/Twitter/Google+, etc. could work to your advantage.  Some people have to resort to deleting Facebook or other social networks entirely to help them forget.  

The point is: You don't want to see what this person is up to.  Which is what social media was designed to do; connect you to people.  If they are dating someone else, going to parties, kissing someone in their new profile picture, or even just hanging out, seeing this **will probably hurt you** and sometimes make you do irrational things (like initiate contact...or cry.)  

**Going Out**

Even though you probably don't feel like it, force yourself to go out with friends or other places.  This helps to occupy your mind and be around people (or even meet new people!).  The only thing about this is, you don't want to go out if it's going to be detrimental to your emotional well-being.  Go out to have a good time, not to be miserable.  Drinking is usually okay...but getting smash drunk because you're depressed is probably not.  (Alcohol is a depressant.)

**Self-worth**

In the end, you have to know that given time, everything will be okay.  While it's very cliche to say, time really does heal most wounds.  Remember that you are important and being happy and comfortable with yourself is the key to being able to get back on the relationship saddle and moving on to bigger and better things.  Be confident.  Don't wish, hope, and wait -- start doing.

1371593071.0,20,self.BreakUps,1gm4i4,7 months after the break up. Some tips...,23,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gm4i4/7_months_after_the_break_up_some_tips/,"Okay, so a year ago in March I met someone on a dating site. He lived an hour and a half away but we saw each other on the weekends. For some reason, I had the most fun with him I've ever had with any of my other boyfriend's. He also wasn't very annoying, haha. He wasn't jealous or possessive. Like if you knew him, you would say he was the right person for me. 

He broke up with me after a silly fight I started, saying he needed to get his life together. Which was very very true. He had quit his job in July without finding a new one. It put a lot of stress of him and us at times. He started to get very depressed and some days I would get depressed too. Not a good thing! One week, the week before he broke up with me, he was so happy for some reason. It gave me hope. But then the next weekend we broke up.

I was so goddamn crushed. I cried and cried. I didn't get out of bed. I didn't have a job at the time, but would be starting one the next month, so all I did was cry,browse on here and complain, and lost a lot of weight from hardly eating. 2 weeks after we broke up, I went on the dating site we met on and looked at our past messages we sent each other..basically torturing myself. It showed that he rejoined too. I was so upset, and went crazy on him. He said he wasn't on there to date...which I do believe him. He deleted his profile and I even looked for him under different user names and didn't find him, so he was telling the truth. I know, crazy psycho ex mode, right?! 

But after I cussed him out, I knew that we couldn't be friends. I had proposed  a fwb's positon with him before, but he denied it saying it wasn't fair to me. Just so you know, if your ex's agree to this, that means they don't respect you. Especially if they know you care and love them more then they do you. My ex said no because he respected me and didn't want to mess with my feeling. I told him we couldn't be talking anymore, and he agreed. I broke NC once, and it was a bitch. I'd suggest, if you really feel the urge to, do it, but it will not turn out the way you want it to. It will make you realize the relationship really is over. If you got dumped, it will make you realize that this person really doesn't want you back. 

So the first month was horrible. I talked to no one. Didn't flirt. Cried. Eventually I started my new job, so a little income was good. But I felt money was worthless, because usually I spent money to go see him. So money, can't really make you happy. 

In February, something was going on with my heart. I went to the hospital, and then was sent to a cardiologist, who gave me a heart monitor for a day. I was stressing myself out way too much over this guy that it started to affect my heart. The cardiologist said it was related to stress and for me to go see a counselor and get on antidepressants. I opted not to. I told myself if I wasn't happy by June, then I would go get help. But at that point, it was only 3 months after the break up. 

In March, I had saved up all my money and traveled down to Florida alone to skydive...My ex had introduced me to skydiving. Sometimes I think he came into my life just so I could get into it, but honestly, I think he came into my life to show how it was to be treated great. 

In April, I had been casually seeing someone since February. Things were really awkward and because of my ex, I felt scared to open up to this new guy. I did like him, but I still liked my ex. 

In May, that guy went on vacation for the month and when he came back he dumped me. I only cried once over him, but it didn't hurt as much as it did when my ex dumped me. I realized that I protected my feelings way more and it helped me in the end. 

This month...I've been doing what I love. I've been skydiving every weekend. Facing the fear of death is what gets my mind off all my other problems. Seems totally weird, but it's easier to deal with at times.

Here are some of my jumps, if anyone is interested. It's truly changed my life and I think it's REALLY important to have a hobby where you are around people. Even if you are shy. I'm shy as hell, but have been learning to go up and start conversations with people. People are nicer then you think. :) 
http://www.youtube.com/user/forgetseptember/videos

 Am I over my ex? Possibly. I'd say, this month so far I have only cried over him once. Compared to every single day, 10 times a day, it's an improvement. 

For those out there who are hurt right now and upset, realize that a long different exciting road is ahead of you. It can only go up from here, if you allow it! Keep your head up. Do NC. Don't grieve too long. Eat! Go do something you have never done before!

1370157002.0,21,self.BreakUps,1ficbc,"Advice from a former poster, over a year down the line.",28,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ficbc/advice_from_a_former_poster_over_a_year_down_the/,"So I used to be fairly active on here. I gave plenty of advice to people going through break ups and it helped me deal with my own problems. I kept posting up to six months after my relationship ended. It felt good realising I was feeling better and letting others know how much better it got day by day. I could relate to most of the other heart-broken people on here.

But now I don't. I don't relate to any of you like I used to. I'm sorry, I wish I did and I wish I could help you all but I can't. I've come so far from the dreadful, pitiful, depressed and often suicidal me of over a year ago. If I were to impart any advice now, it would come across as patronising. ""Time heals all scars! It gets better! You won't even know who you were back then! You won't even care about her anymore!"" 

Nobody wants to hear that. If I'd heard that advice from someone after my break up, I would have dismissed it as being irrelevant to me. ""That guy must have had an easy relationship. He must not have been in love. Their love wasn't this potent. He must have always been this optimistic.""

Trust me, I wasn't. I was so deeply, madly in love. She was the only girl in my life. And the only person that mattered. When she ended it I had no friends, no job, nothing to do. I'd lost everything over the course of the relationship. And then I lost her. I was at the lowest point of my life. I was beyond depressed. I shut myself away in my room for almost two months refusing to eat anything for days on end. My attempts to turn things were thwarted by this severe anxiety that consumed me. I couldn't even enjoy watching TV or reading a book without thoughts of her plaguing my mind.

So this place helped me a lot. I was able to let things out and help others and notice my progress and I slowly got up and changed things. Once things got better and I started eating and exercising and working I still had this sadness about me. She was still on mind. But over time that wore off. A part of me thinks I wish I had the perspective I had today back then, but I'm glad I didn't. Only a robot devoid of feeling or pain could shut those feelings I had off and simply be 'happy'. It was a long road and I'm glad I had to take it. I'm a much better, stronger person now than I ever was or ever thought I could be. I never thought I would be this happy and content with life. It seemed fictional to me.

Look, I guess this isn't practical advice. But I owe it to everyone here to come back and post this.

It truly feels like I stopped having opinions for the last 6-9 months of our relationship. Why?

Its no wonder you didn't love me because I wasn't even a person anymore by the time we broke up. I was a blob of play-dough that I'd given you to form, except you didn't, you just let it harden and dry out and crumble. Why did I do that?

I put my lifelong dream on hold for you. I sacrificed my body for you, my spirituality and my sexuality. Why??? You didn't even ask me to. What was I thinking?

Did I even love you? I know now that you didn't love me. That's not what love looks like. Giving nothing, taking everything. That's not love. But I don't think giving everything and taking nothing is love either. So what *was* that? 

We connected on some level I'd never felt before. I know I wasn't lying when I said I'd never loved someone so much. Except that it wasn't love. I just didn't know it? We had nothing in common besides the things I changed about myself so we could share them. We had no business being together, and yet we were, and it was an experience I would never take back (and I doubt you would either), but what experience was it?

(NSFW),25,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1bji4b/broke_up_with_her_and_then_the_fun_began_let_this/,"Little Back story. Met her (24F) me (35M) one night playing poker. Cute, Great Figure, had a job, and a kid (Seemed normal). We both liked the same things and all. 

I was recently out of a relationship of 3 years with another woman whom i have a 5 year old daughter with. Was still going through all the mess of child custody when i met EX#2 playing poker one night at a local poker club. She seemed fun so i asked her out. Took her to Vegas and we had a great time so began regular dating. Her job at the time paid very little and seemed shady looking back so most of the time i paid. Fast forward 6 months of dating she loses her job and cant find work so i let her move in with me (BIG MISTAKE)

When she moved in she moved in with Trash Bags and wouldn't let me help her. Basically all of her stuff was in black trash bags and i found out she was a bit of a slob (I am a neat freak)

First week is when the problems began, she would never take out the trash, help with dishes or clean up common areas which pretty much left me to do it.

Then money started to go missing... 20 bucks here, 100 bucks there, Blue Ray Movies, DVD's, Games i had purchased.... Hell an entire Wii in my daughter's room.

To make matters worse my Ex whom i have a kid with hated her from the start because she was younger and prettier than her... (Long ass story)

Anyways, fast forward a year into my lease and landlord tells me she is shortselling the home. Things arent working out with my GF so i tell her that as soon as the home sells I am leaving, and not taking her with me. (I know i am leaving out alot, just venting)

It took 3 months for the home to sell. I moved out Last Thursday (She never once looked for a place to live and basically continued to not work and mooch off me)

I went back there sunday to clean the house for the new landlord and this is basically what i walked into.......

1.) 1 60"" Panasonic Plasma TV Missing
2.) My Entire Bedroom Set and King Size Bed Missing
3.) All my Groceries Gone
4.) She had a private bathroom, this toilet was full of shit, blood, and toilet papers
5.) Mounds of Hair in the Sink
6.) a Home Made Bong/Crack Pipe (I don't do drugs, didn't know she did either)
7.) 1 Pack of Magnum Condoms, 1 used and open (I am no where near Magnum Size.

I cleaned for 6-7 hours with a broken foot and removed all the trash, the carpet in her room is ruined (I never really went in there because it was non of my business) and i removed an entire large dumpster worth of trash. Nearly gagged on cleaning the toilet....

Let this be a lesson to you guys. Think with your brain and not your dick. I thought with my dick and let a crazy person move in with me.

This might be long..

I sucked it up and decided to head to his house with the letter. I texted him and called him a few times informing him I was coming but he was still asleep until I finally got there.

I called some of my friends while on the bus, trying to get some courage about what I was about to do. I just ended up crying on the bus in front of everybody and lost both of my contact lens which left me blind for the whole trip. 

My original plan was to just give him the letter and leave but he invited me in and I couldn't help myself. We went up to his room and I asked how was his trip and if he slept with him. I already knew the answer, I don't even know why I asked.

I told him that there were just some things I wanted to say but knowing I couldn't do it, I gave him [the letter](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1bfgfg/i_feel_weak_and_a_letter/) and some chocolate truffles I made that he enjoyed so much. He read it while I was there shutting my eyes and digging my fingers into my arm. He asked if he wanted me to respond to the letter and I said no. He started crying and I broke down and started crying too. We hugged and I just broke while holding him. I cried that I was sorry I had to ruin his happy weekend but I just couldn't stand it anymore. I couldn't stop bawling.. and I still can't right now. 

Eventually it died down and I told him that even though in the letter I wrote I wanted him to continue texting me, I actually don't want him to. It would just make things harder for me. I also did something stupid while he was out of the room and checked his phone to see more texts between him and the other guy. Texts like ""&lt;3"" and such. It hurt a lot but strengthened my resolve to get better. I need to get over this.

Things got awkward as I knew I should leave but didn't want to. I forced myself up and tried to move my legs to the door. Apparently his mom was leaving at the same time too and asked if I needed a ride. I said no, and my ex insisted that I wanted to take the bus, for my sake. She knew something was going on and told me I would always be welcome in her house and I said thanks and quickly turned around because I would be breaking down again. 

As she got into her car to leave, I felt like I should say something so I ran up and rapped on her window and said ""Thank you really for everything, I just want to say good bye."" She stared at me for a second and ordered me into her car. I guess.. I don't know. I decided to say bye to him one last time and got into her car. 

She held my hand the entire time, telling me I would be okay and that her son was young and stupid. She didn't know if we would ever get back together, but she said she had a talk with her son and knew he really cared about me and that she was the one who told him that if he didn't love someone, he shouldn't string them along. It hurt to hear that because it meant he didn't ever love me. But she also said that she knows I'll get through this and that my ex and I would eventually become really good friends, because despite it all he really likes me just not in the same way that I do. I just need to get over this hurdle.

It was.. really good and therapeutic. She said she liked me and already thought of me as her half-son. I started crying again not just because of the pain but because.. she felt like a friend and a mom (I'm not out to my parents) and.. just someone who genuinely cared about what I was going through. 

She bought me lunch and drove me home. And.. yeah that's about it.

I unfriended him on Facebook because I kept checking up on him and the other guy. I unfriended him on Steam because I kept checking to see what he was up to because if he was playing a game it meant he wasn't with him. I finally unfriended him on Google Latitude because I keep trying to determine if he was with him. 

So yeah. I'm still tearing up and crying but I think I can get through this. ",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1bge9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1bge9k/cut_off_all_contact_hopefully_my_last_post_for_a/,

Sleep is really important to me and I even spent some of the engagement ring fund to splurge on a tempurpedic bed.

When I first met my ex, she was still good friends with her ex, Andy. The problem is I had no idea they ever dated, she never mentioned it, and as far I knew they were just good friends. I later found out the truth and confronted her about it, she apologized for hiding the truth from me but she claimed she didn't want me to be jealous or anything. The problem is that because she was my first girlfriend, I had no idea as to protocol with your girlfriend having close male friends, they'd hang out once in a while and on more than one occasion she had spent the night at his place. After  finding out they used to date ideas of her cheating on me with him were constantly in my head. I even considered contacting Andy at one point to find out, but I didn't. 

How could anyone think it's okay to spend the night at their ex's place when they have a SO? Especially since their SO didn't even know they used to date. It was a blatant disrespect to me and I should have known better, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt that nothing ever happened. They eventually stopped hanging out, but not before a late night phone call where Andy professed his love and how he still wanted to be with her, she almost considered going back to him, but decided to stay with me.

Fast forward to 4 years and several months after she broke up with me for an old crush(not Andy). She had a crush on Benny for forever and he had friendzoned her early on in their friendship. After a visit home she was hanging out at Benny's house(deja vu) when he tried to kiss her and she claims she rejected his advances(she probably didn't) She came back home, strung me along for another month, and finally broke up with me, citing every reason under the sun except for the fact that Benny finally wanted a relationship with her and she couldn't be happier. I later found out about the Benny episode and lost the last ounce of my self-esteem.

Here's where it gets fun, because they were doing a long distance thing, her and I still would hang out, hook up, and act couple-y. I never wanted to be the other guy, but old habits die hard. 

One day it hit me. It's me, I've become the new Andy. Her boyfriend wasn't available, so I was the stand-in. I had never felt more pathetic in my life. This is what I had become, the emotional blanket, the fill in, the ""good enough for now"" No more, I don't want to be the Andy anymore, I hope Benny never finds out about how much she cheated on him, I wish that kind of pain on no one.

I have never suffered such heartache, such a feeling of loss. An utter emptiness and my soul is left torn.
How can this feeling be right when it feels so wrong? I am short of breath with the feeling that I am imprisoned in a world where we just don't belong.
Time is all I am indebted to now and I will repay the minutes and hours with a heavy heart and a sorrow that can not be matched. This has to become my time to heal and find myself without you and I pray that one day this feeling of yearning will go away.
I can not instruct myself to stop loving you, which I am somehow thankful for as I also never want to stop. I feel that you are my soulmate, my partner in this life whether we are together or not.
I meant it when I said I will never give up hope. It's not something I'm prepared to do as my heart is truly yours.
I have stopped trying to find reasons we went through what we did, as you and I are just us and that was how we were. I can only learn from past mistakes and redesign the path ahead of me. I hold hope that it leads back to you and at the end of it you are waiting for me.
Everyday away from you feels like a lifetime. It is like I am being robbed of 24 more precious hours with you and suddenly life seems to short.
All I can do now is leave this in the hands of the universe and hope that my future includes you in it. I want nothing more than to be in a happy, bright and warm place with you where once again we can not get enough of one another.
I long to grow old with you and would vow to look after you forever. I would do anything, absolutely anything for you and there is nothing in this world I care about more than you.
I hope that you are well and I hope that soon you can remember all of this and find a happy path back to me.

You may think i'm crazy. But what happens when you lose the person that shared your life for three years when you barely lived 17, with who you shared your ideas, your thoughts, your achievements, your failures, a person in which you had so much confidence that you could show yourself entirely naked to them, not only physically but also mentally. A person with who you do not build a barrier inbetween, where every parcel of ideas that run through your mind can be discussed. A person that has been there through joy and pain, that you believed you could count on no matter what, that what ever happens in life they'd always be their to support you and love you for who you are and you'd commit to do the same for them. A person for who you wouldn't mind spending everyday out on their corner in the pouring rain. A person that understands you, that knows who you truely are deep down in your heart. That knows you better than anyone else, even your own parents, a person that could tell what you feel just by looking into your eyes. A person that can guess what you think just by your body language. A person that has been by your side every fucking day during some of the most important and joyful years of your life. A person with who you could spend your life in a sweet surrender. A person that knows like no one will ever know. A relationship that ressembles that of brothers' and sisters' but even better, where nothing is taboo and nothing is hidden (at least thats what I thought). A person with who you have the relationship of siblings, best-friends, lovers, confidents, all within the same relationship. A person with who you thought you'd share your life with. Support each other to achieve your individual goals as well as the goals you share. A person with who you discussed of the future and couldn't picture it without them. A person you thought you would never lose, putting so much effort into building a strong relationship that could overcome any obstacle. Your second half, your soulmate, a person that understands your sens of humour, that could change your mood from depressed, sad, entirely destroyed to the happiest person on earth whithin a matter of seconds. 
But what happens when that person becomes the main source of the pain? When the person you thought you could count on during hard times becomes the reason you're having a hard time, and you're still alive but you're barely breathing. And no one could understand you like they could but they don't want to understand anymore. They have abandoned everything you put so much effort into during all those years just to experience things her single ""friends"" experience, and a thousand lies have made them colder. Because it looks so much fun to be an easy girl that grabs the attention with her looks. Superficial and egocentric stupidities that have no significant values in life. Getting drunk and being trashy. Living ""young,wild and free"" doesnt mean to abandon the person that loves you like no other, and nobody felt the way they did about you, loved you for yourself, for the person you are within your physical body, that appreciates you for who you are, that sees you as a human being with emotions and ideas and not as a sexual object, ""be pretty and shut-up"" 
If in todays society, having the ability to truely love someone, and by love I mean true fucking love from within your fucking soul, is synonym of being crazy, then I accept that label.
Do you know what it feels like to have a person you took for granted, that you believed your love would never be questioned, and then one day everything changes, and from that moment, you live every day wondering if that person ever thinks about you, or if she even remembers you and all the moments you spent together.

It keeps popping though, just when I think I have the technique mastered.

I texted him last night, and never should have. But when I’m alone, it all comes rushing into my mind uninvited, and then all I want is him next to me, to smell and to see. I want him with all of my senses. But I can’t have that anymore. Not at all, in any small capacity. I can’t even hear his voice. That’s what’s the hardest--accepting the finality, the fact that he does not want me the way I want him, and that nothing I can do, nothing I can say, can change that. It is a law that has been passed by a majority vote that I was not invited to attend.

It makes me feel weak that I reached out to him. Just a small text, saying that I missed him, which was truth, but it made me feel like I had lost something. It made me feel like I should be ashamed. He won’t respond, and why should he--it would only torture me, and torture him, and he’s too good of a person for this fuckery I seem unable to avoid.

I don’t know if I am ever going to be able to be free of his face hovering in front of my mind, saying over and over on a repeated loop I will never propose to you I will never propose to you I will never propose to you as white spots dance in front of my eyes.

How do you get over somebody saying they reject you fully and completely, that they have agonized for months and weighed the option of accepting you as their lifetime partner in their mind and you didn’t quite make the cut? How can you accept somebody saying you are wonderful, I loved you, this is as hard for me as it is for you, as they reach into your chest cavity and rip out everything there? If you loved me, I want to say, If you loved me, why do you say these things. If you loved me, touch me without regret behind your eyes. If you love me, stop crying. If you loved me, why are you taking your things and walking out the door? If you loved me, this whole day would rewind and reset, and you would no longer have to assure me that I was wonderful because I would know it to be true.

I fantasize at night about sitting at a bar alone and letting another man tell me I am beautiful. Maybe I will, I used to do this. But there is the niggling thought that I believed I became a stronger better person with you. I want to believe that was me, and not just you. I’ll know, though, if I’m in some stranger’s bed with bourbon on my breath again, that I was nothing all along and everything good in me was a reflection of you. And that, that would be the worst realization of all. 

The hardest thing is not knowing. I don’t know if you are sad, if you regret this, if you are relieved, if you can’t wait to find love with somebody else more deserving. I have no idea. I have no idea about anything. You said we just didn’t fit together. What does that mean after a year and a half? How is it that I did nothing wrong, like you said? What you are saying is even worse, I hope you realize. You are saying that I did nothing wrong, that I was wonderful, but inherently, in my personhood, I did not fit with you on some deeper cellular level. You’re not rejecting my actions, you’re rejecting me. And then you somehow think this makes it easier for me. I’m not your genus, I’m not even your species. This is what you tell me.

I don’t ever want to fall in love again. It seems ridiculous, so foolish, so masochistic. Handing over the most fragile part of yourself to somebody who very likely couldn’t give two fucks. We both took this chance, you said. This is always the chance you take when you love someone. I feel so weary. I feel too weary to try this any more. I’m only 25 but it feels like my life has been mapped out and finished and the direction it is taking I was never even consulted on.

People tell me I will be able to do this again in the future. This seems like telling a paraplegic he will someday walk again. And none of my paraplegic friends have seemed to find a miracle worker. There are so many of us, immobile and destroyed by love, huge scars across our chest for everyone to see. Does love even exist anymore? I think it faded out somewhere along the way. We’re too scared, we’ve been hurt too much. We are a huddle of terrified rabbits, darting from relationship to relationship before we can get caught again. We’ve learned our lessons, thank you very much.

Starting a new week seems incomprehensible to me. The idea of waking up and feeling this grief wash over me completely and totally day after day seems unmanageable. But here we go.

Met her in January, seen her 2nd time end-February and kissed. By the 4th time (March) we fucked. Always thought se was single, as she told me.
It began as a great sex story, then mid-April I tell her that I'm getting involved, and that if things are going on then I want *exclusive*, or *the truth then GTFO*. She tells me that it's OK and I think so.

By the end of May we are BF and GF... or I thought so.

All going great, lots of fucking and great moments together; she never really opened her life to me (friends, family, etc.) but I didn't notice, nor did I care. 

Fast forward to saturday night, chatting with her sister she tells me something like ""you're such a good guy to be with my sister even if she has a boyfriend"". I clearly went WTF all the way, met her and shit came out of the closet.

She has an ""official"" BF since before I met her, he hangs out with her parents and shit. And she was not at the seaside with her friends, so I was going to flip shit on some guy on vacation.

Different facebook privacy settings, each one described to the other as the stupid friendzoned guy, her sister being told not to tell me about him because ""I'd suffer cause I hopelessly loved her"". That's some fucking movie material right there. I had a few doubts, talked to her but basically I trusted her.

I call her and dump her ass. She calls her sister and tells her that he loves his BF and I'm crazy, then she calls me and tells me that she loves me (she always told me so) and it's a mistake. All in my car, on loudspeaker, heard by both. Then, at 5AM, she calls me (loudspeaker with BF) and tells me I misunderstood everything and I never had sex with her. Me, dead inside and full of hate, I just tell him to ""open his eyes"".

She keeps texting me she's sorry and a horrible person but I don't give a fuck. The guy contacted me on FB and told me he wants the truth, I'm going to tell him fucking EVERYTHING. I want her to be as alone as a stray dog. 

I feel like I lived a fucking lie for half a year, I'll never know the truth and I feel like shit.

It could have been worse: I could have been the BF. I could have been the sister, that has to live with that horrible person. After all, all I had was chitty-chats and awesome sex.

I feel destroyed. Not that much for the feelings, but because the bitch fooled me and threw me away like I never existed.

I just typed one up on my diary and though I might share it here in case it helps someone.

* There's no point moping around, thinking of times past, of weddings and honeymoons and past events.  There's no point thinking of the sex you've had or any of the other stuff you've done together.  She has all those memories too, and when she thinks of them it doesn't make her want to come back to you.  She can think about those things and STILL want to be apart from you.  Don't dwell, don't think back.  Think about the things you need to do at this point to move forward.

* She moved out for fucks sake!  She didn't just go to stay at her mother's for a while and clear her head!   She packed up 80% of her personal belongings and moved out.  She's not looking back.  This isn't temporary.

* Think of all the things she's ""willing to go through"" to get this done.  She left you, even though you begged her to stay.  You kicked you screamed you cried and she still pulled away.  She's abandoned you in the house you both own.  She's paying half the mortgage on a place she doesn't even live in!  She's undoing all your joint finances, and putting herself in debt.  She's at her mother's which she hates, living out of boxes and being miserable.  She left her dog here with you.  And she's asked you to look after it in the future (which you're considering...)..  but the fact she could walk away from her house, her dog, financial stability, joint friends...   means she REALLY wants out of this.  So much so she's willing to do almost anything to get it.  Not the actions of someone who would consider reconciliation.

* She's got a new love interest.  That's right..  and this is the part that hurts the most.  Yes she started talking to this guy while you were still together.  Doesn't seem like there was anything physical going on, but there was certainly an emotional relationship which you know she is pursuing full steam ahead now that you're separated.  Thinking about him and her does you no good.  What she does now isn't your concern.  And you'll never know the facts.  Maybe they've only kissed.  Maybe they're fucking, maybe they're fucking right now..   but you don't know, you can't know and thinking about it only hurts you.  Don't think about things you can't know for sure, because your mind will fill in the blanks with things that aren't true and real and it will only hurt you.  Let it go.  Let the thoughts go.  She's not coming back, you're not getting back together so whatever she's doing doesn't matter!

* Stop contacting her.  Yes it's hard when you wake up in a panic at 5am.  You want to text her, or email her or anything to unburden yourself.  The times you've done that what have you gotten back?  Well she doesn't reply to your emails.  She replies to your texts ""matter of factly"" and when you've spoken to her on the phone it's just been you doing all the talking and her listening - until she says ""I have to go"".  She doesn't want to hear from you.  She wants you to go away and leave her alone so she can get on with her life, and you need to do the same.  You have a good job, a decent car and lots of awesome friends who've been there for you through this.  So as someone said ""80% of your life right now is still great.  Don't let the 20% that is messed up make you forget that.  Don't let the 20% drag you down"".

* You're hurt.  You're feeling betrayed.  You've lost someone very important to you.  But you didn't really know her.  Remember that.  Because the person YOU thought she was couldn't have done this.  You had her on a pedestal, at least in your mind.  You thought she was something other than she was.  But people are human, life changes, love changes.  Deal with what you have left.  Pick up the pieces and move on, you deserve to do it for yourself.  And don't JUST move on.  Improve!  Evolve!  Do all the things you told her you would do to improve yourself, but do them for you.  Get out more, be friendlier, take a course and study like you've wanted to for years, get back to your exercise.  Do all these things and your life WILL get back on track, and you'll better and stronger than ever.  And then once you're in a better place you'll be perfectly positioned to maybe meet someone new - and not make the same mistakes again.

Dear Ex, 

Today was a pretty shit day. I always hate it when the weekend rolls around, because normally I'd be all excited on Fridays at the prospect of spending the weekend with you. Now I'm thinking of the girl that you're probably spending your weekends with now. Don't know whether to feel jealous of her or sorry for her.

Everytime I have this great new idea to reinvent myself, more into the person I would want to be and love, instead of that girl you went out with for 9 months who couldn't stand up for herself and who would've done anything for you even if it meant she was crying herself to sleep every night, I get this pang in my chest. I'm going to learn skateboarding, take driving lessons, start working out, start on that novel I've been meaning to write ever since I got out of highschool, get insanely good at snowboarding once winter rolls around. And you're not going to be there to see any of it. I want to become someone you wouldn't even fucking recognize if you happen to see me by accident one day. I want to show you what you gave up. Maybe I needed to lose you in order to find myself. But it's just sad. I wanted to share all of these experiences with you, I wanted to share my growth with you. But as the days from the break up to now increase and we become more and more like strangers and less and less like the people we thought we knew, I'm starting to realize that we held eachother back. And yet everytime I accomplish something or discover something new about myself, I wish I could tell you. 

Fuck, it's just sad. I remember you telling me that the reason you refused to give up was because while you enjoyed being with me, you knew you would enjoy being with the me who was less insecure, less anxious, less scared even more and you didn't want to leave if you knew you could be with her. But that shit's not love. You didn't accept me for who I was and to be honest, I didn't accept you for who you were either. The person who deserves me at my absolute best can handle and continue to love me at my absolute worst. I hope that even if you realize that I wasn't right for you, you'll realize in time, that I cared about you and I did my best. So fuck you, and your inability to see that now, to see that THEN when you had me. All you know how to do is to take people for granted, but I'll admit I made that too easy for you. You said you haven't felt heartbreak for a long time because you never get close enough to anyone to feel anything. God, I hope you feel something one day even if it's not for me. Then you'll have an idea of how much it can hurt, how much it can scare you to lose someone who's so fucking special to you. You say you're not scared of losing anyone, but that's bullshit. You've lost way too many people for that to be true. But that's why it's better for you to walk away right? Instead of someone else walking out on you. 

Stop running and just deal with your shit. Didn't you tell me that once? Follow your own goddamn advice.

Wish I could say best wishes at this point, but really, it's too soon for that. 

Fuck you very much,

Your ex-girlfriend.

I mean, I read reddit and comment periodically, but emptying the contents of my heart on a somewhat anonymous message board is just not my thing (not to disparage those who do.)  But this sucks, I've talked it out plenty with my friends, and quite frankly I just gotta put it into some structured words.

My girlfriend of a year and a half dumped me on Saturday.  I'm 25.  She's 29.  The reason was simple, despite us being tight companions and having extreme affection towards me, it just never came to love for her.  Fair enough.  There's just no way around that one.

To put it simply, this is the first girl I have ever really, honestly, been in love with.  And while something like that is hard to gauge because I have no storied history with love and therefore no frame of reference, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that girl was it.  She was **it**.  I've never felt so connected and tied to another human being.  And I am pretty devastated.  It is totally cliche to say, but I get it now:  I feel like I have a giant piece of me missing.  Just gone.  Every morning (and there's only been four so far, but still) is awful.  I wake up knowing that I live in a world now where she's gone, and all the history behind us is irrelevant.

I am super fortunate in that I have a wonderful family of friends who have flanked me left and right the past few days.  Before an hour had passed of getting dumped, about 15 of my closest friends dropped everything they were doing for the whole day and came to get drunk with me.  The party went all day, there were laughs, there were more tears, and by the end of the night I had tripped and ate shit walking down the sidewalk, used my face to stop the fall, and now I look like someone royally beat the shit out of me (I even chipped a quarter of a front tooth off!)

But I had a nice moment that night when I got home and I saw my pretty destroyed face.  It all felt very symbolic.  This is how I feel.  And I'm literally wearing it on my face.  And I'm alive, right?  I've got that going for me.

It sucks so bad, on an almost indescribable level.  That despite loving her enormously, she just didn't feel like that towards me.  That one day, she'll find a guy who she will feel that fire towards, and it won't be me.  That there's a long walk ahead of me, and its gonna be harder than hell the whole way.

But as a friend of mine told me the other day:  ""Don't walk away from this without any wisdom gained.""  And ya know, dude?  I'm not going through anything that no one has ever been through before.  That this happens all the time, every day, to people everywhere, and I can appreciate that.  I'm no special case.  And *everyone* has to do this sometime.  Its just part of walking the path.  What, did I think I was gonna be able to just march straight into happiness and contentedness without any hardships on the way there?  Grow up!

So.  Anyway.  That's pretty much it.  I'm pretty shattered by this thing right now.  I think April 14 will probably go down as the year's worst day, provided the world doesn't end in December, then that will definitely be it.  But hey.  This is life.  This is all real.  Bad shit happens.  And I'm not a fan of it.  But there **is** value in being forged by fire.  And you always come out feeling stronger and standing taller from it.  And if I can walk away knowing even just that one thing, then I would call that wisdom gained.

If we insist on staying longer than the necessary time, we lose the happiness and the meaning of the other stages we have to go through. Closing cycles, shutting doors, ending chapters – whatever name we give it, what matters is to leave in the past the moments of life that have finished.

Did you lose your job? Has a loving relationship come to an end? Did you leave your parents’ house? Gone to live abroad? Has a long-lasting friendship ended all of a sudden?

You can spend a long time wondering why this has happened. You can tell yourself you won’t take another step until you find out why certain things that were so important and so solid in your life have turned into dust, just like that.

But such an attitude will be awfully stressing for everyone involved: your parents, your friends, your children, your sister, everyone will be finishing chapters, turning over new leaves, getting on with life, and they will all feel bad seeing you at a standstill.

None of us can be in the present and the past at the same time, not even when we try to understand the things that happen to us. What has passed will not return: we cannot for ever be children, late adolescents, sons that feel guilt or rancor towards our parents, lovers who day and night relive an affair with someone who has gone away and has not the least intention of coming back.

Things pass, and the best we can do is to let them really go away.

That is why it is so important (however painful it may be!) to destroy souvenirs, move, give lots of things away to orphanages, sell or donate the books you have at home. Everything in this visible world is a manifestation of the invisible world, of what is going on in our hearts – and getting rid of certain memories also means making some room for other memories to take their place.

Let things go. Release them. Detach yourself from them. Nobody plays this life with marked cards, so sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. Do not expect anything in return, do not expect your efforts to be appreciated, your genius to be discovered, your love to be understood. Stop turning on your emotional television to watch the same program over and over again, the one that shows how much you suffered from a certain loss: that is only poisoning you, nothing else.

Nothing is more dangerous than not accepting love relationships that are broken off, work that is promised but there is no starting date, decisions that are always put off waiting for the “ideal moment.” Before a new chapter is begun, the old one has to be finished: tell yourself that what has passed will never come back. Remember that there was a time when you could live without that thing or that person – nothing is irreplaceable, a habit is not a need. This may sound so obvious, it may even be difficult, but it is very important.

Closing cycles. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because that no longer fits your life. Shut the door, change the record, clean the house, shake off the dust.""

She emailed me sometimes and I did not respond to her. 

It was really hard. I was miserable but it helped to mourn my loss and reflect on things. After I got some emotional distance I realized that she didn't treat me as well as I deserved and that I wasn't the person I wanted to be in that relationship and I was probably used to some extent to get over a previous relationship.  Anyway, I have gone on a few dates and met new people. No one that I wanted to date. I found out yesterday through the grapevine that she was dating again. I don't like it and it upsets me a bit but I am okay. I am okay. I never thought that I would get to that point if I found out she was dating. Time and distance does help a lot.

Something else. Yesterday I met up with a old college friend. We got drinks and talked for four hours. We had a great time. I am going to ask her to hang out again and we will see where it goes.

No contact is 100% no contact.. not some contact, not facebook stalking, not looking at old happy pictures.. Nothing. No Contact. It's not for everyone, but it applies to most relationships that end, and should last for (x) period of time, where (x) is whatever time it takes to emotionally separate yourself from your former lover. This could be forever, but does not have to be.

Here are my own personal interpretations of who NC will work for and who might be able to remain friends.

NC is the way to go:

* If you were deeply in love with someone at the time of breakup, then NC is essentially mandatory. Don't assume you can be a bigger person by staying friends, and don't assume keeping that person in your life will make you happier. NC is a period of time where you become whole again. You can't do that if half of you is somewhere else.

* Whether dumpee or dumper, if one party was more in love with the other, then you need to establish NC to protect or help the party that is now heartbroken. Staying friends will only hurt the more vested person for longer.

* This might be the most important concept to understand in NC. You loved the person who you are no longer with. You may have even wanted to marry them, have kids, buy a house, etc.. now all of that is gone. You wanted them as a lover, but not as a friend. It's okay to feel this way. There is no rule that says you need to stay friends after a breakup. In fact, most people do not. Those who do fall into another category.

NC is not necessary:

* If the relationship ran it's course, and you both wanted out, then NC is not necessary. You can remain friends. Ultimately, you will get to a point where you want your former lover to be happy, and you will be okay with it.

* If you both never really romantically loved each other, then you won't need NC at all. If you were more friends than anything else, NC may even seem like a silly concept. 

Again, these are my own interpretations as to who NC works for and who may not need it. Feel free to add or debate my points. Many of us here are feeling our way through some intense breakups, and really thinking this stuff through, helps enormously. Having confidence in NC is extremely important in those weaker moments.

I keep thinking about how much I miss you and how badly I want you around.  I have to assume that you try not to care what is going on with me, because you decided on no contact.  I still worry about you at night and hope that you are safe, that you are happy.  I imagine that you are having fun, hanging out with the people you want to be with, the people you chose. 

I have to believe that everything is better for you now, because I'm not there.  I have to trust that you choosing to cut me out of your life is the best thing for you.  I'm choosing to believe that you are happy now, that your path is smoother, that the pressures of your life with me are diminished.  I have to believe that your worries are gone and you know what is right for you.  I trust that you are working hard to diminish what we had and forget the good times, because it's easier to only remember the bad.  Remembering the bad makes it easier, justifies the pain that we are going through. 

Telling ourselves that it won't work, that it isn't worth it to keep trying, is the only way to make the sleepless nights, the racing hearts, the mental anguish, the aching in our chests worthwhile.  I have to tell myself that you're better off without me, that you deserve better than anything I can do for you.  If you believe it, then I have to believe it too. 

I have to fake it, because on the oh so rare occasion when I see you, my heart races and I smile and I'm just so happy to see your face.  And then I remember, ""He won't be happy to see me.  He doesn't want to see me.  He chooses not to see me or talk to me, because that's what he needs,""  and my heart sinks to my toes. I love seeing you.  I am caught off guard  by your hair, because it's so short, but your eyes are still beautiful and the set of your shoulders still makes me catch my breath and the brief flash of your smile is the same. 
If I had known that the last time I talked to you would be the last chance to touch you, I would have.  I tried to be so cautious, so in control, so that I wouldn't influence your decision.  I would have touched your hand, stroked your cheek, hugged you so fiercely, and kissed your neck. 

I would have convinced you of my love and made sure you knew that I would never let you down again.  I would have made you waffles every day (instead of just weekends) and brought it to you in bed.  I would have called in sick to work and taken you on a road trip to wherever you wanted to go.  I would have stayed in bed longer and hugged you more.  I would have drowned my insecurities and built you up.  I would never have made snap decisions based on emotion. I would have always asked about your day before telling you about mine.  I would have been dramatic about the good things and downplayed the bad.  I would have trusted you more.  I would have been better.   I would have, should have convinced you that I would be better, that I would never hurt you again.

And it turns out, I won't.  I can't hurt you anymore.  I can't let you down again.  I can't do anything to make your path rough, because I'm not there anymore.  I'm gone, because it's what you need. And I know that.  I'm trying not to be selfish.

 But it's hard, because I miss you, not our relationship, not loving you, I miss YOU.  I'm not lonely.  I have people to be with.  I quite simply prefer you.  I have preferred you since we started and I probably always will.  But you need this.  So I'm gone. I'm trusting you now, because I have to believe that you know what is best for you.

One thing I've noticed again and again though is people confusing their feelings for their exes. I know for me some days I hate my ex while others days I feel like crying because I miss her so much. I feel the biggest emotions we often get mixed up are missing our exes and loving our exes. 

To explain, I often see posts talking about what they miss from their relationship. I.e I miss biking with her, I miss falling asleep beside her, I miss seeing her after a frustrating day, I miss long night phone calls. When we face it, each relationship we've had with that special person we've built a huge amount of memories and experiences which is completely normal. One thing though that redditors are often getting confused about is whether they still love their exes. We might think we do but infact we only miss loving them. It's another experience that we miss, not something we still feel. You can miss your ex, that's completely fine. I still miss mine but I know now that I don't love her. 

We often interrupt the feeling of missing love as a feeling of love altogether which blinds our minds and makes us an emotional mess. ENough of that! I'm telling you heartbroken redditors to really ask yourself if you still love this person that ripped your insides or whether you just miss feeling that close with them. There is a BIG DIFFERENCE between still loving someone and missing them. And this BIG DIFFERENCE is often overlooked because when you're an emotional wreck your mind can't really separate the two, hence how some of us miss her one day and hate her the next. 

To finish; ""No one can tell you you're in love. You just know it. Through and through, balls to bones."" - Oracle to Neo in The Matrix. I love this fucking quote so much, it just has so much weight. Love is a feeling that you just know, it's there. If you have to ask yourself whether or not you love someone then ""sorry honey, [she's/he's] not the one"". (another matrix quote!? FTW) So if you just read the above few paragraphs and are undecided of your love then it's definitely not love but if you're a hundred percent still in love then I guess you got the real deal. And your hurt is probably an open wound. And a last bit of advice, NO FUCKING CONTACT. You see it all over Reddit, No god damn contact!!!

1365722329.0,21,self.BreakUps,1c63pc,4 months in - It gets better (No really. I didn't believe it either.),23,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1c63pc/4_months_in_it_gets_better_no_really_i_didnt/,"I'm a little over four months in since my wife (of four years, together eight) left. At the time, I was a wreck. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I lost 25 pounds (which I'm actually kind of glad about ha-ha), I couldn't concentrate at work,  I couldn't stay busy. Reading /r/breakups would sometimes make me feel better, but often just made things worse. ""It gets better"" - yeah right. Easy for you to say. Not for me. My life is over.

Now I realize that it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Because my god it was a terrible relationship. Excuse me for a minute while I dive into my rant and the things I'll never miss. Wall of text incoming, sorry.

- Her temper was terrible. I would always watch her be sunny and delightful with everyone else, but with me...I would be snapped at, talked down to, disrespected, and treated like a child. Constantly. I would also make excuses for it - stress, hormones, whatever. Sometimes I would get a curt apology, but usually not. No matter how many times I tried to talk to her about it, nothing changed. It wasn't until only recently that I realized it's simply not okay to talk to anyone like that, let alone a partner. I can't believe I put up with it for as long as I did.

- I was an atheist, she was a Christian. Early on in our relationship, this led to a lot of stimulating and enjoyable discussions. Unfortunately, our difference in faith meant a lot more to her than it did to me, so at some point these talks started ending up in her becoming upset and me having to console her. So I stopped. Or tried. Once I stopped starting them, she would try to egg me into them herself. And because I was so passionate about the subject, I couldn't keep my mouth shut, and I'd take the bait. And of course, an hour later, she'd be in tears, and it would be up to me to fix it. I swear she got some kind of twisted enjoyment out of purposely getting me to make her upset, and then having me fix it. Don't know if I'd go as far as to call it mental/emotional abuse, since ultimately I should have just refused to take the bait, but still. Not okay.

- Compulsive over-spender. Shopping sprees every weekend. Meanwhile I spent years with the same small wardrobe, and wore hand-me-down work clothes from my father, because there was simply never money left over for me to do anything. No complaints though. I just wanted her to have whatever she wanted. I could get by on less. And as far as saving? Forget it. All future plans - starting a family, buying a house (which in hindsight, thank god) were constantly pushed back, and we ended up just treading water. Again, no matter how many times I tried to talk about this, I was just called ""controlling"", or obsessed with penny-pinching, and nothing changed. I picked up extra hours at work, and busted my ass to try to get us ahead of the curve. It was never appreciated, never enough. I made the money, she spent it, and that's just how it went. Eventually I just gave up, resigned to the fact that we'd live in an apartment for the rest of our lives.  
 
- For the majority of our marriage, she was terribly overweight, and her self-esteem was virtually zero as a result. It honestly never made me think less of her, or made her less attractive to me, and as she would fish for compliments, I exhausted myself trying to make her realize that. She also projected her own self-image issues onto me. Would make comments about my own negative features, things like my big ears, or crooked teeth - things that she knew I was terribly self-conscious about. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt and say it was a sub-conscious way to knock me down to her level. During the last year of our marriage, she got back into shape, and lost about 70 pounds. I was ecstatic and supportive throughout, and thought that would make things better. Instead she just started getting more attention from other guys, and eventually got involved with one of them. Go figure. As for me, it took a while to get my self-esteem and confidence back up, and it's honestly still a work in progress...but I'm getting there.

- I simply couldn't make her happy. I cycled through every ""love language"", and nothing ever clicked. Touch, acts of service, gifts, affirmation, quality time/conversation. I exhausted myself trying, but you can't make someone happy who refuses to be happy with themselves...and you'll be unhappy as well. Sometimes I wonder if my wife ever actually loved me, or if she simply used me to make her feel better about herself. It's a sobering though, and I hope it's not true...but if it is, just another reason to be glad it's over.

- All of this turned me into a negative, cynical asshole. Towards the end, I was rarely finding enjoyment in anything. Even things I used to be extremely passionate about (like my Steelers!) I simply couldn't care about. I didn't know if I was depressed, or if this was just the way I was. Only now am I realizing it was the relationship doing it. This really hit home a few days ago, cleaning out old pictures on my PC. Years of photos, and from about the halfway point of our relationship on, I couldn't find a single one where I looked genuinely happy. Every smile looks forced, and my eyes just have this hint of sadness and exhaustion. But all the photos taken in the last month or so? I'm grinning like an idiot, and loving life. And I feel that way now, all the time. My family and friends can't stop commenting on how much better I am. Funny enough, this negativity was one of the reasons she cited for leaving....and that ended up being what fixed it!

Okay, so that was a lot longer than I meant it to be. Sorry. Just wanted to get it out all in one place. I didn't think I'd ever be happy again, like a lot of you on here. And now that I'm actually *happier*, I'm excited as hell, and that excitement just feeds on itself to the point where I want to tell everyone I can.

I guess I could be bitter about ""wasting"" almost a third of my life on this girl. But I don't want any more negativity. Sure, eight years is a long time with pretty much nothing to show for it...but I (hopefully) have a lot longer than eight more years left, and I intend to make the most of it.  And besides, it wasn't a waste. If nothing else, it taught me what *not* to want in future relationships. And as bad as things were, I still have plenty of good memories as well, and I'll always keep those. I don't want anything to do with my ex now, because of the way she treated me (then and now), but I don't wish her ill. That said, I wouldn't say I wish her well either, but whatever. I'm just indifferent at this point. I just hope I can get through this divorce process as quickly and cheaply as possible. All I want to do now is finally close this chapter of my life and move onto the rest of the book. 

Of course, finding someone new and awesome who makes you realize how terrible things were can help....not that I recommend jumping into something else until you've had time to heal and process. But trust me, every single one of you will find someone better too. It's just a matter of time.

So, maybe you're saying ""that's awesome for you, but my ex was nothing like that. He/she was perfect, and I'll never find anyone even close."" False. I thought the same thing. No one's perfect. I wasn't. She sure as hell wasn't. Your ex isn't either. Get them off the pedestal. 

And I've said all of this, to say this - no matter why you broke up, whether you were the dumper or the dumped - there *will* come a day when you look back on it as a good thing, if not the best thing that ever happened to you. Why? Because you're awesome. Life is awesome. And it's too fucking short to waste a second being with someone who doesn't want to be with you, and make you as happy as you make them. And it's certainly too fucking short to waste a second missing or pining to get back someone who doesn't fit that bill.

So be sad today. And then tomorrow get up, and get back out there. Fake it until you make it if you have to. It does get better. And somewhere out there is someone who wants to be with you, and when the time is right, you will find them. But you have to get up off the floor first.

**TL;DR** It really does get better.

I miss waiting up for you to get home from work and tell me about your day.
The one memory I keep playing over and over in my head is when you leaned in and kissed me good night and went into bed. I don't know why that one plays over and over in my head. I think that's when I really just felt like a couple with you. I felt like we fit together like a puzzle. 
I miss watching you play college football on the xbox. 
I miss watching The Voice and The Walking Dead with you. 
I miss watching you cook. I miss watching you do your dances. 
I miss so many things about you. And you don't miss me at all. That cuts like a knife. That there isn't anything about me that you miss. 

But the person I miss doesn't even exist anymore. I don't know who you are now. I don't know this person you've become. Who is the real you? The guy you are now, or the person you were with me? It hurts that you have no feelings for me. That you don't care for me anymore. It hurts that you have now invested yourself and time in someone who is shallow and selfish and takes you for granted. You want to be in total chaos and drama with this girl. This girl who told you if you still drove your Fusion she wouldn't have been interested in dating you again. You got a hummer and that made you ""hot"". Seriously? 

You have changed your hair, your clothes, didn't finish your awesome tat because of her (which really sweetheart looks ridiculous half done). 

She is using you and taking total advantage of you. She doesn't pay for anything and keeps expecting you to take her places. She makes you late for everything. She takes 3 HOURS to get read. 3 HOURS. She ruined the concert for you. She ruined the trip to Old Forge for you. Because of the distance and your jobs you don't get to see each other a lot, and she told you to go home because she needed to get sleep. She was going to make you sleep on the floor because she doesn't sleep well with you in bed. 

What is wrong with you? What is missing inside of you that this is what you prefer? Honestly, I have beat myself up trying to figure out what I did wrong or what I was missing that you would rather be with her. What could I have changed that would make you want to be with me and not with her? But I realized that I don't want to be anything like her. I don't want to be drama. I don't want to be self-centered. I want to be in a partnership. I want to give to someone who appreciates what I have to offer. If you don't want healthy and stable, then we aren't a good match. Then you made the right call by being with her. I do feel sorry for you that this is really what you want to deal with for the rest of your life. I don't know what you did to her 5 years ago that you are trying to make up for and can therefore justify her behavior towards you. But seriously, it borders on abuse. And you just sit there and take it. And I guess that's another reason I don't really feel like I know you. Part of my attraction to you was watching you be in control of every situation and own a room when you walked in. But when you tell me the things she says to you and the way she treats you, and that you're ok with it, you can ""deal with it"", I just want to scream MAN UP! You are so much more than this girl. I don't know why you don't see that. I don't know how you don't know that. But maybe you do. You want to date an immature girl, not a woman who has her shit together. I do still care about you and I still do have a lot of love for you. I hope for your sake you wake up to the person she really is before it's too late.

 That you really do need to learn to love yourself before someone else can love who you are. Personally, I have read this countless times but couldn’t/wouldn’t believe these clichéd words. But now I finally understand.


To all those who have had their hearts broken, here is my personal guide to dealing with a bad break up and how to believe those clichéd words for yourself.


Step 1: Acceptance

When someone decides that they no longer want to be with you (for whatever reason) there is nothing you can do to change their mind. Their mind is made up, so for your best interests, don’t waste your time waiting.  If they want to do their own thing and expect you to wait until they are ready to resume the relationship, whatever you do, don’t let them keep you from living your own life. Maybe one day they will be ready to come back to you but in the mean time, NOW is the prime time to begin the journey of discovering who you are better than you have ever done before.


Step 2: Discover/Define who you are

Take time out of your day and make a nice long list of all the things you like about yourself. i.e. physical appearance, personality, morals, hobbies, talents, attributes.  (making a damn good grilled cheese sammich for example) Nothing is off limits and be as specific as possible. Make another list of all the cool things you have accomplished i.e. graduated from kindergarten, making a rubber band ball. Again, nothing is too small or insignificant to add to the list. Make another list of all the bad things that have happened to you and explain how those experiences have taught you a precious lesson and molded you into who you are today. There is no right or wrong answer, every bad experience has a take away lesson that is different for everyone. Add to the lists daily, weekly, monthly, and see how long you can make it. Read your lists religiously until you feel like you crossed the line into narcissism.


Step 3: Create the best version of yourself

Give yourself standards. Set yourselves some goals. Small reasonable goals at first i.e. finish that one book, go on a walk every other day, or learn some cords on that dusty guitar. Make bigger long term goals i.e. lose 15 pounds if you need it, improve your savings account, or finish school.  You set your limits. The only thing limiting you to how amazing you can make yourself is you. For every excuse you can come up to prevent you, come up with two reasons why you can. 


Step 4: Build a Personal Resume 

It is exactly what it sounds like. If you get bored one day (like on the 30th page of Reddit bored… Let’s be honest here…We have all done it.) Type up/draft yourself a resume. Include all the things you have in your lists. Personality traits, skills, experiences, personal goals, ALL the good things!


Step 5: Show off

Now that you have built a good foundation for your personal resume with lists of attributes, accomplishments, and goals, it would be a shame to keep how awesome you are all to yourself.  By this point how could you not begin to love all the things that make you who you are? (I mean geeze, you made a resume about yourself for goodness sake)
 Meet new people and have new experiences. Remember that skydiving Groupon?…. Go for it! Hell, maybe you will make some new friends in the process. Join a book club. Go to a zumba class. Throw a little get together/shindig . Call up an old friend you haven’t talk to in awhile. Go to a play or musical. Go to a nerdy convention (star trek anyone?!) Truth is, you won’t meet other cool people like yourself if you stay home all the time. Adventure is out there!


I know it is all easier said than done. Believe me when I say I know how hard it can be to think of just one good thing about yourself. It won’t happen overnight, or in a week, or in a month, or a year. It requires your everyday effort to find the good in yourself and retrain your brain to perceive yourself in a better light. 


Some days you will fall off the wagon and it is okay. It happens to the best of us. Just pick yourself up. Hell… drag yourself out of that giant mud puddle of negative thoughts and emotions. Take a shower and do some singing while you are in there. When you are having bad day pull out those lists and resume you spent time making and carry on.  It is a way of living not just a magic fix. It takes effort and time.  


tl:dr- 5 steps to help with break-ups and learning to love yourself. You either read it or you don’t. Hopefully this helps at least one person out there.

First of all - thank you guys for your input. You all helped me recognize that I had nothing to feel sorry about - nothing to blame myself for. I know without a single doubt that I gave this relationship my all and I didn't get the love I gave back.

I'm going to end it, tonight, after work. I know what I'm going to say. We live together, and her car gets me to work, and we share a lot of furniture, so I'm going to give her to the end of the month to get her shit packed and move out, and see if sharing transportation can work in the meantime. I think that's a fairly even deal. 

In my past relationships, I always had some form of guilt to deal with when things ended. I wasn't open enough, I was an asshole at one time or another, I did something wrong or said something that wasn't right to say, I didn't try hard enough. Guilt isn't an easy thing for me to deal with - I have a really hard time accepting the fact that I fucked up and it doesn't mean I'm a shit person. 

Anger, however, is a different story. I handle anger very well. I know that I did nothing wrong - that  she had ZERO reason to go looking for someone else. Especially not someone as disgusting in every conceivable way as him. When I was suspicious of something going on, and told her about it, rather than making me feel better, or coming clean, she made me feel like an asshole for being suspicious. Who does that?

I'm holding up better than I thought I would be at this point. I think the rage is keeping the tears at bay. There have been tears - just not quite as many as I'd expect. I know I was wronged, and this whole thing proved she's insecure, has serious self-worth issues, and needs time to figure herself out before she's right for anyone. She ruined what could have been a perfect relationship, because up until this happened, it was. My suspicions were the ONLY thing we ever fought about.

I know that once she's gone, and it really sinks in that it's over, it's going to hurt worse. A lot worse. She stole the future I had been planning from me. She threw my life into complete upheaval. While she has rich parents and her own car to take care of her needs, I'm carless with a 3-digit bank account and student loan debt, and I'm on my own. I make money, and I have a few ebay sales that could net me enough to buy a car - so I'll hope for the best.

At this point, I've gotten over the thoughts of trying to salvage things - I know that if I were to try, I would always be suspicious, I would always doubt anything she told me, it would be months before I could stand to touch her again, and in the end it would fall apart anyway. There really is no coming back from this for me. That energy is going to be spent getting my finances in order, rearranging my house, doing yoga (before you call me a fruitcake I'm recovering from a spinal injury I got in OCS a few years ago and it's the only exercise I'm allowed to do :P), and generally working through everything. I also just bought the Dark Souls DLC, so that should help.

Thank you guys again for helping me out. Any more words of encouragement, speculations about my story, or any input in general would still be appreciated. My support system isn't that big on this side of the monitor, so it helps to know that people who don't even know me sympathize and can offer some advice.

I have days where I feel like, I don't even care if she's seeing someone new, and I can even envision a future with another woman (no woman in particular, you know what I mean).

I see her semi-frequently, because we still share an apartment, but it won't be for much longer. There are times where, even when I see her, and talk to her, it's not so bad. I can really see the light at the end of the tunnel.

The dreams are what set me back. They're always different, but they always factually represent what level we're at. Last night, it was her coming home, and we were just talking small talk, and then she started crying, and ran to the bathroom. I followed her, asked her what was wrong, and she just started kissing me. It's always the same, emotionally. It starts with where we are at any given time, and it ends with me being self-assured that everything is resolved, everything will be okay.

Then I wake up, and I slowly start to realize that that didn't happen, that it'll never happen, and I'm back to that dark place.

Honestly, alcohol is the only way I can get any sleep at all. If I'm totally sober, I'll either lay awake, or fall asleep and wake up within 10 minutes because of a dream. So I'll drink until I'm tired, and fall asleep, and remain asleep for 2 or 3 hours until I sober up (I guess) and have one of those dreams.

It's odd, really. I haven't gotten more than 4 hours of sleep a night for the last three weeks, and I'm never tired. In fact, I'm less tired than I have been in a long time. This makes days agonizingly long, and it totally destroys my perception of time (I only know today is Wednesday because I've had to confirm about 20 times that it isn't Thursday).

The first two years were near-bliss. But we were young, immature and not yet ready to handle a relationship for the rest of our lives (or at least I wasn't). 

We worked on it on and off over the next 5 years, together for months/years at a time, then we'd take a break. We attended the same University together, and then when I went off to Law School, she went back to our home town and got a retail job. 

Our lives simply headed down different paths. We broke it off in the fall of 2010 and I started dating someone new, soon after she did too. My new relationship failed, hers did not. 

The truth is I'm very happy for her, the new guy is great, treats her well and I think a much better match than her and I ever were. I've known this day was coming for months and to be honest it hasn't bothered me up until now. 

She was the girl I wanted things to work out with. We were best friends, went through a lot of shit together and she really is an awesome person. We still text occasionally, but since we live in different cities we don't really see each other. 

There was the dream of the future we were supposed to share. The marriage, the kids, the house the family dog. camping in the summer, warming by the fire in the winter. She spent Christmas with my family and me with hers. 

I know I'm glossing over the bad memories, and focusing only on the good, but it's hard to see anything else right now. 

Next week I'll be on my way to fine, this is only because of the wedding tomorrow. 

She'll always have a place in my heart. 

So here's a toast, to all the women in our lives who made us who we are today, the ones we loved and lost. 

All the best on your marriage, you deserve it.

I Just wanted to offer some positive words to those of you who are hurting pretty bad right now. I know it feels like hell, [trust me](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/s4mac/perfect_recipe_for_anger_and_resentment/). 

It's been 3 months and occasionally that pain sneaks up on me like a thief in the night. 

What I want to tell you is that IT DOES GET BETTER. unfortunately, time truly is the best medicine. But there are definitely a few things you can start doing immediately that will help. 

1. Acceptance is the first and most important step. A little introspection is okay. But don't over think it. You're not going to fix it. You can't start to move on until you realize that you will have to let them go. 

2. Distract your mind. Take up a new hobby or learn something new. Every time that familiar feeling pops up, acknowledge it, don't dwell, then dismiss it. After a while it will be less frequent.  

3. Get healthy. If you have a drink, don't over do it. Get out and go for a long walk/run. It's amazing how clear your mind gets after a workout. 

4. I know you hate hearing this (I did) and it's been posted a bazillion times, but NO CONTACT works. Every single time I broke no contact, I felt like shit, and wanted to call her for days afterward. Once you get past the first few days, you'll realize that you've been getting along just fine without them. 

5. Some days will be harder than others. When things get tough, take solace in your friends and family. Don't try to go it alone. 

So that's all I've got for now, I know if you're like me, these words will seem like daggers to your broken heart. If you're not ready to face it, don't worry, time will get you there. Hang on and be strong, after all, you're not alone!

1340642019.0,20,self.BreakUps,vktl2,*UPDATE* 3 Months Later.,23,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/vktl2/update_3_months_later/,"I thought I'd give you guys an update with how I'm doing. If you want to find out about my story read my past posts.

**What I've Learned:**

**TIME**: This is honestly the only thing that will help you heal and eventually move on.

Yes is does help talking to people about your feelings, but as many advice as someone gives you at the end of the day you will do what you want, you will have to learn and go through this experience on your own. Vent if you need to and do it as many times as you want to... you will eventually get sick of talking about it lol. If you need to cry, cry it out. Talking does help.

**ACCEPTANCE**: I went through the cycle of the 5 stages of a breakup “Denial, Anger, Realization, Depression, and Acceptance"" many times. The hardest one was Acceptance, but after 3 months I have finally accept that it's over and him and I will no longer be. No matter what I do or say, it's ultimately up to him to make the move, you can't force anyone to love or be with you. 

Another thing that was hard for me to accept is that... sometimes things just aren't meant to be. As much of my heart and soul went into that relationship and as hard as I fought for it... him and I weren't meant to be. Deep down inside I knew no matter how hard I tried it wasn't going to work out. We didn't see things eye to eye... he was who he was and I am who I am... and we aren't meant to be together.

**REMEMBER**: For the longest time, I tried really hard to forget him... all I wanted to do was forget him. That didn't work for me... the more I tried to forget him, the more I remembered him. Don't try to forget your ex... try to embrace the memories of them... It is because of them that you are were you are now... a stronger, wiser person. I finally realized my worth after the relationship and now I have true standards. I know what I want and what I won't settle for... and that was because of him that I realized all this. I never thought I'd make it through this pain, but I made it and I am so much stronger now. I will never put up with being treated badly again because I just dealt with the worst and I'm not going to make the same mistake again.

Also remember that every relationship will have ""good times"", if they didn't we wouldn't be in one in the first place, so you will have more good times, but with someone else. Don't try to forget the memories you've made with your ex, in time you will replace them with better ones.

**HEART VS. HEAD**: Deep down inside we all know that we want to move on and be happy with someone who appreciates and loves us just as much as we love them. Logic says we should move on and they didn't deserve us, but our hearts is what's holding on to the memories and the feelings. Force yourself to think with your head more and eventually your heart will follow.

**OVERALL**: I am very blessed for this experience, I learned so much about myself and overcame one of the hardest thing you can experience in life... a heart break. I have talked and seen him a few times after the break up and it is hard because I still have feelings for him and it does take you back to step one, but each time it gets easier getting over it. I really do recommend **NO CONTACT after a breakup for at least a 6 WEEKS**. It's hard, but it really does help you. I promise you, it does get better... you will feel better... you will make it through this... I know how much pain you are in and I once felt that too... but you will gain something better from all this... everything does happen for a reason.

""This is difficult but it will be alright."")",22,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/sx11c/an_update_aka_this_is_difficult_but_it_will_be/,"Just deleted all the comments off my photos on Facebook. That was incredibly difficult. I've been doing alright, but I've still got about 500+ photos from things we did and places we went to get off of my computer and backed up somewhere. 

It was just really hard running across those comments from when we were good, all the little ""I love you""s and goofy shit we used to talk to each other. There were some comments from as little as a week before she cheated on me, and a week or two after that were just basically ""I love you beautiful"", and that was hard to read and delete. I don't want to forget how good she was to me when she was good, but I have to remember that she did cheat on me and it hurt me tremendously.

Otherwise, I've been holding out okay. Seeing lots of friends, making music again. She called this morning and left a voicemail, but I had my friend listen to it and it was about a concert her and I were supposed to go to this weekend. I guess she wanted to see if I still wanted to go (I don't and I'm not), but she was apparently condescending in her tone, so I didn't feel too upset about it. 

I want to move on more than anything else so I can be happy again, and be ready to give my heart to the right person when they come into my life. It's just difficult when you remember the good times and think about them not being there anymore. They're just memories now. 

An old lady at breakfast overheard me talking to my friends about what happened, and she pulled me aside and told me ""I'm sorry for eavesdropping, but you seem like a very level headed young man. What she did to you is one of the most painful things you can experience in life. I'm 73 years old and other than my husband passing away, that was one of the worst pains I've ever known was being cheated on. You've done the right thing by cutting her out of your life. You stay strong, and the right woman will come into your life, ready to give you her everything and make you her world. Someone like you is a rare thing nowadays, especially in a young person. God bless you and good luck with life from here on out.""

I mean, I couldn't help but choke back tears when she said that. I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just need to stay strong and keep pushing forward. I am a good person, I do have a lot to offer, and when the time is right, it will happen again. 

And I say the same to you guys. Your heart is going to drag you every which way, and you're going to have to be ready to fight it with logic and strength. You can't change the past, but use those good times as a reminder of what you want the future to bring you and stay strong because when you are good and ready, it will happen again. 

I have faith in all of you, and I hope my support helps, because none of us can just do this overnight. We need each other. I love you all, r/breakups. Thank you for being there.

I head to a nearby park and sit down. Feeling a little sorry for myself have a cry on the sly (oh, rhyming!) and this homeless man comes over and sits beside me.

Such kindness from someone who is worse off than me just makes me lose the plot a little bit and I sniffle that my boyfriend and I have just broken up.

Here's my story.",27,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/mp8oz/its_been_a_year_finally_able_to_get_divorced/,"It's just past midnight in Afghanistan, where I've been since the middle of the summer and will be through the winter. She left a year ago, come this Saturday. It's hard to believe that it's been a year. It's hard to believe that it was only a short two and a half years before that when we vowed to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what. But, there are a box of overexposed pictures in a storage box waiting for me when I return, to prove that and an thousand other lovely terrible things.

The affair was short, just a couple of weeks, and I didn't suspect anything until the very end. We had made vows, there was no reason to be suspicious, I can prove them with pictures. When she stayed out late for work or to have study groups I believed her. She was smart and hard working. I knew she had been down, life had been tough on her. My life, the one that brought her halfway across the country with me, had been tough on her. She was lonely and wanted to feel smart and hard working. She needed more praise than I gave her. We went to a formal dance, me in my uniform and her in a gown, but she was distant. It was the first time in a couple of weeks we had spent time together besides in sleep or in passing, she forgot to wear her rings. There were glossy formal pictures to prove how beautiful she was that night just a year ago last Monday, even light the weight of her rings and heavy with a secret, but I put them into the dumpster behind my office this last winter. There was also a picture I took of her with her phone that night, I still wonder if it went to him. 

Before bed that night I kissed her neck and she pulled away.

Her phone had become a busy companion, I didn't know yet that the nature of the buzzing was artillery fire into the small patch of earth we had cleared for ourselves and reinforced as best we knew how. I noticed though, that sometimes when it buzzed it would go ignored if I was too close, only to be checked when I had made some distance. I didn't want to be suspicious, we had taken vows. Forever. There were pictures.

Just a year ago last Wednesday I lay in bed not wanting to think about the things I was seeing. The texts, leaving early in the morning and coming in after I had gone to sleep, the rings, pulling away from tender moments. I woke her up to ask her what was wrong. I needed to hear that her depression was just worse than usual but she loved me just the same. When she told me she was thinking of leaving I was confused and heartbroken and pleading. That wasn't an option. There had been a white dress and family and friends and a honeymoon and promises made. The kind of promises you prove with too many pictures that you hang up to remind yourself how you were once handsome and show off how she's still beautiful.

We took separate cars to my dad's house for Thanksgiving. She wanted to get back home the same night so she could work the next day, and wanted some space from me to figure things out. I wanted her to figure things out, so I stayed two nights with my dad. Before she left, my dad and his wife talked to us. Told her not to give up. My dad said it looked like she was already gone and asked her point blank if there was someone else. He had been where she was, he knew this look. She lied.

 I was frantic. I could refresh our phone statement online and see the text messages continue. I called her, I needed to hear... something. I needed to hear the truth. She admitted that she spent a lot of time talking to a new friend. A friend who listened. I was afraid this wasn't the truth. I wanted to believe that there wasnt any one else, that she'd remember that I had been good to her and that I tried my best even when I didnt know what to do. I wasn't perfect, but I tried as hard as I could, even if my best attempt was sometimes feeble. There are pictures of vacations and road trips and kayaks and marathons deep in my computer that serve as my record of trying.

When I got back home, just one short year ago tomorrow, she pulled in right behind me in the warm noon sun. She said she'd slept in her car by the ocean and had a change of clothes in the back seat. I wanted to believe her. She napped, and I wondered what to do next. She woke up and went to work an hour early and I tried to keep myself busy. When I walked past the spare bathroom that she had claimed as her own, I noticed a line of new bra's and panties on the towel bar. There were pharmacy bags in the trash. When I looked more closely, as concerned as I was afraid and suspicious, I learned that she had just started taking birth control again. We hadnt discussed it.

I texted her and told her to leave work. That we needed to talk.

When I confronted her with my suspicions I saved the fact that I thought she was cheating until the end, I wanted to focus on the instability that had sent us both into depressions, the struggle over the last couple of years, and my own failings in trying to be a supportive husband. I wanted it to be about that. But I had to be honest. I told her I knew about all of the texts, the late nights and the early mornings, the underwear and the birth control and pulling away. I told her that I wanted to be wrong but that I didnt trust any more. I asked her to remember what she felt when she thought her first husband was cheating and I told her that I loved her and would do anything to keep her. I would do whatever I could to trust again. 

Just one short year from this Saturday night she told me that I had made her life miserable and she insisted that she wasnt cheating. She reminded me of the times that I had pulled away, and had given up the chance to spend time with her, and there were too many of these times. She said she was lonely in her life, that I wasnt affectionate, that I made her feel ugly. I tried to counter her with how much I loved holding her hand and how I never left home without kissing her goodbye. She packed two bags and left.

I didn't know it then, but she left our house for his.

It's been a long year. She didnt participate in counseling except to blame me for her unhappiness. She admitted to cheating in January, as well as living with him. She got pregnant in February, though she didnt admit that to me until April, three years to the day after we had stood in a park in Tulsa and posed for pictures in the bright sunlight. She had started wearing a claddagh ring to fill the space that my rings had once occupied. She hid it after she caught my eye it but it was too late. I had given her a claddagh ring once as well, the spring before we were engaged. She hadn't told him this, and he didnt have access to the photo albums to see for himself because they were in storage, where they sit to this day. They moved out of state, back to live with her mom soon after.

In April, those three years to the day from our shattered vows, she told me she was pregnant, and that she had discovered the lies he had told, some of which I awkwardly tipped her off to before she hung up on me a month prior. He had never been to college, let alone graduated. He had received a GED, rather than a High School diploma. He had never been a Baltimore Firefighter. His wife was never a Navy Corpsman. Most shockingly, he had two living daughters with his ex-wife, as opposed to the youngest perishing in a car accident as the story had originally been told. She had seen pictures, and the pictures proved everything. 

I expected him to leave. I expected her to kick him out. I expected her to ask if she could come back or if we could work on things now that she had hit bottom. I expected too much.

He never left. Maybe because he decided to be a good father this time. Maybe because he had trouble holding minimum wage jobs and being responsible enough to pay his own speeding tickets. Maybe because he didnt have a car of his own. I could ask him, he's still there.

She and I  talked nearly every day for 3 months after that tearful April call, first by texts and phone calls, then emails as she was worried he'd find out and make things worse for her, then emails and messages after I stepped off of American soil for the cold steel of a transport jet in the summer. I visited her for two days before I left. I put my hand on her belly and cried and told the baby stories about myself and her mom and the waiting world. I sent her things for the baby. Things I knew she couldn't afford for herself and things to prove that I could care about another man's child if she allowed me to care about her again. I missed her dearly. I saw hope, even though the knowledge she still slept beside him and told both of us she loved us pushed me deeper and deeper into despair. I knew I had to cut it off before my friends were put in a position to try to patch the lethal wounds I had began planning to inflict upon myself. 

I've mostly been successful in my attempts to treat her as though she died. It's easier for me to pretend that she died while I loved her than face the reality that she rejected my love. Reality will have to be faced eventually though.

I'm tempted sometimes to email him or call him and let slip a tirade of my best insults. Let him know what a worthless piece of shit he is for allowing another man's wife into his house and telling her about his made up past and poor dead daughter. 

I've hoped that the beautiful tiny little girl they now share would die just to make an honest man of him. Not often, but enough to secure my place as an evil person.

I've wanted to call her and demand to hear why. Why did it only take three weeks for her to leave after meeting him? What does she love about him more than me? What did she love about me more than him? Why didn't she ever ask to come back? All of my friends told me to prepare myself, that it was just a matter of time, but she never did. Why? Was there nothing worth coming back to? What does it feel like to be a parent? Does she think I'd have made a good father?

Now it's been a year, and we've fulfilled the state's 12 months of separation. It's gone fast, in the way that the weeks drag forever but the months tick by unnoticed. In 12 months I've been to 11 counseling sessions, started drinking, been on sleep medication, been in a vehicle that was blown up in an IED strike, and fantasized about my death at my own hands.

I'm terrified of the future, of never being able to say the words ""I"" and ""love"" and ""you"" together again. I worry about more counseling and my career and being happy when there are so many things to be sad about. I dread going through my storage and sorting out the things that don't pain me too much to be around. I'm often just sad, but I've had a good full life, I have the pictures to hold as proof of that.

I agree with this completely.

But it's hard.  Your head is probably thinking of a number of reasons that you should and need to get in contact.  Some thought that would change their mind, something that they absolutely need to know before you are finally able to let go.  That somehow by making this one effort you can finally get closure.

I can only say, think long and think hard.  Find your reasons for why YOU need to continue no contact.  What do YOU gain out of it?  Find these reasons and remember them.

I found my reasons and wrote about them [http://progressbarloading.blogspot.com/].  Maybe they'll help you.  Maybe you have reasons you'd like to share that will help me.

1372340615.0,20,self.BreakUps,1h6e95,Today marks 5 weeks NC for me and also my 25th Birthday. She sent me a text and now life sucks again.,23,3,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h6e95/today_marks_5_weeks_nc_for_me_and_also_my_25th/,"Hey everyone.

This post is sort of an update/vent/cry for help type post.

I've posted on here quite a few times in the last few months. A lot has happened with my breakup. I've gone through her losing all feelings of love for me and breaking my heart at the beginning of the year, to her sleeping with a guy really quickly, to her coming back and being confused as to what she really wants. It's all been hell.

After a while of seeing her again and me not being able to get past her being with someone else fast enough, she backtracked and said it's over for good, but she wants to still be my best friend. I said no and started NC.

Today marks 5 weeks into NC. I started it because I knew she still liked this guy she slept with. I saw it coming, her getting with him. So i wanted out. I couldn't be around her while she possibly fell in love with someone else, not when I felt so strongly about her still.

A few days after I started NC i saw his facebook change to 'in a relationship'. I knew deep down it meant he was with her now but I got it confirmed when a week or so later I saw she had made a new FB account and was only friends with him and she too was 'in a relationship'.

It hurt like a bitch.

Anyway. So I knew they were together and I know they still are now. Every single day I go around and around in circles in my head. Asking myself 'how can she move on so quickly?' and 'why would she do this to me?'. I know why though. The relationship crumbled and her feelings changed a lot sooner than mine. She had a head start.

It's been around 6 months now sinse the intitial breakup. And they've been together for about a month. Like, official, girlfriend and boyfriend. I feel like I should be way passed all of this by now but because so much has happened it still feels so fresh. I feel like I've had my heart broken twice by the same girl.

So today is my birthday. I'm a 25 year old boy and I woke up and lay in bed for a few hours missing her and thinking about her and her new boyfriend. How happy they must be together. I was dreading today so much. i knew i'd be waiting for it and eventually it happened. She sent me a text.

It was short and sweet. 

'Happy Birthday :) ... I know you might not want to hear it but i didn't know what the best thing to do was... but yeah, hope you're good and you have a good day xx'

I started crying immediately and ran to the bathroom so nobody would hear me. I miss her so fucking much. I know I shouldn't because we had our differences and our problems. it just still feels like a nightmare, like none of this should have happened. I thought we would be together forever and I still want that. Now this other guy is getting her love. He gets her hugs and kisses and smiles while I sit here missing her and being lonely.

I reached out to a good friend because I knew i'd end up texting her a huge message and ruining all my hard work keeping NC. He advised me to just send back 'Thanks x', so that's what I did.

Does this mean i'm back to square one with my NC? I doubt i'll get a reply from that and I don't intend to send another message. As much as I want to I know nothing has changed.

I guess i'm just looking for some motivation here guys. I know i'll get better and I know I need to work on myself. it's just so fucking lonely. I have friends and everything but, I just miss her so much that it feels like it physically hurts sometimes. I don't want this stupid phase to last this long. She could do it so why can't I?

I feel like my life is going nowhere. I hate my job, i'm back living with my parents like a little kid, i'm sat around doing nothing but being depressed and i'm missing work sometimes so it's possible I may get fired. I'm actually a little fucking scared of the future. What if it doesn't actually get better. I know i'll try my hardest once this horrible feeling passes, but, some people don't make it, or at least some people take years to get there. I don't want that. I want it now, or soon. I'm just so angry and depressed and unmotivated right now. I just can't see this getting better really. We broke up and she got all the good bits.

---

I also want to say thanks to you all. This subreddit has been the biggest help at some of my darkest times and the people who have helped me and given me advise and tough love need to know how much I appreciate it.

I just wish things turned out different.

I wish I didn't love her any more.

Thanks for reading.

I hope you're all doing okay too. As much as I hate what's happening to me and I feel like my situation is unbearable and unique. I know everyone here is going through similiar stuff. I feel for all of you and I hope you all feel better real soon. We all deserve happiness. That doesn't mean being with someone. It just means being happy in any way possible. Finding someone is just a bonus in life. If anyone needs someone to talk to i'm gonna be here so fire away.

1372288990.0,17,self.BreakUps,1h54fa,About the past and my break up. Hopefully an encouraging message,23,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h54fa/about_the_past_and_my_break_up_hopefully_an/,"TL;DR - This is a post about how to deal with the past. 

I posted this on my facebook, regarding on my break up without saying that it's about my break-up. These are the lessons I learned, I hope it helps you too. 

In the last 25 days I have had to take the crumbles of my self-esteem, my self-worth, perspectives on what I know of myself and build almost everything back up again. This was a time of self-discovery and a time of self-invention. This is a journey I took on myself. I reached out to a lot of people and the people that did reach back to me really helped me out. Besides those people, I really took a lot of time for myself, read a lot of books, read a lot of stories, watched a lot of movies to try to find out the truth and answer to all of this. Without giving away the details of the last 25 days, I wanted to share with you the lessons that I have learned because I think if it helps you in your time of need like it did mine, then it’s worth it. 

My main journey and one that I’m still working through is the notion of a past. What to do with the past, and how to deal with those emotions once you know that everything you used to know has changed. I stopped living in the present and my mind was concentrated on the past, this happened for a solid two weeks, trying to find out details and wonder if I could change those details, maybe it would be better. Then I found out that I wasn’t living in the present anymore, I was letting my past consume me. We want to live in the future as humans, but we tend to live into the past, repeating moments in the past and hoping for better endings, like an alternate ending in a movie. That’s what I was doing and I was doing this without the essence of prior knowledge and logic that I gained through my years and experience. I was in a state of denial, and lost myself in the process. 

But then something hit me in the middle of the month. The past is just that, a story, a movie. You can’t change the past, there’s no need to heal it, and it’s only a story. All you can do is let go of the story of who you are. All you can do is change yourself, you can’t change other people. You can only let go of the limited perspective of them. We don’t know truth, not real truth anyways. We only know it through our eyes, and we conduct that as truth. But something is always seen through different eyes, and that person thinks its truth a well even though it could be completely different. Not only that, they might get upset because your truth does not match theirs. So I can’t do anything about that, and it made me mad. 

I felt it was an injustice, I felt it was something that was out of my control and something that I was anxious to solve but I couldn’t solve it because I didn’t know the truth. The truth was out there, but I couldn’t reach it. So I created this injustice and became angry at this injustice, this illusion that I created. I realized it was an illusion of injustice though just because it was out of my control. I added that it was an injustice, out of fear and to cope through it. What do we do we when something is out of our control? We should just accept it, but we fight it. But, if there’s nothing you can do, then do nothing. Do nothing. Do nothing. Repeat that, because I had to, do nothing. So that’s what I did, I did the best I could do under the circumstances and I stopped worrying about it. 

Everything is a choice between fear and love, and I was letting fear get the best of me. I should’ve just chose love, and love meant peace. Once I saw that, I started to choose love and peace instead of fear. I let go of the character I invented of myself, even though it’s still scary. It’s scary to be outside of yourself. But I could do it. I could do that, or at least I have the knowledge to do so. It’s hard to change yourself and try to stop living in the moment, in the present. It’s hard, I know. You think of the what ifs, the could’ve, would’ve’s but that’s inessential. Death is coming, that’s all I know, so why live in fear. Especially fear of the past, fear of something you cannot control. Do nothing. Do all you can do, then do nothing. It was hard being patient, but patience comes with understanding. I needed that patience. 

**The past is a story, you cannot heal the past. You, dear reader, have to let go of your past, let go of your character you created out of fear. All you can do is change yourself. You look at that story and read it and go “Oh yeah, that was nice right there. Oooh that wasn’t so cool.” You learn from it, but don’t try to repeat and expect a different result. Let go. Let go of your past. Let go of your character you created out of fear. All you can do is change your perspective on other people and old events, and then move on with your life.** 

I’m proud to say that’s the plan. I’m proud to say that with grief comes peace. I am not mad anymore, I am not at pain. I am moving forward, and I’m moving on. I’m not letting my past, my failures, and my self-worth consume me. And I loved that I learned this and I learned it all myself. I’m happy to the people that supported me, it means a lot. I hold my head of gratitude for you all. But I’m happy that I went through this journey in my head by myself. I think it was an important journey that I never have had to go through. 

I hope, one day, it helps you as well. Thanks for reading all of this. It helps me too.

I (M 27) was in an emotionally abusive relationship. She (F 26) was perfect at the start at the relationship and once I was emotionally hooked (about 6 months in) the criticizing, guilt tripping, taunting, disrespecting, manipulating and tantrums began to surface. I tried to do everything I could to turn her into the person she was at the start of the relationship. I never gave up on her, even though doing so would have saved me from a lot of abuse. Eventually, she dumped me. The day after she dumped me she went on OKCupid and bought a paid account. I was devastated. I was so needy, I begged her to get back together (What was I thinking?). We did and the following two weeks were the most exhausting and self-esteem crushing weeks I have ever experienced. She dumped me again via email after a night of yelling insults at me on a date for being ""stupid"" enough to ""talk about our relationship in public"" (see ""Note 2"" at bottom of post for more detailed info regarding this particular night). 

The problem is that I was trying to get my emotional needs met from an abusive individual. I didn't have proper boundaries, and let myself be treated like a doormat to get whatever scraps of love she would send my way. I should have walked away.

I have been broken up with her for a month. She is terrible for me and intellectually I understand that. However, emotions trump intellect and I still yearn to contact her to get my emotional needs met (because of the illusion she created at the start of the relationship; that she could meet those needs). 

I often get the desire to send her messages or emails of various sorts: angry, sad, concilliatory, etc., because the emotional part of me is still not convinced that it will never get its needs met by her.

**The Advice:**

To curb the desire to contact your ex (which will inevitably descend upon you furiously and repeatedly after a breakup), I recommend the following:

When a strong desire occurs, you are most certainly obsessing about memories of your ex at the time and feeling strong emotions. Instead of acting on these strong emotions, pay attention to your breath to anchor yourself in the present moment. Don't try to control your breathing, just pay attention to it; the way it sounds and the way it feels on your nostrils and in your lungs. Continue to refocus on your breath when your mind inevitably drifts back to ideas of contacting your ex.

Focus on the breath and feel the emotions without acting on them. Eventually, the emotions will subside (for now). When the desires and emotions come back (and they will...for weeks or even months), repeat this exercise again. Repeat it until the desires and strong emotions fade away completely. 

Each time you successfully use this exercise to avoid contacting your ex, you can congratulate yourself for not continuing to fan the flames of a relationship that will only bring you great pain.

**TLDR - When you feel a strong desire to contact your ex, meditate until the desire subsides**

Note 1: If you are in an emotionally abusive relationship where your partner has treated you without love, respect or care. Don't make up excuses for your partner to justify him/her treating you that way. That kind of behaviour is never acceptable and should not be tolerated (protect yourself with boundaries!). Tell them if they don't change immediately, you're walking away (create a boundary). If they don't change immediately, walk away (enforce the boundary). Don't waste time trying to change someone or waiting for someone to change. They won't change and you'll feel even more used, exhausted and worthless. You'll think that if you just behave like the perfect boyfriend/girlfriend you'll get the old them back; the one that was sweet, kind and loving. It won't happen - That's not who they really are. Also, don't blame yourself; the abuse is not your fault. Some people abuse others and some don't; it's out of your control. The one thing that is in your control is whether or not you're going to accept the abuse. **Always remember, it's better to be lonely and have high self esteem than to be in a relationship and have none.** Healthy relationships should add to your self-esteem, not decrease it.

I should add that www.baggagereclaim.co.uk has been an invaluable resource for me in getting over my breakup. It's tailored toward women, but the advice is universal. Also, they have podcasts and videos for those days when I am too depressed to read a word and just want to lie in bed...

Note 2: We were having drinks on the patio of a bar and I asked her if she deactivated her OKCupid profile and asked her why she wasn't being affectionate. First, she lied and said she had deactivated her profile. I knew it was still up and that she was logging on daily. Second, she went berzerk and stormed out down the sidewalk. Classic manipulative behaviour and it worked. Rather than having a mature discussion about how her lack of affection was upsetting me, she used anger/intimidation to avoid the subject, put me on the defensive, and changed the focus to my stupidity for daring to bring up the relationship over drinks at a bar. The manipulation worked. I apologized profusely and thereby implicitly agreed with her warped opinion that I was stupid. Amazing how quick manipulation can happen and how one can fall prey to it.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1370877978.0,,,True,t3_1ft3oz,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ft3oz/tempted_to_contact_your_ex_do_this_instead/,

It sucks doesn’t it? You’re emotions are on one of the worst rollercoasters you’ve ever been on? You feel like you are the only one to truly be hurting? No one has ever felt this pain that you are feeling? You’ve been in bed crying for three days and don’t want to even talk about it?

I’m here to tell you that it gets better..

You see my fiancé of 7 years and I broke up last week. We tried EVERYTHING we could to save it, counseling, date nights, acting “as if we were in love”, nothing seemed to fix a relationship that quite frankly just…”ran its course”. It happens, sure you’ve had a great run, but have you really? I will go more in-depth what I mean by this here in a moment. I want you to know that ALL the emotions that you are feeling are not abnormal, everything is completely normal and we all feel them.

I’m going to go step by step as much as I can to help you begin your healing process....


**The Failing Relationship**

Do you find yourselves falling farther and farther away from each other? You guys aren’t communicating anymore are you? There’s no intimacy, and you cant remember the last time you’ve hugged, held the persons hand, or let alone gotten a kiss right? These are all signs that something is up in your relationship, I’m not saying that someone is cheating I’m just saying that something is off. When I stopped hearing an “I love you” occasionally is when I started to get nervous about where our relationship stopped. Sure we didn’t say it a lot to each other but we still said it, and when we did it meant something more since it wasn’t over used in our relationship. 

When the warning signs are there you can do a few different things. Every couple is different and will go through a different process than the next, but the most important thing to do is try and fix what you can before it’s too late to fix. So explore your options that you have around you before you decide to end this relationship. Seven years (like my relationship) had a lot more in it than a relationship of seven days, weeks, or months would have so play your cards accordingly. 

Can you work this out on your own? Has this worked for you in the past? Have you guys sat down, talked about it, the other changes for a few weeks and before you know it…BOOM! You’re arguing about the same stuff again. This is something that happens in EVERY relationship, not just yours. Some talk it out and are great forever, others are only good for a week or two. If you decide to go this route really think about if you are getting what you want out of it.

Have you ever considered going to a counselor? Someone who can look at your relationship as a whole from the outside and see if this is something can be fixed. This is the route I took and it helped me with realizing that she just wasn’t into the relationship the same way I was, and made the breakup a lot easier for the two of us.

What about the breakup? Sure it’s a tough decision to make, but if you guys aren’t happy then end it before you end up hating each other for the rest of your lives. Like they always used to say to us “If you love something set it free, if it comes back it was meant to be; if it doesn’t; it wasn’t”. Don’t wait to go down this road until after you guys truly start to hate each other, go down it sooner than later. 

**The Breakup**

This section is the hardest one to cover. People go through all different types of breakups. Regardless of your type of breakup eventually you will feel all kinds of emotions, some good, some bad, and for the most part you will be VERY sad. But something you need to realize is that you will get over whatever emotion you are feeling. Today marks day 8 since I said my very last “goodbye” to (in my opinion) the greatest girl in the world. Last week I would have told you I will NEVER get over this intense feeling of sadness that I am feeling, but here I am 8 days later telling you it does get better. 

The main things you need to keep focus on in this portion is that you make it a clean breakup and NO CONTACT ! If you do that it will make the healing process go a lot more smoothly. One of the things that suck so bad is that when I was sad, mad, or felt any other kind of emotion I would talk to her about it, and now I can’t because she’s the one who I am hurting over. But please don’t lose your cool no matter what….DO NOT LOSE YOUR COOL!

**Post Breakup**

You did it! You broke up with the “love of your life”.... How are you feeling? Sad, depressed, angry, stress? Those are all very normal feelings after a breakup, that’s what makes them suck SO BADLY! I had a 4 day “pitty party” for myself, I didn’t eat, I only drank water, and laid in bed all freaking day. That’s all I wanted to do, I mean how could anyone function after losing the greatest thing in their life? How can someone go outside without their other half? How can I face big decisions without talking to THEM first? Guess what? You **CAN** do it! **You can do it, and you will do it!** But please take time for yourself first. Don’t breakup and then two days later go “ok I’m good, lets go out and find a new partner”. You are repressing normal human emotions by doing something like that and eventually you will regret it.

You have to take time to grieve and then go about your normal every day life. You’ll have to grocery shop; FOR ONE....You’ll have to pay the bills; ALONE....You’ll cook dinner; FOR ONLY YOURSELF....You’ll go to bed every night; ALONE....It’s a rough transition to go from thinking about another person to only thinking about yourself. My other half LOVED coffee, the smell of it throughout the house would signify the start of her morning.  Imagine what it was like going down the juice aisle at the store and smelling the coffee from behind you. The same smell that would let you know she was up, ready, and waiting for her “morning kiss”, or her “have a great day”, imagine what that was like smelling the smell of coffee for the first time post-breakup. There will be the little triggers that will make you think of that person, and that’s ok.That’s a memory that will always be with you no matter what and that’s something no one will take or can take away from you.

Please have a support system in place as well. Whether it’d be family, friends, a neighbor, someone from church, anyone you can just unload your feelings onto and they will just listen, that's what makes a great support system. My greatest crutch has been an old friend I haven’t seen since High School but we’ve maintained a “Facebook Friendship”, she’s been the best one out of my family and closest friends so far. Because she doesn’t bring it up, we’ll talk about other things and then I’ll just casually talk about it and she’ll make some comments or remarks and we’ll move on from the discussion. Just make sure you have someone to talk too, feel free to contact me if you’d like, I’d be more than happy to just listen to you and hear you through.

**Moving On**

Think back on your entire relationship……….. What did you sacrifice for that person because he or she didn’t like it? Really dig deep and think about it, hard. Because you will realize that you made a lot of sacrifices to make someone else happy, while ignoring what made YOU happy. Sure at the time you don’t mind making those sacrifices because that person truly matters to you more that you matter to yourself, right?

You need to be able to LOVE YOU before you can love another. This one hit me in the middle of the night, out of the blue. I was sitting in bed thinking about my former girlfriend (I don’t refer to her as my “ex”) and I remember going “Wow, you haven’t been happy for a really long time”. It’s true, I’ve been so miserable for the past year and a half deep inside of me that I was no longer the old me, I had become someone I wasn’t. Then it got me to thinking, it was because I was forming to what “SHE” wanted me to be, I was doing things that made HER happy and not doing things that made ME happy. In order to truly be happy with your life you need to be happy with yourself, and to achieve that you also have to be in love with yourself as well.

Breakups suck! Plain and simple, you will think that you are alone in feeling what you are feeling but you aren’t we were their once too, I’m still there. But you have to make sure that you allow yourself to heal properly before moving on and being happy again. I’ve started doing that and the other day I had to go over to the former girlfriends house for something and when I was talking to her I felt as if I was talking to a really good friend. This was only 5 days post-breakup and I was already starting to move on and heal. Why? Because of a great support system that I had in place to help me move on quickly from the breakup. Now, don’t get me wrong I’m still sad! But this process has hills, and it has valleys…Right now I’m in a valley at the base of a hill, I need to tell myself “It’s time to climb that hill” and when I do, I will have people to lean on to help me get over the hill.


Remember to love yourself…THAT’S the MOST IMPORTANT part of the healing process!

We were in a long distance relationship but I had plans to move back home after college.  I was upset over the breakup as anyone might be but I knew that we were both good people just going our separate ways trying to discover ourselves.

Her birthday was yesterday and so I wished her a happy birthday only to receive a text from my friend, shortly thereafter, that according to Facebook she got in a relationship in mid April.  My friend sent me a picture and turns out the guy is a name I recognized from her Snapchat and texting all the way back around New Years.

I was going to send her the following but I decided that she is not worth my breath, but it is still nice to vent:

&gt; I pity you and your cowardice. 

&gt; To end a long term relationship is something I can accept but to lie when asked if there was another person in the picture and then be in a relationship only a month later, that's distasteful and wrong.  

&gt; I can't believe how fake you were, leading me to believe you wanted to try and be friends. 

&gt; I thought during our time you grew as a person but you're still the same insecure girl looking for approval from guys and scared to be an independent individual.  

&gt; My only regret is second guessing myself when the problem was you.

The pessimistic side of me is pissed I wasted so much time with someone that's so heartless and the optimistic side of me is glad this all came about now instead of down the road when I could've potentially moved in with her.

Let it be noted that I ended all communication with her at the end of March with the exception that I wished her a Happy Easter and a Happy Birthday.  Given the events that took place I don't think I will ever speak to her again.

**TL;DR: Long term relationship came to an end after 3.5 years.

We were together for over 7 years and lived together. One day, I'm looking at engagement rings, the next day I'm on the phone with her while I'm out of town and she breaks up with me. It gets even worse.

It's probably been the lowest point in my life - ups and downs. I've had no closure and I will probably never get any. 

MUSIC has been my savior. Whenever I feel emptiness or my house is too quiet, I put some good jams on. 

I've always enjoyed Florence but it wasn't until today that I really heard these lyrics. Enjoy.

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play

And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues strong
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around

Our love is pastured such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues strong
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out, 
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out,
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

'Cause I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues strong
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out, 
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out,
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

I tried to dance with the devil on your back 
And given half the chance would I take any of it back
It's a final mess but it's left me so empty
It's always darkest before the dawn
(Oh whoa, oh whoa)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my road
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark and right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Looking for heaven, for the devil in me
Well what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me

Shake it out, shake it out,

Shake it out, shake it out,
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

Today I was hit with the possibility that my ex would be returning to his ex. (One before me) And whilst it hurt somewhat, it actually wasn't that bad which is something. The three month grace period is now up so I am faced with the fact he and possibly I will be moving on soon. Which is the next hurdle after the initial breakup. But I'm ready for it. It is interesting to look at previous posts, my mindset, my fears, everything. But I can say I am almost halfway over it. 
So it's just an update, it does get better honestly, only if you let it. Things I have learned. 


You can't force being happy constantly and you can't force yourself to get over it quickly, so take some time to cry, listen to sad music. Get it out of your system and don't continually wallow in sadness.  


Recognize when you're ready to date, not just dating or romanticizing the idea of someone because you don't like being single.


Being single isn't the worst thing in the world it really isn't, when you look at the bigger picture, it's a small fraction of your life, not your everything. Embrace it, and don't live life always thinking there's a big gap that can only be filled with someone else. 


Friends are the most important thing right now, don't push them away, be social even if you feel like crap, it will have a big pay off. 


Now is an awesome time to start working on your self esteem and generally becoming a better person as a whole. Don't do it for your ex, do it for you. You have nothing to prove to anyone but yourself. You will feel better as a whole when you realize you've come out of this a better person (Especially if you're the dumpee)

I opened up to you like I've never opened up to anyone before. I was more comfortable with you than anyone else. We talked about a future, about forever. I went out of my way to hang out with you and your friends and get to know them. I always made an effort for you. It was always me that was the first to apologize, the first to find ways to fix our relationship, the one who gave 110%. 

But when I think about it, you never made a real effort to get to know my friends. You begrudgingly hung out with them, and even when you did you would be on your phone constantly or remained completely quiet. You didn't make any kind of effort to engage. And then you would blame it on the fact that you're an introvert. You were happiest when we were doing what you wanted, hanging out with your friends... but when it came to doing what I wanted to do, exploring my interests, you grew easily tired. 

I thought that maybe it was me putting too much pressure on you, that maybe my expectations were too high. That I should be understanding because you're an introvert. 

Whenever we fought, I was always the one fighting for us, reminding you about all of the good things that you seemed so incapable of remembering on your own.  After we made up, you would always genuinely thank me for fighting so hard for us, and you would always be so grateful that I didn't let us go. 

But it was all bullshit. In the end it was all selfishness. You could have tried harder, you could have made an effort, you could have been more understanding and patient. I'm tired of making excuses for you and giving you the benefit of the doubt when you've done nothing to deserve it. I was CONSTANTLY having to try so hard for the both of us, because you couldn't be bothered to give your equal weight of effort. I used to think it was because you were incapable of doing so, but I now understand that it's because you straight up didn't want to. 

And even now, I am stuck here expending all of this energy just to BREATHE, just to feel normal, just to prevent myself from falling into a dark hole. My thoughts are still consumed by you and everything that I might have done wrong. You took and took throughout our whole relationship and even in your absence you are STILL taking life from me. I'm SO FUCKING SICK of you taking things from me, my happiness and my time and my energy and my LIFE. 

And the worst, the ABSOLUTE worst part, is that you made me feel like I was too needy, too dependent, too emotional. You made me feel that way even though I was carrying all the weight and the stress of the relationship.

But you know what, it's not me that's lacking. It's you. **You're the weak one.** You're the one that isn't capable of the immense amount of loyalty, love, patience and emotional maturity that I am. I am not weak for loving, you are weak for not being able to love back. And for that you don't get my sympathy, you get my pity.

We get along great, and I can't think of any other person I would rather hang out with than her.  We even had discussed the timeframe for our engagement, and she told me when she wanted to be proposed to.  I understand we are young, but I've been in many long relationships and this one was different.  When we broke up I almost drove my Harley into oncoming traffic (I know, stupid).  So she sends me the text, ""We really need to talk"".  I call her, and she says she is going to take off our relationship status from Facebook because she needs to move on.  I'm devastated.  I can't move, breathe, or feel my body.  A brick moves from my stomach and lodges into my throat.  How could somebody who I had spent the last two years with break up with me so non-chalantly over a phone call? I was mortified.  I had just landed a job with a great company with her in mind.  I was going to propose at the end of the year, with the ring that she picked out. 


After spending days not eating and leaving work early, I gave her a call.  I had noticed that she had been all over this other guy's social media.  I know I should have deleted her, but I can't take that back now. I asked her to be honest about this guy and she said, ""Honestly, he is the first guy I've been attracted to other than you in two years"".  That broke my whole world apart.  I go to Arizona State University, where heart break happens 10 times between every class, and she is attracted to tank-top wearing, New Era cap fitting, baggy pants sagging douchebag who thinks he's a rapper and works at Safeway.  The icing on the cake? They went on a hike/date the week we broke up. I cannot even imagine dating a girl right now, it makes me sick. So we're on the phone and she says she doesn't want to be married at 21 and she wants to live her life single and the her new boy friends caught her interest like she hadn't felt in 2 years.  **She said she had been meaning to break up with me for 6 months** .

I had never met anyone like him before. In the past I have dated many different guys, and have had flings with many different guys. You learn a lot about personality types and who you ""gel"" with, and what works for you.

With ""Tim"" I felt like we just had an incredible amount in common...I felt secure with him, and warm when we were together.

Then one day, in early July 2012, it was all over, and I still do not have a clear answer from him as to why. ""I'm just over it"" was his response.

I couldn't believe that's all he had to say. That's it.

I look back and now I think, ""You know what? There doesn't NEED to be anymore than that in his answer. Besides it was only 6 months""

I realized about a month and half ago (beginning of January 2013) that my mind was just sick and exhausted of trying to come up with a way to win him back, or to figure out what I did wrong.

You may never get answers, but the first step to realizing you are getting over someone is that you just cannot rationalize wasting any more time being sad and nostalgic over what you lost.

That's it. That's what I found. I just felt my mind had absolutely exhausted any means possible to think about ""Tim"" in any more ways than I already had, and those thoughts became like dried weeds I just wanted to clear away.

And you know what? There is someone new now, ""James"". He is not ""Tim"" and he never will be, but there are aspects of James that Tim could never be. You cannot compare them.

In that time, I suffered repeatedly from insomnia, considered suicide, hit rock bottom, began to recover, reached out to my family, and successfully maintained no contact for a month. In that time, I tried to date again and it didn't work out, but I ultimately made a great new friend out of it.

She didn't seem too pleased to see me, nor did she seem very interested in catching up. It felt like she hadn't changed much at all, which I honestly found disappointing - I still genuinely hoped that she would meet people who would make her want to better herself and I still genuinely hoped she would have a good life. Our exchange was brief. 

And I know I was taking a chance going up to her. It's not been all that long but I guess I wanted to test myself - and I mostly passed. Looking at her face again didn't fill me with an aching loneliness. I didn't have to fight the urge to throw myself at her knees and beg her to take me back. While standing next to her, I briefly recalled us having sex and while I still haven't found anyone whose company in bed I've enjoyed nearly as much, I trusted that I someday would. 

I took the test and I passed and here I am, hours later, with only a dull sensation in my chest to remind me that the girl I gave over a year of my life to still exists.

Some background, I come from an abusive, broken home. I used to watch my Dad beat my Mom and he used to hit me too. I was sexually molested by a family friend and basically had a shitty enough childhood. Lots of anger and yelling all the time is what I remember the majority of it to be. I have a terrible temper and have known this for a long time now. I am an only child, I lost a sister at the age of 4, she was 11 months when she died. My girlfriend comes from a solid family with an older brother and sister, her parents have been together for a long time and are happy. She never experienced any of the sort of trauma I did as a youth. I am 35 and she is 24.

My girlfriend and I recently celebrated our first year anniversary and have been going through some tough times lately. We have had a lot of fights in our first year. Mostly caused by me being drunk and like a complete moron. I have been physically aggressive with her before, grabbing her by the arm and once pulling her down a set of small steps by She got pregnant before Christmas. It wasn't a surprise, we had discussed having kids and we were having full unprotected sex. So when she told me I was ecstatic with happiness but I made it clear that whatever her decision was in regards to keeping it or not, I would support her. She wanted to keep it in her heart I know this, but she talked to friends and got freaked out and decided to have an abortion. Then she told her parents and they wanted her to keep it because they do not support abortion. So then she went back to thinking about keeping it. It was a few days of to and fro and I could sense she was really scared. We had been drinking a lot during the early days of her pregnancy as it was holiday season. She had also been smoking. So she starts to worry about the baby's health. She decides she can't keep it and we book the appointment in the clinic. She then tells her family she is getting an abortion. She does this via text message to her Mother.
Her Mom completely broke down and begged her not to but my girlfriend was strong and we went ahead and she had the abortion. I was devastated inside because I wanted to keep it but I was trying to be strong for her. I talked to her Mom and Dad about the decision and whatever way the conversation went it came out sounding like I pushed her to get an abortion. So I became demonized. The whole family basically hated me, Dad, Mom, Brother and Sister. Her parents take a holiday to get away from it all. She asked me to come over to their house one night and her brother threw me out and threatened to beat the shit out of me. It turns out Mom had barred me from the house before she went away but neither me nor my girlfriend were aware of this. She almost had a breakdown and we both went home to my house that night. She was angry at her brother because he was being abusive and threatening and she was angry at her Sister for sticking up for him when he was threatening me. The pressure was immense. At the same time we were both doing okay in our relationship. We were very very close with each other and I felt that I had found the love of my life and I know she felt the same way. I made plans to get counseling for my anger problem.

So after a couple of weeks everything was still fine and so yesterday we were texting all day sending so many nice flirty sexy messages and talking about her moving in. Everything was great. She told me she wanted to marry me all the time and we loved each other so much, I thought. So yesterday after work I send her a message asking what time her train arrives at. My plan was to have a couple beers with my friend after work to celebrate a special occasion he had. She wrote back a half hour later saying ""On bus"". So i figured to finish up my drink and head on. Half hour later I get another text saying ""Going for a drink first"" and a bunch of drink emoticons so I thought she was happy to do that and I sent a message back saying ""Ok love xoxoxo"" then she asks if I am hanging out after work and I said ""Yeah having a celebratory drink with my friend"" and she replies ""Yeah thought so"" so now I know she is annoyed and I text her asking whats wrong, it takes about 5 texts and she writes back an hour and half later saying ""I knew what you were doing all along, the reason you text me about the train was so you could hang out with your friends"" and some other stuff basically to the effect of: I picked drinking with friends over her.

So at this point I have had a few beers and I'm in trouble with the girlfriend so I knock back another one or two and at this point I am now pretty drunk as I was drinking fast. I go home and she shows up and starts going off on me. She is really angry and yelling at me and I can't remember but I think she said ""Fuck this, I'm going home"" or maybe she broke up with me I'm not sure but I lost it at this point. After the day we had os all the nice messages and then her to be angry at me now combined with all the other pent up emotions, I just exploded. I pushed her on to the ground and kicked her in her legs a few times. I grabbed her hand and bit it really hard and then bit her on top of her head. I completely lost all control and was consumed with emotions. I felt like I was losing my mind. She looked up at me in terror and I stopped. She got up and told me we were finished and she never wanted to see me again. She punched me in the face and broke my glasses. We threw some dishes and things and I just completely crumbled. She wanted to leave but I was preventing her. I smashed her phone on the ground and pulled her bags off of her. I stopped preventing her from leaving and she opened the door and walked out. I followed her out in the street and tried to talk to her. It was useless of course. She went home.

Her parents are on holiday right now so it was only her brother who was there. I called the house and she answered and told me to fuck off basically. So I wake up this morning and have to go to work. Her Sister calls and says they will be contacting the police etc. I am now sitting in my house surrounded by her things which I have to pack up so her Sister can come collect them. I have been talking to the Samaritans because I have no one else. My Mother passed away 4 years ago and I have no contact with my Dad. My family structure is basically broken.

I am a good person. I am not violent normally. Anyone I know would tell you ""Hey that guys is a really good guy, he has a good heart."" This is why my girlfriend loved me, she had a lot of guys previously but never went out with any of them bar two of them. She chose me because I'm a good person. Yet... I feel like a monster. What I did was MONSTROUS. I hate myself right and can barely stand to be alive. I have a problem with alcohol and anger management. I know this much but I don't know where to go for help. I have just ruined the best thing thats ever happened to me in my life. This girl is SUCH a good person. She is literally an angel to me. She does not have a bad or mean bone in her body and look what I did to her. I can't believe it I don't know to deal with it.

My own story:

Girlfriend and I since 3 years breaks up, she made it seem like I was a douche and that she was the only one of us who was in love. Within a month she had sex with a guy on a big festival, they later on got together and they are today a couple.

This was about a year ago, I gained ~15 kilos because I started doing alot of drugs to forget the sadness which wasn't good at all. I used Bensodiazepines together with alcohol, Cocaine on parties, alot of morphine pills and alot of Weed. I think this was a way to in some way show her that I was so depressed that nothing really mattered if I couldn't have her.

I never looked at another girl, never felt any attraction to anyone, all I did for about 9 months was getting high on my own and just sitting in my room, mourning.

I tried to take a hold of myself and decided to spend my New Years Eve with my parents and go to bed early to wake up healthy with a fresh start on the New Year.

I didn't make any NY resolutions because they puts to much pressure to you and you get tired of following them.

After NY I started feeling alot better, no drugs (except Cannabis sometimes), no more sugar and unhealthy food, more exercise and I actually started reading alot of interesting books.

Right on the 1st January I started feeling better about this breakup for the first time in almost a year, I don't know what changed but I've never been this happy and confident ever and I'm actually really happy today!

You don't know how to fill it or what to do with it, but you will learn. You'll adapt (slowly) and get used to this by redirecting your attention onto everything else.

It's like going to the gym. The first time you go, the next day you are so fucking sore, getting out of bed is excruciating. But once you get into the routine, and get into shape, the gym just makes you feel awesome. But even when you're exercising for the first time, you'll think, ""this isn't what I normally do, should I be doing this?"" That's normal. It's not natural to you, but it doesn't mean that's a bad thing! By the tenth time you go to the gym, you'll focused, determined to hit that new number, and have no sensation whatsoever of the awkward ""why is this a thing....""

So just give it time, go play the new Black Ops, try that hobbie you've always been meaning to get to. Hang out with old friends a lot more, if they're truly friends, they'll be there for you and motivate you to get out of your dreadful funk.

It's been months for me, and it still lingers, but holy cow does moving on through pursuing your own interests make you feel great. I started Djing and producing music again, hanging out with friends that I'd lost time to, took up cigar smoking (she hated that so I rarely did it, r/cigars shameless plug, they're great though).

Seriously dude, go game online, laugh, drink with friends, try new things and just live because now way is life over for you. You've gotten a kick to your self-conscience but if you can put your best clothes on and smile when you talk to somebody, you'll feel great, look even better, and will eventually re-learn life with her, because it was meant to be, and that's how it's going to be.

You will feel alone and deprived at first, but throw down whatever makes you smile, and to start out, there will be that moment of complete [nirvana](https://www.google.ca/search?q=nirvana+definition&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enCA502CA502&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=nirvana+def&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j57j0l2j62l2.3140&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=2&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) that will soon begin to fill more and more of your day.

I got drunk and decided to say hello and wish her a happy thanksgiving. And she was barely willing to carry on a conversation. She was distant, there was no effort, and she only answered my questions, not really providing any way for the talk to continue.

1. Accept that it is over. Seems simple enough?, it's not. This is the hardest and most important step. Cry, cry and cry some more because you can't even begin to heal until you've completed this step.

2. No contact. This advice feels a lot like telling a child not to touch a hot stove. It's so inviting, and only the pain will teach you. No if's, no buts, just do it. Every time you break this rule (willingly) you start back at square one. Don't believe me? See how you feel after you reach out to them...Yeah, it hurts. 

3. Get fit. Eat healthy. Drink less. A healthy body will translate to a healthy mind. How you look and feel about yourself is paramount. If you feel attractive, you will be attractive. 

4. Get a new hobby. Study a language. Start Rock climbing.  Join a book club. Challenging yourself to learn something new will distract you from your usual thoughts. 

5. Don't be alone for the first month. Surround yourself will good friends and family. Keep the conversation focused on positives. Do not hang around with people who will nurture your desire to dwell on the breakup.

6. After the first month, spend some time alone. Go to a coffee shop or a farmers market and just hang out by yourself. Start conversations with complete strangers. Relearn how to exist outside of a relationship and be comfortable in your independence. 

7. If it feels like its not working...Don't rush things, and don't worry! Time is the ultimate healer and everything is going to be okay. People fall in and out of love everyday. The fact that you had it once means you have the capacity to love. If you keep an open heart and mind, you will be happy again soon. I promise. 


**disclaimer** there isn't a quick fix, anyone who tells you ""the quickest way to get over someone is to get under someone"" is giving you bad advice. Stay the course, do the things and your recovery will be swift.

And always remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea!

I'm so sad, disappointed and hurt that he couldn't work through his own shit and it resulted in our break up. I'm mourning the incredible loss of not only our relationship but the future we had planned and looked forward to. I wanted to marry him and have kids...We talked about our future like it would become reality because we both wanted it. We were excited about it. I'm going to miss him so much. His keen wit, sharp intellect and dry sense of humor. I will miss his inquisitiveness and laughter. The light in his eyes when he looked at me.

I won't miss his moodiness, depression and lack of communication. I'm relieved to not have to walk on eggshells and constantly wonder if he's okay...I'm so relieved to not have to deal with his stoner friends. I'm free from having to wonder if today will be a good day or why life isn't good enough on its own without having to abuse substances. I'm happy that I no longer have to place myself second to an unhealthy person with an addiction. I no longer have to reconcile how the future I want isn't possible with the current circumstances.

Looking back it was a very unhealthy relationship in many ways. Don't get me wrong, it was amazing in many ways too but it was emotionally exhausting and torturous.  I invested everything into a man with a troubled soul who wasn't willing to do the work to get better. He found way's to manipulate, control and degrade me without even realizing it. He found so many ways to blame me or his unhappiness in the relationship versus looking in the mirror at himself. He gave me ultimatums, outlining what he was willing to give. And, I took it. I always did. I took him back countless times after he would leave me sometimes for days. I always welcomed him with open arms, loving him immediately without reservation. I held out hope for so long that things would work. And, they just didn't. In the last month the stress and anxiety of living with an addict has taken its toll. I have been depressed, riddled with anxiety and devastation at my inability to conjure hope. It's been heartbreaking.

I want and deserve to be happy. I know I can be, on my own. I deserve to have a partner who is healthy, present and emotionally supportive. Someone who will love me just the way I am and as much as I love them. I always loved him more. I always came second to his self destructive vices.

I'm trudging the road to happiness. I'm processing and feeling all of this without self medicating. I have reached out to loved ones and friends candidly, humbly and wholeheartedly grieving this loss. It is truly painful. I have never loved someone this much. The loss will be felt for some time.

I know now that I cannot be in a relationship with someone with an addiction or mental illness they are not seeking treatment for. It's a deal breaker and non-starter. Period. I am done playing second fiddle to bullshit. I have had enough.

The holidays are approaching. I have made plans literally for every day for the next week. I am leaning on essential support from those that love me. And, it feels good to feel loved by others despite the pain. It will get better. One day at a time. I deserve and will be happy.

As my first post to reddit, I just want to say that love is one of those things that really can bring you up or down. Ultimately, it's up to you to really find the next step in your life that will help you be happy again.

Short story - broken up by live-in girlfriend, she's moving out and leaving behind an apartment for me full of memories. At first, it feels like deep sadness, then some confusion, hope, sadness, happiness, and then sadness again. 

Remember that the high road is always the best road. Especially if you truly love that person or did, I feel that doing anything passive-aggressive or out of hatred/anger/sadness only leads to a darker path for yourself.

I'm still in the process as we speak, give the other space, and find something that will make you remember what you are like happy again. It's really important to look out for yourself first (speaking of someone who just lost about 8 lbs in 1 week, not sleeping much, and finding random places to stay).

I promise you that once you realize that it's over and just get over it, everything else just falls back into place again. It's ok to be sad and cry it out - get all of the hurt/anger/pain out, and then realize that life continues on and be happy again.

1346726116.0,19,self.BreakUps,zbcom,This One Is For You /r/BreakUps: My Broken Hearted Manifesto,24,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zbcom/this_one_is_for_you_rbreakups_my_broken_hearted/,"The following will be somewhat vague and brief. As I tend too ramble.

A young woman captured my heart and as she fell for me I fell for her.

It took 3 weeks of her eyes, and of her lips, and her voice for me to discover I was in love with her.

I was intrigued by her life. She was from a broken home. With a broken family. The only strong member of a family consisting of a sex and drug addicted mother, a drug addicted brother, no father, a run away sister, and a little brother, to young to know how unlucky he was, but just old enough to feel sad about it and not know why.

I won her over with my charm and my storied past. I too coming from a place I'd rather not remember, as they are dark, and lonely times. Smart enough to impress her, but soft enough too never make her feel dumb. I picked her up from a broken series of poor decisions, I showed her who she was, who she could be, and what she was worth. When her family got in the way, I put them in there place, I taught her to do the same.

I loved her in a way I had no idea I was capable of loving. I spent most of my life, with one dream, with one goal, with one passion. And in a few months. She replaced it. And I was not bothered in the least.

The first time I told her I was in love with her. I was inside of her, and she stared into my eyes, and tears rolled down her cheeks. And there was no mortal or otherworldly thought or notion that could have interrupted the bliss I endured. I feared nothing. I cared about nothing. Life and Death, tomorrow, or yesterday. These were strange words, with strange meanings. That I no longer cared for.

This feeling rarely subsided. All it took was holding her hand.

Five months pass and one day we wake up together, to discover her brother has died from a drug overdose. A room away from the bed we slept. With his five year old son sitting next to him. Oblivious.

The next two months were not easy. I feared I would lose her to sorrow. I feared I would lose myself, in sorrow that did not belong to me. I didn't leave my bed. As it was nearest to my phone. Which was as close to her as I could get. She needed time. She needed to keep her family together. She promised me we would be ok. I believed her. And though it seemed like it would never end, it did. In time. She was mine again.

But her mother did not recover from the loss of her first son. She returned to drugs. And to sex. And began to treat her daughter in a way that only the most broken of mothers do. Like a peer rather then a child. And as words got stronger, language became violence. So I took my woman away from this broken monster. I turned my room into our home. And for 3 months we lived together. In love, and without pain.

I fought. Literally. And emotionally. Time and time again. Against her family. Against her past. For her. And I would do it again. Or forever. But in time. I stopped being my own person. And became someone entirely different. I was no longer myself. I was simply, a very good boyfriend. But no longer me. I lost myself in dedication and protection and adoration. I was no longer my own person. And soon enough. I became something she spited. I was overbearing. I was emotional. I was boring.

Months went by and we found ways around her mother. She moved back home, and stayed with me in our old safe house less and less. I rarely went to her. As I despised a place where so many terrible things had happened. And with this distance. My grasp tightened. And finally. Three strange distant days, with strange, out of character discussions. Led to her revealing, she believed we should break up. I was in no position to argue. I asked why. She listed the faults I had recently acquired. She then mentioned, she really just wanted to go on a break. Something she didn't bring up, as in the past, I was always vocal about finding the idea of a break, pathetic, infuriating and pointless. But this was not a discussion. It was an ultimatum. 

We kissed deeply, and told each other we would still say goodnight and good morning. Surely. We need not be on a break for longer then three weeks she said. We just needed enough time, to become who we were again, before we started depending on each other, for reasons that were not love.

I couldn't simply “Go on a break”. So I took this as a break up. My heart and my mind fractured, and that night I quit my job, and hopped a train. And spent two weeks out of state. Our communicating was sometimes encouraging and made me feel wonderful. Though mostly, it was cold, and brief. And left me feeling empty. And terrible. I would consider this a break up. Because I feared the bliss brought upon me through hope. Hope, my heart broken readers, is a poison. And unless it is hope without doubt. It should be thrown to the wind. 
I came back into state. And when I pressured her for the truth, she promised me we were still to get back together. I was told I needed to relax. And that what she needed was time. The very day, of the end of week 3. Would be the day before the two of us must return to school. I expected her to return to me. But she did not. When I asked. She was angry. She treated me with malice. And told me again, she needed time. 
During the three weeks I have sat and worried, and grown. And all while doing this, prepared for school, and got my life in order. Daily, I heard rumors of ill doing. That she has been unfaithful, or that she has been spending time with the wrong people. Doing the wrong things. My sadness overtime became anger. And spite. And I almost let it control my life. I stopped eating, I stopped moving, or thinking, I wallowed in pure sorrow, and I thought of nothing but how awful things were. And would be. I am talking to you now, writing this, the night, of the end, of the third week. It is today. 

**TL;DR** (If you came for the pick me up and not the story)

Tomorrow is my first day of school. My bed smells of her but is empty. Her pictures are still smiling at me. Her body is still casting a shadow on all things beautiful. And I am finding her promises more and more empty.

I’m done. With this. With what it may or may not be. With what it makes me feel. This is for you /r/BreakUp. This is for all my heartbroken brothers and sisters. For all my loving husbands and wives and fiancés and boyfriends and girlfriends. We are done. And we are going to be okay. And for the first time, in 3 weeks for me, or maybe 3 years for you. We are going to smile and say FUCK YOU to the rain that follows us when our eyes are open and haunts us when they are closed. WE ARE NOBODIES FUCKING OPTION!

We are better then this. Tell me why? Tell me why you’re fucking better then this?

I’m charming. I’m kind. I’m smart. I’m handsome and I’m fast. I’m loyal and I’m thoughtful. I’m creative and I have dreams god damn it. I HAVE DREAMS AND GOALS AND DESIRES AND PASSIONS AND I AM YOUNG AND MOST OF ALL I’M FUCKING BETTER THEN THIS! I’M SMARTER THEN THIS!

I’m nobodies fucking option. My life doesn’t stop when someone else stops caring. When someone else drops the fucking ball. My life goes on. Our lives go on /r/BreakUps because we are the fucking main characters. I don’t know about you but I’m nobodies fucking sidekick. I am not the antagonist, I am not the deuteragonist, I am not a fucking side story in anyone else's life. I am the fucking story. I am the fucking plot. I decided what happens. And if I’m in so much pain I cant fucking see, I cant fucking, breath or think, I’m going to take a deep breath and laugh. My heart may be broken, and my life may be on hard mode, but if I gotta run it solo for a mission or two so fucking be it. 

You beautiful, unique, powerful fucking individual. Don’t ever forget who you are. Don’t lose yourself. Don’t let anyone guide you. Control you. You’re not a fucking emotional puppet. You’re a goddamn rockstar.

It's something I want to say to my ex but I won't. I no longer want there to be bitterness between us. I just want us to drift apart and both be happy. I still care a great deal about her and I want to tell her this as a friend, I won't feel like it and yeah, it probably is some sort of resent on my behalf. But I'd rather say it to a bunch of strangers than add flames to the fire of our break up.

You met a guy and fell for him. I don't blame you for that. You can't choose who you fall for. You cheated on me, that was wrong of you but shit happens. You're now with him, and if you want to get into a relationship that has foundations of cheating, then that is your choice too and you deserve each other.

What I want to warn you about though is the situation you are leading yourself in to. I know you don't want to hear this from me and I have no right telling you now. But I still am a friend, a friend who wants you to think about what you're doing. I don't want to tell you what to do though, it's up to you to make your own mistakes.

Beginning a relationship with a co-worker is risky business. It's not necessarily doomed to fail but with a situation like this you should proceed with caution. It will be fun at first and I'm sure you're having a good time now. But as with us, things can be over in less then 24 hours. It can only take one moment for your life to come crashing down.

You get to see each other at home and each other at work. Your life style will revolve around this. The relationship will move faster because of this and before you know it, you're in head deep. You will have days where you can't escape each other. There will be days when you may argue in the morning over something petty. You won't be able to escape it though because today you are sharing the same shift. Annoyance will turn into resent.

Maybe you two won't work out? Maybe it will end? But all those moments you shared at home, you can escape them in the workplace. But what you have done is brought your personal life into the workplace. So there is nowhere for you to escape these feelings and believe me, if you ever feel like I'm feeling right now, you will feel terrible. 

There will be no escape. If the relationship ends sour... and we both know you're into him more than he is into you. So you are setting yourself up for a fall here. I know you don't care at the moment and you're willing to risk everything for this. I know, I did that with you. And noone can stop you.

I know love is blind. You won't think about this now and it's just a process of life. But I do care, and you know it. I don't want you to compromise your job over this, this job, the best job you ever had. I don't know what this guy is like, I can only assume the worse (it's my job) but will he give up his job to make you happy? His job is disposable, yours is not. You worked hard for that position. Just think about what you're doing please!

Like I said, it's a petty dig at my ex. But it's also a concern for the friend I used to know.

I'm tired of being alone. I am tired of being emotionally isolated, feeling cut off from friends and family because I have no one to share or feel anything with.

My divorce happened four years ago -- the woman I was committed to, who I had a child with, who I promised to have and hold for the rest of my life was unfaithful on multiple occasions. Believing that marriage should mean more than a piece of paper and broken promises, I ended it on my own. I miss my boy, but he's happy and healthy and we keep in touch, which is what's important.

Last summer, I had a chance to touch the sky again when a mutual friendship seemed to blossom into something deeper. It was a long distance thing, but our friendship had lasted more than a year already, and I was looking forward for a chance to meet her in person, to deepen what felt like a strong bond, to finally touch and feel and know one another. I was even considering proposing, hoping that I'd found who I was looking for. That relationship ended a month ago: her ex-husband found someone else, and it appears to have frightened her into wanting a reconciliation, leaving me to watch my broken hopes crumble.

I want to give myself to someone. I want to be someone's white knight; I want someone who thinks she's just a lonely princess so I can make her a queen. I want someone's hand to hold, someone to hold the door for, someone who wants to laugh with me, or hold onto in the silence of sadness or regret.

I want to be a part of something bigger than myself, to have someone to think of when the radio comes on, to bring flowers home to. I want a warm temple to kiss in the morning, someone to say goodbye to. I have nothing to give but myself, and no one I've found yet seems to want that.

Break-ups suck. Telling myself that ""someone better will come along"" is painfully hollow when I hear happy songs and see happy couples. Who doesn't want to be happy? Being content with yourself can be the hardest thing anyone can do, and it's not something I'm very good at right now.

I know that it's easy to wonder if ""The One"" will ever come along. I've already lost The One -- twice. I didn't want the need to look for the proverbial charm; I didn't want to have to look a third time.

The story goes back roughly 6 yrs ago. I've just gotten out of a bad relationship so I was partying alot and meeting tons of women, and she was one of them. I met her when I was 20 and she was 18. I flirted with her and gave her my number. She never called.  I later saw her again at another party and ask her why she hasn't called. She apologized and called me the next day. We initially texted each other, then the late phone calls. She wasn't interested in me but I was. We had nothing in common. I told her stories of my childhood to keep her interested. She slowly fell in love with me.  There were other guys courting her, they were good looking, funny, and smart; so I was really surprise when she chose me. She was everything I wasn't; she was passionate, caring, and innocent. She changed me for the better, she made my life complete; Where I have character or personality flaws, she filled those gaps. She completes me and was my better half. She wasn't perfect, but I learned to love and lived with her flaws; to me that was love. Fast forward 3 yrs later, I suspect her of cheating cuz she was texting and calling a guy late at night and deleting the messages on her phone. I confronted her and from that point on it just got worse. She never cheated on me, but we no longer trust each other. I talk to her less and show less emotions. It became more of a marriage type relationship where don't go on dates nor spend quality time alone. I tailored my life for her; I made career changes, I gave up my passion in life so that I can spend time with her. I wasn't enough or maybe it wasn't what she wanted, either way we fell apart. She broke up with me when I moved away to take a job and she didn't want to come along. I'm alone in a city without friend and family and she's home having a good time. I still love her but I think we may never be together again. Tonight, I tell my heart it's over. She has moved on and I should too.

Yo jordan its jordan. If you ever start to miss tyler, well dont. Yeah shes nice and one of the cutest at school, but that isnt really saying much lol.

Remember the reason she dumped you? Over religion! Dont stick your dick in crazy as they say. You wont have a meaningful adult relationship with someone who at a base level you cant agree with. She did you a favor as you wouldnt have to dump her later.

Another reason. She went back to cody loool. They are actually perfect together. Both pretty immature. Have the same interests . Batshit crazy with jesus lol. He can have her. 

Besides, would you really like to be with someone who can start dating someone 6 days after her mother died?!?! Or someone that ""rediscovers"" feelings for her ex less than a month after she dumps you.

Dont get me wrong though bro. Dont get mad or bitter at her. During your time together, she was 100% yours you fuckin boss. She just had principles(stupid medievel ones) but principles nonetheless that made her lose romantic interest in you. That and being a little needy and supplicating(be the alpha boss you know you are). You have to respect her for being upfront about it. Shes a good friend for that.

Oh god and never bitch to her again. Jeezus you sound like such a little girl. Bottom line is: she truly liked you for who you are. Yes she did some messed up things, but you cant blme her as shes a fuckin high school girl. Theyre all like that. She cant date you because shes crazy. Get over it. Its her loss really.

So to tldr: tyler is a shitty girlfriend for losing out on you, but still a good friend who cares about you.

Fast forward 2 years later and we start to date again, we had both grown and were getting along great. Over time I catch her in some small lies about her relationship with the guy that she had been talking to while I was dating her. I had recently started going to counseling due to the stress load in my life right now, and in one of those sessions I found that there were some underlying trust issues in our relationship. I confronted those issues this morning and told her that some of her stories did not add up and I was wondering how far the lies had gone and if she had been totally honest with me.

I'm still not completely over her, but here are some things that have helped me to move on a little bit or realize that things will get better (especially since she was the first one I really felt compatible with and cared so much for):

* **Stop putting your ex on a pedestal.** When I really think about it, this is really what I've found as some of the best advice.  While going out I thought my ex was perfect for me, there couldn't be anyone else. Looking back, I realize there was quite a few things she did that I did could not stand but I continued to ignore them because I thought she was ""perfect"" for me and it did not matter.
* **There is more than one person for you that you are compatible with.**  Before your ex, was there anyone else that you had feelings for that maybe you did not go out with?  There were several for me before I went out with my ex.  I was not in love with them, but I had not been with them in a serious context for that to happen.  What makes you seriously think that out of the millions of people close to your age, there is only one that could ever work for you? Take it all as a learning experience as I am trying to do right now which leads me to my next point.
* **Learn from your past relationship.** I had some of the best times of my life and best first experiences in my past relationship, I won't forget those and remember the happy times.  But, as no relationship is perfect, there were a lot of things that I have learned. I began to nitpick because she did the same and I wanted to ""get back"" at her for it which I learned was stupid. Also, being unexperienced I brought up her past more than I should have which is another thing I learned not to do in the future.  She had also done several things that bothered me that I know I will not want in a future S/O.  Once we got to school I always had to go to her place instead of coming to mine, I would only go out to parties with her if it was with her friends, and I catered to her needs entirely too much.  Just imagine what it will be like when you find someone that you love that gives back as much as you give to them.
* **Time and patience is key.** As much as people say it, it really is the truth.  Like I said it has only been over a month and I am not completely over everything and still recovering, but I know that I am making progress.  She may still cross my mind a lot which I believe is only natural, but I know things will get better.  Realistically speaking you're not just going to find someone else instantly that you are compatible with and interested in, or else you wouldn't be here which again leads me to my next point.
* **Take time to better yourself.**  Do what is best to make yourself a better person.  I know it is said on here every day to improve yourself afterwards but that's because it's the truth.  Hang out with friends, go to the gym, experience new things and learn more about yourself.  It's a lot easier said than done, but just make progress as the days go by.  Do your best not to slip back and talk to them again or look at their Facebook if you're still friends with them for some reason, it only takes you back to where you started and you have to make that progress all over again.
* **Don't fall into the friendzone**  As hard as it may be, as much as this person meant to you in your life and as much of your best friend they might have been, don't let them try to talk you into being friends.  Everyone needs their space and time of healing after a break up.  My ex has tried contacting me several times since and I know that won't help anything.  She may feel guilty or want to catch up or be friends, whatever it is who cares.  If you can't see your ex with another guy or girl and be ok with it, then you can't be friends with them yet, that's not a friend.  I've been tempted to respond a lot, but I think about it and realize how if anything it will make things worse or the same as they were already, so what's the point? It's not necessary.

**TL;DR** To summarize, things do get better. I'm not completely over my ex but I realize there are others out there and things will get better.  And stop putting your ex on some pedestal that they are the best and only person out there for you because it's ridiculous.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_mrl9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/mrl9u/trying_to_look_on_the_more_positive_side_of_things/,

Yesterday I received word (unintentionally, through a less-than-bright friend) that she's seeing another guy. A guy that, in the months before our break up, she told me wasn't a threat. She told me he was a flirt, but that he was like that with everyone. The amount of time she spent trash-talking him is unbelievable. Now they're hooking up. And considering the stories she's shared from ""colleagues"", there's a good chance that it was happening whilst we were still together. I have been played.

Of course, I took it like a man. Which is to say: I held it together around my family. Then I proceeded to curl up in the foetal position, drink a quart of jack, begged for death, and cried until 5 in the morning. 

I feel a little better today, though. Admittedly, I'm rough as sandpaper and I have a hangover that would cripple a wild boar, but the thing I feared the most in this world has come to pass. Now I'm on the other side, looking at myself, and wondering why I'm still standing. I genuinely don't think I gave myself enough credit with how strong I am. 

She's inadvertantly done me a favour, I think. That last, lingering, pain-in-my-arse shred of hope, (the one I never admitted to anyone else even existed) that we could talk, could fix this, has been snatched away. You have no idea how much I wanted that little bastard gone. Now I guess all that's left to do is stand up straight, mentally wish her all the best (and him; she's going to chew him up and spit him out. Poor bastard), and move on.

I just wanted to let everyone here at r/breakups know; it doesn't kill you. Nothing that happens from here on in is going to kill you. Its going to hurt like high hell, but you won't die from it. Keep your chin up, roll your shoulders back, and be the best person you can possibly be.

I [M24] broke up with my SO [F24] almost 3 months ago after a 4 year relationship. She'd suggested a break, and was clearly not feeling it anymore. She didn't have the guts to pull the trigger, so eventually I had to. Around that time when she started to lose interest she had started hanging around with a new bunch of people. One of them repeatedly tried to hook up with her, which she told me about. It was pretty clear to me at the time that this was no coincidence, and these new people were making her antsy about being in such a long relationship.

Anyway, surprise surprise a couple of months go by and now she's with that dude. While I've come a long way in getting over the breakup, this still sucks. Not only does it mean that she was at least emotionally cheating on me towards the end, it also devalues our long relationship. It sucks that she got over me because of some guy she hardly knew, especially since I met him and he was legitimately a massive douche (the kind of guy she would have laughed with me about back in the day).

I hope this will be positive in the long run. There is now no lingering possibility of getting back together. I also think a lot less of her now, and I'm glad I'm not with her if that's the kind of person she was. These things will hopefully help in the coming months to finally get to the 'Don't give a fuck' phase.

Still, even realising this intellectually, right now I can't help feeling a bit pathetic. I'm like the guy in the movie who's girlfriend leaves him for some generic asshole.

For the longest time in our relationship especially when we were going through some hard shit, he suddenly made this girl friend that I did not know of. She kept popping up on his text messages and I was really confused. I asked him about it, but he said that they were just friends and I left it at that. I always had this feeling that they were hanging out when he was not with me, but I didn't know for sure because I'm not a psycho stalker and did not follow him around. I asked a couple of times just if I could meet her because she had a nickname in his phone and one of her texts consisted of hearts. He said that he would introduce me, but never did. Then the night that I came over to talk to him, he was hanging out with her and another friend in the hallway. He broke up with me that night. I never really thought about it, but it makes me physically sick to think that they are hanging out more and maybe even going to get together. I hate him so fucking much for putting me through this shit. He fucking sucks. I don't know what else to say. I'm just pissed. And needed to get it out there because internalizing it has never really helped me. Don't really know if I want a response for this, I guess just support.

I was the stronger person, who wanted to push through the complications and into the life we had planned, and we got oh so close to realizing the dream. It was not to be.

The last 6 weeks have featured your text book post break up highs and lows. NC is in full effect and I don't see that ever changing. The hurt is just too much to ever restore this. Who knows, I may change my mind down the road, but I doubt it.

so.. how do I know this is bottom? Because I know. I know in my heart, and my mind that this is my goodbye, and this unrelenting sadness that I feel, is the result. Bottom may last a day, or a week, but even still,  I am methodically moving forward, with a very heavy heart and a bruised soul.

Bottom is here and now, but soon, I will make the turn upward to a better day. How do I know? Because I know.

That is until I realized as more time passed I was a back burner friend. Only acknowledged when there's no one else or my ex needed an emotional punching bag. Which happened a lot really. I did know that my ex continually popping up on Facebook was stopping my full potential for moving on. It was a slower more grueling process. 

I wasn't ready to see him moving on, even though it's not at all about me, as more and more information popped up alerting me of the impending doom, it still felt like a punch to the kidneys every time. I couldn't help but take it personally some what, start questioning why I wasn't good enough. These thoughts are bad news, and I couldn't go back to that place when I worked so hard to regain my self esteem. 

So I did the only thing I thought it wouldn't come to, I asked him to delete and block me, which he didn't take to well, but I figured it would be nicer of me to offer an explanation instead of just vanishing. He refused to block me, which makes it harder for me but it's just another test where I have to prove how strong I can be. And yet I will still spare the feelings of the person who's hurt me the most. 

And as melodramatic as it sounds, it does feel like a crushing finality. But I know I'm just stopping myself from moving on. This isn't proof that no friendships after breakups work, but much like relationships, it's not going to work if one person puts all the effort in. It takes two.

So I got dumped last night. He was decent enough to do it in person, so I guess that's a plus. But I honestly did not see it coming.

Basically, I'd been seeing this guy for about 4 months and we seemed to be good together. We talked every single day, and sent each other long messages, just about whatever we felt like chatting about. We just recently celebrated my birthday last weekend and everything seemed great. He even got me a birthday present.

So anyway, yesterday he didn't chat much, and they weren't the usual happy messages. I didn't think much of it, as he's currently got a lot on his plate. Turns out he was intending to dump me. Which he did, quite suddenly, with little explanation.

I think I'm still in a small amount of shock. Especially at the reasoning that we're apparently 2 different people because I can't talk about philosophy. Yet we talked every day and weren't limited with conversation when we were together. I'm so confused.

I guess I just wanted to vent, and see if anyone can make any sense of the reason behind the break up. I was single for 2 years before we started dating, and was happy, so I know I can get back to that. It will just take some time.

For the most part I've moved on, I really feel like I've bettered myself through everything and I'm not even missing her anymore. I still think about her every couple of days but it's really nothing to cry over. I'm happy that she moved on and it's time for me to move on too. But why do I still feel like shit? I know I'm not completely ready for another relationship, I'm trying to enjoy and embrace being single... But there's still a feeling deep down that makes me feel uneasy. I don't miss her. I'm glad she broke up with me because it made me realize that she was no way close to being the perfect partner. The thing is this, I still very much miss having someone, anyone, to talk too. I miss someone to hold when I wake up in the morning or fall asleep at night. Waking up in bed alone night after night is getting more and more lonely. I miss how this special person was someone I could talk to through out the day about anything. How do you guys cope with not having someone who cares about you at such a deep emotional level?

That's what I really have trouble with, it's not that I don't have friends who look out for me and such. My buddies are there for me always, but it's just not at the same level as your significant other is. It's just my life is lacking that special someone. It's kind if hard for me to explain this but hopefully you guys understand what I'm going through.

TL:DR Do you guys have any advice? How do you guys cope with being so lonely at time? Unless that's the single life..

We couldn't get enough of each other. We spent every waking moment together, and it was the best time of my life. 

Then things got comfortable and our insecurities came out to play. You didn't think you could trust me, even though I never gave you a reason not to. When that guy came around, I got jealous. I shouldn't have. 

You swear you love me and that I'm perfect, but you can't see long-distance. You wanted time, and I gave it to you. You came back and we were ready to work, and then that guy kissed you. 

Suddenly you didn't want to do the work anymore. You'd already done so much damage. You needed more time. You needed more space. 

How can I sustain a relationship with you if you don't miss me like I miss you? I miss you so much. It turned into me badgering you all day for attention, affection, any indicator that you're still in it like I am. It made me feel psycho. I can't be your puppy. You can't have me halfway anymore. I can't be in a halfway relationship if you can't reassure me you want what I do.

We were in it for the long haul, and you got scared. I can't blame you for that, but it hurts that you didn't want to try.

You told me you couldn't be without me. You told me a week or so without me would surely bring you back into this all the way. I hope that's true. 

When I told you a break up would mean no contact, you looked like you'd watched your dog get run over. You don't want life without me. Hopefully that translates into you wanting life with me the way I want life with you. I did what I had to. 

I see your tweets. I know how much fun you're trying to have. I love you so much, and I wish you well, but I hope to God you come back for me. 

I have your shoes, among other things. Even if you don't miss me, you have to get those. 

So begins your life without me to turn to. Without my unconditional love, without me to tell you how great you are and how pretty you are and how perfect you are. Without me to vent to and to tell about your day. I hope you miss me. I hope you miss my touch and my company.

Here are a couple of quotes that are surprisingly deep despite the fact they came from The simpsons, South park and scrubs. 

""Sometime, when you least expect it, you'll realise that someone loved you. And that means that someone can love you again! And that'll make you smile."" - Homer Simpson

""Well yeah, and I’m sad, but at the same time I’m really happy that something could make me feel that sad. It’s like, it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human.

About 4 months ago my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years began cheating on me, then left me for her drug dealer. We both used to smoke pot but I hated it and just did it with her because she did nothing else. After that happened I still managed to ace every class that semester while going through the break-up simultaneously. It was at this same time that my ex's new boyfriend began sending me death threats, and my ex and him began trying to extort me out of cash, by threatening to expose the most intimate secrets I had shared with her during our 2 1/2 years together.

I quit smoking pot and cigarettes immediately, and left the country for 3 months to visit friends and family around the world and re-assess my life, because we had been living together and were already thinking about marriage, well she was. Instead of being a lazy stoner, I've begun writing the novel I have been planning for years but never had the time too, and have started working out and eating right and managed to gain 10 kg, (a good thing in my case, I was well under weight).

After getting back to Australia several weeks ago I chose to contact my ex's mother instead of my ex directly about reclaiming somethings I had forgotten when I moved out (her parents always seemed to really respect me). And today when I met her mother to reclaim my items, her mother began begging me to get back into her daughters life in any capacity. 

She explained to me that since she left me for her drug dealer boyfriend, he has convinced her to drop out of university and start using crystal meth, and that she was apparently out of town this week getting an abortion, because after getting pregnant in December she hadn't even attempted to quit drugs. Her mother described her as constantly flustered and nervous, always on edge and miserable. She went on to say that her daughter seemed like a shell of the person she had been during her time with me, and that pretty much all the good that I had done for her in our time together had been undone by her new drug pushing boyfriend in a very short time.

Its was really disheartening to hear all that, but it was not anything that I was previously ignorant of, in fact I had warned my ex about how bad getting involved with her current boyfriend would be for her, and it seems I was right.

I just wanted to share this with people currently going through break ups and say, If your ex is treating you horribly or done terrible things, forgetting about them because focusing on yourself is the way to go after a break up.

Break up date: Week ago. 

We were together for 5 years. For the last few months he just kept talking about how he wanted to marry me blah blah blah. Last week, while I was at work, he up and left. Packed everything and moved out. Said he wanted to be single for a while and not have to worry about being responsible to anyone. And he also told me he never intended on marrying me because I am his first girlfriend and he needs to date other women. Obviously I'm crushed. I am alone in a place surrounded by no one. My friends and family are hundreds of miles away and I am trapped here until the end of my lease (mid june). 

My heart feels like it has been ripped out of my chest and smashed into a million pieces. Not only did I not see this coming, I went from being around him every day to never being allowed to see or talk to him again. To make matters worse, I found out he is online dating now.

Any success stories of getting back together, even years later?",22,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/163g5z/how_do_you_know_if_a_breakup_is_right_any_success/,"I'm guess I'm just wondering how to know if breaking up with someone is ""right"".  Providing no ""real"" troubles like cheating, how did you know when to end it and when to try to fix things? Mostly I'd love to hear any of your stories. Especially, is it possible to get back together? Are there any of those success stories?

That's my main question. If you feel like reading the whole thing and giving advice, that'd be great too, tho I know it is very long. Although I do realize that it's impossible for someone else to know what the relationship was like and what I'm feeling, I can barely even explain my feelings anyway. 

I (19/f) just broke up with my boyfriend (19/m) of 10 months. 
He was the perfect guy but for reasons I can't explain very well, I was not happy. Distance was a factor, and feeling like I was missing out on a ""typical college experience"". We're both freshman in college, and the distance was hard. I was always the one who was unsure and thought the distance was so hard and being in a LDR in college was so hard, and he loved me unconditionally and still treated me perfectly despite my doubts.

But overall, I have been too scared to fully ""commit"" to him and show him I love him and put him first above my selfish wants. To clarify, I never cheated or anything close, but I did express feelings that I thought I was missing out on ""typical college"". I've been a big insecure and unsure because I've never really been with anyone else-besides kiss, he was my first absolute everything, my first love, and this is my first breakup.

I feel like I'm dying. I can barely eat, and I normally love food. I wasn't fully content with him because we had problems and I wasn't willing to work on them. Now I'm miserable without him. I know, I know what you're thinking-you're 19, it's your first love, of course it's gonna be hard cuz it just happened, just get over it and find someone new. I want to be able to meet new people in college and have fun, yes, but honestly I would love to end up and marry him. He told me he wanted that too, and he meant it.

I know that any pain i feel from missing him or losing him, is probably a hundred times worse for him. He was my best friend, and I don't know how I'm supposed to just lose him. Tho at the time i felt a bit ""less in love"" with him, maybe it was just a rut. I feel so sad. I still love him so much.

I just don't know what to do. I could have tried to work on our problems, but I didn't because the problem was ultimately me-I couldn't love him enough and be satisfied while so far away. I told him I'm gonna work on me and fix me, so that I can fully love eventually. 

I feel like I made a huge mistake. But something made me feel like I had to, like I didn't want to commit to him because I knew eventually I would want some freedom before fully committing to someone. He always told me it's not a commitment for life or marriage, but with the difficulty of distance it sure felt like it.

I told him and made a list of all the things I need to fix, like giving more than I take and putting him and his needs above mine, showing him I really care. I really want to fix myself, because I know I'm selfish. Then pursue him and make things right; I know that sounds crazy and unrealistic. I know. But it's what I want for now, to have freedom and space now but go back to him when I'm ready. I know he probably won't ever love me again, anyway. 

Well if you read all that long, sappy, confusing thing, then thanks. I will try to elaborate if you would like. Thank you for any help

I've been a mess all day, I'm a bottle of jack in and it hasn't even made a dent.  We've left things amicably, but it's killed me inside all day thinking about what Christmas might have been.

Floating around online I found a quote from one of my favourite movies which really inspired me to keep on going in life, hopefully it might inspire some of you.

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” 
― Frank Herbert, Dune

My biggest fear is that I'll never meet anyone else like her, sorry if this is just drunken ramblings, just needed somewhere to vent. First Christmas alone, haven't seen another human being all day and I'm yearning for some human contact.

It seemed to me that I was going through the worst time of my entire life, and today sitting here in my living room, it might as well have been, too. The world was imploding and my mind was plagued with the worst possible thoughts. At the time, she was my world. All that I did, I did because of her. 

My friends, even our closest ones whom took loyalty to me in the end (because she had committed adultry with a neighbor of ours), BEGGED me not to speak to her. They insisted that if I kept any line of contact open, I would never climb out of the dark place I was in. She was a manipulator, giving me all the possible signs that she still loved me and wanted to be with me. At the time, with her being my own lifeline, I grasped onto whatever I could from her. I seriously thought we'd be together.... seriously. 

When I found out that she was still trying to douple dip (excuse the rude imagery), I started to panic. I had lost a sense of pride that nobody had ever taken away. To be frank, I never thought I could ever get it back. It was very very tragic. 

Someone close to me said, ""You have to not talk to her at all. Just give it two weeks, you will feel so much better.""

I caved in and said fuck it; whatever I've been doing isn't working so I must swallow the pill and not speak with her for at LEAST two weeks. I was in the gym parking lot when I was told that phrase, and from that point forward my gumption to become normal again increased. 

There were times where I would dial the phone number, stare at my phone for a few minutes, smoke a cigarette, take a shower, do pulls up, and then go back to staring at my phone. I NEVER pressed dial. I NEVER sent the text. Two weeks passed and I was becoming whole again. I don't mean I felt better because I had been pursued by girls, I don't mean I felt better because I became more fit or because I had gotten a promotion (altought a few of those things DID happen, but as a consequence of what I had truly gone through). 

I felt better mentally. Subconsciously my mind was interracting with my heart and giving out signals that if I could get past my impulsive need to NEED HER, I could get past anything. It didn't matter if I went to the gym routinely, or if I gotten laid routinely, or if I won the breakup routinely. It only mattered that she didn't matter, and that was the breaking point. 

As I predicted and had imagine with some guilt, she came knocking on my door a few times. She begged to come in, she begged to speak with me, and apologized for being a bad girlfriend, she told me couldn't stop thinking about me. It DID NOT MAKE ONE DIFFERENCE. I told her that it was OK, that it didn't bother me anymore. She cried, she was pathetic. She left. 

Once again weeks went by, and I DID NOT CONTACT HER ONCE. I was in a mental place of peace with myself. I AM IN A MENTAL PLACE OF PEACE. 

More texts came, more calls, more voicemails (mind you this is while she is in a relationship and now, seemingly, lives with my ex-neighbor). They went ignored. She once called while I was travelling abroad (actually, I still am travelling) and when she said her name I genuinely did not know who she was and had to ask for a last name. Do you know how good of a feeling it is to remind yourself that this person, who once was your everything, can become so little in such little time?

My point is... go those two weeks, it won't hurt you a bit. Pain is temporary my friends, and pride lasts a lot longer.


I am writing this while I am abroad, and back at home it is Christmas. I woke up this morning thinking what she was doing, or what she had gotten as presents. I wonder if she is happy. I hope so. 

Although her THOUGHT still crosses my mind every day, I have become much more disciplined in dealing with my emotions in a healthy way. I have had the opportunity to get involved in a bad cycle again, and I made the choice of what's better for me. Knowing you can do that will advance you so far. 

Months ago I used to read here alot, and now it's been months since I've opened one of these. 

If I had the opportunity to send PAST me this text, I would. But it probably wouldn't change a thing.... just go TWO WEEKS, and quit being a little bitch. 

Be a man, pull the trigger.

I was glad that I was moving on, focusing on myself, reconnecting with friends, working out, meeting new women. I was glad that we had our time together, but I was also glad that we were able to move on without ruining all the good parts of our relationship.

In the end, I realized that we couldn't be together. At least not right now, maybe not ever. She has things that she needs to work out, and I deserve better than an incomplete version of someone. There really is no chance that I would suddenly feel okay about her hurting me, or that she would suddenly feel okay about me hurting her.

And that is just fine, because true happiness doesn't come from external things, it comes from perspective, gaining the ability to deal with your problems, it comes from giving yourself the time to heal.

Today marks the one year and one day after my ex brutally dumped me over the phone. Being the awkward lonely girl I am, I don't think I could have gotten through without Reddit. This is my small way of saying thank you.

[Here I was, one year ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/mphk0/just_got_dumped_what_now/) 

Here I am now.

 I moved out of my hometown and I started a new program last January. Right after our break up, many of his friends reached out to me. People I never thought who cared, such as his closest friends came out to comfort to me and admit he was never a great boyfriend.

I was never close to my parents, but after the break up I shared my feelings with them for the first time in a long time. I spoke to my dad for the first time in a very long time too.

The new program I started is called Animation. The program is tough, I have had friends in engineering at one of the time top schools in Canada tell me I had it harder than them. I do nothing but go to school for ~12 hours day. We rarely go out to party or to drink or anything like that. Our studios are a self-contained bubble separated from the rest of the school. 

I love every single second of it.

For the first time in my life I felt a sense of whole-ness. I was doing something I loved to do, to draw and make art. I found people I actually fit in with ! People who also liked to make art and play video games and read comics and watch anime. I didn't feel weird for the first time ever. I never felt like maybe I wasn't pretty enough or skinny enough or wore the right clothes or liked the same things. I enjoyed pulling all nighters. Those were the best bonding times. 

In May a boy in my year and program asked me to help him pick up a record player downtown. I was in the process of moving to my current apartment in the same area he kept offering me to help me move stuff, then paint my walls, then clean my apartment, then give me some of his extra kitchen stuff. One day, we fell asleep next to each other and he put his arms around me. 

I still thought about my ex often. Shortly after I started dating my current SO, he began seeing someone too. We haven't spoken since I left my hometown. I was holding my SO's hand when my friend told me.  It was an initial punch in the gut. I looked at my SO and and thought, I would never trade this to be back with by my ex's side again. Never ever. I actually ended up seeing my ex that night because my friends and I were celebrating someone's birthday nearby. Afterward my SO drove me quite a bit north of my town. I warned him about the downfall of my previous relationship. I told him of some of the terrible things I was so deeply ashamed of doing then. He shrugged it off and assured me that it's not as shameful as I thought it was. We stopped on the roadside and we sat on the hood of my car and it looked at all the stars my bright town could afford us. He told me he felt a little sorry for me because I've never seen the true night sky before. He promised me he'd show me one day. 

It's been a little over 6 months now. My SO and I have little in common other than our passion for art and occasional overlaps in musical tastes. He's a total country bumpkin, and I've always lived in the city. He doesn't play video games and he doesn't eat meat. I'm total carnivore. We always have something to share even though we spend so much time together every day. He fulfilled his promise and took me to his parent's house to see the true night sky for the first time in my life. It was beautiful.
For the first time in my life, I was able to tell myself, ""I'm happy.""

School gets super stressful now and and again. I still think of my ex. I admit, I sometimes stalk his facebook even though I deleted him. My current and SO and I get into fights occasionally. I often doubt myself  as an artist too. My SO and I may or may not break up somewhere down the road, but that's life. In the year's that's past, I've really grown up. 

I tried to come up with some profound life advice but nothing I was about to type really worked or was totally true. I guess nothing really ever is. I guess, all I can really say is to be yourself! Stop living your life for someone else, because once they are gone so are you. You can't spend your entire life waiting for someone to pick you up. I've heard people saying, ""Once I have a boyfriend/girlfriend I'll be happy"" and that's totally untrue. Happiness is something that comes from within. It's not something someone else hands to you. I've always heard (from jason mraz I think?) that it takes two wholes to make a whole, not two halves and I think that's a wonderful way to put it. This is what NC truly means. Don't contact your ex so you can focus on yourself.

So there you have it Reddit. A pretty long summary of the past year of my life. If there's anything I should close this with, it's life goes on.

She was cheating on me multiple times.,20,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/y6xsg/just_broke_up_with_my_gf_for_the_past_3_years_she/,"We have been together for almost three years now, and I really thought we should be together forever.
She's been treating me really bad, but I have been way to blind to see before now.

We met in high school, and started dating. First we didn't want to commit because she was going away for six months to a school 200 miles away from where I live. But we got so close, and became best friends, so we gave it a shot. It was amazing. I have never been happier, and I spent hundreds of dollars on tickets to go visit her 2-3 times a month. Everything was perfect, she told me that she was certain I was the love of her life and vice versa.
When she finished school, she moved back home with her mom (parents divorced), but everytime she had a day or two off her job, she came and lived with me.

So fast forward a year (march 2011) - we moved together. We were both very nervous, because neither of us had ever had a SO for this long, and never tried to live together, in my apartment. But we gave it a shot and it was amazing. She want's to become a cosmeotologist, but had a hard time finding a job here, so she could save up money for starting at school. So she didn't have any money, or any friends. I told her I would cover her rent until she found a job, and that the money was whatever (I'm a dental hygienist so my pay is more than decent to cover for both).

Three months later she went to Roskilde Festival (big music festival here in Denmark). When she came home she was so different, didn't talk very much, tried to hide from me when she was on facebook or texting. I got suspicious, and one day she forgot to log off Facebook, and I saw she had been chatting with a guy, that she screwed at the festival. I was devestated. For months forward I was ready to just kill my self. But she still told me that she loved me, and that we were meant to be together, she was just confused, and it didnt mean anything. So we stayed together, and actually went back to having a great relationship (or so I thought).

Two months ago, she starts behaving the same way again. She had started texting someone from her job, a guy. At first I talked to her about it, and she said that they had nothing together and that she loved me. Then one day, she forgets to log off facebook, and all hell broke loose.

For months she had been texting this guy, sending him nude photos, telling him how she wanted to rape him in my apartment, in my bed. Telling him how when she was in bed with me, she was thinking of him. I snapped, I felt so sick. I couldnt believe this was happening, and that she did this, and then when she came home, she told me that everything was good between us.

So last night, this guy she was with texts me saying that he knows he fucked up, but that I should know that my ex-gf had told him that we had broken up months ago, and she didnt care for me anymore. That was it I couldnt handle it anymore.
I have spent almost 1,5 years of the last three years of being sad because she was cheating on me. So I told here we were over, she didn't even cry.

So now here I am, lost three years of my life, lost almost $2000 that I had payed for her in rent and utilities. And I still miss her.

For the last few weeks, I've been meeting as many new people as possible. Starting conversations with randoms, girls and guys alike. Making new friends. THAT is how you get over your ex: re-esttablishing the fact that you are a wonderful individual. Remember how you were before you met him/her? Be that person again. Or, better yet, be better.

I went out tonight, again aiming to meet new people. To make FRIENDS. Well guess what? I had a great kiss with a beautiful girl tonight. And I wasn't out for that. It JUST HAPPENED.

You've got to put yourself in position to succeed. The greatest people have failed time and time again. Failure is a necessary part of success. Couple that acceptance of 'failure' (ie being single) with just being an individual and let it flow!

Follow your gut. You KNOW deep inside it is time to re-establish YOUR VALUE. It sounds polyanna (sp?), but it is true.

I have moments, days even, of weakness. But you must ween yourself off of reliance, and move towards INDEPENDENCE WITH NO GOAL TO FIND DEPENDENCE.

1335203448.0,20,self.BreakUps,sogyh,Trust Your Struggle. ,25,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/sogyh/trust_your_struggle/,"**“You never know how strong you are, until being strong is the only choice you have.”**


**My story:**

* I (24f) was in a relationship with this guy (32m) for 1 year. He was my first love, first everything. He won my heart over and stopped trying. The less attentive he was, the more I was falling and becoming more “needy”.  We had great relationship, amazing chemistry; everything was perfect except the emotional aspect of it. He was emotionally unavailable and thought more with his head than heart. I on the other hand was an emotional person, so this caused issues because he didn’t “try” to understand me as a person. I did everything for this guy, I bent over backwards, and I let a lot of hurtful things he did slide. Long story short, he broke up with me saying I lacked life experience because everything I am going through he already has and he doesn’t want to be anybody’s teacher. 


* The day after he broke up with me, I went to his house grab my stuff and returned his. We didn’t say anything to each other. As I walked out the door I thanked him for breaking up with me and not giving me a second chance (The night he broke up with me, I begged him for another chance and promised him things would change). After this I went on complete **NO CONTACT**, I deleted his number (even though I memorized it lol).


**Week 1:**

* This was the hardest week of my life because I reached to one of the lowest points in my life. I’ve never cried so much and my heart was aching so badly. I just wanted the pain to go away, so I even thought suicidal thoughts.  I didn’t want to go anywhere, do anything, except cry.
I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t eat. I would go to sleep crying and wake up in the middle of the night to the thought of him and cried some more. Everyday every second I thought about him and the good times. In my eyes he was perfect, I kept telling myself I wasn’t going to be able to find anybody better because we had such a good connection. 


* I kept blaming myself for the relationship for ending, I kept thinking if only I did things differently, if only I didn’t complain, if only I just kept my mouth shut. I wished I could turn back time. 
How I was able to not contact him was because I read online that if I did **NO CONTACT** I would be able to get him back, so I did it in the hopes of him returning to me soon. At this stage I was still in denial of the breakup and I still had hope that things will work out and he might return. 

* What kept me somewhat sane during this week was talking to my friends about my feelings and sleeping over at my friend’s/brother’s house. I couldn’t be home alone; I would have driven myself crazy in thoughts. I cried everyday that week, don’t be afraid to cry and let out your emotions, it will make you feel better.


**Week 2:**

* The aching in my heart decreased, but the constant thoughts were still there. This was when I started seeing the relationship for what it really was. I was in an unhealthy relationship; he wasn’t in it for the long run from the start, he just wanted someone to have fun with without the emotional side of it. There were signs, but I was too blinded to see it and also because every wrong thing he did I made excuses for it and tried to justify for his wrong doings, so it didn’t seem that bad at the time.


* The hardest thing I had to accept was that “he and I weren’t meant to be”, I fought so hard for this relationship, and I did EVERYTHING possible, so how can this be true? I use to think that if you treated someone right and gave them your all, that that was enough to keep a relationship, boy was I wrong. Even though he might have been perfect in my eyes, he wasn’t perfect for me. I am a loving, giving person and that is the type of person I need to be with. 


* I got a job and this helped time pass by so much quicker. It sometimes help occupied my mind, but I still thought about him. This week was hardest to stick to **NO CONTACT** because I had such bad urges to call him. I kept thinking that I’ll just call him up and see how he’s doing and keep things casual, but deep down inside I knew that hearing his voice would make me break down. As much as I wanted to call him I knew I couldn’t.

* I also made a CD full of songs about getting over a breakup, yes this helped a little bit, but it also hurt in a sense that I was thinking about him when I listened to these songs. It’s funny because I never really understood love songs until after getting my heart broken for the first time. Everything in the song related to how I felt, I felt what the song was trying to convey.


**Week 3:**

* *Trust your struggle, it does get better.*  This week was a rollercoaster for me. I didn’t cry as much this week, but I was very bitter and had a lot of resentment.  I still think about him, but not as much about the good times or the good things about him, but of how he really isn’t that great of a guy. I started accepting that things were really over at this point, the hope of us getting back together is almost gone. 

* I signed up for Eharmony because I wanted to get myself out there and just get to know people. I’ve gone on 3 dates and I’ve made it clear I wasn’t looking to jump into any relationship. I don’t want to hurt other people or use anyone as a rebound, that’s not fair. The first date was hard because I kept thinking about my ex and comparing my ex to these guys. I wasn’t allowing myself to enjoy the date as much, so I tried harder on the next date and it wasn’t as bad. I’m an introvert and I have trouble meeting people, but I kind of had to step out of my comfort zone. 


* This week there was a few times I wanted to call him, but I really had to ask myself what I would get from calling him. I had to be realistic about it, it isn’t going to change anything, and if anything was going to change it would have to be him. 


* Sometimes I think that if only I was the person I was now when I first met him, things probably would have worked out, but would I truly be happy? People don’t change, they are who they are, you need to find someone who loves the same way you do, or else you’ve never fully be satisfy in the relationship. 

* At first I went into **NO CONTACT** with the mindset of getting him back, but now that has changed as well. I deserve better and he isn’t worth having in my life, not even as a friend because a friend wouldn’t treat you this way. I went through hell and he probably knew it but he didn’t even try to reach out to me, which is good because if he did it would have ruined my progress. I am now using **NO CONTACT** to heal myself and better myself as a person.



**The story:**

* This was the hardest experience I’ve ever gone through, but it needed to happen. I’ve grown so much in such a short period of time. I now know what I want in a partner, what deal breakers are and what can be compromised. I just dealt with the worst, so the next time someone treats me wrong I am not going to put up with it. I now have standards and I won’t settle for less. I am more cautious with how much I give. I am stronger and wiser now, and if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t have become the better person that I am now. I now know what LOVE is…

* I went through the 5 stages of a breakup “**Denial, Anger, Realization, Depression, and Acceptance.**” I repeated the first four stages many times, but I’m slowly getting into the acceptance stage. TIME is really the answer to all our pain.

* I did everything I could for this relationship and I didn’t have it in me to keep fighting it. Sometimes things just don’t work out the way you hoped it would… but it will work out even better. You have to start letting go of what ifs and maybe because if you don’t then you’re not allowing yourself the chance to let go. You can’t keep feeding yourself possibilities, memories and hope because it will only slow down your progress.

* Life will throw surprises at you, but don’t be too busy standing at the door behind you that you don’t catch the one opening for you. **Stay strong r/breakups!**

Feel free to ask me anything, I want to help you through this because I did. It’s not easy and we are all going through it, but just know that I am here for you. Message me if you want more advice on your situation :)


**EDIT**

I still miss him and at this point, if he came back into my life I might even give him another chance, but deep down inside I know I shouldn't be with him. He put me through a lot and he was the one who gave up on us... love doesn't give up... people do. Trust that feeling deep down inside. 

I know it's hard guys and you probably think you won't ever find anyone like him, but you will and they will treat you so much better. Look at it this way, look at all the people on r/breakups they are going through the same thing you are going through and they just want to be loved as well! I put him on a pedestal and in my eyes he was perfect, but he isn't! The perfect person wouldn't leave you hanging, they wouldn't give up when things get hard. 

*GROUPON* I found some classes on there for a really good deal. I am taking yoga to keep myself busy!

**The feelings won't burn out unless you stop feeding yourself memories!**

Together for a year, first loves and all that jazz etc. She broke up with me in August because she didnt feel love me anymore. Fair enough, I accepted it and went strictly no contact straight away, deleted FB etc. It fucking hurt a lot though, times when I felt like my chest would burst how much I missed her, but to her I was a wall of silence. Also since we broke up she has slept with at least 40 guys, no exaggeration... Yeah, you can imagine how nice that was to hear! That was fucking horrible. Still kept that wall silence. If you're wondering how, I just knew something like that would drive her(and most other girls) crazy. And did till I ran into her in a club Monday.

I was having a fucking awesome time. It was the holidays, I was with my friends, we were doing shots, I did the wiggle in my boxers on the bar. Good times.
I was fucking buzzed and really happy and I literally ran into her, I caught her and just hugged her and said hi etc. We then started making out as I recall. She then stopped, looked at the ground and said ''I miss you, I've missed you so much''. I was like whhaaaaaaa and before I knew it we were outside talking.
A long, emotional, drunken talk. She said  she wanted me back, why havent I talked to her at all, she made a mistake blah blah. Well all the bitterness, anger and resentment I had been holding in over the past 4 months came streaming out. I said you missed me so much you just had to fuck every guy you came across, how fucking dare you, you think I'd just come running back into you arms after you were tired of one night stands. Yeah, it was not pretty. She cried, I cried. I went home that night, made some toast and fell asleep on the kitchen floor.

The next day I text her apologising for saying such awful things. We are broken up and whatever she does is none of my buisness no matter how much I hate it. She replied saying she deserved my anger and was sorry for how she handled things. I left it at that and did not reply.

Im not looking for advice, I know what I want which is not her, but I'd love to hear your perspective on the matter. Sorry if the post is a bit messed up, I am on my phone! Ask away any questions you have!

I did more research on breakups. I was snooping around my Ex's FB page (she never changed her password... I'm an idiot) and came across pictures of her with a guy she's hidden from public. Photos can mean a million things, but for the dumpee, it can suggest only one thing. After seeing those pics, I promised myself to never do that to myself again.

Anyways, I came across the **Grass is Greener Syndrome (G.I.G.S.)** which I've pulled information from two links:

* [Link 1](http://www.loveshack.org/forums/breaking-up-reconciliation-coping/breaks-breaking-up/251986-grass-greener-syndrome)
* [Link 2](http://www.enotalone.com/forum/showthread.php?t=265952)

Basically, it hits women from the ages of 20-25 when they have been in a long relationship for over two years. Best described in Link 1:

&gt;This is different from Mayday11's thread because the dumper leaves the relationship to pursue another relationship with another person. Not because they want to be free or enjoy life...etc. This type of relationship usually occurs immediately after the breakup, or starts a couple months before the breakup. The dumper is usually young 20-25yrs old. What happens in this kind of relationship is that the dumper is in a long term relationship with the dumpee for 2 years or longer, and the couple are about to make a larger commitment to each other. The dumper gets ""cold feet"" as things are getting stale, boring, and predictable. They start to wonder, what else is out there? Is there anything better out there? Is this all I'm going to have for the rest of my life? 


Link 1 has these symptoms of the breakup:


* Reasons for the break up are contradicting or sound like the dumper is grasping at straws for reasons. As if they are trying to convince themselves of it, too.

* Not much warning that something is going on before the actual break.

* An extreme change in lifestyle, such as suddenly starting to drink a lot, party a lot and hang around people they normally wouldn't.

* Wishy-washiness on the part of the dumper. They love you, but aren't IN love with you. They say that this doesn't mean you two are over forever and maybe someday down the road you'll be together again. At the same time, they'll tell you to move on.

* Quickly entering new relationships with people they aren't very compatible with.

The end gist of it is that the dumper may enter into a new relationship fast. The honeymoon stage of that relationship will be over and as time goes on, the partying, the going out, the ""grass is greener"" feeling will wane and eventually the dumper will realize how much better they had it with the ex.

Every suggestion has stated that there is really nothing the dumpee can do besides move on while the dumper experiences these new found freedoms. 


* **What I like**

In my personal thought, I think G.I.G.S. is accurate to some extent. My GF, in the last six months, has experiences completely new things. A new full time job, graduated college, hanging out with her aunt more and more, going out more and more (she used to have a curfew, believe it or not), and meeting about two dozen new faces and people.

It does accurate describe how some long term, young, relationship faulted. Being in a relationship for much of your youth, one does start to think about other options in life, especially when they are confronted with a new set of friends, social circles, and lifestyles. Can my current BF/GF work with what I seem to want in the future? Or are there better options out there?

* **What I don't like**

What I don't like about G.I.G.S. is the thought that the dumper will ""realize"" the grass ISN'T greener on the other side and come back to you. People change, especially in our early 20s, and they change for the better when they experience new things. The dumper may very well end up thinking about you after all the new experiences, but most likely not come back to you. Maybe for the dumper, the grass is greener. But there is also the saying that ""the grass is greener where you wet it the most""... not even sure what that means.

On a personal level, I want my ex back. I've read countless ""How to get your ex back"" eBooks and will hopefully try when the time is right. It's been 3 weeks of NC and I'll probably go on for 4-6 weeks. We share the same birthday and our birthday tomorrow and, well, I just wonder how it'll hit her to not have a birthday without me. G.I.G.S. is disheartening for me, since it offers no solution besides to move on. But every solution tells the dumpee to move on, so that isn't new.

I'll never understand why girls break up with me and/or leave me for less-attractive versions of myself, since I'm clearly ruggedly handsome and real-good at life. But I do know the red flags, the green lights, the pet peeves and the morning afters now. 

I toggle with inner peace, but the flip side is a heavy dose of liquor-fueled rampage. Step 1) Apply as needed. Open the bottle, wet your whistle, and repeat as necessary. Throw in Mr. Pillsfrom Friends and you're set for a rollicking ride of no shame, no guts no glory style. Step 2) Stay as busy as possible (preferably surrounded by friends) and say yes to damn near every invitation, short of a trip to the local meth lab (Without proper safety goggles and gear). Step 3) Rebound. Go hard in the paint like Charles Fuckin' Barkley. If nothing else, it will keep your self-confidence from taking a nose dive.

It didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. Today had been an awful day for me (for many reasons), but oddly enough, looking at her page didn't bother me. Most of her photos didn't seem to attract me as they once did. I even talked to my best friend about them, and even she agreed that she didn't look as pretty. Maybe it was her hair, maybe it was the make up. Maybe it's the fact that I'm moving on, or the fact that my best friend is lying to make me feel better (which in this context isn't really bad), I'm glad that I didn't break down or anything. I know I'm not completely over her, but I'm also happy to know that I'm not in that can't-live-without-her stage anymore. 

I'm not encouraging those who aren't ready to go look at their ex's pages, even for me, I thought it was a terrible idea right as I was about to click it. But I guess this post is a talk to all of you out there who still struggle with the smallest reminders of your exes that it does get easier with time. The knot in your stomach loosens up, and your anxiety levels tone down at thoughts of your ex. 

I know for many of us, these people were people we once envisioned marrying or spending the rest of our lives with. For some, that will end up happening, but for most, it won't. What's important to realize is that the world has so much to offer to us; we need to seize every opportunity, and realize that while grieving over our exes is normal (even healthy), doing so obsessively could blind us to meeting someone who will actually be *better* for us.

- I hate that you always made fun of my music or film taste
- Your film/music/food taste was always better than mine
- I hate that you made me feel like you were always improving me
- You made me feel like crap if i was too tired to have sex
- The first time things got tricky you said you would get me a wedding ring, I didn't want it. Your final reasons were that you didn't want a long term commitment. I hate that you lead me on with false security.
- You complained about my family and housemates to me. I know they weren't always easy, but you never had the sense not to bitch about the important people in my life to my face.
- I attended all those huge parties that make me uncomfortable with all your friends. I never knew what was going on and it was so hard, but i went to them for you. I felt so out of place with your friends, but they were nice, so i tried. You stopped bothering with my friends.
- I hate SO MUCH that you had decided a week before to end it. I knew you were being distant, and two weeks before i told you I felt I couldn't talk to you, and now I know why. I was going through a stressful time at university and your distance didn't help. 
- Towards the end you made me feel needy and lonely. You told me to see more of my friends, when I only wanted to spend a little time with you, not all of it.
- You had time to think through the break up, and I didn't. I saw it coming but it was still such a bloody surprise. You broke me. I wanted you out of my house. You brought my things around, how could you be so cut throat?
- I hate that even though I got the answers I needed a week later, it still hurts. I hear what I needed to hear. You o love me, but it has't been working, and we want different things.
- I hate that missing you ruins my mornings. I hate that I'm struggling to enjoy my final weeks and Uni before leaving because of this pain.
- I hate that I spent a year and a half with you learning to trust and be truly intimate, only to have to go through the whole thing again someday.
- I hate that you stopped loving me, that we couldn't remember the last time we said we loved each other, or even the last time we had sex.
- I hate that I can't talk to you and see how shit we're both feeling.
- I hate that I have to get on with things, though I probably will.
- I know it wasn't working, and there re so many things I'm glad I don't have to deal with anymore.

We have done the whole no contact thing and it's worked out great despite all the times I wanted to call or text or drive over to see him.
He's a good guy but he held me back from what I wanted to do.

I always wanted to see the world. It was my dream since I was a little girl. We talked about it for a while and we decided we would save up money and we would conquer Europe together. I saved and saved from every paycheck while he would spend and spend like no tomorrow. It wasn't his dream so it wasn't important to him. 

Once we broke up I went into a pretty long depression until I realized I lost myself. After my big realization I decided to act on my plans. I finally motivated myself to get out of my funk.

So, my boyfriend (26,M) and I (24, F) broke up about 8 months ago. It was the absolute worst break up of my life. I felt like I was going to die. I cried every day. I cried at work. I cried myself to sleep. I cried when I woke up, I cried in the shower. I just couldn’t get a hold of myself. 

We’d been together 3 years. We had a home together, pets together, friends together… a whole life together. I found out he was messaging other girls on Facebook, (inappropriate messages) he also tried to hook up with one of my friends one night when I wasn’t around, and he was just not being a good boyfriend in general. He never spent time with me, even though we lived together. He worked like crazy, would come home late at night all the time. He is an alcoholic also, when we *did* go out together, he’d usually end up embarrassing me by getting ridiculously drunk and doing something stupid. When I found out about the Facebook messages, I confronted him about them. I begged him for an explanation… he didn’t give me one or apologize. He just said he was unhappy and that’s why he did it... He left me and moved out the next day.

I was devastated. Even though he did all these terrible things, I begged him to stay with me, I loved him *so* much, even though we hadn’t been happy for a while. I couldn’t imagine my life without him. But he left me anyway. He moved out of our apartment and cut off all contact with me. Just like it was nothing to him. It was so painful… I moved out of our apartment a month later (couldn’t afford it on my own) and moved in with a friend. I fell into a deep depression for several months. It wasn’t until around 4 months later that I started feeling better. Started dating again, etc. All the while, my ex and I having no contact. (Not that I didn’t try… I tried several times over the first few months to get him to at least talk to me, to no avail).

So flash back to about a month ago. I texted him for the first time in several months… and said I think we should meet up and talk. I want to try to be friends or at least call a truce. We have a lot of mutual friends (we live in a very small town of about 11,000 people) and we’re going to run into each other. I don’t want it to be awkward or painful. I think enough time has passed that I feel this is a possibility. He surprisingly agreed. We planned to meet up face to face and have a quick chat and clear the air.

A couple weeks went by, and we still hadn’t met up. I kept instigating it, asking him when he wanted to. He’d keep telling me “this week is really busy” or “yeah we’ll meet up I’m just not sure when. Work is really busy right now” etc etc. He even made solid plans with me a couple times, and then texted me at the last minute to tell me he couldn’t make it. But all the while he would still text me. (Usually at nighttime… when he drinks). One time he even texted me at nighttime and said “I want to meet up, but I’m going to have a hard time with it. I’m still super attracted to you. I still think about you every day, I don’t enjoy what happened between us”. I knew he was drunk when he sent me that text, but it still gave me some hope.

Then one Saturday night, 3 weeks ago…  I was out with some friends, and had a few drinks in me, and I got bold. I texted him and said “You know what, let’s just forget this whole thing. You’ve been telling me for weeks now that you want to be friends and you want to meet up. But you clearly don’t, because it hasn’t happened yet. So I’m calling a deadline finally. If we don’t meet up this weekend once and for all, then let’s just forget the whole thing.” 

He texted me back right away (VERY unusual... normally it would take him several hours, or it would even be the next day) and said “I’m at home. Come over now if you want”. So I hopped in a cab and left my friends and went to his house to go ‘talk’ to him.

He met me at the door. We hugged and said hello. It was hard. He looked *good*. He said I looked good. He reeked of booze. He was clearly hammered… I was drunk too, but nowhere near what he was. And I had been out, drinking with friends and being social. He had been sitting home alone getting wrecked. 

We went and sat down and ‘talked’ for about 10 minutes.  Next thing I know, he’s pulling me onto his lap and kissing me. Next thing I know we’re in his bedroom and one thing led to another. The entire time, he’s telling me “you’re beautiful” and calling me babe and telling me he misses me.

Then he said something really strange to me afterwards… he said “Do you feel bad about yourself now?”  and I was like… “what…” and he said “you just slept with your ex boyfriend. Do you feel bad now?” and I jumped out of bed and started gathering my clothes because I found that very offensive and confusing. He said “I didn’t mean anything by that I’m sorry. Come back to bed”. 

We fell asleep cuddling after. I woke up the next morning and walked home… I left as soon as I woke up, I needed to clear my head and think about what had just happened. 

He texted me later that morning and said “did you get home ok” and asked me if I was ok with what happened. He kept text me all day (sober) and making small talk with me and he said “No regrets right?” and I said “no of course not, I don’t see why I should!”  (Because I thought it meant something to him… the fact we spent the night together. I was still in love with him and he knew it. Apparently it meant nothing, which I was about to find out).

So then he didn’t contact me for 3 days. I was waiting to see if he would, but he didn’t. I texted him and said “Hey how are you? I’d really like to meet up like we originally planned and actually talk about stuff. Because we didn’t really do that on Saturday! I’d really like it if we could still do that because I really would like to be friends”  (Now.. I don’t actually mean I want to be friends of course. I want to talk to him about getting back together now that we’ve had some time apart, because I’m still in love with him. But I don’t want to scare him off… so I just tell him I want to talk about being friends). He agrees and say’s “We’ll meet up this week”.

Now back to the making plans and ditching me thing again. We made plans about 5 or 6 times. And they never happened. He kept telling me why he didn’t have time, or that he had to do something with his family that night, or he has to work late, etc etc. 

After about 2 weeks of me trying to make plans with him again, I sent him a text that said “Ok, I understand what’s happening here now.. You got what you wanted from me, and now you’re done with me again. I have to say, that makes me feel pretty used and hurt”. He texted me back and told me once again, that he really does want to meet up and talk, and we will meet up this week. I said how about Saturday. He said ok.

So on Friday night (this Friday that just passed) I was at a friend’s house. (Who is a mutual friend of his and mine). She asked me if I had seen him yet since the night we spent together (she knew what happened). I said no, he keeps making plans with me but then changes his mind at the last minute. But we’re supposed to get together tomorrow. 

She said I have to tell you something, and maybe when I tell you, you’ll think twice about seeing him tomorrow. She said *the weekend* after he slept with me, he slept with another girl… (Specifically, a girl who doesn’t have a very good reputation around town). I couldn’t believe it. I never thought he could do that. And the weekend after he slept with me, was one of the weekends I’d asked him to hang out. He’d told me that he was driving to a city that was 7 hours away to pick up his sibling from school. Guess that was a lie.

So I’m pretty upset at that point, but I try not to show it. To be honest, I'm embarrassed by my own stupidity and I don't want my friend to know how upset her news has made me. Besides, it’s a Friday night, and this man has already caused me so much pain. I told myself if I’m gonna get upset I’ll do it later in private. 

So my friend and I know of this party going on that night in town. She knows I’m upset after what she just told me and says “Do you want to go? We don’t have to.” And I said “Fuck it, I need to go have some fun. Let’s go” We get a ride over to the party. As we pull up to the party…. I see my ex, and that girl he slept with the week after me… walking away from the party hand-in-hand… in the direction of his house.

Felt like a fucking knife through the heart. I wanted to jump out of the car and run after him and kill him. The amount of humiliation and hurt I felt at that moment was unbelievable. It’s one thing to hear it. It’s another to see it. My friend and I ended up going in to the party even though I just wanted to go home and cry. But I tried to stay and make myself have fun. I lasted about and hour, and then I just said I need to go home.

I get home … get my phone out, and send him an extremely long, heartfelt text message. Asking him what he was playing at, how could he do this to me. I even sent him a screen shot of one of the text messages he sent me where he was proclaiming how much he missed me. I sent him a screen shot of that and said “Remember this?” I told him I don’t understand how he could just use me that way. He *knew* I was in love with him still, and he saw me as an easy lay, and took it. And then tossed me out like a piece of trash. I said I don’t understand how someone who was supposed to be in love with me once could hurt me like this. I even said I would still forgive him... how pathetic of me.

I said if you are seeing this girl, please just fucking *tell* me, instead of stringing me along. No more bullshit. You could’ve just told me the truth after you slept with me, that you *still* didn’t want to be with me. Instead you kept making plans with me, and stringing me along, and leading me to believe maybe you still had feelings for me. I then I find out you’re fucking this girl? And then I see you leave the party with her tonight holding hands as I’m pulling in to the party… do you have any idea how cruel that actually was?” It said a bunch of other stuff too, but that was the gist of it. The part that killed me the most, was while those messages were getting sent to his phone, he was lying in bed with her most likely.

I went to bed at about 1 a.m. and bawled my eyes out for a good hour, then fell asleep.
The next morning I slept in late, until about 11 a.m. First thing when I wake up, I check my phone to see if he’s replied.
Of course he hasn’t.

I sent him a text and said “you have absolutely no conscious. You don’t even have the decency to answer me…”
And he replied back “Omg, I’m busy. I’m working. I don’t have time for this.”

It took *everything* in me not to reply back to that. I wanted to send him a nasty text message telling him what a fucking pig he is, and that he’s a sorry excuse for a human being etc etc. But I knew he wouldn’t care, so what was the point. He would probably just laugh at it and call me psycho.


So that last communication was on Saturday morning. And that’s the last I’ve heard from him.

I feel like an absolute fucking moron for being so naive. For thinking that maybe he still felt the same way about me. For thinking our night together meant the same thing to him that it did to me. 

I don’t know how I’m gonna get over it this time. I can’t get it off my mind. I’m having a hard time focusing at work. I want some way to make the hurting stop because I really honestly didn’t think there was any new ways for him to hurt me, but I was sadly mistaken.

**TL;DR** my ex boyfriend of three years who left me 8 months ago, used me for sex a few weeks ago. Don’t know how I’m going to put this one behind me.

i met my boyfriend just as all of these things were happening to me. it didn't occur to me until after we broke up just how much of the emptiness in my life that i was transferring onto him. he was my sole source of happiness and encouragement. i started to expect him to be there for me, to outweigh my crappy job and living situation and lack of a social circle. i used him as an emotional crutch, and as a distraction from the things in my life that REALLY needed my attention. i didn't find fulfillment in my own life, only in 'our' life. and the thing is, i didn't even realize i was unhappy with everything because just before we got together, i had school and friends and an active social life. he came right during the transition and i didn't notice the emptiness because he filled it. 

so, now that he's gone, i see how bleak my life really is. i see the things that i need to change, that i should have changed a long time ago. it's time to find a new job, it's time to move, it's time to build strong friendships again. it's going to be hard to do it alone and i'm really afraid. but it's time to be responsible for my own happiness again.

It's okay to cry sometimes! You're going through an unmanageable amount of stress after a major loss in your life, and crying is a natural way of coping. Don't fight it, bawl your eyes out, seriously. It can help in those moments when you know something important to you has died, and there's nothing you can do about it.

I was doing okay-ish after several weeks of NC. It felt like I was slowly moving in the right direction, despite still being hopelessly in love with someone foolish enough to leave me. Yesterday morning I had an eyelash in my eye and blew it off my finger to make a wish; I wished he would send me a message or some sort of sign that he still loved me, sweep me off my feet and tell me everything is going to be okay...

Then he actually did send me a message, but it wasn't the kind that I had wished for. He didn't say he loved me, that he was sorry about everything, and that he wanted to fix things between us. He just wants to be friends now, that's all. This wasn't a surprise to me, it's what he said when we broke up. I'm just a friend to him. 

Those words shouldn't cause as much pain as they do, but hearing ""friend"" from someone that I thought I'd be marrying someday... every time he says it I can feel my heart breaking a little bit more. It's like there's a knife in my chest and the tissue around it was starting to heal up, but then he comes and jiggles the knife so the wound stays fresh. Needless to say, last night was one of those times where I *needed* to cry, because there was nothing else I could do. 

For any of you out there having a similarly rough night, there are some songs I'd like to share. Be warned, they are all sad and they *will* make you tear up. If they don't, then congratulations on being over your breakup!

It was four years. It's been three weeks.

By the end of it you were as exhausted as I was. The jealousy, walking on eggshells, being careful what I said or did. We had problems before the procedure. You begged me to not make you go through with it. I was scared. I was convinced we weren't ready. It's been eating at you ever since and you always assumed it didn't affect me as strongly. You will never know how wrong you are. My defence mechanism consisted mostly of trying to forget and hope one day the pain went away, but it never did. You were vocal about your pain and I was hoping it wouldn't destroy us, but that was futile. I will regret that decision for the rest of my life and every day I think about what my child would look like today.

I wanted to be with you for the rest of my life. You will never know that I was ready to propose. We talked about it from time to time and you always seemed excited. Sometimes I think I waited too long, but other times I knew we weren't ready. What if things didn't change after we were married? Chances are they would be the same, only with the added pressure of being in a marriage. What good is there in that? 

So now here we are. You have your life and your things, I have my life and my things. My family has joked about how long our separation will last this time, but they don't understand how committed you are to forgetting about me. I, on the other hand, can't. I want to know that all this pain and suffering will somehow make you happier in the long run without the assumption it will. How else am I supposed to know this without contacting you? I know you are too kind a person to leave me hanging if I started talking to you again. So it is essentially up to me to make sure I don't break my promise and leave you alone. This is infuriating. 

I don't care about how I feel anymore. I've accepted that I will never be as happy as I was with you and I am oddly okay with it. At least we had the time we had together and hopefully you are able to find a better place to be than with me.

I don't regret helping you move and painting your apartment for you. I don't regret spending all the time I did and money I did on you. I don't regret trying awkwardly to get to know your family to improve relations. I don't regret cooking you meals for school. I don't regret the trips we took. I don't regret buying us a bed to sleep in together, despite the fact I know someone else will sleep in it with you one day. I don't regret pouring myself into you until I was dry, and then pouring some more. 

Somehow I know I've come way from this a better person. Maybe not happier and definitely not as comfortable, but this experience has taught me more than anything ever has. I know what love means now and I know how to accept love. Thank you for showing me that. I am sad now, but I am glad I am able to experience this deep a sorrow. It's a strangely good feeling to know I can feel an emotion this strongly. There was a time when I thought I was dysfunctional and couldn't feel things as strongly as I should, but you have helped me prove that wrong as well. Thank you.

A part of me will always be waiting for you, but I have myself to work on a well. I have problems that need addressing and I would feel like all this torment is a waste if I didn't at least attempt to deal with myself. You are stronger than you think, even if you don't believe you are. I hope you meet great people, do great things, raise a great family, and have a wonderful life.

Goodbye and good luck,

1364923269.0,19,self.BreakUps,1biyt9,To Everyone going through a Break up,23,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1biyt9/to_everyone_going_through_a_break_up/,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to let all of you know It will get better. For me its been almost a month. I did everything I knew to try and get her back. But yesterday I posted this on face book,

""First I would like to thank everyone for the happy birthday wishes and apologize that it took me this long to respond to all of you. I have been going through a break up and it really hit home for me. I have been feeling down the last few weeks since before my birthday. I am writing this to tell everyone something and open up to tell everyone who I am and what I stand for.
I lost my father 2 years ago, and it devastated our family. We all grieve in our own way. I stepped up and became that rock for my mom to help her grieve. I became that advice/shoulder, for my little brother and I became reliable for my other brother. I guess I never really grieved; I just pushed through the feelings. About a month before my Father died I met a very beautiful woman named Marissa, she was “seeing” my best friend Patrick. I remember telling my dad when it was just him and I that “She was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen”. After Patrick and Marissa called it quits after a few months went by I started talking to Marissa and her amazingly unique son Merrick. I spent time with them and I truly fell in love with both of them.
With her I was able to open up and truly find myself and who I can become. With her son he showed me that it’s not always about discipline but showing how to do something correctly. They opened my eyes in many ways, when we first started dating and telling me about her son, I told her that I didn’t want to be his friend I wanted to be his father. I was able to fully love with no restrictions; I did everything for her to help her with her studies and him with his. She became my best friend. I wanted to call him son so many times. Stuff went down and well now I am hurt. Instead of telling you the story I will tell you this. When people say time will heal all wounds I don’t agree.
I am currently in the bad state of mind, feeling down on myself and helpless. I have high blood pressure now and also have been having panic attacks. So to get over them I am telling you about me. I am the type of guy that will give you my whole, I am a Strong, Caring, Loyal, Trusting, and I work hard at everything. I am that guy that would give some stranger money by over hearing a conversation that they had saying that they spent their money on having a wonderful time with friends but don’t have enough money for gas to get back home. I do things for people to see them smile hoping that they will turn around and show another complete stranger the same generosity I gave them. I guess I am rambling on. I want to fight for what I want and love. ""  


After that post I realized after my phone blew up from my friends and family all of them where crying because of what I wrote. I was always the person to turn to when needing advise. Now I guess that was me asking for help and realizing who I am and what I stand for.   It made it a lot easier for what just happened. Text with her basically saying that she was pissed that I used her name and her son's name. I told her Sorry but everyone on my fb knows who you are. So I asked for the rest of my stuff back, told her that she gave up on me. Told her that we had passion and love and you tossed it all away. Told her that Right now I feel like my heart was ripped out and being abandoned by my best friend. I said to her to drop off the rest of my stuff at my mom's so she didn't have to see me. 

Knowing that its over I feel fine now. Because that person that sent me the texts was not her. Not the person that I fell in love with. It gave me the courage to tell her not to text me not to call me. I gave her permission to check in on me in 3 months. So that gives me the goal of using this time to focus on my self and Work hard for who I am and who I want to be. So that when she checks in with me I can tell her to and show her what she missed. And look at her and see where she is at and say this is where you could have been with me reaching my goals you lost everything.  

I have the power I have the strength, I will push on and LIVE, and LOVE again! But not until later. I want to work on myself and get back what I lost due to this break up.

Something that I guess made me focus and realize everything, I was outside having a smoke, I just sat there feeling shitty. Going over everything that my friends and family said to me. I stood up and said my Fully name, I am Strong, I have loved, I have lived, I know who I want to be, I am loyal, I am trusting, I have faults. I am the son of ( said my fathers name ) said he was everything I wanted to be and everything that makes him a real man. This morning I feel good I know what I need to do, I need to find myself again and help myself become stronger.


So if any of you need to talk need to hear someone's voice to help you to motivate you to be there for you. I am always willing to help. If you want to call me text me or skype chat me I can and will be there for you. Just Message me.

Yet there you are. There's only so many distractions I can pack into a day. And when the day is finished, you haunt my dreams to the point where it's a struggle to stay awake during the day because if I sleep, I am calm and even happy for awhile.

You knew that I had never ""loved"" anyone before. You knew I didn't trust others easily… You knew these things and so much more about me. Yet you accepted me and brought these feelings out in me. I never thought I was unhappy before, but having you in my life I finally knew happiness. 

I don't even believe the line he fed you, how could you? Believing he was gay and wanted to experiment with a girl for the first time… But maybe that's all it takes for you to open your legs. A cheap line and for him to be there while I am here.

The way you built me up… Brought those feelings out in me… Then abandoned me so easily for him... Broke me. There are reasons why I don't trust people, and the one time I reach out... *sigh*

When I said my goodbye to you last week, I said many things; I wished you happiness,  told you that I could not go back to being friends with you while you were with him. I told you I hope that one day you contact me to rekindle our friendship. I regret saying all those things, because every day I grasp onto that tiny bit of hope and it pulls me down. Every. Single. Time.

Someone told me that I know what I'm missing now, and I'll soon find someone else. They are partially right. I do know what I'm missing. But I'm not sure I will have the strength to go through such a moment again, let alone trust someone else.

So this is me… Actively trying to forget you from this moment on. I don't know how I'll do it. Perhaps just saying the words in a place where someone will read them is enough. I don't know. All I know is that I need to move on.

No contact worked great the first time and so I think it will work this time.

The reason you need to get into no-contact mode is because you need to get used to not having him around. Very, very tough but possible.

Most people say find a new hobby, hit the gym etc. etc. but what seems to be working for me is minor weekly goals that keep me super busy. 
For example, 

1. I downloaded 5 books and told myself that no matter what I need to finish them in a month. And these are serious books, that will allow me get into the minds of characters and for sure I will learn a thing or two by the end of it.

2. Work out at least 4 times a week. No excuses. And also have minor weekly gym goals [example, deadlifted 90 lb this week, make it 100 lb in 2 weeks]

3. Finish up with some paperwork that I've been postponing forever

4. Some work related goals 

5. Bake some cookies for coworkers


When you tell yourself that no matter what, you need to accomplish a list of tasks, then you just won't have time to think about your ex. After all, there's only 24 hrs in a day. Tire yourself out every day, so that when you lay your head on your pillow you'll fall asleep within 10-15 minutes.

Chin-up. Things will get better.

To be honest I'm not really sure I need helping, I think I'm OK.

I just got dumped from my first real relationship. It was only a couple of months long, but it was a big step for me. A few months before she met me she came out of a 7 year relationship. It was awesome for a while, but she eventually started to seem withdrawn. She went away for a week, and on the day she came back she dumped me. Said she feels like she needs some time to only have to worry about herself for a change, she needed to be single. Pretty simple really. In the end, it's over, the details ultimately don't matter. It was all very civil. I'll miss her.

What's struck me most is that in a way, this doesn't feel all bad. I liked her a lot, and obviously would have preferred to stay with her, but in the end I'm thankful to have spent the time I did with her, even only for a couple of months. 

Before I met her I'd never thought myself capable of being in a relationship. I overcame that with her. I got over my issues with intimacy. She overcame her trust issues. I think we both left each other better than we were.

The thing that strikes me most is this though, this experience has opened up a a new side of life for me. In a way, I'm excited about all the new people I can meet. I know I am capable of being in a relationship now. If even one person on this planet could take that kind of interest in me, there chances are, overwhelmingly, that there are more.

It's been three days. While I'm not exactly planning on running and finding the nearest girl to start something new with, I'm not going to close myself off from the possibility either. One of the best parts of life is the people you meet along the way. Some you'll be closer to than others. Sometimes your connections might only last an evening, sometimes they last til one of you dies, but there is no such thing as an everlasting relationship. This isn't a reason not to get involved though. in a way, the finite and fragile nature of these little connections you forge with others is what makes them so special.

In a nutshell, I think what I've learned is this: Yes break ups hurt. Yes, an important part of your life is gone, but I think most of the time the badness is worth it because of the good.

I sent him a message about getting him his things back and he ignored it so I just dropped them off at his parents this morning for him to collect when he's home for the holiday.

I gave everything back but the bear he gave me at the beginning of our relationship. With time, I'll let that go, but I've made a lot of progress in these past two weeks. I will allow myself the bear until I can fully let the whole thing go. All of his things were just sitting in the trunk of my car so I wouldn't have to look at them but I was really just taking a piece of him everywhere I went. It feels good to be rid of it.

His parents were sweet. His mother told me we could still talk, go out for coffee and that he didn't need to know as she winked at me. She was sweet. It made me laugh.

I sent him another message informing him that his things were at his parents and that I'd like him to either ship my things back or bring them home with him when he's back for the holidays.

I feel a lot better. A lot lighter. Like I can start moving forward now.

I have been posting and spending a lot of time here recently as I am currently going through a break up (as are a lot of us), and I am finding this subreddit a really positive helpful place. So I just want to start by thanking you all.
 

What we are going through/gone through is hard, there is no doubt. But I have been through a few break ups and even though they always hit me really hard (I must be sensitive) I have always come out on top... eventually. 


Let me give you some insight into who I used to be and will be again, before I spin you my tales.


Im a 26m, I've always been a hugely confident social creature. Egotistical and arrogant but kind and caring. I have a lot of time for people but I take huge amounts of pride in my personal achievements. I do jokingly play up to my ego sometimes but thats just me. The downside is that when something like this happens, my ego is shattered and well thats when the dark spiral starts. So here I am, on the spiral. But as much as it hurts, as much as I am a mess, I know that this will not always be the case, I just have to find myself again. I'm in here somewhere, 
always have been.


I wanted to share with you guys a story about my most fucked up relationship. This is not the current heartache I am feeling now but several years (and several girls) before. I'll try and keep it as brief as possible. 


I went to a university where the ratio of girls to guys was 1 - 8. It was in a shitty little town and I saw a lot of people around me turn to drugs and alcohol to ease this. Lets just say it was not a very inspirational place. Luckily for me though my home city was only a 40min train journey away so I could go home at weekends and catch up with my friends and family, party, play music, and do photography.


However, I was still stuck in this horrible place for 5 days a week. Single, alone... not very happy at all. I didn't enjoy my course, I felt I had made a huge mistake but I kept at it. I'd come from a world of a huge social scene into a tiny inhospitable place where the elderly came to die. 


I digress. 


So anyway, one weekend I went home, back to my city and went to the club we used to frequent. Whilst there I bumped into a girl I used to work with... well I say worked with she started just as I was leaving for uni. Anyway I knew that she wanted me even then so I thought 'go for it.' Which I did, and yeah I ended up back at her place. 


I guess I should of started to sense something was wrong from the start, but I was just happy to have someone in my life again I ignored all the warning bells. 


So we start doing the usual stuff you do, texting and what have you. Then I was back in town again, and we met up and went back to her place, this time however, she tells me about her and her ex bf who is still living with them, but having a hard time about it. I think ok EX bf, bit strange but its ok.. Until I got a punch in the face. 


Fair enough I guess. Still silencing those warning bells. So a few months go by, I've introduced her to my friends who took instant dislike to her, I didn't understand why and just carried on silencing those warning bells. I'm laughing about this now, but I fell for her, although in hindsight its hard for me to understand how that happened, I guess I was just happy I wasn't lonely anymore plus all the sex. Ok so, lets get to the really fun to read, really fucked up parts.


This girls, it turns out, had massive mental health issues and was also an alcoholic. You may ask; how did you not notice? Well I was not around 5 days out of 7. It is easy to hide stuff over the phone or through texts, I knew she partied a lot but I trusted her. 


This wasn't kept hidden for long though, and instead of doing the rational thing I thought I could save her. She was deeply unhappy and I thought; all it will take is my love! ...WRONG! 


Things got really fucked up after this. 


It all started one night when I was having a guys night, hanging out with my friends as I hadn't seen them in ages, she was off with her mates somewhere in the city and that was cool. Then I get a text saying that everyone has left her and she had an argument someone wants to beat her up or something. I ask her where she is, 'No one hurts my woman, I will save you!' going through my head. She tells me, its not far across the city centre so I bid goodbye to my friends and run like hell to her. 


When I find her she is in a mess, totally pissed up, make up streaming, crying her eyes out. She lived in the city so it was only a short walk home... a walk which involved a lot of her shouting at random passers by, but i got her there eventually... without getting punched (achievement unlocked!). Once we got into her apartment, thats when the fun really began. 


First thing she does is crack open another bottle of wine, something which I had tried to prevent but could not stop. Then she turns and rounds on me. At this moment I am currently getting shouted at and belittled by this girl but I think it's ok, she is just drunk. She moves to the window to have a smoke, then in a dark voice starts talking about jumping out. 


""you know I wont let you do that.""


So I move to the window next to her to grab her if she tries anything. After a while of this she locks herself in the bathroom and wont speak to me. I'm trying to text my friends to get some backup if I need it, but by now its late and everyone has gone home. It's ok, I can deal with this. 


When she comes out she is bleeding, she had taken a razor or something to her arms, I stood there shocked, but instinct took over and I new I had to get plasters or bandages on the cuts, something she really did not want me to do. I get some and try to put them on her, but this ends in shouting and eventually a look in her eyes that make me think she is considering attacking me. However something changes in her head and she allows me to dress the cuts and put her to bed.


Lets just say I didn't get much sleep that night. The next day we went out for breakfast and she was obviously very very ashamed of what had happened. I'm a fool, I should of run then but I didn't. 


After that, things went down hill quickly and she started to mess with my head using all sorts of devious techniques, she cheated on me, then when I got pissed of turned around so it was all my fault, it got to a point where I eventually had enough and left. This wasn't the end though.


I still cared for her, and she was still messing with my head, all thoughts of doing well at uni now a distant memory. After uni finished I came back, I'd done shit I was depressed and I had no job with no prospects of getting a job in the field I had studied (thats ok though because I have finally found my passion in life). Argh digressing again.


Right, so I'd come back and ended things with this crazy person, but she wasn't having any of it. She knew I still cared and I could not walk away from someone in so much pain, I still thought I could help. But I was trying to stay away. 


Until one night. I will always remember this night, even as I type this I can't believe that I actually saw and dealt with it, I always figured that there are people who have seen and dealt with worse so it wasn't that bad. For me though, yeah it was bad. 


I was at home drowning my sorrows with my brother playing some computer games, when I receive a text message from her.
Even after all these years I still remember this message word for word:


""It's my time to die now, I will always love you.""

WTF!!!! I freaked, tried to call several times, no answer on the mobile, no answer on the house phone. Shit! I can't let her kill herself!! I've got to get over there! 


I had £10 left in my bank account, I knew the taxi fair would be roughly that much, so I jumped in a cab and rushed over there. I'd had to get out further down the road to get the drivers money from a cash machine. So I walked down the street to where she lived. Her apartment building had an adjacent car park with a wall and gates around it, as I walked down the road I saw sitting on the street just outside the entrance gate a figure. I knew it was her, I got closer. This is what I saw:


She was pretty much lying in the street in a short dress no coat, totally out of her mind on alcohol and god knows what else, covered in blood.


Ah. This is bad.  


I couldn't get much sense out of her but I new I needed to get her inside and patch her up, some of the cuts on her shoulders looked pretty deep. I did not even think about what I was seeing, something just kicked in and I just dealt with. I managed to convince her to come inside with me, she was still pretty out of it but she was crying and telling me how it had all happened whilst I cleaned up her cuts, put plasters and bandages on. I can't remember exactly what she told me but basically it was all drug and alcohol induced. 


I managed to settle her down, and we talked about getting her some help, and I promised I would help her get the help she needed. I lay with her a while until she calmed down. We were talking and then everything changed and she went dark. You know in the movies when someone someone decides to do something like give up their live to save the others or something, and they talk in that quiet cold certainty? 
Thats exactly what she was like, it was like she had a realisation and everything was so clear. She asked me to help her. 


""Yes! Yes I will help you! We will make sure you get better."" I replied

""I don't think you understand. I want you to help me commit suicide."" She said in a cold voice full of certainty whilst staring directly into my eyes, unblinking. 

""No! I will do everything I can to prevent that from happening."" 

""You can't be here all the time, you can't stop me.""


Then she got naked and tried to have sex with me, but I refused. And the world exploded. She went totally and completely (as a friend of mine put it) bat shit crazy. I told her to get some sleep and left the room, I needed a smoke, this was all going mental. 


As I was rolling my smoke in the living room of the apartment she tried to make a break for it. She ran out of her room, in just a dressing gown, with her hand bag and car keys and stumbled towards the front door. She was still really really drunk and couldn't work the handle on the door, so I walked towards her slowly telling her I wouldn't let her leave. She was screaming about driving back to her parents house, I tried to take the keys, she almost attacked me, and finally got out the door. I chased after her. We were in the landing now, and she was heading for the elevator. She pressed the button, I got there, the doors opened. She got in, I stood so that the doors couldn't close, all the while she is screaming at me. I wouldn't move. She eventually realised that I wasn't going to budge, got out of the elevator and sat down on a wall opposite, I sat next to the elevator doors and I could hear noises of people returning from nights out on lower floors wondering what would happen if anyone stumbled upon this scene.


She sat there sobbing and occasionally shouting at me then crying more. I just sat there staring at her, hardly blinking waiting for her to try and make another move. This went on for about 20 - 30 minuets. No one came up. I was considering calling an ambulance. Then another switch in her head and she got up and decided to go to bed. I followed her back into the apartment and lay on the bed next to her fully clothed making sure she didn't try and do a runner again. Luckily this wasn't the case. 


I was thinking about what I could do, how could I stop all this. I got up early the next day about 6am, and decided to leave. Just as I was about to go she came out, and just looked at me. I told her that was it, I was going and left. 


I got a text from a friend of mine asking me to go check on her bf who was ill (he is also a close friend). When I got there I told him everything that had happened. 


In the end, I had to call up her family and tell them. From what I heard, they took her away for a while and got her some help. Although judging by the angry texts and answer phone messages I got at the time it is clear she didn't actually mean anything she said, it was all a manipulation game. 


Why am I writing this? 


At the time I didn't see any effect on me psychologically and I was wondering what that was going to be. Well it has, but in a way I did not expect; I always assume the worst, and have problems believing things which girls I date say to me, when things go bad I freak out, over thing and assume the worst, it has given me some trust issues and I guess I'm always waiting for the craziness (I do seem to attract them). It has taken me loosing my last SO to realise that it is time to get some help. It wasn't those things that drove us apart, I don't want to go into that. But this has made me think it is time I confronted things from my past to make my future better.


I hope if you are reading this then you never have to go through anything like that, and I hope that maybe this post will make you feel that what happened between you and your SO, whilst bad, wasn't totally fucked up to the point of insanity. If I can get over that, I can get over this. 


If I can get over that, then so can you. 

Any questions or PM's welcome.

Stay strong :)

This here is a little technique that I read about years ago, during my first real break up. I applied and I do believe, in the long run, it did help. Here I am today, using it again, and I thought I would share it with you fine folks. It is called The Fast Forward Technique, however I cannot credit its inventor since I have long ago lost track of him/her :( 

''STEP 1: Feel whatever it is you are feeling and notice how and where you feel it. For example many people feel emotional hurt in their chest or heart (that is why it is called heart break). But, that may or may not be true for you. Now just focus on your feeling and ask yourself silently or aloud the following:

Can I allow this feeling?
And then answer. It doesn’t matter if it is a Yes or No.

STEP 2: Ask “Could I let this feeling go?” Again, a Yes or No is acceptable.

STEP 3 Ask “Would I let this feeling go?”

STEP 4 Ask “When?” 

STEP 5 Now examine the feeling again. Does it feel different? Did you feel a shift? The shift is different for everyone, but is a sign of small healing. You want to feel how your feeling has changed and repeat steps 1 thru 5. 

The Fast Forward Technique should not be a struggle. In fact, it will usually feel quite warm and soothing. 

You will want to do 2 or 3 sessions a day. One session may be 5 or 6 repetitions or more through the 5 steps.''

I am a stubborn ass sometimes, and will emotionally freeze someone out if they refuse to acknowledge that I'm angry. I spend a lot of time thinking about what I want my partner to do to fix things, and don't spend enough time thinking about what I could do. I also noticed that I tend to feel emotionally affronted easily, as in, I get offended about stupid little things. I start taking my partner for granted after awhile, so I don't try as hard to control my bad moods. Also, comparing my relationship to other real or fictional relationships is a problem for me.

I also realized that I am a fun person who doesn't like to sit around. I chase new experiences, and get inspired by positive people around me. I love to care for others, and need to be with someone who will let me nurture them.

Whew! Feels good to write that out. I'm hoping that by identifying the parts of my personality that create problems for me in relationships, I will be able to work on them, and stop creating drama where there needs to be none.

We started talking again. It felt right, like a new relationship was starting. Like I was developing a brand new crush. Then we decided to hang out as ""friends."" Ha. We both knew what was happening.

We spent Friday night together. I was happy, but had no idea where it was going, or what I was doing. I have a terrible habit of over-thinking things until they become convoluted. I decided that I wouldn't do that this time. I would go with my gut.

We hung out again on Sunday. I overcame my fear of rejection and told her what I wanted, what I thought would make both of us happy. She had her reservations, but I convinced her that we could make it work again, that it wouldn't be the same as before, that I wouldn't use her as a crutch. She agreed to give us a shot, if we went slow. I was fine with that. Between that, and my parents calling off their divorce that same week, I was ecstatic.

Tuesday, we hung out again, and it felt...right. I tried to take it slow, I initiated nothing. But...she kissed me in the kitchen. And grabbed my hand in the car. And as the day progressed, my cautious optimism became full blown conviction, that I was doing the right thing, that we would get back together and be happier for it.

But , as the week progressed, she grew colder, and my new found confidence slowly faded. Tuesday was to be our final chapter, but I didn't know that yet. I convinced myself that she was busy, that she had shown her true colors on Tuesday. 

Finally I broke down, and on Friday, I asked her if something was wrong. She told me that, apart from her disapproval of my drinking habits, that it was nothing. She said she still wanted to try. And then her texts grew warmer, and my optimism returned. She left town for a convention. I stayed on campus and hung out with friends and had a great weekend, apart from some unfriendly yellow jackets and a punch in the stomach. 

She returned on Sunday, having barely communicated over the weekend. It didn't bother me. Irrational jealousy was a skin I had shed. I was, however feeling a little down. My parents reconciliation had been short lived, and the divorce was back on. I called her, wanting to talk about it and perhaps grab some dinner. Then it happened. 

She didn't want to try anymore. Her ""effort"" lasted 6 days and one 5 hour hang out session. She had decided over the weekend. She said she wasn't entirely sure, but that she had to go with her gut. I think she was afraid of getting hurt. 

I don't hold it against her though. She's doing what she thinks will make her happy. I want her to be happy. Even if I'm crushed. It feels like too much weight to bear. Everything was looking up; my family was staying together and I was to have my first love and best friend back. It was a week of bliss. I walked around with the biggest smile...

Then, in a four hour period, a large part of my world was obliterated, and I was cast back into the void that had taken me 3 months of therapy and many destructive decisions to emerge from. I feel a little better than I felt yesterday, but I know this will be another roller coaster ride. And sometimes...I feel like I don't have it in me for another ride. But what other choice do I have? I'm afraid to die, yet afraid to try and live again.

http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zxfsl/my_ex_19f_was_raped_last_night_am_i_20m_wrong_for/

Based on the feedback I got in the comments from my post, I decided to be the better man and visit her. Unfortunately however, I had to tell the nurses on duty that I was her ""boyfriend"" before they let me in to see her. That rehashed some feelings that I wasn't wanting to feel, but I handled it like a champ I think.

When I got into her room she was curled on in a ball looking out of her window (facing away from me so she didn't see me come in), it was fairly obvious she was extremely traumatized. I took a deep breath and said ""Hello"", and her head spun around at breakneck speed (I can only assume this has to do with the drama and paranoia of being raped, or maybe her expecting me not to show up)

Long story short, we talked. She explained to me what happened and how she was out the night prior, brought a guy home, and when she refused to have sex with him he forced himself on top of her. I won't lie, it reopened a lot of wounds for me. But as suggested in the comments of my previous posts I was able to ask her why she couldn't do the same for me when I was need. And I got my answers.

As I expected she tried to become touchy with me, trying to hold my hand and asking me to hold her in her bed. But I refused. It hurt a lot but I know it was the right thing.

You shouldn't care, fuck her. This other guy? Yeah he's just some desperate prick, he's gunna wind up in the gutter somewhere and your ex will never find someone as good as you or someone who treates her half as well. And in 6 months time you'll be a million times the man she'll ever know because you'll have some new great looking girl who you'll just click with and you'll wish it was her you found 5 years ago so you never had to bother with your ex!

He'll be getting take away's every night, he'll be drinking and having fun and hell yeah he'll have a good couple of months! But then it'll be over, he'll have wasted part of his life and it'll take him longer to fix it! Infact, the fucker wont fix it because he's not a fraction of the man you are, he can't just set his mind on something and DO IT. He'll see that your doing fucking amazing and wish he could be you.
When shit happens to you, make you happen to shit. Don't worry about what she's doing, fuck her, she doesn't care about you so why should you give a shit about what she's doing? I'm going through a similar thing, she broke up with me, got with another guy the next day.

I'm a 22m that went off for a few months to go work and save up for school. My 22f ex had just graduated, and we were deeply involved with eachother. She went through the summer unemployed and made a sudden decision to take space from the relationship and go and independent. After failing to meet up multiple times on my days off, she confessed that she no longer loved me. I knew the space she had asked for was for herself but I had no idea she was/had grown away from me. 

A few days ago I finally realized that things will now never regrow and after sending her a long sappy letter (big mistake, I opened up so much, I have it if you want) she replied with, ""I appreciate it so thanks."" I was defeated, had hit rock bottom and cried for hours. But after reading every bodies posts here, I realized that I'm not alone in this world of pain and suffering. 

I learned that no matter what happens, you need to look back and reflect and become a better person from it, and that's exactly what I did. Although we both made mistakes, I can't resent her or regret the things I've done because being driven by so many emotions will make you do things that are crazy. That happened. 

So guys, I'm cutting contact with her, and as much as it hurts, I'm focusing on myself, my future and other things in life that make me amped to be alive. I'm still sad as ever but people like you give me faith that I'll without doubt meet the lady of my dreams someday.

It will set you free to be you. Anger only ties you to them. You do not need to forgive them for their sake, but your own. You may have to remind yourself that you have forgiven them, but it is worth it. Forgiveness does not mean opening the door to letting them hurt you again.

In the movie Sex and Mrs. X, the main character makes a point to her prodigy that she must change for herself and if the husband comes back then she gets to choose if she wants him or not. He had abandoned her for another woman. When he wanted to come back, she had changed so much that she realized she was better off without him.

Accept Yourself

There is a saying that ""no one can hurt you without your permission."" Well, I don't think that is quite accurate, however there is a truth to it. The choices you make when you encounter abandonment and rejection are a testament to your character. It may hurt like hell, and maybe you might shoot daggers with your eyes if you encountered them, but if you will make the decision not to accept bitterness as an option, or find another way to handle this punch then you can come out better. The main thing isto acceptyourself forwho you are. Ifyou cannot accept you then how can you expect anyone to? You have to be valuable in your own eyes before anyone else can see your true worth.

I went through a period of depression, anxiety, restlesness.. she was my life and I thought that's all that I had. After much struggle I pulled myself out of it. reconnected with my friends that I haden't talked to in a while, started being more social again, began to eat better &amp; work out, and most importantly I found myself again. I still have a lot of work to do but I am happier than I've ever been. I realized she was sucking myself out of me, supressing who I really am/was. 

People shouldn't do that to one another. If your relationship is draining who you really are, get out. Its not worth it. In the end you are the only one that matters.

I want to thank this community. I got a lot of great advice from here. The best of all advice was to find myself again, which is going to be different for everybody.

* Read this one first: [NO CONTACT: Why you shouldn't be friends/in contact with your ex - Dramallama](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ssdtr/no_contact_why_you_shouldnt_be_friendsin_contact/)

* How much time has past. In term of weekends or mondays how many have past 2 weekends? maybe 4 mondays? it's too soon. Set a monthly deadline to check up on how you feel on contacting them again. 

* Focus on yourself, heal lost friendships, do stuff you never did going out with them, go on holiday, learn to be happy and alone. So the next relationship is better.

* Don't put them on a pedestal, remember them at their most stupid. Laugh and don't take them seriously 

* They broke up with you. It wasn't working out. They might still care for you,feel guilty or want to see you casually, but they reached a stage where there are no romantic feelings. More rejection will just leave you more hurt. Move on because they are going to and you don't want to be around to see it. 

* If you contact them now for a friendly chat, how will they know that they hurt you.

* You tried, there is nothing left for you or them to say/do which would make it better. Respect each other with no contact. They know how you feel.

* Longer you live without them the stronger, more proud you become for yourself. No contact makes you and them a better person. Improve yourselves. No e-stalking.

* How have you changed as a person since the last contact. If you're the few who do get back together, good chance you'll end up back here if it is too soon. 

* Don't give them the temptation to keep you around for nice company/dating practice/FWB until they find someone else. It makes you both weaker as people.

* If you're on a break or they're 'not ready'. You cannot hang on their hook it'll hurt you. Plus being the back up plan means they don't respect your feelings. They're being selfish and have low opinions of your chances alone, prove them wrong. Living in denial is nice, but prolongs the pain.

* Were you a couple? Seriously, was it even a healthy relationship or was it a terrible struggle in a swamp of happiness. Maybe you were two just good friends who dated and got it badly wrong. Let time heal the friendship. 

* You're hurt, you are not in a fit emotional state to talk to them

* Think, if you broke up with someone, would a emotional phone call change your mind? probably not, might make it worse.


* Day dreaming about them? Stop. Change it to someone else or make it about them as a friend or on 'like bro/sis' terms.

* Are you just feeling lonely. Early morning, end of the day, alone at home? Just call up a friend for a social chat or get onto OKCupid and get a new pen pal. 

* There is no 'The One' there is nothing special or unique about either of you. If they are the first, you'll never forget them, sadly majority of firsts never work out.

* Want to tell them your current feelings? write it down but don't send it to them. You'll know when you've fully moved on when you re-read it and those emotions are alien to you.

* If they made a mistake, NC &amp; time will help them see this, if you're lucky. NC leaves them the window for a return if they miss you. If they broke up with you, it's up to them to break NC.

* Do you want to be the one that got away, or the one that wouldn't go away. ",,False,,t5_2ra79,1344330808.0,,,True,t3_wdohk,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/wdohk/surviving_no_contact/,

I don't usually fall in love. I don't like the vulnerability it gives you.. You are so easily hurt when you're in love. But, as it always goes, I did. There's that guy, Thomas (22M). I know most of you are going to shake your heads in disbelief, but we met on chatroulette. Turned out he lived in a city not far away from my home town.. Unfortunately, I live in a completely different country now (we're in Europe). But anyway. I liked his face, he liked mine, we talked, and once when I came home for the holidays he asked me to come to his party. Sure, why not? The first time I saw him in real life he was wearing a pink bunny costume that was WAY, WAAYY too small for him. You should know, he's 1.96m tall and extremely good looking. He kind of fell in love with me on that party, and even though he had just split up with his girlfriend of 3 years he decided to proceed to have a relationship with me. Well. I told him he should take his time to get over her, but he said she was all forgotten. Silly me. He was diagnosed with the bipolar disorder a while ago, but of course I ignored all of these facts, as you do, when you're stupid. 4 days later, he proposed. Alarm bells? Yes. They rang. As loud as they could but as it turned out, I am quite good at ignoring things. Blablabla, fact of the matter is, I said no, a couple of days ago he said he had feelings for his ex again, we broke up, he keeps calling me and telling me what a mistake it was. I love this guy. A LOT. So after a while, I decided to give in. And then he turned away and said ""no after re-considering this I think it's better if we split up"". And that hurts. It's like he just wanted to do this so HE was the one who broke up. 
Right now, every single cell in my whole body seems to hurt. I want to be alone and not see any of my friends or family, and at the same time being alone makes me want to call him and cry. I don't even want to watch Family Guy, Spongebob, Futurama, Southpark, The Simpsons.. none of that. But lying around doing nothing makes me think of him and how he used my feelings because he needed someone to be around and take care of him while he was thinking of his ex again. Feelsbadman. But I always try to think of what this guy told me.. 

**WORDS OF WISDOM BEGIN HERE**:

So the same night, my brother in law had his birthday party. To get my mind off things I decided to go, and there I met a very interesting person. He is 45 years old, and gay. But he has a son, with a woman whom he was married to for 10 years. He told me one thing: 
Things always happen the way they are supposed to happen. The person who is perfect for you will come, and if one door closes, another will open for you. Perhaps it is a job you would not have gotten if you hadn't broken up, or someone you have learned to appreciate more during times of sadness. It hurts, and breakups always do. But things happen for a reason and if you keep your eyes open and accept things the way they are, you will learn why. So I am holding onto that.

I was dumped last Wednesday over the phone. I was devastated. The man I loved more than anything was walking out of my life, despite my attempts to fix things and make them right again. I couldn't function, sleep, eat, or talk to anyone without spontaneously bursting into tears. Why was he doing this to me?

It's gotten better with time. It's been almost a week. And today while I was sifting through erlenmeyer flasks in the sink (I work in a lab), a familiar song crept into my head: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Or6-HOveg

The song is titled ""Your Ex-Lover is Dead"" by Stars. 

The lyrics that I found trickling into my thoughts were these:

""It's nothing but time and a face that you lose
I chose to feel it and you couldn't choose
I'll write you a postcard
I'll send you the news
From a house down the road from real love""

And this is when I turn to all who have been dumped and say just this:

You wanted to try. You put in your best effort. You wanted things to work because you loved this person. This person did not truly love you. If they did, they would put in the same effort and you two would meet in the middle and resolve your differences. 

That being said, this is NOT the person for you. Wouldn't you like to be in a relationship with someone somewhere down the line where the other person doesn't simply turn away? Where they agree that you have something special and try to work through it? That is the definition of love, in my opinion. True love. True love does not falter when the chips are down.

I'm finding it really hard to articulate what I'm trying to get at, but I hope this post is useful to someone. Just know that it will get better and that this happening for a reason. Take it as a learning experience and when you feel comfortable enough to do so, analyze the things that you liked about the person. But think more heavily about the red flags and the things that really bothered you (For instance, my ex needed constant female attention. There was always some girl pining away for him in the background of our relationship, which I could not stand). By making mental notes about them, you'll be less likely to select someone with the same problems in the future.

This is what I did to get over it and wanted to share,17,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/q9j4z/5_year_engagement_ended_a_month_later_i_think_im/,"well, I was engaged for 5 years.  I thought things were great.   The end of the relationship was emotional torture as we both loved each other a lot and were just incompatible. 


Well, I did five main things that have helped me get over it


1) I left the country and went on an adventure.  Still here in fact, and having a great time.  Also, no I'm not rich.  I'm a student.  I'm just resourceful.  I have spent the same amount with the ticket and being here that I would have been spending back home.  I didn't bring a phone, I have essentially cut myself off from home.  One reason I did this is because I know myself, and my tendency to get lonely late night and have the urge to call him up and reopen the wounds, or take his calls and reopen the wounds.  Well, that's impossible from here, nor can either of us just hop a flight to go see each other.  It's helped, believe that!


2) Every time the ""good times"" pop in my mind, instead of focusing on those and getting sad, I think of all the numerous bad times, the AWFUL times.  I realize now that I have some distance, there were just as many terrible times, mostly due to incompatibility with our personality and life styles.  It reaffirms the fact that the break up was healthy and a good decision.


3) Turned it in to a positive by making this a new phase in my life where I am learning about myself, being alone, and growing as a person.  This is an introspective time.  I'm writing, I'm thinking, I'm hiking and being alone in the woods every day


4) Figuring out all the things that I couldn't do because of being in a relationship, and doing the things I want to.  Example.  Boyfriend used to get mad about stupid little things that I enjoyed.  Now I do all of those things and no one is there to bitch at me about it.  Also, many things I love to do that boyfriend doesn't like, like hiking, so I would refrain from those to make him comfortable.  Now I hike all the time!


5) From the first day, I looked at my ex and the relationship objectively.  I'm not mad, not bitter..  I accept the end of our relationship as a natural ending because two people were not compatible.  In most of the messy break ups I've witnessed, one or both parties just have this ""fuck her/fuck him"" mentality where they are angry, often over simple misunderstandings.  I realized, someone breaking up with you doesn't make them an asshole.  We all have one life to live, and we should try to be happy.  If someone is happier without me, that doesn't make me or them a bad person.  Also, I don't let myself deny that my ex was such an influential part of my life.  I look back on our relationship as a beautiful addition to my life history.  But it ended, and that in its own way is beautiful as well.



Yes, I know some people will just focus on #1 and say ""well we can't all just go to a different country!"".  Well, it wasn't the easiest for me.  I don't have much money.  It took sacrifices back home.  But ultimately, I made it work.  I'm not claiming everyone can do it on a whim, but I think it's easier than some make it out to be.  You don't have to leave the country.  Go to the next county/province/state, call up a friend in a different city and go visit them.   Don't take your phone.  Separate from life for a bit.

This book is for the true and mighty...

http://www.amazon.com/Its-Called-Breakup-Because-Broken/dp/0767921968/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327867834&amp;sr=8-1


""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Fuck, it hurts. It's rocking the very core of your being. You never saw it coming. You knew this was going to happen. You were going to do it first. You only broke it off with him before he broke it off with you. You guys were supposed to be together forever. You never liked him that much anyway. He was a great kisser. The sex wasn't that great. You really liked his family. He hated your friends. You hated his shoes. You miss him soooooo much.

There's no doubt about it - breakups suck. And now here you are [on this stupid subreddit] because, quite honestly you'd do anything not to feel like this and maybe this place will shed some light on what you're going through. Maybe you'll get some sleep tonight. Or stop sleeping all the time.

In these first few hours, or days, or weeks of your breakup, there's one all important truth that you need to recognize: Some things can't and shouldn't be fixed, especially that loser who dumped you or forced you to dump him. It's over for a reason, and even if you're in denial about it, deep down inside you probably know what the reason is. Even if you feel baffled by his decision to end it, it boils down to the same thing every time: Your relationship, despite it's promise, has ceased to be right for one or both of you. It is, in effect, broken...

So take a deep breath, steel yourself, and realize that this is going to hurt for a while. There is no quick remedy for the powerful sting of heartbreak. You're going to feel like crap head to toe and run the gamut of emotions. Edgy, moody, angry, depressed, nauseated - you name it. In fact the amount of time it takes for you to start feeling great about yourself is directly proportional to how much it sucks right now - especially if you weren't the one who broke it off. Because at the end of the day, someone you loved, trusted, and valued has rejected you, and that really smarts. It's hard not to take it personally. 

But here's the important part - the fact of the matter is, they're wrong about you. Just because your relationship is broken, doesn't mean you are! No matter what happened between you, no matter what you may or may not have done wrong, you are still a kick-ass person. And even though you might not believe it right now, this breakup is the first step toward finding someone truly worthy of your greatness.""",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_p21yn,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/p21yn/its_called_a_breakup_because_its_broken/,

I get to be alive today!,19,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/nepvu/holy_shit_i_get_to_be_alive_today/,"(Obligatory age/details: I'm a 26 year old guy. Girlfriend cheated on me, and then we had an on-again/off-again terrible-all-around last 4 months together. Finally started to go no-contact as of a week ago.)

I was at the gym tonight, reading a book called ""Time Warriors"" (basically a book about how to be more productive that's organized as a collection of 3-4 page lessons/anecdotes), when I came across a chapter that talked about how it's the challenges in life that show you who you really are. It's these challenging things that break you out of your same-old, same-old, ""comfortable"" routine and force you to grow and, as a result, truly be able to love who you are and who you're going to become.

Anyway, just that lesson was good enough to put a smile on my face, but it also caused me to close the book and think about some other positive things that I might forget about when all I keep thinking about are the negative things. That's when this sudden, incredible feeling rushed over me. It's really hard to just read these words and understand what I'm saying if you haven't had a similar moment of clarity, but here we go: 

I thought about all of the people that have come before me. Many great and powerful people have walked this Earth. Isaac Newton, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander the Great, and many others. Many ordinary people have walked this Earth as well. Widowed mothers in Ancient Rome, middle children in 1400s Madrid, homeless men in 1800s England. Among all of those people, there have been countless amazing times, and an equal number of terrible times. There have been moments of incredible love, and others of heart-breaking loss. Nothing I've been experiencing with my recent breakup and all the things that came with it are new. It's all been experienced time and again, all throughout the course of human history. The only difference is that, whereas almost all of those other people are long gone and forgotten, I get to still experience. I get to actually be alive and have these feelings. It doesn't matter what the experience is, because the simple fact remains that I get to have it. Many years from now, I'll be long gone and forgotten, too. All traces of my existence will have turned to dust, and everything I've ever done in my entire life will be nothing but distant echoes in the vastness of human history. But I get to be alive -- today. This exact day in the long span of the Universe, I get to actually live. I get to have these feelings that I have, and I'll even end up getting to grow from all of it. 

All that we feel is caused by our perceptions of what's occurring around us, rather than by the actual events themselves. Start seeing the positives in your life, and the negatives will start to fade away. And trust me, there are positives.

I was very sad because she is leaving and we use to say, OK it's only 30 days, we can do it.
First thing she did when she came these was a long mail sent saying how that was the plan for leaving me. It was total shock. I could not believe. Or our plans, dreams and love are gone from her side. I found out she was unhappy with me for last year without any strong reasons.

22f &lt;- that's her

We had been together for 5 years, 5 months, and some change. We were going to move to another state, she first to stay with her best friend for a month or so while we found a place. Then I would come up with all of our stuff. 

We made it about two weeks into the separation before she made it permanent. My whole life, my future, the children I wanted to have with her, The good, the bad, all of it just vanished. Apparently I hadn't been close enough. Apparently I was supposed to read her mind and know that she was unhappy. 

Two weeks later she's being wined and dined by some guy. I still can't keep food down and barely drink enough water to sustain life. I throw away everything that isn't essential to me, put her stuff in storage and move in with some friends out of state, because I really don't think I'll make it on my own.

Since then I've progressed. I moved back to the town we used to live in together. I've started my own business, though not much has come of it yet, I've been hitting the gym constantly and doing the Keto diet Religiously. I'm in the best shape of my life, physically. I still cry sometimes, in the shower, or when My roommate isn't home. 
I still kiss our matching necklace before I go to bed, and pray to whomever will listen that she is having a good life, and that she sleeps well. 

But I've made progress. Today she popped back in to town. Out of the blue. She wanted her stuff from storage, and her cat. Of course I relinquished them without fuss. But when I saw her turn the corner... the waterworks started. I choked them back. As she got closer I smiled. ""*I can do this.*""  Then she hugged me. Her smell hit me like a freight train, that old smell that always made me smile because it was hers and hers alone. a beautiful fragrance made solely by her. Her skin, that soft, beautiful skin of hers, like velvet lightning when it touched my own. Her hair touched my face. It was like the finest lace, woven for the gods themselves, yet here I am, a mere mortal man being graced with this gift upon my brow.

**I couldn't do it.*

The tears came. My breath caught. It took everything I had not to pick her up, spin her around, tell her how much I loved her and to please, please for the love of god and all things good in ths world to please take me back. That I'm better than I was. I'm stronger, better looking, smarter. More successful than I had ever been! Please! **PLEASE**

But I choked down the beast known as love. And I think I hate myself for it.

She got her things. I could see it in her. A few times when we were talking. when I handed her her old stuffed bear. When I looked into her eyes. She almost broke down. Her breath held, too.
 But she doesn't love me anymore.
   *But she doesn't love me anymore*

**BUT SHE DOESN'T. FUCKING. LOVE ME. ANYMORE.** i don't think you get it. You see, for me, Love isn't some toy to be lent and taken back at your leisure. Love is forever, love is a bond unbroken forever trusting, I don't give MY FUCKING LOVE to just anyone. I knew when I met this girl she was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

*She said she would love me forever.*
*Hah. What a joke...*

*I hate being the punchline.*

So she got her things, I walked her downstairs.

We stopped at the bottom of the stairs. I held her one more time. I kissed her on the forehead, like I always used to. Like I would every night before bed. Like I did every day before work. Like... like It was all just a dream, and she was shaking me awake.

But no such luck. I didn't wake up. *Damn it all.*


She said she was sorry for this.
I told her she had to live for her, even if I hated the way she was doing it.
I told her I didn't hate her.
She told me I should.
I told her I could never hate her, that I was, and am, severely hurt by her. But not hate. *Never hate.*
We talked for a few minutes. I made her laugh, god I miss her laugh.

I walked the cat and her stuff to the car. The car with her fuckbuddy/roommate/it's complicated. The same motherfucker who took her out that aforementioned wine and dine.

I know he didn;t do anything wrong. That doesn't mean I can't hate him. Doesn;t mean I can't be consumed with white hot jealousy. Can;t mean I don't want to end him. 

But I looked him in the eye, and I shook his hand. Not too hard. He didn't seem like a bad guy. He's older than me, but he seemed so much younger. I knew looking in his eye, he wouldn't die for her. He couldn't defend her if she were attacked. He was a... patsy isnt the right word but it's what comes to mind. Pushover, perhaps?

But he helps make her happy. Do I hate him, or respect him? Maybe both. Maybe not.

Anyway. I don;t feel very good right now. I think i'm going to go vomit.

Here is the comment:
&gt;Well then, let me take over this woozy perspective with some Science™, _bitches_. OP, try a little variation on a nifty little thing called _cognitive reappraisal_. 
&gt;
&gt;Science bases what I'm about to describe on three things: one, our brain has a tendency to make sure visualization is prioritized above and overrides our reason, and second, a brain is almost completely incapable of separating vivid fantasy from reality. Third, writing something down has a more lasting neutralizing effect on your emotions than just thinking it.
&gt;
&gt;That kept in mind, let's move on.
&gt;
&gt;You say you hold grudges, right? Well, the following technique has been observed to relieve year-long held grudges more effectively than years of therapy. 
&gt;
&gt;That's right, I'm offering you an easier, quicker, more believable and more effective treatment than any of what is stated in the above post. Read right on to find out what it is.
&gt;
&gt;Follow these quick and easy steps to get your very own peace of mind:
&gt;
&gt;1. Think of a person that has wronged you.
&gt;2. Write them a letter, preferably handwritten, in which you detail exactly what you wish you could say to them and sign it, leaving absolutely nothing filtered or censored. Remember, this is your fantasy. 
&gt;3. Write back a letter to yourself, in their name, in which they tell you precisely what you want to hear. Be it an apology, an explanation, appreciation -- everything you feel you'd need in reality to stop feeling resentment towards them. After you've finished this letter, sign it as well, again in their name.
&gt;4. Read back this second letter every night before you go to bed over the course of a week. By the end of the week, you'll notice that, even upon meeting them in person, your level of resentment is reduced to next to nothing. You will be able to treat them as if they've righted their wrong, because even though perhaps you don't cognitively believe it, you do feel that emotional satisfaction and relief.
&gt;
&gt;Now then, did you know that many placebos work even when the patient knows he's being deceived? This is one of those placebos. Hilariously, I can explain in full detail that you're tricking your mind, and it'll work all the better because of it.
&gt;
&gt;Relevant studies I can share upon request. (Or, you could read _The Charisma Myth_ by Olivia Fox Cabane.) And don't mind me using infomercial-type communication; I'm just having a jolly good time.
&gt;
&gt;__N.B.:__ Science™: it works, bitches!
&gt;
&gt;__EDIT:__ On a personal note, this in a mere day helped me get over a lifelong grudge I held towards my mother for abandoning me and locking me for years in a psychiatric hospital. I would say _YMMV_, but I'd be lying.
&gt;
&gt;__LATER NIGHT EDIT:__ I got a lot of PMs saying thanks, and the appreciation and compliments have been overwhelming. It's a shame a light-hearted and entertaining post got the limelight between so many others of more substance, but it has sparked some profound discussion and deep emotional sharing. I like that. I like that a lot.
&gt;
&gt;So I got thanks, but really, __no, thank__ ___you___.  Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and thank you for letting me teach you something small that has helped me so much. It's been fantastic, this day, thanks to people like you. :)

The best parts are:

- I got on my career path.

- Got a super new and large energy efficient apartment for a great rate close to my work. 

- Got to perform on stage with one of my favorite comedians, meet him and have him buy me a beer etc.

- I have been so luck that my career path is unfolding even though I don't graduate from my school until two weeks from now and they want to use my story as a success story.

Just remember, if you regret, or both you regret mistakes; if you just need space, time and a chance to see things without the other to know what you really want...it's never too late to fix mistakes if you really both believe in each other deeply and care. Just always remember that. Never too late to move forward on your own either or to move forward together again on a new path grown like a plant rising from the ashes of the old plant. A whole new path but with the same person, it's a choice and both paths are options. Just keep spirits high and your head clear and act wise.

**TL:TR If you have or both of you have made a mistake and there is a chance, take it. Fix the mistake, correct any problem. There is always time, it's not too late unless you all give up.

I never wanted things to get ugly. I just wanted to feel good again. I've been trying all the tricks I know to prove to myself that we weren't as compatible as I thought, that it's better this way. I've tried listing everything I don't like about you in an effort to convince myself you are not right for me, but I only came up with two things.  I've been so angry because I thought that you broke me. I've been so hurt that you made me doubt my worth.

But today I realized that I've been going about this all wrong. I don't need to forgive you, because I already have, the moment I started loving you.  The one I need to forgive is myself.

Everyone tells me how strong I am constantly: that I can power through anything; look what I've already been through. But I'm not strong. My burdens have been piling up for many months, if not years, and pointing out how much I've already carried does not make it easier to carry more. I've been berating myself for letting you hurt me, for letting you see me the way I really am, for being vulnerable and not protecting myself from what I knew would surely happen. I've been feeling guilty that I can't carry as much as people seem to think I can. I've been questioning whether I should have ever told you the way I feel. I've been feeling ashamed about letting you into my life when you never really intended me to be part of yours.

But today I forgive myself. I'm not going to force myself to be strong because I can't.  I don't regret the way I live, trusting my heart and intuition. I don't regret trying to live with wild abandon. It doesn't matter anymore whether you were a risk worth taking because I have not lost anything. You can never take anything away from me because I gave it to you freely. I'm still in pain, but I know now that my vulnerability is my strength, and I would do it all again.   

Ultimately this is your loss. I've always known that I am worth a lot of love, and that I'm capable of giving even more. Your inability to give or receive love doesn't change that.  I forgive myself for telling you that I love you, because I know something in you really wants to be loved. I forgive myself for giving you all that I had, because I can see that you really needed it.  I forgive myself for being patient with you, because I know you are not ready.  I forgive myself for missing you, because you are so far away. I forgive myself for wanting you, because we were right but the time is wrong. I forgive myself for being shocked because there's nothing wrong with being full of hope.  I forgive myself for mourning a loss because you are worth it.

We broke up like a month ago. Pretty much right away I realized that he was verbally abusive to me. I had been questioning it for awhile but when we broke up I came to the conclusion that yes, he was. It pisses me off. He didn't even respect me. At all. He was/is a manipulative asshole.

About a week after HE broke up with ME, he texted me. He wanted to be friends. I didn't. He finally admitted that he wanted me back. I *almost* went back. He was so convincing, saying that he had changed. But my roommates (I'm a freshman in college) were so supportive and told me not to go back to him. It was painful and difficult because of all the sweet things he was saying to me. I realized that he was being manipulative once again, and at that time I completely cut off contact with him. Our talking back and forth had lasted a few weeks. 

It was then that the stalking started. He would wait for me places, follow me, come up and try to talk to me, come to my room, send me messages and texts. 

And then yesterday I came to the realization that along with all this shit, he was also sexually abusive to me. And it messed me up. I feel bad for not wanting to go any further than I am comfortable with. I wanted to wait until I was married, but that shitbag took it away. He mocked me for that, just like he mocked my Christian beliefs in general. He is the shittiest example of an atheist.* And I know that I shouldn't hate him; my beliefs tell me I should love everyone. I simply cannot help it though. He *ruined* me. Or, he tried to ruin me. Even though he told me I am a weak person whenever I cried, I am not. I am so, so strong. I am stronger than I ever thought I was.

And now he wants the shit that he gave me for Christmas, my birthday, and our anniversary back? He has the fucking *gall* to ask me for that back, after everything he's done to me? **Fuck him.** I cannot stand the sight of him. It pisses me off that he stares at me during class. Everything about him pisses me off. 

I cannot wait until the day that he finally stops talking to me.

*Edit to say that I don't think that Atheists are bad people; I'm just saying that he is one of the bad ones, much like how Westboro are the worst Christians. 

Edit 2: Now that I've had the time to calm down, I realize I was very angry when writing this. I feel a little bad calling my Ex a piece of shit, because it was not all bad. I guess I just needed to vent. But it is as you guys have said, I am hurt by what he did. I can't trust him, but one day I will forgive him. I don't know if we can ever be friends again. We'll see. I will not let the anger consume me though. I'll use this experience to better myself and learn what I want in a relationship and how to defend myself.

I (23M) have never experienced such disregard, such malice. Our relationship was very new. But it seemed so fantastic. She has a history of getting a bit out of control with her drinking, and it doesnt help that she's pretty enough to get as many drinks as she wants. Earlier this week she had told me she wanted to go out with her co-worker/girl friend. This girl always told her how much better she could do, or how much of a player I was. Except, I don't know her friend at all, and I treated her like gold. She had a sedistic way of taking revenge on me for the most ridiculous reasons. She would flirt with other guys, give out her number, etc. I shouldve seen problems from miles away, but I never EVER expected what happened tonight.
 We spent last night together and it was perfect. We had plans to have a sleep over after her girls night. Last night, my now ex (F22) got drunk with her friend at a bar nearby. I wouldnt want to over step my boundaries so I went to a beer bar nearby with some friends. She called me (drunk) and wanted to meet up. I was stoked. But things took a horrifying turn. Long story short, we had a mild fight in which she implicated that I had been completely dishonest with her throughout our relationship. Which is false. I proceed to leave. Get 7 calls from her, to which I dont respond. Then I see a voicemail pop up. She left a voicemail while having sex with a random guy. I know this post is all sorts of messy, but I just don't know how to feel right now. Who would do such a thing over something so minuscule?
As far as I am concerned, shes crossed too far to come back.

TL;DR My ex made a series of poor decisions which ultimately resulted in the indefinite ending of our relationship. Shitty circumstances. Last night. 

EDIT1: Thank you so much everyone. After some good sleep, and some laughs with the boys, I am feeling like I am better off today than yesterday. You guys are incredible, makes me regain a little faith in humanity.

EDIT2: I edited some of the post because I don't need to be insulting or crossing the line myself, it's hard to be keep your shit together in that kind of stress but I don't want to lower myself.

We broke up a month ago. I was the one to initiate the breakup. It hurts, but it's not the same type of hysterical hurting I've experienced in past break ups. It's a ... calmer pain. One that doesn't incapacitate me and take over my life, but instead lives on in the background.

We were best friends. We lived together for three of those four years. We had a kitty together (that I kept after the breakup). We talked of commitment and marriage. He was my biggest pillar of support, and right off from the first day we met, I just knew we were going to be together. At the end of the day he was the person I'd cuddle up against and fall asleep next to. Everyone of our friends was jealous of our relationship. We were a ""pair"", and no one knew one of us without the other.

But it just didn't feel right. I fought for two of those four years with constant doubts and overwhelming thoughts that made me not enjoy the relationship. I went to therapy, we went to couples counselling, we did everything we could. I loved him, I truly did. But I could never commit myself to him 100%. There was no one else I wanted, but something just didn't seem right.

We had a trial seperation for a few weeks before we fully break up, to see if there was any chance of salvaging what we had. It hurt me tremendously and I missed him insane amounts, but I knew I would never be able to commit 100%, not at this point of my life. I'm just finishing my third year of Engineering at school in a few weeks, and I'm due to graduate next year. I've barely experienced LIFE.

Please believe me, I fought with all I had. I didn't think I had Grass-Is-Greener Syndrome, because there was no one else or anything else I wanted instead of him. It was just with HIM, it didn't feel right. I can't commit to settle down with someone I was just so unsure with. So after so much fighting, at the end of it, I just took a deep breath and walked away.

I won't lie, it was a relief to finally break free. I've moved out of our place and back in with my mother while I get my own place sorted out,  and god damn do I miss him. There's no black-and-white solution here for me. I miss him at night time. I miss his arm around me while I'm sad. I miss his support. I miss my best friend, and being able to come home from school or work and have him there to talk to about my day, and be able to cuddle up against.

But I can't go back, because I know the doubts will only come back, and we'll just go back to the same situation that caused me to want to end things.

So I go on every day. This is a calmer sense of heartbreak. This is not one I see time ""calming down"" per se. It's just going on every day and missing his every day presence, and the back thought in my head thinking what if I've just thrown away the most wonderful thing life has ever offered me. Will I look back 10 years from now and be happy with my decision, or will I look back in regret? 

Can anyone relate? Like I mentioned, this heartbreak is not ""destroying"" me, but it certainly has numbed me down. While I do not doubt that there's other people out there that can be my best friend like he was to me, it is not the thought of ""never finding anyone again"" that is hurting me.

Sorry... I'm just a whole mess of confusion. And I was hurting both of us. I didn't feel it was fair to either of us. While bridges aren't burned, I know he will be trying to move on and will not bend over backwards or beg to take me back.

Just wondering if this numbness that keeps my mood down and makes my days ""drag"" will ever fully go away. :( And if I'll ever find 100% closure in this decision. Or is that a hopeless fantasy? Will I forever live with a little bit of regret and longing, and I just have to learn to not dwell or focus on it?

Sorry for the rant... just so lost and emotionally numb right now. Not sure if I made the right decision, or how to come to peace with my decision.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1366241920.0,,,True,t3_1ckhv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ckhv8/break_up_after_4_years_does_this_regret_and/,

I walked into the store, just before close, like I had so many times before. We always rode home together, that was our thing. I knew things had been off between us. I felt the shift. I had hoped to summon the courage to talk to you about it. To fix it. 

Nothing could have prepared me for the way you looked at me when I came through those doors. Before you always looked at me like I was your favorite. You would smile at me like I was the best part of your day. That night you looked at me like I was the last thing you wanted to see. An annoyance. 

You barely looked at me, focusing instead on your phone. You stayed as far away as you could while we walked to the station. I was scared and felt nauseous. Unsure how to ask if you wanted to be done with me. We waited mostly in silence, you still on your phone. We sat on the train, same seat, but not together. 

I knew you were stressed about money, about work, about a lot of things. Just a few days before you seemed happy. I didn't know what had happened or why you suddenly lost interest. I should have asked that night, but I was too scared. You continued to mostly ignore me for another week after that. 

When I finally got you on the phone, all you could say was you didn't necessarily want to break up. That hurt so much, it was a physical pain in my chest. An actual pain. I finally found the nerve to end it with you. It was one week until my birthday and I didn't want to be attached to someone who really didn't like me all that much. I knew you would have forgotten anyway. 

Funny thing is, after I told you I was done, you went back to being your old self. Sweet, kind, asking how I was, trying to get on my good side even after I asked you to leave me alone. But you wouldn't leave me alone and you did forget my birthday. You even had the balls to be mad at me when I deleted your Facebook and ignored your texts. 

But the thing you don't understand is, the way you looked at me that night, the way you treated me the few weeks after, left a mark that still hurts when I think about it. No amount of texting from you will change that. Because it doesn't matter what you say. 

You only care enough to send a text. Never a phone call, never anything thoughtful. You send a text because it's the least amount of effort or risk for you. I refuse to let you make me feel like nothing again. I hope you have a good life, please let me get back to mine.

**TL;DR Together for 1 year. He treated me like I was nothing, but changed his mind after I ended it. I can't talk to him so I decided to talk to BreakUps.**

I've posted here a couple times now following the break up I have been dealing with for over a month now and other personal issues. I've been severely depressed over this and some personal issues going on with my family. 
I won't go into too much detail as far as the other things go, but one of the latest news to add to it was finding out my friend's dad passed away. When I found out, I immediately wanted to go to a quiet park and just meditate. I ended up parking at a viewpoint that overlooks the ocean and beach. I pretty much ended up just standing there looking out to see and thinking about all the things going on. I looked down and there were some waves and surfers, and that's when I thought about this analogy that made me feel better:

Think of relationships almost like waves. Most of the waves eventually make it to the shore and recede back into the ocean, some farther than others. What you choose to decide the reaching the shore means is really up to you, but I see it possibly as representing the end of life. 

Now imagine that you're a surfer. To those unfamiliar with surfing, it can be a pretty demanding sport that requires a lot of energy to just to get in a position to try catching a wave. What it takes to be exceptional at surfing (to me, at least) is patience, balance, endurance, and strength among other things. One of the best feelings after I learned to surf was finally catching that first wave. I finally found the right balance and positioning on my board to stand up and ride a wave. I felt on top of the world and capable of doing anything. Of course, if you lose balance, it is easy to fall off and wipe out. Falling off and losing that first wave was a bummer, but I never looked back and got all sad because that wave was gone. I look back and remember how amazing that feeling was, and actually quite to eager to catch another wave. 

So how does that relate to relationships? I just got out of my very first relationship and it was tough. All I wanted to do was do anything to get her back. I lost my balance between her and my relationships with other people and lost control of my friendships to be with her. In this case, my very first girlfriend was my very first wave. I have either the option to be bummed and sad because I didn't ride that relationship wave all the way to the shore, or get back on my board and paddle back out again, potentially catching that next wave with now the experience gained. Don't regret and think too much about what caused you to fall off that wave, but learn from it so that next time you can stand up a little while longer and maybe even stay on it all the way to the shore. 

I suppose what I'm trying to say is don't think that the one wave that you catch is the only wave you catch. There are tons of waves out there for you try your best and catch. All it takes is to get back up on that board, paddle back out, and have the strength and patience to eventually get that perfect wave.

I think that this analogy can be applied to a lot of other aspects such as dreams and goals, as well as life itself. I hope this helps and hang in there! ",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1b2tmq,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1b2tmq/some_possible_inspiration/,
1364257453.0,15,self.BreakUps,1b0d04,Almost 8 years together building a future...done in 3 months,18,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1b0d04/almost_8_years_together_building_a_futuredone_in/,"I think my title is likely misleading because things have been brewing for more than 3 months.

I'm 34. My wife is 26. We've been together a long time. 8 years to be exact. She is the best person I know. The brightest light in my life and the sweetest most caring woman I've ever met. Someone who loved me from the start without reservation. The kind of person you dream about.

7 years of bliss. Total happiness. We got married last year and it was the best day of my life. Everything was perfect. We were in synch in every way you can think of. 

And then things changed.

After our honeymoon, she became more distant. She started going out more often without me. At first I didn't even notice. I'm an introvert. Sometimes I welcomed it - I need alone time. By October, we bought a house. A beautiful home. We talked about filling it with kids and starting a family. With a big backyard that our dog would love, and enough room to plant an enormous vegetable garden.

We moved in and it was perfect. It was tiring, but it was perfect.

And then the hammer dropped. Right before New Year. 

'I'm unhappy and I don't know if this is what I want in my life right now.'

'You've given me everything I ever wanted...and now I don't think I want it.'

We spent New Years apart. She with friends in her hometown. Me, alone with our dog at home. Watching Ryan Seacrest drop the ball in Time Square. My wife...the woman I love more than anyone in the world, not even bothering to call me to wish me happy new year.

A long time ago she told me to never stop fighting for us, even when it looked the most desperate. So I did. I fought hard. I did everything. Some would say I coddled. That I catered too much. But she was worth it to me. In January, we went on an already scheduled NYC trip. It was amazing. Fantastic. Felt like old times. Then back to nothing at home again. Entire weekends away with friends. Barely in contact. Always promising to be home, never showing up until Sunday evening. I had a wife from Monday to Friday, and then someone who didn't want to be with me at all on the weekend. I was a glorified roommate.

We fought during this time. Usually about weekend outings. Sometimes about money. Every time I talked to her it was like walking on eggshells. I'd ask myself - is this was marriage is supposed to be? Is this what love is? Was it always like this and I just never noticed?

It wasn't. She had changed.

She always (and still) maintains that she loved me. That she still loves me. She hasn't done anything in 3 months to make me think it. Sometimes I think she's bipolar. On Tuesday she'll talk about having a family and the cute kids we'll have. On Thursday she'll tell me I'm overreacting because she showed up home after work at 11pm without explanation. 

Sometimes I believe that I overreacted. Most times I know it's insane to think that.

Ultimately, she wore me down. I've hated my life the last 3 months. To sit and know that every weekend will be shit isn't a pleasant experience. To dread a Friday night isn't fun.

Family has helped. Friends have helped. But the one person I could always lean on before...that I could open my heart to and ask for support hasn't been there.

Yesterday we came to terms with it and said it was over. It was cathartic. It hurt. It really hurts. I spent the day at work today not working. Thinking about everything. Love is simple. It really is, I believe it. You love someone, you would do anything for them, no hesitation. Everything else is peripheral. But we always make it complicated. Like we want it to fail.

I'm scared of the future. I don't know what it will bring. But I'm not alone, and that comforts me. I will move on. I will love again. 

But I don't know if I'll ever stop loving her.

I miss her already, even though she's still here in the same house as me.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1b0d04,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1b0d04/almost_8_years_together_building_a_futuredone_in/,

My girlfriend broke up with me because she said she wanted to find out who she really was and not feel like she had to depend on anyone. She also mentioned she would like to date other guys and that she was interested in another guy. We were together for two years and I thought everything was perfect. 

When we started dating, she was full of baggage, but I am a very nurturing person so it gave me purpose and I was happy to take care of her. She was diagnosed with a chronic illness and suffered from depression and anxiety. I am a really positive guy and I love life so I figured I could really help this girl out. I also saw what she was like when she was happy and I knew she was the most amazing girl I had ever known. I loved her when she was a mess too, but I wanted to help her get better. 

Well she thought I was superman for a while. She thought I was the nicest person in the world and all that jazz. She said she saw a future with me and all that stuff, but three weeks ago something changed. I guess she had an epiphany. Of course it was just when she was starting to feel better. I hadn't seen her really depressed in a month and the hadn't had any panic attacks for a long time. 

All of this was a huge surprise to me and it was very unlike her. I would have never thought that she would be the one to end it in a million years. I get the whole thing about not wanting to depend on anyone... no one should feel like they need to depend on someone else to be happy. But I don't think that needs to be the end of a relationship. I think that you can find out a lot about yourself while you are with someone... Whatever. I have mixed feeling about it. 

Right now, all I can say is that I guess I did my part. I just think that it is so fucked up that I gave her so much and put in so much effort, but when she starts to do a lot better, she leaves me. 

Anyway, these last two days I finally had an appetite again, was able to sleep, and didn't feel sick to my stomach ALL day. No contact thing has been tough, but I hid her on facebook and stopped following her on other social networking sites. It is hard to not look at her stuff, but it is making thing a hell of a lot easier. I started working out... something I hadn't done in a structured way since we started dating (though I ride my bike everywhere and love to rock climb so I was in decent shape). I have been doing *okay* these last two days. She is still on my mind 24/7 and I still get angry when I think about her talking to another guy, but I can honestly say that I am starting to look up for the first time. I don't think I want her back anymore and I now know for sure that everything will end up okay in the long run. I still am having a hard time losing my best friend. I think that is the hardest part. But this has happened to all of us, and just knowing that helps me get through it. 

Last night was the first dream I had with her so I woke up extra shitty this morning. I feel like I needed somewhere to vent so I came here.

But after this time, I've bettered myself so much. I stopped working out while we were dating, quit doing anything active, didn't have a license at the time, and we were going to separate schools. And she was blossoming into a gorgeous, mature woman. 

Shoot, if I were her I would have broken up with me too. I was kind of blinded by my own reality to think anything like this at first but after hitting the gym, getting my confidence back, getting in the best shape of my life, eating healthy, learning guitar, and keeping up with my studies.. I realized I didn't have much to offer when we broke up. It was just like I thought I deserved her because we already dated for 2.5 years and I loved her. But hindsight is 20/20 and I'm actually thankful, in a way, that she broke my heart because I've rebuilt myself and am better than I ever was.

I hope you all learn from your experience and become better off rather than sulking in it.

11 years of my life committed to a college sweetheart whom I stuck with even when he became a controlling, insecure, irrationally jealous caveman months into the relationship when he projected all his baggage from his previous relationship with a lying cheating slut onto me. I stuck with him even when it became apparent he wasn't my intellectual equal, stuck with him even when he ballooned into a fat slob who had no qualms pointing out I'd put on a bit of weight or didn't dress attractively enough. Stuck with him when he was a fresh grad, skint on money, and we had to do the long distance relationship thing because I was still studying abroad. 

And now that my family's fucked up genetics have finally caught up with me and bestowed upon me (mostly) high functioning bipolar disorder, now that it's been a decade since he last fell in lust at first sight at what he deemed the most gorgeous girl he ever saw (I'm still attractive, if the regular stream of guys who try to hit on me is any objective indication, but hey, apparently putting on one dress size since college is unacceptable), now that he's a corporate hotshot raking in shit tons of money, lost weight and has girls throwing himself at him while he works an ocean away - the fucking coward, instead of telling me straight up he doesn't want to be with me anymore because hey, way to look like the bad guy who dumps the bipolar gf now that he's moving up in life right - over the course of the last few months - stopped telling me he loved me, stopped using any terms of endearment, stopped holding my hand, and before we parted ways last week, I asked him ""do you even enjoy spending time with me?"" he says ""Okay."" What the fuck is that? OKAY? 15 years of friendship and 11 years of a relationship and the last word he says to me is ""okay""?

I text him to wish him a safe flight back to the country he's working in, and he responds with all the warmth and affection of someone exchanging polite chit chat with a second cousin he only sees every Christmas. 

So I gave him what he wanted but didn't have the balls to do and initiated the breakup. I deserve better than being treated like shit now that I'm no longer the trophy girlfriend he can't believe he scored all those years ago.

And he responds with something like *hey, I always want to be there for you but yeah, this relationship thing isn't working out*.

Fuck breakups.,19,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/17wi33/i_need_to_just_get_it_all_out_fuck_breakups/,"I posted a few days ago about my story and why it's been a difficult breakup. It happened a week ago now. The healing process is difficult but I'm doing better than I thought I would. Generally I've been doing pretty okay most days. I've been trying to be with other people as much as possible, especially my family, and to stay social and busy. I've been doing what I can to take care of myself and just doing little things to make myself feel good, and to stay distracted. Immersing myself in movies and tv shows is really helpful for me.

But sometimes it just hits me. He knew breaking up with me would mean having no contact with me ever again. After four and a half years of being so close and going through so much, how could he prefer to cut me out of his life? How can he be okay with that? I used to be his life and he used to love the absolute crap out of me. Our relationship had plenty of things wrong with it but why wasn't I worth it for him? Why did he just give up?

I just don't know how he's okay with never touching me or sleeping next to me or holding my hand or so many other things with me ever again. I can't understand it.

But then I realize he did not treat me well. The way to deal with my sadness is to override it with anger at him for the many things he did wrong, instead. He was so selfish and so controlling of me, especially toward the end, and the dynamic between us was really messed up. He would get mad at me and say such hurtful things even if I was crying and begging him to stop. He would have such unfair expectations of me and never consider that he had plenty to fix himself, especially toward the end. It was always about what I was doing wrong. He'd make a half-assed apology about his own behavior but the focus was always me. He has no idea the damage he did to me and us. Breaking up with me has freed me from a lot of bad shit.

But it hurts so much, even so. Thinking back many months ago when things were so much better and he actually cared about my happiness. When he actually wanted to spend time with me more than once a week and wasn't always pushing me away, when he actually desired my presence and did things to show that he loved me. He was and is so special to me and I just miss being the same way to him, so much.

I'm glad that I've realized how unhealthy our relationship was so I can see that getting out of it was a good thing for my own well-being, but I will never stop thinking it could have been fixed, if he ever actually tried (or never started doing many of the things he did to begin with.)

We've been together for 10 months and throughout those 10 months, my relationship with my mother has been down the gutter. I value my relationship with my mother as most should, but I feel so empty now. She disapproves because my ex is not of our religious or ethnic background (which I think is ridiculous), she is not at least 3-5 years younger than me (my mother is very traditional), and because my grades have been below par lately (I still believe I can turn it around after 2 poor semesters by my standards).

Everything is gone. I have no one to turn to. I'm an emotional wreck. I keep asking myself if I did the right thing. I've told my mother what I've done, I've told other family members and friends. Anything they tell me is only a temporary relief, but the pain is still there. She didn't deserve to be left like this. I don't think I deserve it either, but it was for the sake of my relationship with my mother. 

She avoided me for 2 weeks because of a very heated discussion before Christmas. I went to visit my girlfriend one last time before she left for home out-of-state. My mother wouldn't let me go. I went anyway. This triggered the heated discussion the next day. Let's just say we're lucky no one got hurt. Xmas and New Years passed and my mother and I did not speak a word to each other.

I've never been so depressed. I need to get my act together before I take my PCAT tomorrow evening. I can't focus on anything. I've been so tempted to just tell my ex that I can't deal with this and that I want her back, and that I don't care if mother doesn't approve of us. But something holds me back. Does everything happen for a reason, or is it just poor decision making? 

It took me 3 hours on the phone with my ex last night to make up my mind. She hated me for what I did, but she begged me not to do it. I'm alone now. I hate it. 


EDIT: A few hours ago, I went out to confront my ex because I felt like I needed to see her instead of hiding behind a phone.

You can look in my post history to see the long, drawn out story I wrote, I was in a pretty bad place.

Long story short, after deciding to transfer schools for our almost 2 year relationship a few months back, and her dumping me a couple of weeks before I moved (over the phone when I was coming up the next day for orientation anyway, she didn't bother to wait), I was depressed as all hell. After dragging myself through the mud for awhile, I talked to my family over Christmas. 

They helped me realize that I was very codependant in my relationship, and my natural independence I had possessed my whole life slowly faded away as the months went on. I wanted it back. 

In a span of five days, I re-enrolled at my old school, regained my financial aid, was accepted into my program, found a flat downtown at a good price, and regained my old job. On top of that, I nailed an interview for an internship (which is unfortunately near her, but there are always downsides) and start that in the summer.

What I'm trying to say is, although I still think and dream about her every single day, find yourself again. Find that person you were, and don't be afraid to do anything in your power to get it back. Be strong, independent, and motivated. 

I called her once three days after the breakup, never got a call back, and that was it for me, I got the picture. I boxed her stuff up (threw it out a couple of days ago), and blocked her and her family on all social media. That starts the healing process.

Everybody heals in their own way, and certain days are still a struggle for me, but just stay strong and positive. YOU deserve better, just be who you really are. And in your next relationship, never ever give that up for any reason.

But there are a lot of positive things that inadvertently come out of ending a relationship and starting a new life.  Writing and thinking about them usually put me in a good mood when I was in the doldrums, so I want you to do the same in the comments! It can be big or small things, doesn't matter.

I'll start:

* Being able to reconnect with my friends. When I was in a relationship, I found myself wanting to spend almost all my free time with her, instead of my friends.  It was fun at the time but probably not the healthiest thing for me.  After the breakup, I was able to have some great times with people that I care about and that care about me.

* I don't have to stress about how she's feeling. I had to deal with a lot of nagging insecurity (for good reason, it turned out) during the relationship that she didn't feel the same way about me that I did for her.  It was stressing me out more than I realized.  Nice weight off my shoulders.

* My life isn't planned anymore.  I have the freedom to do whatever I want with my evenings, weekends, future, without it being tied to this person.  Of course, I was okay with that and wanted that when we were dating, but it is a great feeling to have control over your future.

* Less dates and gifts = more money for me. Haha.

* I can check out and talk to other women without feeling guilty.

* I've gotten to explore more of my interests; music, movies, working out, nature, lots of stuff.  Having the free time at first was sad because that time was always spent doing something fun with her, but I've learned to fill it with things I enjoy.

But I'm functioning again. I'm seeing friends. I'm getting off the couch.

I'm starting a new workout regimen on Monday and looking forward to it as I haven't been able to workout for over two weeks now. 

As I type this I want more than anything to text her. Not to beg her to come back but just to tell her how much I miss her, right at this moment. I guess this post is kind of a replacement. 

I know she loves and misses me and for the life of me (and believe me I've spent countless hours trying to determine it) I can't figure out why she didn't want to work things out like we did every other time. Knowing that I can't let go of the idea of us maybe getting back together at some point but I accept its out of my hands. She made a choice and I fought for her and put myself out there. There's nothing more I can realistically do and I accept the fact that if this is ever going to work again she has to decide she made a mistake and she has to reach out to me and put herself out there like I did a little over a week ago. 

Whether she'll ever do this, I don't know. But what I do know is even though I miss her like crazy and I could be a mess again tomorrow, things are going to be okay. I've realized I have a lot of personal issues and I'm making goals to improve myself for the first time in years.

*To E,*


You were my best friend for the last nine months. I want to hate you, but I still love you. You crushed every piece of my self-esteem and I'm struggling to pick myself up. 


I gave you everything you. I never asked for anything return. I was there for you, I compromised, every fucking time. I feel so stupid looking back on us, why the fuck did I invest so much? I meant it when I said I love you. I fucking love you. 


I'm going out, I'm having fun. But I fucking hate it because it's all pretend. I know I'm not doing this for myself. I'm doing this to spite you. You're flaunting your freedom in my face and I want to get back at you. I hate feeling resentful. I want to heal on my own terms. I want to be happy again for myself. I am tired of feeling spiteful. I'm  even more tired of being sad. Especially when you are having the time of your life. 


I wish could forget about you but I can't. Because every fucking time, at the end of every day. I just fucking cry and I can't stop. Fuck you, why did it come to this? I guess the grass is always greener on the other side. You never wanted a relationship, you thought you did. You want freedom, you want to flirt and fuck around. It's okay, I'm letting you go. 


Just remember, don't expect me to be there. Don't expect me to help you up when you're down, don't expect me to tell you it's going to be okay. Because, I'm down on the ground. You left me hanging. 


I'm going to get up. I've lost my best friend, frankly you don't deserve that title. But it's for the better. I know I deserve more. Fuck you. I'm going to be strong.

She wants to be ""friends.""  We dove head first into an amazing relationship so we were never friends to begin with.  Things faded after a while and we grew apart.  We never acknowledged that things were rough between us, we just coasted into the inevitable break up.

Each day is a roller coaster of emotions.  At one point in the day I think ""I do deserve more than her.  I deserve to be happy again.""  I know that there are plenty of other girls out there.  I'm certain that I will eventually find someone.  But at this point I don't want anyone else.  After being with several other people (physically, no emotional attraction) I still find myself wanting her.  Thinking ""I wish I could go back to (inset memory of ex) when we were happy.""  Things we used to do together just don't seem complete anymore.  Everywhere I go I am reminded of memories of her.  See a blonde on the street, could that be her?  Do I want that to be her?  I want to see her but its so hard seeing her as ""a friend"" rather than her boyfriend.

She has mentioned that maybe in the future things could possibly work out but I don't want to sit around waiting for her, looking into every little text or call.  At times I want NC but then every time my phone rings I think ""Could that be her?  Is she thinking about me too?""  We went a couple months of NC and it was probably the worst time of my life.  

It's not just the relationship I miss but her specifically.  The jokes we had, the way she looked at me, the way she was a self proclaimed dork, the way she couldn't dance, and the little things that separated her from any other girlfriend that I have had.

After a dinner a few days ago with just us 2 and heading back home, we got stuck in the elevator and she said how she didn't enjoy our one on one company anymore and her mind is pretty made up. She's found a place today to move out in a couple weeks, which sorta seals it.

Obviously I feel differently, I enjoy every moment with her. In fact, I often plan a lot of things around her schedule so I end up being available to spend time or hang out together with our groups of friends. That's a different story tho.

My ex and I broke up on relatively shaky terms after 2.5 years, I would argue that we were each others first loves. The whole break-up stemmed from her and I not seeing each other for our entire summer break from university even though we live in the same city and me becoming increasingly frustrated with that. However, the break-up was wanted by her, and I abliged knowing it was probably for the best to start moving on with my life. 
After the break-up I went through the general grieving process, but she strung me out the entire way. First saying she wanted to be friends, then cutting me off entirely. Whatever, that was her decision, I won't pretend it wasn't partially my fault for trying to hang on, but I digress. 

There were 3 points (I have horrible, horrible luck, but thats a topic for another subreddit) where I had to be hospitalized since the breakup. Once during a work-related injury (I worked construction this summer) were I was literally 4 inches away from death, but thankfully walked away with a dislocated shoulder, once during a rugby game and once after I got jumped walked home.

I seriously just want to tell her to go fuck herself and be on with my day.

What should I do, Reddit? Am I wrong for just wanting to tell her to go fuck herself like she did with me? Or should I afford her some sort of humility because of the gravity of the situation?

I just wanted to share how I am currently dealing with my break up and maybe it will help someone.

To get ""over it"" something snapped in my head, i felt it. This is the second time he breaks up and looking back on the problems we had I was suddenly able to realize many things such as remembering that life continues and is just as beautiful as i remember it when i was younger, its a cliche but its true, enjoying the moment. That and that i shouldnt kid myself in thinking i was happy, because no matter how much I fought for us, deep inside i knew i wasnt completely happy and didnt deserve the way i was being treated and I found myself wanting more for myself and became hungry to take a bite our of this world.

I had goals once and i stopped working on them when i started loving him, the relationship consumed me, it was all i was thinking about and would be working on, and too crazy in love to want anything else anyways in the world. 

But one cannot be lazy and give up on goals, it is the essence of who we are, we all visualized our perfect self as we grew up  and how we wanted to be a few years down the line and there is no reason we cannot be the best person we want to be.

At some point you need to stop letting your emotions of selfpity boss you around and do the right/logical thing, whether you need to move out, get healthy, get a better job, go to school, get into that hobby you always wanted, read more books or anything. For your own self growth. And same socially, work on yourself, be the person people find funny and want to hang out with, be the person who handles situations with grace and logic, be an example for friends who are going through breakups too, someone they can look up to, it is a great feeling but to feel looked up to, very fulfilling. Look forward and remember that one really grows when outside their comfort zone, its not gonna be easy if you approach it like its a chore, you need to approach the next steps you will make in life as an constant discovery adventure

I still love him but when thinking logically, there are reasons why  its over and I understand his decision. But if its meant to be then it will be but for now its time for both to grow into who we really are. 

Another tip that helped me through all the turbulence was constantly reminding me ""what would Spock do?""  and to handle any situation, texting and conversation with as much neutrality, class and logic, no matter the snappy or hateful things you would rather say.

The future is bright, but you wont see it for a while and its normal it has to come from within, nothing anybody really says will do that unless it comes from you and you realize your own worth.

Watch the sky, sunsets, sunrises, stars and the moon, its not only beautiful but it gives perspective about one self and our problems in this gigantic universe. 

much love

I was heartbroken, making posts here and in twox about how I couldn't handle my boyfriend leaving me.  I remember feeling like I had nothing left, like there was no point in going on.  I remember a deep conversation with a close friend (at the time) about how I no longer had the motivation for anything and felt like maybe it would be better if I just didn't have to suffer anymore.  I suffered two months of feeling like that while we sorted out our belongings and our home.  At the end of March he walked onto an airplane and I haven't seen him since.

I moved in with my parents, several hundred miles from where we lived together.  I have a job that allows me to travel a lot, and live wherever I want.  I've been thankful for it through this process.

I spent our first month apart alternating between work and laying in bed crying.

I started to feel more like myself in May, but some days were still tough.  I lived in an bedroom in my parents house, work a lonely job, and felt like I had no friends.

At the beginning of June I hit what felt like rock-bottom.  My mother and step-father would argue incessantly, while I was home and away, and they soon came to the decision to give up after 12 years and divorce.  My stepdad immediately kicked me out.  My first reaction, on a drunken afternoon in a small city after spending the day at the bar with coworkers, was to reach out to my ex about my situation.

I was met with no response for several days.

I spent the next few days staying with a friend in Detroit, trying to sort out what I was going to do.  Where I was going to go.  And that weekend, as I was getting ready for work I received an apology from the ex for not responding.  But then no further response. 

It was in that moment I realized just how much better off I am without him.  Why was I so hung up on a person that didn't care about me in the least?  Why had I believed this boy that had repeatedly told me he loved me, that he would always love me, that he wanted to be my friend no matter what?

Fuck him.

Since then (that was a little less than a month ago) I have learned exactly who and where my friends are.  I've realized just how much I let myself be changed by the ex (and the one before him).  I woke up and realized that I am a great person, and I deserve SO MUCH BETTER.  I actually have a bunch of friends that care about me!  When I was homeless, I had people stepping up to offer me a couch, people I would have never expected to care.  

This week I moved into a new home.  I'm not homeless anymore.  I returned to the city where he and I lived together, and I've said fuck it.  I remember all the anxiety I used to have about ""memories"", and fear of running into people that knew us and what they would ask.  Fuck it.  On my first full day I went downtown, walked right into where he used to work, and shopped.  I didn't see a single person I recognized, or that knew us, and it felt great.  Last week I went to dinner with a coworker and her friends that I did not know previously, and I had a blast.  I bought a ticket for a concert -- right now I don't know if anyone is going with me and I don't care, I'll go alone.  I'm going to a Reddit meetup on Thursday at a bar -- maybe I'll make even more friends!  I'm trying to round up some people to go see ET in the park on Wednesday.   I set up a new OK Cupid profile, made a friend on the other side of the country, and we text constantly and are making plans to travel together.  I'm getting back to the person I was a long time ago, before I ever got into a serious relationship and let myself be changed by the men I was spending too much time with.

Need guidance on how to make things better.",17,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/uizrb/a_year_after_my_breakup_gf_cheated_on_me_i_have/,"I broke up with my GF about year back after she cheated on me. I lost my best friend (and a few others) as well in the process due to complications I don't want to dwell into. Most of my other friends are married and too busy with their personal lives. Or they are no longer in the same city as I.  

I had two short term affairs in the last one year. The first one sexual in nature and I couldn't emotionally connect with the woman. I lost her when she got serious and I couldn't handle it. The second woman I connected with was emotionally a little more satisfying but she is way too young for me and our life wasn't heading in the same direction. Besides, I felt more like a mentor to her than a boyfriend. So I had to disconnect with her as well when I felt things may have been getting more serious.

I stay alone in a house I lived with my GF for 3 years. It is a constant reminder of the times I have spent with her. I am unable to move out as it is going to be a painful effort (too many things) and I have been trying to get out of this city/country if possible. Besides, I love the house I stay in and it would be very hard for me to find an equal or a better place to move into for the rent I am paying. So I would rather leave this city than shift. I have no certainty for when this relocation could happen but I am aiming for the end of this year. Shifting within the city in the interim doesn't seem worthwhile. There is also a minor possibility that I may be stuck her for another two years. The uncertainty of this bugs me.  

I have a nice job that pays me well and keeps me busy. I however don't like bringing people in my professional life to my personal life outside of work. I have had a bad experience with this in the past. Besides, work is one place where I have my peace of mind. I don't want to spoil that by bonding with work-people outside of work.  

The last one year, I have hit the gym and lost 10 kgs, read a lot many books, learnt to play the drums and gotten good at photography. I have tried to keep myself busy doing a lot many things.  

However, at the end of all this, I feel very lonely. All the hobbies feel like a fake substitute for emotional bonding with other people. I don't have many opportunities to make friends. When I am going for photography classes or drumming, I am way too focused on it to prioritize and seek out social connections. I prefer for things to happen naturally. Hitting a club/pub to pick up women isn't really an option. It just doesn't work that way in this country (hence the attempt to relocate from this place).   

I am 31 now and I feel the need to find one woman and settle down. I am at loss of ideas on how to make this happen. Even worse, I can't even make friends and I find myself alone at home on a Sunday evening without a soul to call and go out with. It is depressing. I know time will heal and things will change but I can't just sit and wait for things to happen. I don't feel very optimistic about things getting better without me doing anything about it. And I don't know what more to do. Everything I have done so far hasn't cured my depression from the breakup. To worsen it all, I can't honestly admit to myself that I am over my ex. If she ever comes back to me, my loneliness may drive me to accept her back even I rationally know that this isn't the smartest move. This knowledge is quite disturbing as well.     


EDIT: Things have gotten to a point where I am unable to perform my chores because of the strong feeling that everything I am doing is a cheap substitute for human connection. I don't feel like attending to my routine because it is becoming very monotonous. And when I stop doing this, I just sit and wonder what to do and actually end up doing nothing which makes me feel much worse.

We liked the same music, we hated the same politics.  We both loved to sit around and watch movies and play games.  We enjoyed each other's company.  

She lived in a crappy run down apartment, alone in a shady part of town.  She and I became a team.  There was only one problem, drugs.  

She got off of drugs (pills) and onto suboxone, things shaped up quick.  We decided to move in together and signed a 15 month lease.  15 months went by without serious incident, we renewed our lease in january of 2012.  

She suddenly lost her job, started drinking heavily and quit caring about the most basic of things.  She no longer cared to clean or cook, to wash her clothes, or any of those basic things.

I became suspicious, I felt like she was cheating, I knew it in my heart.   But I had been cheated on before and still wore the scars, I chalked it up to paranoia.  We had great sex, hours of sex in one night.  Foreplay, oral, ropes and toys.  In the shower, on the floor, in the woods, on the bed.  Where ever and whatever we wanted.  

As she was unemployed I helped her find work, I payed our bills, I bought our food.  She drank.  I asked her to sober up or take it easy the very least.  This was my error.  Instead of trying to quit or moderate her drinking she tried to ""get with"" my best friend.  When he refused her she found some random guy at a bar.

The whole time she inflated my ego with tales of how wonderful I am.  A few more random guys happened (I didn't know this at the time).  Then my co-worker happened,  I had grown suspicious before this so I caught them hanging out.  They didn't have a chance to fuck.  Then some other random dude, I asked her to just break up with me and walk away if she didn't want just me.  She told me good things and I listened (kind of) then I stole her cell-phone and found out about ""all these mentioned guys"". The co-worker was the only one I knew about already.  

I had locked myself in the bathroom with her phone, she was standing outside beating on the door and cursing my violation of her privacy.  How dare I violate her privacy!  How dare I take the truth that she steadfastly refused to give freely.  I knew in my heart she had become a snake, no words filtered through her lips carried the truth.  She wouldn't tell me the truth so I stole it.

Now armed with the truth, I opened the door.  She grabs my arm claws dig in deep, stabs me with the pen she was using to try and pick open the door.  And demanded I return her property.   

5, maybe 6 men (boys I should say).  She used us all like puppets.  Regardless of the fact that I had supported her financially for half a year, she had told these young men that I was evil, that I stole every penny she earned and spent it on myself. (Reality is that I payed all the bills &amp; gave her spending money) some of the text I read she actually had convinced these young men to come the her defense. To do me harm.

She was using drugs with them you see. And my money would afford them more pills.  And she was telling them that my money was actually hers, that I had taken it away so that I could go party.  So that I could buy pills and get high without her.  I don't do drugs, ok ok I smoke a little weed, but I don't do other drugs.  I rarely even have a drink.  She was going to have me robbed,  maybe beaten, maybe killed.  Just to get high one more time. 

2 years of caring for each other, 2 years of love, all erased by the toxic pull of pills.

Be careful out there gents,  evil is real.  Sometimes its laying right there beside you telling you how wonderful you are.

* drugs are fun but stay the fuck away from the hard shit.
* cellphones are open windows into the truth,  you can't control what other people text to you.

We broke up completely less than a month ago. We had been on and off for a long time...things were beyond crazy between us but we just kept trying to make things work. 

I've been trying to end things on a better note, it was a bad break up. Every time I try to he just calls me a slut or a whore. I decided I would write him a letter for closure. I spent hours on a 7 page letter. I really thought I had made progress. I really felt like I was able to let go of all the horrible things that happened in our relationship. 

He treated me like shit. He was abusive emotionally physically and sexually. I kept letting him come back because I loved him so much. He also lied all the time and never ever apologized for anything.

I was ready to let go today. I was ready to just send that letter and give him the time he needed to let go of all the bad blood between us until we could be friends again...

Before I can send the letter he tells me he's been hooking up with all these girls. He tells me how he had sex with one, he tells me all these things to hurt me... I was doing so well and now I just feel broken. I never thought he'd turn into that guy. I never in a million years expected him to do that to me. I know we're broken up so I shouldn't care...but we thought we were soul mates. I know that's not the case, but I thought our relationship deserved at least some respect... a proper mourning period. It's been 3 weeks, that's it.

I guess I'm just so hurt right now, I don't even know what to do. I don't even know if it's true. I know I need to just cut him out and move on, but I can't believe someone I can care so much about, can hurt me like that. Even if he is doing those things, why would he need to rub it in my face like that? Why would he feel the need to hurt me after all he's already put me through? I went through complete hell for a year for him...

I'm 25, she's 23. We have been living together for about 1.5 years, with a 5 month break in the middle while she was on exchange. We have lately been making lots of plans together for the future, where we want to live, what jobs we can both get in that city, etc. 

We both usually sleep naked, which I was, but she wasn't for some reason. I noticed she was really tense and not wanting to cuddle with me or anything so I asked what's wrong and she said she doesn't feel like cuddling because she fells like shit. I asked her if it was her stomach, but said ""no, in my mind."" She starts talking, gets all hesitant, I tell her to just say it thinking it is going to be something like ""I'm frustrated with work"" or ""You need to do this better"", whatever. But then she told me ""I don't want to cuddle because I feel like you are more of a friend than a boyfriend."" 

I was in utter disbelief. She went on to say she doesn't love me the way she used to, that it was nothing I did or didn't do it was just a feeling. Yesterday I made her an awesomely romantic dinner, we had great sex afterwords, everything was going fantastic. We had even been talking about kids names a few days ago, then wham. 

So I slept on the couch, and left early in the morning to fly to a different city where I live half the time (trip was already planned). This morning we had an extremely awkward 15 minutes of looking at each others' feet in silence, then I hugged her and she cried, I gave her the keys, she cried more, I told her she would be just fine, because if she wasn't going to be, then she wouldn't have done this.

I guess I am just wondering, are there any females out that have done something similar? What was she thinking and what do I do now? She said she wants to call me later today, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

 UPDATE: So later that day while I was having dinner with a friend and getting drunk she calls me like she said she would.

She took the first flight available and immediately told me ""I love you, I'm sorry. I can't picture being with anyone other than you.""

I apologize.  But I found it necessary to put down in writing why its better that my ex and I broke up.

I just went through a pretty tough break-up with my boyfriend.  He was basically cheating on me, without the actual fucking around.

God that is hard to even write.  To actually put down in words and see it staring back at you…

It happened like three days ago.  And today was his birthday.  We had plans.  We were going to spend the day together.  Yeah, today was really hard for me.

He was my best friend.  Is? Was?  I don’t know.  God I miss him so much. And I just want to call him up.  I just want my best friend back.  But I have to remember that I deserved better than what he gave me.  Memories can tend to cloud the brain, especially when all you remember are the happy times.

I have to remember that he didn’t want to travel.  That is all I want to do.  I'm getting my Master's degree in International Studies!

He Smoked!  I hated it.  And many times he had no regard for my feelings when it came to the smoke, seemingly almost upset at times that he had to curb his habit because it bothered me.

He had a fucking gambling problem.  Like serious, hardcore gambling problem.  We almost broke up over it last summer, almost to the DAY!  But I stood by him and helped him and I worked with him though it and he just had his 1 year anniversary for no gambling.  But everyday I worried, for months I worried about him.  If I didn’t hear from him I drove myself crazy with worry that he was at the casino.  God this relationship was such a mess.  The only reason we lasted so long was our friendship and my force of will.  It should have ended sooner.  But it still hurts.

He would never walk with me or work out with me.  UGH!  I hated this.  I need that support, for my health, for my body.  I need someone who will be by my side as I try to be healthy, not someone who will bitch and moan as I plead and needle them to just come on a walk with me around the block.

He didn’t cherish me.  He DIDN’T CHERISH me!  And I fucking deserve to be cherished.  Not overlooked when times are difficult.  I deserve ALL of your love and ALL of your attention.  I am fucking worth it!

And honestly, J, you may have thought I was okay with it, but our sex life was NOT that great.  Seriously.  Sex is not over just because you finished.  At times you were a very selfish lover.  Maybe you should learn from this.

And I want to say fuck him for neglecting me.  You are an asshole for doing what you did.  I stood by you through so many things!  I deserved better.  FUCK YOU!",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1hwy4x,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hwy4x/trying_to_remember_why_its_better_that_were_apart/,

I deserve something good.**

I genuinely hope he's mentally stable and working on his issues, because someday he's going to realize that it's hard enough to start a relationship with a whole person, but it's near impossible with a fraction of a person, and he is not whole.

Two weeks ago I was feeling great. Life was good, promo at work, organising wedding details for a marriage to my highschool sweetheart who I had been with since I was 19. We were engaged for over a year. She was so into everything about the wedding (was going to be in november) she was picking a wedding dress, invitations, we even paid deposits on the venue and photography (theres 10K I will never get back). Friends and family were booking flights and accommodation.

A week goes by and things seem a little different. Shes more quiet and distant. We sit talk every night and I try my hardest to work through whats troubling her but she doesn't have any answers and over the week she just seems to be pulling further away each day. This freaks me out as we have been such a strong couple for so long. We rarely even have a heated argument we were so well matched.

She says she doesn't know whats up with herself and that shes feeling depressed and shes not sure if she ""loves me enough anymore"". So she decides to move back to her parents for a week to try and get her head straight. I tell her I love her completely and that I will give her the space she needs to sort things out.

She then comes back to our apartment yesterday and sits down and tells me its over and theres nothing we can do to fix it. She rattles off a list of all these issues with our relationship that she said had been getting her down for over a year, NONE of which she had ever even voiced to me before. I don't hang out enough with her group of work friends, I don't do enough work around the flat, theres no longer any trust between us, we have been growing apart etc etc. 

Needless to say I'm staggered...since fucking high school! I had been supporting this girl, working three jobs at one point to pay our rent and bills while studying. Working long hours and overtime to pay for the wedding and honeymoon she dreamed of....

So...shes moved all her stuff out and the only trace of her and our nine years spent together is the engagement ring left on the bed. I'm here alone and single for the first time since I was 19 in a two bedroom flat with most of the furniture gone (she took most with her). All my hopes and dreams for family, honeymoon, purchasing a house which I had been working towards gone...

Its so hard to even know what to do with myself now. I'm going to have to sell the new car we just purchased because I won't be able to afford the loan repayments without her salary contributing. This flat is too big for just me and I will need to downsize. I have never lived alone like this and that by itself is scary. Its like I'm having to start a new life. Make new goals and dreams. At 27, almost 28, 99% of my friends are all married and having kids. This one long term relationship is all the dating experience I have. I'm not an extrovert and have to really try to get out and do all those social things. Shit is not going to be easy for me over the coming months.

Just needed to get this all off my chest, not sure what advice people can really offer apart from try to move on.

I think it already had, but I was the only one who didn't know.  

We'd been long distance for four years, but we spent a lot of time together and made it work.  Well, I did anyway.  He said he didn't want to hold me back, and that he couldn't see a future for us.  It's bizarre because the breakup was a surprise, and I was in love with him.  Or at least I thought I was.  Now, I'm not so sure.  If I miss anything at all, I miss talking to my best friend every day.  I feel like there should be more than that, because that pain gets easier by the hour.

I don't regret being with him but I wish I didn't pretend. While I was pretending I still had this perfect relatioship. Once a week for 35 weeks I was bowling in a league with my friends.

I am feeling so happy. I want to get up in the morning. I feel like me and I am around someone who enjoys me for who I am.

You share.
You build.

You wonder, you doubt.

Still you walk further and further.

The rose-coloured mist is fading.
Underneath, confusion.

You look deeper, you try to understand.
But the mist has gone.
And so have they.

You aren’t walking anymore.
You stopped.

Looking around you see you are not alone.
You see a life so bright.
You envy it.

You see a ruin, still smouldering.
You count your blessings.

Hey Reddit. I usually lurk but had to make an account to get this off my chest and hopefully get some advice/perspective...

TL;DR We broke up, haven't spoken in almost 2 years, and my feelings for her have only grown stronger. Should I break NC and tell her?

I dated a girl for a little over 4 years. We got off to a great start and that momentum never really slowed down between until the very end of our relationship. We were both absolutely insane over each other, everything just fit into place so well. We were best friends as well as significant others. This isn't to say there weren't up's and down's, but we overcame every obstacle and confirmed that we could use those moments of stress or worry to learn and grow together. Marriage and a life together was brought up often (not something to happen immediately, but it was very definitely in our cards for the future).

So things got bad in the last I'd say 4 or 5 months. Stresses with work, money, whether or not we were going to continue living (together) in the same city or move on to something new (obviously together as well). She started to get distant and I did, too. We pretty much let our time and experiences together take a back seat to immediate issues that were mounting up to being more and more difficult to overcome. After so much time together we allowed ourselves to get to a place where we were perhaps too comfortable with each other and didn't take full advantage of what we had.

So, after the stresses and worries and everything else, she began to stray farther and farther away and eventually found herself being attracted to other people (there was no cheating, on this I believe her absolutely). She told me this, and in a teary and emotional next few days we broke up so she could have some time to figure herself out and grow a bit more and her own (and me too, though the break up was mostly her idea).

So here's where we are now, nearly two years later. I have moved out of state for work, she's in the same city. I broke all contact with her so we could both sort of move on and get back in a better frame of mind. The only problem is, while I did grow, learn, and better myself overall mentally and health-wise (thanks, r/keto!) I have not been able to stop thinking about her. At all. I've spent time alone with myself. I've gone out with friends, I've met new people, and even dated and found myself in a couple different relationships - of which none began out of the desire just to be in one - but every time I'm with someone all I can think about is my ex. She's just embedded in my mind.

I've tried accepting it and confronting it, focusing on why she's there and letting time erase that feeling. I've tried pushing it back and focusing on me and others instead. I have only heard snippets about her life from mutual friends, and what I have heard sort of leads me to believe that she feels at least in part the same way.

I don't want to add more damage to how I'm feeling, but the desire to reach out to her and see where she's at and how she is doing is honestly unbearable. I can't shake her and I really want to try again because truthfully she is the one person I feel I've connected with on a far deeper level than anyone else I have encountered.

So, any thoughts or advice? Is it worth breaking the NC after so long? Even with my feelings as strong for her as ever, and knowing that she may feel the same? We're pretty far apart now so I don't even know what's feasible. Thanks for the help.

I can't pin my happiness on her. So what should I do? How should I act?

What if she starts flirting with other guys to get back at me? Or even worse - what if it's not to get back at me, but instead because she's genuinely moved on?

What if we don't speak?

What if we do speak and my feelings for her get stronger? How will I feel the next day?

What if this? What if that? Screw it. This is how I'm going to act: exactly how I feel. I realise that she will influence my feelings throughout the night, but I'm not going to try and pretend it doesn't bother me, or 'step up' my game. I'm just gonna be me and try my best to have a decent time. If that means not talking much then so be it.

But she'll see that I'm sad about us breaking up, she will know that I still    care!! she will win!!

There is no winning or losing. The game's over. Time to be incredibly selfish and just act exactly how I feel. Let her be her and let me be me. 

It's gonna be a difficult night. I'm not going to try and plaster on a fake smile or try and win her back. I'm just going to make nice conversation, laugh at other peoples joke, sit back, and try my best to relax.

It doesn't matter how long we were dating; we loved each other. A lot. We told each other almost everything and we were happy with each other. It was never perfect, but we so rarely fought and I was happy to be with him. I loved him.

I have emotional problems, I will admit that. I don't talk about my feelings of depression because they only happen occasionally and when they do happen I just like to be by myself until my emotions level out. I don't like sharing this with anyone and it was a really big step forward for me to tell my boyfriend that I was sad. That I wasn't always happy and full of life and that I didn't always see the positive side of life. Well I did and the next day he came over and told me he was done with me. He explained that he had problems of his own and that I was bringing him down when he had so much to deal with. I didn't want our relationship to end, but that's what he wanted. I told him to get out of my house and he left.

I thought maybe if I gave him a few days to cool off things would be fine. So I contacted him again a few days later and he said he wanted to talk about it and meet me. He picked me up in his car and we talked about how he was doing badly in school and how he thought his friends hated him, how I was always making him feel guilty (to this day I still don't have a fucking clue how I made him guilty and I've asked people outside of the situation if I ever did and they said that they had no idea what he was talking about either). I told him that this wasn't a reason to break up with me, that just bailing wasn't the solution, and then he broke down, started to cry, and said that I was right and that he missed me and all that bullshit. He wants to get back together, so I'm happy, and I told him only if he's sure and he says that it's what he wants.

We go back to his place, hangout for a few hours, then we have sex. After I fuck him, he tells me that he actually doesn't want to get back together and that I forced him to. Even though I really, and I swear on my mother's life, I never forced him to do anything. I didn't hold a gun up to his head, I didn't threaten my own life if we didn't get back together, all I did was say that I didn't want to break up. All he had to do was be a man and stick with his decision. But no. Instead, he pretends as if he's really happy to get back together, tells me he never wants to break up again, and then conveniently waits until after he has fucked me to tell me that it's actually not what he wants and that I should leave. 

I've never fallen out of love with someone so quickly. I'm disgusted with him. I was mad at first and lashed out. I was angry, but who wouldn't be?  Then I calmed down and tried to get everything in my life back on track. I tried ignoring him but he called me one day and said he was having a panic attack and that I needed to go over. I go over and he's crying and telling me he doesn't care about anything in his life anymore. I try to comfort him because, I dunno, I feel bad for him now and I'm just trying to make sure we both get out of this okay at this point. Then he kisses me. Which is confusing. I don't want to kiss him back, but I feel like if I don't he'll freak out, so I do. And then he smiles and says he'll miss doing that and I tell him that I have to go, but he seems better. After that we agree that we can be friends and that we can still help each other out if either of us needs to talk. Well the one time I go to him for help, he freaks out and yells at me, telling me that he's not my boyfriend anymore and that he can't listen to my problems. But of course all the times he's contacted me to talk is perfectly fine, I'm just not allowed to ask him for help. Okay. Great. I tell him I won't talk to him about shit anymore and he seems fine with it.

My problem is that I can't get over the fact that he is in any way happy with his life now. I really feel like a woman scorned or some shit like that. I'm angry and I don't think it's really fair that he used me and then sent me through emotional torture for a month until I told him I didn't want to hear from him again. I wish these were the fucking middle ages and that women were the dominant sex so I could fucking nail his dick to his forehead for this bullshit. I've actually never been so angry at anyone in my life. I don't see how it's fair that he gets to keep going on about his merry way, with everyone thinking he's this great guy, when he tricked me into having sex with him, lied and manipulated me, and then threw me away like a piece of trash. As a child who grew up without her father, I already have abandonment issues and even though he knew this, he did it anyway. So what do I do? I guess just keep ignoring him and hurting? How do I trust other people? I want to start dating again someday and I really don't know how to go about doing that. I literally feel sick to my stomach when guys ask me to hangout and I've turned down a lot of people who have asked me to go out because I just don't feel ready yet. But if I were to prepare myself to be ready to date again, what would I do? Should I just have lots of sex with guys I don't have to see again? Should I not be having sex at all? Am I crazy? Are there other crazy people out there? Am I going to die alone? Just someone tell me what the fuck I should be doing.

TL;DR: My ex is a pussy. He dumped me. I don't know how to trust guys anymore. He has actually given me a prejudice against the opposite sex.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1drgzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1drgzs/20f_i_got_dumped_and_now_i_cant_trust_anyone/,
1367344960.0,14,self.BreakUps,1dfazk,My Girlfriend (23F) left me (23M) after five year relationship. I know it was my fault that she left.,17,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1dfazk/my_girlfriend_23f_left_me_23m_after_five_year/,"Hello Reddit, this is going sound like a rant but I just want to get some things off my chest. Here a little back story. We met when we were in high school as being just friends. I never had any feelings for her at that time, I just thought she was a pretty girl and we never really got close. On our graduation night she told me that she had a crush on me. I was being a stupid and told her like her too. I know wasn’t thinking straight with my head and was just over joyous when someone tells me they like me.  Things went on from there and eventually we ended up being together. 

The first 2 years was wonderful as we felt like we were inseparable. I know this is probably because of the “honey moon” stages. I know she loves me with all her heart and would give up the world for me. However after a while I just became lazy, I put no effort into the relationship and whenever we fight or argue she will always be the one running back to me. I never admitted to being wrong even when I was. I was just way too comfortable with her always being there and took advantage of it. I took advantage of her. I am also not the type of person to talk about my feelings even with my girlfriend so we also had some communication issues. I just have problems expressing how I feel. Our relationship became a weekly routine where we would have no contact during the weekdays and only go out on the weekends. 
2 weeks ago she told me and pointed out the obvious. Things were not going were we wanted to be and she broke up with me and ignored all my text and calls. I didn’t get any response from her until I waited outside her house all night. I told her I was sorry for being such an idiot and I took advantage of her. I told her that I still loved her and I cared for her and I actually meant it, but it was too late to salvage the relationship.

I know I was an idiot and a really shitty boyfriend. I took advantage of someone I love and broke her heart way too many times. I feel like a complete idiot and I regret hurting her. I know it’s a good thing for her to leave me. I didn’t give her my all and I regret it. I’m sorry for not calling her at night and not communicating better with her. Not telling her how I feel. I didn’t give her the attention she required and I regret it. 
For guys out there that still has their girl by their side. Please don’t be like me. Please call her and tell her how much she means to you. Please tell her that you love her and wants to spoil her rotten. Grab her and hold her in your arms. Tell her you cherish her and never want to let her go. It’s really true you don’t know what you have got until it’s gone. I have been really depressed since she left I know I brought this on myself. I just don’t want anyone to feel the way I do.

**TLDR; My girlfriend left me because I put no effort into the relationship. I still love her and miss her, I have a lot of growing up to do and I know it better for her to cut me out of her life. Please don’t be like me.**

Start No Contact, move on and she might come back",21,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cp9as/if_you_just_got_dumped_please_read_my_story_and/,"I'd like to first off say to everyone that as soon as you get dumped START NO CONTACT. Don't respond to texts or calls unless they really want you back. I know I got that advice from everyone when I did and I tried, then ignored it and now here I am, hurt 100 times more than originally.

We went out for 1 year and 2 months.

I'm a M [20] and she's a F [19].

So, it all began spring break. We texted each other every day as usual, say I love you before we went to bed every night. Then on Saturday Night I texted her good night and love you but to no response. I didn't really worry. She was off with her new team on spring training and she was probably tired from the trip and went to bed early. Well Sunday morning I drive up to college all day and finally get there, unpack my things and relax and watch TV. Well she finally texts me asking me when I would get back, and I told her I just did. She told me she'd be over soon. She came over and we talked about eachothers break, had sex and told each other that we loved each other afterwords. She was acting funny though sometimes, but I just thought that because we haven't seen eachother in a week that it was just normal. Well she gets tired really early and asks if we can go to her place to sleep and I agree. We go back, sleep and snuggle, and then wake up and go to classes. 

Now my second class comes around and in the middle of it I get a text saying we need to talk. I ask her why she can't just tell me in a text and to just text it to me. She tells me she fell out of love, that we don't have that spark anymore, and all that stuff that I found out was the normal bullshit girls say when they're dumping you. Well I leave class early because my heart just got smashed and I meet her at the bus stop and begin to cry like a bitch. We sit next to eachother on the bus back to my place, and finally when we get to my room I ask her why, what happened, that I love her more than anyone and I'll do anything to keep us together. She just looked at me cold, didn't shed one tear and just told me shes moved on and doesn't love me like she used to. 

That almost two months ago, and I just initiated and will STAY NO CONTACT this time for good. 

Now she leaves and I just lay in my bed crying, don't go to the rest of my classes for the day, and end up at her place that night asking for more answers. Well she kissed one of the guys on the team at the party Saturday night, and told me that she didn't like it (lie) and that it had nothing to do with dumping me.

I kept begging for three more weeks, coming over to her place to talk, thinking of things to say, phrases, anything to get her back to me. I started searching the internet for answers, what to do, how to get her back, and I read many places that it was to start no contact. So I told her that I needed to fall out of love with her and started not talking to her. I still loved her and thought to myself that she would surely miss me and want me back eventually. Well four days pass, and I break no contact telling her I can't have her out of my life. She responds that she miss me and asks me to come over and I started jumping for joy.

I came back, we talked, and eventually got intimate and had sex. She cried afterwards and we both snuggled naked. Well after all that she felt like she didn't want me again, and so I beg and say give me one week to win you back and she eventually agrees. Well this just lead to arguing and me trying to talk to her about us when all she wanted to do was watch Netflix or do her homework while texting her friends. I tried being intimate with her again when we slept together but she'd just say stop I want to sleep and so we slept. Now after three or so days of this trial I felt like I couldn't take it anymore and told her that.

So I start no contact again and then last two or three days and come crawling back to her telling her shes the one and I need her more than anything. She says she wants me back but can't. I ask her why and she tells me because of David, which was the guy who she kissed at the party over spring break. The night before I broke no contact originally and she told me she misses me and for me to come over, she went over to Davids house, got drunk and fucked him.

This made me so angry I called her awful things, told her off, and went back to my place. I start hanging out with my friends to relax and thats when she starts sending me text after text that night, telling me she wants me back, that shes so sorry and that she made an awful mistake and that we can get past this. My friends all tell me to ignore those texts and I did that night.

Well, the next day I read them all over again and I still love this girl with all my heart and so I text her back saying we can get back together and we can work through this. Now she says she's not sure she wants to. Well that pissed me off so I packed up everything that was left in my apartment she gave to me (shirts, presents, etc..) and went over to her house to give it to her. 

Then I do a stupid thing and have sex with her again. I'm not going to say I didn't love it, I did. But she told me afterwords that she couldn't get back together with me.....because of David. Because she has a crush on David. Oh, but she still loves me. Well me being blinded by love started getting back into begging mode and begged for two more weeks for her back.

I finally stopped. She was my first love, girl I lost my virginity to, and my best friend. We hung out everyday together. What sucks the most is that I still love her.

Block her on facebook, delete her phone number, and don't respond until you can seriously look in the mirror with your self respect and pride back, because right now I'm trying to find it and get it back.

She cheated on me, fucked the guy she cheated on me with, and in the end I felt like the bad guy. But I'm not the bad guy. Ya, we had fights near the end of our relationship. I became lazy and boring to her at the end. But nothing constitutes cheating. And its my own fault for trying to get her back. 

I dragged my broken heart only for it to get raped by a pack of wolves. Once she breaks it, don't let the wolves rape it.

**TL;DR:** Seriously do no contact. I wish I did. I wish I never went through these past two months. Only talk back to her if she wants you back. Thats it. ",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1cp9as,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cp9as/if_you_just_got_dumped_please_read_my_story_and/,

I wasn't expecting a response and I didn't see it until Monday (yesterday) at work. it was polite, encouraging, supportive.... all the things he always was. after work i went to my friend's house to vent and just not be alone, and he called. out of the blue. 

i was shocked because he was the one that seemed reluctant to keep the communication open (a request i made before i decided to do NC), so why was he calling me? i've been pretty good about not contacting him at all, but as soon as he called i didn't even hesitate to answer. he said he just wanted to check up on me and i told him i was at a friend's house and that i would call him later.

then i spent the rest of the night talking myself out of calling. making my friend give me every reason not to call him back. and i resolved not to call. but then today at work... my resolve weakened and my curiosity took over. so today, i called him after work. 

he asked me how i was doing. we caught up a bit about what we'd been up to over the past week/weekend. everything was very cordial. he said he wasn't sure if he should call and that he was conflicted. he wanted to be there for me but he also realized that he was the source of the pain. he asked me how i felt and i told him that i appreciated him checking up on me and that i was happy, but it's also very complicated. he said he understood and said he wouldn't contact me and i could contact him if/when i was ready. i was very calm. i held back my tears, i held back all of the questions i had and all of the things i really wanted to say to him. 

i don't know how i feel. i'm happy that he called and i'm happy that he cares but at the same time it hurts. it hurts because, although the conversation was very supportive and i know he's trying to be there for me, the affection and the love that was in our other conversations wasn't there. i know he's holding back and maintaining distance so that he can be there for me objectively. 

i know i shouldn't have answered. i know i shouldn't have called back. and i don't plan on calling him again. i was just so curious about what he had to say. i just wanted to indulge myself. and the call didn't change anything, it didn't change my feelings or his, there's still no chance we're getting together. it was just so bittersweet hearing from him. i'm happy that he called but it hurts. it opens old wounds. i keep holding on to this sliver of hope that he'll have a change of heart and come running back. i know i know. THIS IS WHY WE DO NC. i understand, i really do. 

i'm just so weak. and i miss him so much. and it hurts. it tears me apart. ",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1ci8p8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ci8p8/day_9_he_emailed_and_called/,

I suppose that one could say that I'm going through a sort of ""denial"" phase while in the process of grieving over losing the person I thought was the love of my life.  I can honestly say that with this individual, I felt as though I could be myself...I felt comfortable around them, and we had just the right amount in common.  For a decent amount of time (a combined total of four years overall), I provided him with a place to stay, rent-free. He was employed for chunks of time here and there, but for the most part the expenditures were left up to me.  I also cooked, cleaned, and was never stand-offish when it came to other certain activities. We got married in 2008, and it seemed like not too terribly long after that, things began to go downhill. 

 I'm by nature somewhat of a shy person, so I didn't always go into super-perky, divulge in everything about myself conversation mode with different people, including some of his close friends.  Without even getting to know me, while he was staying with them for a while (I was busy with work), they tried to convince him to leave me, and upon returning he told me that he almost listened to them and thought about just not coming back.  I was floored, but I calmly stated my feelings on the issue, and that was overcome. 

As the years went by, he began to habitually say very negative things to me, despite my contributions both to the relationship and our cohabiting.  Now, I'm not a ""looker"" by any means, and have always had self-confidence issues, and he seemed to be aware of that.  However, in one particular instance, we were looking at bathing suits when we came across one for women (it was a style that was the new fad at the time, very skimpy and revealed the navel without being an actual bikini).  I noticed him being rather enthralled with it, at which point I said ""Sorry babe, but I don't think I could rock that look.""  His reply was ""Oh, I wasn't imagining you in it, I was imagining some of your friends wearing it.""  It was quite hurtful, but I pretty much let it slide without really saying anything.

He was in the Air Force for about five years some time before we met, and considers that to be his greatest achievement so far, and to some extent, rightfully so.  However, I have had an extremely difficult life, and have had little opportunity to do anything quite of that magnitude, despite many smaller accomplishments over time.  He would often make it a point to tell me that he had ""Done far more than I had previously, so my achievements are better than anything you have done.  You have not used an ounce of your potential throughout your whole life.""  He was dishonorably discharged for talking back to a superior in the Air Force, and has not had much of what could be considered a ""real"" career ever since; this hasn't been an issue in my eyes, because in a way I believe that one can be happy and fulfilled in positions that are technically menial in nature.  However, while I was working on getting into college, he had no job, didn't do very much around the house, and spent most of his time either in front of the computer or playing video games.  I tried to motivate him to go back to school himself so that he could utilize his intelligence and be more satisfied with life.

One day, I had to take care of some red tape so that I could begin taking classes, and he happened to have come along with me for the day.  Prior to, I had no idea that the lines for the school offices would be quite lengthy, and sadly I was stuck in the building for an hour or so, but I was doing what I needed to do.  Upon returning to him, where he sat comfortably in the car with the A/C and the Sony PSP I had given him, he immediately began to complain that he ""Doesn't like to be kept waiting, no matter the reason, and that I took entirely too long.""  I chose not to remind him that he was currently living with me, rent-free, with no job (he did not try very hard in that department), and with no intent to go back to school himself; I instead apologized and suggested that maybe he would benefit from going back to school himself.

  After being accepted, I focused on my studies, maintaining at least a 3.7 GPA throughout my whole time at the technical college.  At one point I changed what I was majoring in, which he also critiqued, despite my attempts to say that sometimes people realize their limitations and change their minds.  I graduated in 2009, and sadly I have never been able to become employed in the field I studied, so I moved on to a local university, where I have also studied diligently and would consistently get good grades (I have been on the Dean's list multiple times at both institutions), and subsequently my hard work paid off in the form of earning extra scholarships that went towards our living expenses.  In 2010, he enrolled at the same local university, and things really began to look up.


Over the course of two years, my grandmother with whom I was extremely close with, began to deteriorate in depressing ways (I just learned yesterday that she has had Alzheimer's), and my brother and I were tasked with ensuring that she received proper care at home, made it to doctor's appointments, bathe her, etc.  Understandably, my husband seldomly assisted with many of the duties involved with taking care of her, however, at this point I was working, going to school, caring for my grandmother, cooking, cleaning, and being available for marital activities, while all day he could be seen sitting at the computer, playing such a high number of games at any given time that even my other very ""geeky"" friends became rather concerned. 

 At one point he began to keep his twelve-pack of sodas right underneath his computer desk so that he would not have to get up to get a drink; the only times he would stand up were to use the restroom, and the occasional checking in on me...other than that, he would be sitting at the computer/TV for five to twelve hours straight at any given time.  Sometimes I would have a few friends over to chat with and what not, and they noticed that he seemed to have a problem as well, as all of them have said that any time they have seen him, he was at the computer.  It might be safe to say that he has had an addiction to computer usage and gaming, and there were many times where I tried to help him out by mentioning that his lifestyle was not very good for his health, using polite and concerned tones.  There have been many days where I would become extremely worried that he would have a heart attack, or something of that nature due to his extremely sedentary lifestyle, yet anytime I mentioned it, he vehemently denied having any problem of the sort.  


Fast forward to September of last year (2012)...my grandmother had deteriorated to the point where my husband, brother, grandmother and myself had to live in the same house a few months prior to ensure that she remained safe and could be taken care of properly.  Understandably, this put a decent amount of strain on our marriage, as my brother and I had to leave our jobs and focus on caring for grandma, while at the same time attending college (husband, brother and myself were all enrolled); I developed a schedule that ensure that everyone had time for what they needed to take care of, be it school, helping with grandma, etc.  My husband would make the occasional meal for her, but that was about it.  For the entirety of his college career, my husband has performed poorly because he spent his time playing games as opposed to studying...he is a physics major who has failed multiple core math classes required for his degree; I say this not to be spiteful or anything, but I wanted him to do well and tried to help him with time management and his studies. 

 A few days before my birthday in September of 2012, my grandmother was utilizing the bathroom at a time in which (very regrettably), everyone happened to have been asleep.  I woke up to a partially flooded house, and found her extremely out of it, lying on the floor, in a very confused state, partially nude.  She had slipped a bit in the bathroom, hit her head on the counter, and confusedly turned the faucet on and left it running for a number of hours, with the thought that it would clean up the unfortunate mess she had made in the bathroom.  Upon getting her to the hospital, I learned that she was in the throes of a stroke: we would later find out that she had two strokes back-to-back that day.

  My sister, who has always been somewhat abrasive and was capable of saying incredibly hurtful things, immediately blamed everything happening to grandma on me.  The day before my birthday, she sent a barrage of hurtful text messages, saying that grandma would have been better off if I weren't one of the ones helping out with her, that I was doing a bad job of helping, that I was only after grandma's money, etc.  As a side note, grandmother had given my sister $4,000 as a down payment on a brand-new car that she just had to have, something that many of my family members have never even dreamed of or wanted to own, and I have worked hard to pay in full for the various clunkers I have had over the years.  As a result, my sister was working two to three jobs at any given time just to make her car and full-coverage insurance payments, while bouncing around questionable living situations, something that I was definitely not envious of, but it was what she wanted.

  On the day of my birthday, upon showing the mean-spirited texts to my husband (who had up to this point began to spend more time with my sister than with me) began to scream at me: ""You take horrible care of grammy!  Your sister is doing everything that you should be doing right now!  She has jobs and a nice car!  You have done nothing worthwhile with your life!  F*** you!""  Needless to say, this was pretty much my breaking point.  A few days later, after grandmother was released from the hospital, it was decided that she would be moving across the country to stay with the one of her three sons that has spent the least amount of time with her throughout his life, and he and his family are much better equipped to take care of her (my aunt is a former registered nurse), which was difficult to hear because I would be very far away from someone who has always been there for me, but I went along with it fully, knowing it would be the best for my grandmother.

  Up to that point, she had been helping out with the rent and what not, seeing as how my brother and I had to leave our jobs to take care of her, and with her leaving, that would no longer be happening because it would not have been fair for her to be helping with our bills since she no longer resided in the same household.  I had absolutely no qualms with this, and immediately set to the task of finding work in a tough economy while still attending college.  We tried to find other roommates, sold many of our belongings, yet still were unable to sustain the household, and on January 10, we were evicted from the house.

  My husband and I stayed at a few hotels for a week and a half using our student refunds while trying to find a new place.  After this, he convinced me to take a small vacation somewhere because I deserved it after having gone through so much in such a short amount of time.  While I was out of town staying with a few friends, I attained a Skype account so that I could chat with him.  For our first Skype conversation, he promptly told me that he had found a room in an apartment with some roommates, and that he wanted a divorce, and some of his exact words to me were ""You have no home to come home to, Jane Doe.""  My heart literally felt like it broke in two, especially after finding out that he had been wanting to leave me for two years prior to that.  This was in late January, and ever since I have had to rely on the good graces of two very close friends who have been letting me stay on their couch while I try to get my life in order.  He has toyed with me a few times by saying that he might want to get back together, but kept changing his mind.

  He doesn't have the funds to file for a divorce, so nothing has really been set in motion yet.  His reasoning was that ""I don't find you attractive as a woman anymore,"" which he actually said to me in person, and also stated that he had given up on me a long time ago.  I admit that I'm not a perfect person, nor am I very good-looking, but I have worked extremely hard at making our relationship work, as well as contributing pretty much all of my time to taking care of the household, and he has left me pretty much homeless and on the verge of losing my car (I had to take out a title loan to ensure that we could move into a big enough of a house with my grandmother last year), my things in storage, and at this point, my college career (my grades are horrific this semester).

  He still has no job, and his rent is only paid up through the end of this month, so in his eyes he is only trying to find a job where he makes just enough to support himself, failing to recognize that during separation each spouse has a right to equal and separate living arrangements.  I can't afford a good lawyer, and he says that if I contest the divorce, he would have many claims that would make the courts rule in his favor, so he is pretty much trying to blackmail me, despite the fact that the claims he brings up have no validity, and I have people in my life who can attest to that. He has even told me that he is ""perfectly fine without me."" 

 I want desperately to work things out, because despite his flaws, I love him very much and have given six years of my life and time to try to make him as happy and content as possible.  I have never verbally or physically abused him, I have been faithful to him, and I was pretty much always happy to be around him.  He is an intelligent individual with the capability to be very romantic, and we have spent a great deal of fun time together, yet he still has his computer/gaming time issue, no job, and continues to do badly in school, as he is on academic probation for the second time in a row.  I can understand that all of what has happened over the past few months has been extremely difficult on him as well, yet he seems to be completely unaffected by ending our relationship, and he knows that this has devastated me entirely after everything else we went through.

**TL;DR, my husband of five years has essentially abandoned me, despite my consistent contributions to our lives and relationship, has insinuated that he might want to get back together yet has changed his mind, and I don't know if it's worth it to put forth even more effort to try to patch things up, so to speak.**

Some days it feels like 3 years ago, other days it feels like 3 days ago... I have to keep reminding myself it's been almost exactly 3 months. For frame of reference, we were together 1 year and 8 months. He was my best friend for 2 and a half years before we started dating. I was in love with him from the moment I met him. For those of you not great with math, I have been in love with him for 4 years and 3 months. He has known that I love him for the last 3 years and 9 months.

I have done everything right:

-I've only broken NC twice. Once to deliver his things to him (contacted him to set up a time with his roommate to return his things) and once to let him know I needed to delete him and all his friends from FB so I could reactivate it without the constant, painful reminders. Both were valid, businesslike, and transactional interactions. 

-I have gotten shitfaced only once since the break up. My birthday was 3 weeks to the day after he ended it, and I ran into his two good friends while I was out at the bar. I did not drunk text him. I did not embarrass myself. I simply drank too much, blacked out, and was carried home by my wonderful roommate. Since then, I have not drowned my sorrows in drink or drug or anything else.

-I am in therapy. I have been since May of last year, when I started feeling tension and issues in the relationship due to my personal jealousy and insecurity. By the end of the relationship, I had worked through most of those issues and he simply wasn't happy with me anymore. Maybe I waited too long to seek help or maybe it just wasn't meant to work out. What I know is that any problems I contributed to the relationship in the beginning were absolutely resolved by the end of the relationship. There is nothing more I could have done to salvage what we had. It was his choice to end it, and although it hurts I respect his decision.

-When I felt I was ready, I began dating again. I went out with 4 different guys over the last month. I made it to a third date with one of them, and we slept together. This happened this past Friday. It did not mean anything to me, but it felt good to get the first time without my ex out of the way. I broke things off with that guy yesterday. I do not feel sadness or regret for sleeping with that man. He was kind and I did not lie to him about my expectations or intentions, and he was happy to satisfy my physical needs. He was what I needed in that moment.

Most days I feel nothing. I focus on my work and my friendships and my family and I go out and have drinks and eat food and live my life. I don't feel any real passion or fire in my life, as I did when I was with him... but I also don't feel the deep, intense sadness he would make me feel when he would tell me I was holding him back, or that spending one day a week with me was too demanding. I no longer feel loved, but I also don't feel neglected. 

Most days I don't think much about him. And then days like this come along and I feel that all I can do is think of him. My heart aches and my vision swims and I feel sick to my stomach wondering whether or not he still thinks of me. I remember the good times and I remember the days it seemed that he loved me as much as I loved him. I remember lazy summer days on my patio with an RC helicopter and cold winter nights snuggled in watching Muppets movies... But I also remember the way his words cut through me like knives. And I remember never feeling that i was good enough or worth his time. I remember the constant fear of losing him and always being blamed for the flaws in the relationship. I remember all of this, and I don't think I will ever forget any part of it. I hope that one day, all these memories will stop hurting and that the good ones will bring me joy while the bad ones serve as a lesson learned.

I'm taking another break from dating. It was fun for a while, but I'm tired now... I'm tired of trying to make myself feel something for these men and always ending up a bit disappointed that they aren't him... I'll work on myself a bit more. Try to focus on my career and maybe pick up another new hobby or series of books...

I've felt sick about since I found out he was planning on seeing her a week ago. Like actually physically sick -- stomach pain, lump in my throat, tightness in my chest and that all around horrible anxious feeling that you get when you know something shitty is happening. My nerves are shot. 

I was so anxious and stressed about it that I even sent the girl he's seeing a message (I know, I know, a little crazy) telling her that he and I still live together and that he's told me we can talk about our relationship when he gets back from his trip. It wasn't a mean or nasty message, I just thought she should know that I am still in his life. She never replied.

How do I heal emotionally? ,15,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16pr2c/i_23m_broke_nc_with_my_ex_in_the_sappiest_way/,"Last night I sent my ex the sappiest message ever! Here's how it went..

""I don't really expect you to reply to this, but there are some things I need to get off my chest for my own benefit. I know what I'm about to say may be highly disrespectful of our situation, but this really can't wait any longer.

So first off: In the month that we haven't spoken, I've come to realize that I am a very unhappy person. When we spoke on the phone for the last time, you told me that this was causing a lot of pain for you. I never understood what you were saying until I had time to think about it. I took a lot of time focusing on what was causing me pain rather than focusing on what was important...which was you.

I remember all those times you tried to make me feel better, and I just wanted nothing to do with it. I guess you could say it made me feel better just to stew in my own unhappiness, which in itself was a horrible thing. Not just for me, but for you. You were a god-damn angel if there ever was one.

Looking back, you really made me happy, but all I could think of was myself. Remember when you would get so upset at me because you thought I was annoyed by you? I wasn't really annoyed by you. I was annoyed by myself and how I couldn't figure out my own shit. When we broke up I felt relieved in a way, because now I didn't feel like I was burdening you anymore.

But you know what was the kicker? You really cared about me. You cared that I was in so much pain, but didn't know what to do about it.
""R""  you were probably the only person in the whole world who truly cared about me, and I threw it away. No, I pushed you away.

As a side note, not that it matters but I thought you should know. I've been very sick lately. While we were dating, my Crohn's was coming back full swing. It kind of explains why I was constantly tired all the time. I partly blame that on why I was just never willing to do anything, and I feel horrible about it. I wish I was man who took you on the adventure of a lifetime.

I don't know why this all came to me tonight. I just woke up and immediately ran for the computer. I've been debating writing this for the past hour, but I just couldn't take it anymore. You had to know.
So if there's anything I can leave you with it's this....

Thank you for being so perfect to me. I am so sorry for everything I put you through. You deserved so much better than me.
and I know this is the worst time for me to say it, but I don't care.

I love you.""

Her Response :

""I can't say that this message takes me by surprise since you were talking to my friend last night. My worry is that you contact me when you're lonely and realize you lost someone.

Yes, you are a very unhappy person which is why I decided I couldn't see you anymore. I don't know if you're trying to tell me you have changed, you're working on it, or you're just sorry for being that way. Being with you was a burden and as sad as I was when we broke up I was also very relieved - which is why I am hesitant to respond to this message. I really don't want to get dragged back into this emotional turmoil. I'm unsure about what you're wanting from me at this point.

That aside, I appreciate the kind words. It does mean a lot to me that you can recognize your own faults and take responsibility for them.""

So we spoke on the phone right after so I could explain myself further, and I just got the silent treatment mostly. She wants nothing more to do with me. I'm in so much emotional pain right now and I could really use some outside views to help me close on this.

I went home, back to work, and worked on rebuilding my life.  there were some low times there, the worst feelings I've had since I was a young man, horrible thoughts.  I felt like the most worthless person around.

But life went on as it always does.  I got back in touch with the ex after months and we started being friends.  We'd get together every couple of weeks and do something fun.  It was a great time and I was very serious about being friends.  It seemed like she always got more and more distant as time went on though and we'd meet less often.

To shorten the story up, we got together at Christmas and she was more distant than ever.  I finally wrote her off that she just wasn't interested in friendship any more.  And I left it at that, figuring she would call me some time if she wanted to hang out again.  I wouldn't try to force it any more.

My sudden realisation was that her birthday came and went over a week ago, and I didn't even remember it.  Didn't think of it until tonight for some bizarre reason.  For the first time in over 5 years I forgot this womans birthday.  The woman that used to hold so much power over me and consume my thoughts hourly.  Who made me feel so horrible for treating me the way she did.

I still haven't heard anything from her, I don't think I ever will again.  Especially after forgetting her birthday I guess.  But it doesn't matter.


I seem to have gotten to a point where I just don't think about her any more, and other women are becoming very appealing to me.  I'm serious about finding the next 'Ms. Right'.  And you'll get there too, as bad as it feels right now you will love and live again.

She continued/ continues to text me expecting a close friend conversation.. Here's where it gets better.. one of the stages of grief is anger, and sweet baby jesus I've hit that stage!

I used to get all sad when I thought of her but now it's been replaced by anger and it's much easier to get over someone when you can't stand them

I never thought I would reach this because now I'm not sure if I would take her back if she came to me. but before, I was positive that I would.

last time we talked she let something slip out. she was talking about some guy who's all over her and thinks she's just a stupid freshman that he can fuck easily. then she says ""these kinda guys make me feel dumb for leaving you because I feel like I'm only gonna meet assholes""

that statement right there, let me know she didn't leave me because I did anything like she said.. She left me because she thought she could do better.

but I know that she can't (immature maybe but I don't care) so she's gonna get hurt by these bad boys she left me for and then realize that I was a really good guy and come crawling back. but I'm not an option so she'll be greeted by a big ""fuck you""

so all those people out there who think that they'll never get over their  ex, you will. and when you hit the anger stage of grief, don't deny it.. embrace it. just don't do anything illegal.

One of the most painful things in life is losing yourself in the process of loving others too much, and forgetting that you are special too.  When was the last time someone told you that they loved you just the way you are, and that what you think and how you feel matters?  When was the last time someone told you that you did a good job, or took you someplace, simply because they know you feel happy when you’re there?  When was the last time that ‘someone’ was YOU?

1355421594.0,16,self.BreakUps,14smvz,My (24m) plans after a 5-year relationship with her (24f),16,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/14smvz/my_24m_plans_after_a_5year_relationship_with_her/,"I never imagined that I would be making a post about personal issues like this, but I guess the main goal for this is just to get my thoughts out of my head so I can move on a little faster. 

Some history: We met Freshman year of college, and started dating Sophomore year. We were both 19 at the time. I was living in a house with a bunch of roommates, but we spent most nights together. Senior year, we moved in to our own apartment. Spent about 6 months apart while she finished up a last semester, and I moved to NC for my job. She ended up getting a job down here as well (same employer), and moved down here too. We decided to buy a house at the beginning of last year. House and mortgage are in my name since she didn't have established credit, but I've put a lot more money into it than she has. 

When we first met, neither of us wanted kids. I was much more career focused than she was, and she had issues with mild depression, but was managing it well. She had all of the traits I wanted in a partner - logical, geeky, down to earth, a sense of humor (however limited), responsible, caring, motivated, didn't have expensive taste. We spent a lot of time together - hanging out and talking, playing airsoft, computer stuff, watching movies, walking the dogs, hikes through the woods, and recently, riding motorcycles. We never fought, and rarely argued and when we did, it was civil and controlled. Neither of us have temper issues. 

A year or two ago, she started thinking that she might want kids, specifically adopting a couple. I've never been one to enjoy being around kids, but everyone told me that it would change. A few months ago, we bought up the possibility of marriage. We had been together for a while, and everything was going seemingly well. The topic of kids came up again. While I don't foresee wanting kids now, I am open to the possibility that my priorities might change in 5-10 years. I told her there is a decent chance that I would be okay with kids when I was 35, but she wasn't satisfied with that since it had become a very high priority for her future. 

Now that I look back, I saw this coming and was able to emotionally prepare and plan for it before my emotions would get the best of me. We've been spending less time together. We've been more critical of each other. She started doing things with her friends without inviting me. When I came back from a business trip about a month ago, she was upset and said that she wanted to break up with me, but was having second thoughts. I asked her what the reason was, and she didn't have one and she was confused, so we moved on. The night before last, I walked into her office in our house and she minimized a couple of screens pretty quickly. One was a chat window with a male colleague of hers. I know she's been talking with him about us, but I don't know what his/her intentions are. I'm confident that she was not cheating, but I don't know what motivation he played in her decision or what either of their intentions were toward each other. The other looked like some sort of text document about me. I asked her about the document, and she said that it was a pros/cons list about me and it was helping her make a decision about our future. When I got home last night, I noticed she had that look, and I almost immediately knew what was up. I made her say it anyway. She wanted to break up, main reason being the kids issue. She was very upset about it and I could tell it was a difficult decision for her to make. This will be her first time living truly on her own, so I know it will be a difficult journey for her. 

Even though I knew it was coming, it didn't make it much easier. It's difficult talking to her (needed to discuss her moving out, splitting assets, etc). My mind is racing with the uncertainty of the future. I no longer feel a since of happiness/satisfaction/complacency. I've lost my appetite. Menial things like cooking, which I used to enjoy, have become a burdon. I know this is only temporary, and I'd like to make this feeling pass as quickly as possible. 

Now, onto the list. 

**What I will do**

* Allow her time to find a new place to live, and move her stuff out. She's moved out of our bedroom into her own. We can have no/minimal contact since we have separate offices, separate bedrooms, separate bathrooms and slightly different work schedules. 
* Split up our joint assets. She'll take the stuff that she uses most, I'll keep the stuff that I use most. We have separate bank accounts so that's no issue. The house (and mortgage) is in my name and we've agreed that I will keep it since I have much more invested. 
* Cut off all contact with her and her family. She didn't want this, but it's important to me to help me move on. I think in the long run, it will be better for her as well in the event that she doubts her decision. I haven't done this in any previous relationships, but after 5 years, I think this will really help me cope. 
* Eliminate reminders of her. I've done much of this already. Removed pictures of us, removed from IM and emergency contact lists, returned Christmas present, canceled flights to visit her family, putting away items that have a significance in our relationship. This will be much easier when she's out of the house.
* Prevent this person crisis from negatively affecting my job. I need to keep my head in the game and move on. I usually do a good job of keeping my personal life out of my job, and I need to keep that up. If this means taking time off to get my head straight, than so be it. This point is ironic since I'm writing this entire thing during work. I'm hoping it will eventually help me concentrate. 
* Step up my social activities. I'm very much an introvert and I keep people at an arms length. My dad blames this on me being an Engineer. I spend a lot of time volunteering for Habitat for Humanity as a House Leader, so I will increase up my efforts there. Perhaps I'll try to connect with my team members on a personal level outside of the office.
* Spend more time away from home. Plan a long motorcycle trip with a colleague that I ride with. Head to the shooting range (haven't been there in a while). 
* Get my finances in order. Need to re-balance my personal budget now that I'm paying the mortgage on my own. 
* Be healthier. Eat better. Work out more - not just for physical reasons, but for mental reasons as well. 
* Learn from this experience. She was critical towards my ""pessimism"". I viewed that trait more of preparing for the worst, but she saw it differently. Perhaps I'm too critical of people. Perhaps I don't trust people enough. I need to do some introspection over time and examine my relationships/friendships (or lack thereof). 
* Embrace the support that my family has offered. I've had a difficult family situation, but this is perhaps the first time that I've valued having family to support me. I felt much better after a long conversation with my dad and sister last night, and other family members have reached out to offer support as well. 
* Move on. Embrace the opportunities that this opens. That might be in the forms of amazing career opportunities that I previously turned down so we didn't have to move. This event bring the opportunity for a fresh start, but I need to be rational about it. 


**What I will NOT do**

* Make any big decisions that will impact my future for at least 6 months, or more if I'm still feeling like I can't think logically. I know I will be grieving, and that's not the right state of mind for me to make important decisions. I want to make sure that the big decisions I make (changing jobs, moving somewhere else) are because I'm heading toward an opportunity, and not running away from anything.
* Pursue or commit to another relationship until I am happy being on my own. I know this time will come, I am independent my nature. Maybe it will take a year, maybe two or more. But I feel it's important that I enter my next relationship to complement my life, not to fill a void or attempt to solve loneliness. 
* Bury myself in work, and otherwise become even more of a hermit than I am now. It would be so easy to do, and it was my first instinct, but my Dad talked me out of it. 
* Spend Christmas alone. I had originally planned to head up north to spend Christmas with her family, but those plans have been canceled. My dad and sister both made me promise that I wouldn't spend Christmas alone, so I will plan to spend it with family. 
* Do anything retaliatory. I don't hold negative feelings towards her. My decision to cut off contact despite her objections is not meant as some sort of 'punishment' towards her. It's completely to help myself, and I think it will benefit her too. 
* Hold resentment. I don't feel like I've wasted five years or anything. I don't see her in a negative light. Given our age when we started dating, the odds of staying together were against us. This decision may have saved us from a divorce or other unhappy future plans.
* Blame anyone, including myself. I will not go through a ""bargaining"" stage. This was her decision based on something out of my control. Was it influenced by a male colleague of hers with questionable intentions? Possibly, but I will not pursue that investigation. That's her business, not mine.

I hope that this post has the chance to help someone who is in the same boat as me. Perhaps someday I'll look back on this post and see what helped and what didn't.

Her response, ""I didn't know, I have to think about that."" She can think all she wants, she just reinforced what I had suspected all along.

Almost six years. Been a lot of ups and downs since then. Been loosing weight, running, eating better, etc... 

Finally got out of retail and into a big boy job in the city making real money.

I still have those days just like anyone else who recently had their heart ripped out through their rib cage, but it does need to be repeated over and over again; it gets better.

Even when I'm down in the dumps I know, just from the 'better' days in the past few months, that it does get better and time is the only thing that will help.

Now for the explanation of the title. My new job allows me to dress it up a lot more than I used to. This means I got to pull out the black vest that I haven't worn in god knows how long. In the top left pocket of this vest I found a note. The type of note that I thought got put in the box of other notes that now resides in my parents attic with the rest of anything that reminds me of you. 

The back of it reads ' I love you Overlord220. I will love you every day of my life. Forever'

I thought finding this would make me spontaneously burst into a crying fit that I've been experiencing off and on (mostly music, Christmas season has not helped at all. Thanks Sinatra). It didn't. I decided to keep this note in my pocket today. It reminds me that anyone, at any time, for any reason can lie to you. It may have not been a lie when it was written, but things can sour.

I usually don't post here and honestly have stopped visiting because I'm at a different point in my life now but I want any heartbroken soul out there to know that this subreddit was crucial to my first few steps out of what I thought would pull me down into the deep. /r/BreakUps was my stepping stone onto more help from different subreddits.

Shes still blocked on FB for obvious reasons although the other day I was on my room mates laptop and decided to look up her profile.

and then something happens, and its like a flick of a switch. its totally gone. it makes you wonder how that is even possible? its so fucking odd.

and you can't reach out to them, and you don't know how they feel. you feel totally lost, but you can't do anything. you think of putting yourself out there, maybe ill call them, email them? why? just to hurt myself even more. you decide you have to forget them, to move on. to act as though they never existed.

but is that the right thing to do. for what its worth you have the memories, you have the experiences, you probably learned something about yourself throughout it all. learned something about other people too.

the worst is knowing that they'll probably find someone to replace you. someone else is going to be there for him or her, in your place, and thats so hard to realize.

(M),20,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/13p7an/i_just_really_need_some_advice_and_i_just_want_to/,"My girlfriend was OBSESSED with me. I was a god on Earth for her. She believed that I was the greatest thing in the world and that I was the only guy for her. Summer came. I was sick of it even though I still loved her. I told her I just needed a break from a relationship. When she came home from Europe, my world was torn to shreds. Every little thing I knew was gone.

She still liked me, but she got in with a bad group of girls. They were massive partiers and drinkers. She forgot about how she hated that whole ""party girl"" lifestyle. She didn't want a relationship because she didn't want to have to be constantly with me because I don't drink (due to a previous drug problem) and I don't party. I was destroyed. 

I began hearing that she was hooking up with guys and pictures on Instagram were put up of her chugging out of a vodka bottle. I cried. I vomited. I hated everything. My beautiful baby had become the opposite of what she used to be. She told me that she is just not in the same place that I am in and that it could happen again in the far future. I spiralled into a deep depression. My shrink heard about it, my friends heard about it, no help. I didn't leave my room for days.

Cut to now. I was somewhat better, probably just because I was used to it but she wrote me a hand written letter and that letter crushed my heart into a million pieces. It read,

""We spent 2 years together and they were the best 2 years of my life. You weren't perfect and I wasn't perfect. But I've changed and you haven't. You're still stuck in your own little world. I don't know when I'll ever talk to you again and I know this will hurt you so I'm sorry. I love you and I always will, it's just not good for either of us. Maybe in the future. For now, goodbye.""

I almost died. I vomited. I cried. I listen to the same rounds of blink, brand new and all of the other angry breakup songs I listened to in high school. Nothing helped. I am still stuck in this world of missing her emotionally, physically and she was the best thing I have ever had. I want her back. I want that love back. I want to hold her more than anything. I am still in this sick state. I don't eat too much anymore, I cry a lot. I just want this to end and I want to just wake up and still be with her. I know it won't happen but tell me it will be ok Reddit. Please.

Then i talked to my older sister and she told me that my family would love me no matter who Im with but that if i did take him back my family wouldn't or couldn't respect him after all the damage he's caused me.

It hit me. I love this man, but if he ever loved me he wouldn't have hurt me. 

Even if we as a couple could over come this it wouldn't be the same. Well my family means more to me than my ex does.

I would feel awkward bringing him around family and I just don't want it.

I want someone who loves me and that my family could respect.

And the thought is liberating.",16,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/131oeo/weve_broken_up_about_a_million_times_this_time/,"**I can't tell you how strange it is to go about my life now while solidly believing my ex and I will never get back together.**

We've broken up and gotten back together so many times now -- it's been so hard to believe that *this* is the final time, but for some reason, *this time* feels different. The cycle is going to end because *this time*, I'm going to be the one saying ""no"" when he tries to come back into my life. He doesn't deserve my affection.

And, allow me a moment of purely selfish vanity: I know *I* deserve better.

Accepting the finality of our relationship, it's as if I suddenly have permission to do absolutely everything with zero consequence. And while venturing out on my own without someone to sort of yank the leash is definitely new and scary, it feels good to have experience in reigning *myself* in rather than being completely self-destructive as I was when we broke up the first few times.

My biggest chore after he and I break up (as we often have) is forcing myself to believe I am absolutely *single*. I have that sort of painfully monogamous loyalty that tortured writers and artists paint and sing about. Their devotion to the ones they love is incomparable to any other emotion they might experience in their lifetime. It is crippling. It is consuming. It is all-encompassing and, most often, it *ruins* them.

Tragedy.

**In order to break the spell of loyalty and courtesy burdening me, I give into a vice or two very sparingly.**

It's sort of like a treat. That once-in-a-great-while naughty thing that you *never* do, but *might* do on special occasions because, well, why-the-fuck-not, right? No one can tell me what to do anymore.

Vices can be anything: Masturbation, a strong cocktail, a bowl of weed, flirting with a stranger, waving back to flirtatious strangers who wave at me, actually smiling at people who compliment me rather than brushing them off coldly, doing ""single people"" activities, accepting dinner dates with friends of the opposite sex, etc -- I give into one or two within reason.

For example: Today, just for the fuck of it, I smoked a cigarette (one of those super tiny girly ones). It was liberating. I *never* smoke. I *hate* it, in fact. But the freeing feeling of smoking one, going against my own rules, going against *his* rules -- I can't tell you how good it felt. Lighting up a cigarette *just because* made me think, ""Holy crap. I belong to no one right now. I'm single, no one can tell me what to do, and this is *my* life to live."" It was sort of like a celebratory vice -- not smoked because of some vaguely FMLish reason, but because I knew it would be fun to break my own rules and break free of this idea that my ex would be pissed at me for having one (even though he's such a hypocrite because he smokes packs of the stuff).

This is my life!

I started to have a good day. My little ""fuck you"" cigarette set me on a glorious path to enjoyment. I was laughing with my friends. I was compartmentalizing the emotions of what I was going through just as he told me he did, snapping myself out of it whenever I felt a crying-spell coming on.

Progress gets easier in time. Every time I found myself staring into the distance and dwelling on the pain, I very purposefully pushed him out of my mind by distracting myself with everything in front of me: my friends, food, a soy chai latte, a good book, awesome music, working out, cooking, dancing, playing piano, doodling, writing, messaging friends -- and with practice, the choice to pour my focus into things that were good for me rather than my ex became easier, more natural, and more routine.

I'm getting there.

**He texted me today.**

He told me that he hoped I was doing okay. He told me that this was hard for him.

I thought I would be happy to hear from him, but I'm just so mad at him instead. Does he even understand how hard this breakup has been for me? Is he trying to make this harder? What is the point of text messaging me when he's the one who wanted to end it all? I don't deserve this extra stress -- it's hard enough to get over him without him poking his head into my life to say, ""Hey, remember me? The man who broke your heart over and over, and who broke your heart *again*? I don't actually want to get back with you, but I just want you to know how I'm feeling so you can continue to support me and be my emotional blanket while I move on.""

Fuck him.

How dare he message me. What happened to no contact? What happened to him saying, ""Stay away from me and never message me or call me again!""? How dare he call me the other day just to ask me about trivial bullshit -- I thought we weren't supposed to be in touch? How dare he text me randomly to say other trivial things -- what is he trying to do? We're not friends.

Fuck him.

Must he really work to set me back? How dare he stomp on my progress? How hypocritical of him! If I can't message him, why is he blowing up *my* phone? Don't I deserve a chance to be happy without him too? If he wants to be single so bad, why is he pestering me and not allowing me to discover what being single is like as well?

I feel like he's torturing me. I love him, but I find him so selfish. He told me he wanted me out of his life completely and wanted nothing to do with me. He says he'll never marry me, and that we can't be together in the long run. He dumped me for the millionth time, and enough is just enough. I'm too fucking pretty to be wasting my time drilling deep-set wrinkles into my forehead because of his bullshit. I work hard for my body and for my mind -- I deserve to be appreciated by someone who will love every inch of me, inside and out.

But I can't when he's fucking up my life by forcing his way into it.

I don't know why he's reaching out to me after so vehemently warning me away from him, and dwelling on it just drives me insane. There's no reason for me to worry about his feelings or his reasoning for *anything* anymore. I don't *care*. If someone can hurt me this badly, leave me over and over, but selfishly continue to keep me on a leash even after we've parted, he doesn't *deserve* my worry or affection. I refuse to care about someone who hurts me so recklessly, and who carelessly handles my heart.

What he does with his life is none of my business, and for once, I feel that everything I do with my life is also none of *his*.

**He knows I care about him.**

I don't have to tell him or remind him anymore. I told him enough times while we were together -- I'm done telling him. If it wasn't enough for him then, it surely won't be enough now. There is no point in telling him how I feel, telling him if I'm hurting, or telling him what I'm doing. He doesn't get to be in my life anymore. He doesn't have the privilege to poke his head into my business, much less tell me what to do.

For once, let him be the one worrying about who I'm with, what I'm doing, and where I am. For once, let him be the one freaking out about what I'm doing with all of my spare time. Who fucking cares what he thinks?

I deserve to be happy. I am not a puppet. I am on no one's strings. And this is my fucking life. He has no jurisdiction on these parts, and he never will ever again. I deserve better.

I deserve better, and so do all of you.

This letter is a bit long but I hope someone will read it. It is a bit scattered, but I haven't slept much and my mind is all over the place. Please say whatever is on your mind, I need to talk.

**Short Backstory**

My girlfriend broke up with me a few days ago because she is very stressed over her busy life and doesn't feel like it's fair to either of us that she has very little time or metal capacity right now to devote to us. She has said she might be able to give us a chance in the future but right now she has fallen out of love with me because of where she is personally. We have been talking a bit, never about us, and obviously not the amount of contact we once had. I am lost.

**Letter**

Dearest,

I feel the days have grown worse. I miss you more than anything in the world and I never knew I was capable of this type of pain. I've told the story a hundred times to anyone who will listen in the few short days since you walked away and every time it breaks my heart. I have never had feelings for any person the way I have for you. I was sure that one day, I would ask for your hand in marriage and we would be happy together forever. 

I still can't be in my apartment where you used to sleep so comfortably with me tucked in each other's arms or where I would cook us dinner to share, because it feels so empty without you and it reminds me you're not here when I see the empty places your things used to be and the unused pillows on the other side of the bed. 

I can't sleep without you and wonder where you might be or what you might be up to. The thoughts in my mind of what went wrong have haunted me so much that I feel like I may collapse from exhaustion. We used to talk every day and comfort each other when things were challenging and my closest friend in the world isn't here to console me in all of this pain. I don't know where to turn.

I wish I knew how you are doing and what is going on in your mind, and I wish I could tell you everything that's gone on in mine but that can not happen and I know it will drive you farther away. This feels like the end of the world. 

Please know that I miss you and I love you more than anything.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1350771708.0,,,True,t3_11tej2,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11tej2/to_the_woman_who_broke_my_heart_the_letter_i_will/,

He gave me a piece of his mind and told me he ""Loved me"". Never in my entire life, were words so hard to find. I sat on the phone crying and did not reciprocate my feelings. I don't know if its age, time, or maybe im learning sometime saying what you feel or what your thinking isn't always the answer. 
I wished I was able to utter the words in my heart. But because I didn't I will use this to help me find the words I couldnt say to him:

I love you to my core. I love you so much that walking away felt like my legs were stuck in quick sand. I loved you the minute I opened the door of the pre-war apartment and I found you standing there in your gray peacoat and smile. My heart and soul fluttered as I began planning our life together. I was so excited to cook for you and to play house. I just wanted to build a family with you. We both wanted more than what we had. We wanted a better life, a better future, a better love. I didn't mean to come off as overzealous. I was just excited to be married to you. I felt like a child  in your arms, i felt reborn. My past mistakes cleansed, my future pure as gold. 
I never expected you to hold my mistakes over my head, mistakes I had committed prior to ever knowing you. I couldnt handle the fact that you display my mistakes to your family and friends. 
I never expected you, my husband, to curse me out. To call me C**T and spoiled B*t*h ETC. My own husband ripping the clothes off my back , leaving my bare body exposed to the world. 
How can i trust you? How can I trust my life in your hands? How can you say such harsh words? As if this we're in an adolescent relationship that flickers on and off depending on the time of day. How can a man utter the cruel words that butchers his wife's soul and excuse it as moments of ""anger""? 
A man should always hold his wife to the highest esteem, should never associate his wife with those words, or attempt to break her esteem.

You sit there and play victim. Say I never loved you. Never respected you. And I let out a soft cry of disappointment and shame. I never called you names. I always defended you. The only thing i was guilty of was wanting to share my life with you and only you. the people around us are nothing but negative and I just wanted to be formal with them. 
At the end of the day, i was right about people getting in the way of our happiness. But I was wrong to think you loved me or respected me enough. You gave me your name for show but it was meaningless. 
I still sleep in your Pjs. I still wish I was holding you every night when I go to bed. 

Never has anyone in my life ever viewed me in the skewed way you view me. In such a negative light the way you do. Is it easier for you to feel like youre better than me? does it make you feel more of a man putting me down and creating this illusion of a neighborhood alcoholic money hungry whore? When in reality, i have only been with one person prior to you that i was going to marry and i have a glass of wine over dinner?When I work my ass off at work to be able to reach our goals? 

I wished you could see how horrible you were. How you broke me to the point of silence. I hope one day you will wake up and understand why you gave me no choice but to walk away

My bad.  I deleted the old one.

First time Reddit post, if that matters. Again, I'm 23, and student teaching this semester and I'll graduate in December, to give you some context to my life. This past Friday, my 22 year old girlfriend (graduated last May, just started teaching 7th grade in August) dumped me. We had been dating just over two years. We met in college and it's the greatest relationship I've ever been in. But since she started working in August we've been 2 hours apart and only saw each other every 2 weeks (first year/student teaching is overwhelming!).

I didn't see the break-up coming because the weekend prior we had a great time, went to a haunted house, and she said the sex was better than it has been in awhile. But I also brought up the potential of moving in together while we were out shopping, because I was thinking about my life after graduation. It wasn't a good place, I know, but it was just on my mind and I blurted it out. We had discussed it before, and she seemed okay with the idea then. And I didn't make it an ultimatum situation; I may or may not be able to get a job near her when I graduate, so it would only happen if the cards fell right. I also, in a dense ""guy move"", mentioned that if we split rent her checks wouldn't disappear so fast! She first asked me why I brought it up while shopping, which I know is strange, but it was on my mind. She also seemed to detest the idea that I equated us moving in as a financial decision, because it's way more than that, and I do realize that. So, even though we talked about it before, it seemed to freak her out this time, and she said she'd think about it and we'd talk about it next week, because she'd be coming down for my cousin's wedding.
So I was a little bothered by her reaction, but it didn't seem to ruin the evening or our weekend together. 

The next week happened, she sent me sweet texts about how I was a beautiful person and she loved me, we flirted about how we couldn't wait to see each other, and she received a mug in the mail with my school photo on it and an ""AMERICA, FUCK YEAH"" style background as a joke and it cracked her up, as I hoped. Little did I know that mug would become the most awkward gift I've ever given.

She came to the wedding, we flirted, danced, kissed, joked together. She kept a straight face and cool composition as my grandpa and dad and uncle all complimented her and said we were a great couple and told her how much they liked her. I figured everything was okay based on her calm reactions. She took the day off friday and stayed at my place. I went to school and she brought me lunch, we ate together, nothing seemed off. I even told her how excited I was to come home to her (something I'm not used to this fall), and she agreed.

Then I get home and change and lounge in bed with her and I'm peachy-keen. Then she gets this sad face, and as soon as I ask what's wrong, she just starts bawling. Thus starts an emotional roller-coaster of a very unclear conversation in which I had several different reactions. It was very confusing.

Sorry this is so long, but I guess the bottom line is that she freaked out a bit when I asked her about moving in, and she realized that she may not be in love with me anymore and that she couldn't picture us being together forever, and that if we were to move in, she'd want to feel that way first, even if we didn't *end up* married or living together forever. She said she wanted to be honest and that she owed it to me to tell me the truth. She didn't want to lead me on if we didn't feel the same way or on the same level. That much, I understand. But there was no real reason, there wasn't much for me to object to. It was more of a blurry explanation from her, and not a conversation that I had any say in. When I tried to equate her feeling with something I overlooked or did, she just said, ""You didn't do anything wrong."" But it just ended up confusing me so much more.

She said I was the ""perfect boyfriend;"" I understood her weird humor, I was her best friend, I did so many things to make her feel loved and appreciated, I helped her appreciate herself and feel beautiful, her family likes me (her great aunt LOVES me). She said that I'm so sweet and that I'd be great dad and husband material (even though we are both comfortable not talking about marriage or kids yet), but some invisible un-explainable thing was not clicking with her even though seemingly everything else was. She said it wasn't about being single, or being with someone else, which I've wondered about, because I was her first ""full-on"" sex partner. But I trust that's not what it's about. I asked if it was because of the distance, she said she didn't know. I asked how she knows there's supposed to be a feeling at all, and if we're best friends and understand each other and can be totally ourselves with each other (and, bonus, sexually satisfy each other), then why isn't that good enough? But she said she doesn't know what this magic connection is supposed to feel like, and she acknowledged that she might be making the ""biggest mistake in her life."" And if she does, then she'd be making that mistake for me, seeing as how whatever I said didn't sway her to try and work it out. But the more I think about it, I guess it may not be the biggest mistake ever for me. I'm still in love with her, but I can't put her on a pedestal.

For the record, I'm pissed that she did this after faking happiness and giving no indication it was coming. I'm angry she went to my family function and kept face only to dump me the next day. I feel like an idiot because she has an awkward mug with my face on it.

But most of all I'm frustrated because I'm supposedly the greatest, most loving boyfriend in the world, yet that's not good enough for her. I literally put as much as I could into the relationship, never slacked. It was very healthy, too, no cheating or abuse of any kind between the both of us; we were always very open and honest. I never felt taken advantage of either, but she definitely kept her defenses up more than I did. I thought we were really happy, I thought we were super compatible. But my best isn't enough for her. There's some magic thing that's not there, and I guess maybe that's all that matters?

Is there anyone who has gone through this already and has had enough time to process it to explain it to me? Ladies, have you ever dumped a man that was ""perfect"" without knowing really why, and the best reason you needed was the lack of a mysterious feeling? Guys, do you buy into the ""I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore"" thing without big problems in the relationship to dismantle the love? (Emphasis on ""anymore,"" considering I know this excuse is given by a lot by people, seemly mostly women, for why relationships don't get off the ground. But this was a solid 2 years and a few months before I got read this line.) Well, I guess gender doesn't matter, any insight will help me. I'm just projecting my hetero-relationship onto all of you. But feel free to add if you are a woman and have been in my situation, or if you are in a same-sex relationship.

I'm sorry for such a wall of text and I don't know what the Reddit protocol is. I tried to space everything out and be pretty organized, and I hope it didn't come off as a rant. But I'm really having a hard time wrapping my brain around this and was wondering if anyone had some insight to share. It was only two days ago and I'm still a pretty emotional mess at times. I'm normally a pretty stoic guy; I don't cry at movies or much at all, in general. But I've been punching inanimate, inexpensive things at home alone, or crying when someone sends me a supportive message via facebook or text. I've been trying not to cry in public places when I start to think about not seeing her again. Clearly, I need some friggin' help. Thanks in advance for any help or support you give.

P.S. This is gonna be kind of a jerk, guy move, but I have to suspect that the fact she is off birth control may have played into this too. She stopped being on a regular schedule of taking it when she moved and started working, especially since we didn't see each other as often. Teaching dominated her life (and still does) so she doesn't take very good care of herself sometimes, and that includes taking medicine/pills when she needs to. And I've heard that women can change their tune about a relationship based on those hormonal changes (either going on or off the pill). Could this play into it and it's partly that she's not attracted to me or lost the ""in love"" feelings anymore due to changed hormones? Or am I trying to explain this away with a selfish ""girl problems"" style scientific explanation?

**TL;DR: I (23/M) got dumped by my girlfriend (22/F) after 2+ years of dating. She re-evaluated some things after I asked about moving in hypothetically (a convo we've already had, and she was fine then), and she decided she didn't know if she was still in love with me and said she couldn't see us together in the future. She gave no reason why we wouldn't work out specifically. I was told I was the greatest boyfriend and I didn't do anything wrong. It's all based on some vague feeling she's not getting that she thinks should be there for a marriage or serious relationship. So is there really more to this, or is this lack of feeling a legitimate thing? How can I be perfect, yet not enough? P.S.---Did I get birth control sabotaged?

I got rid of his pictures, his messages, and I have been doing ok flirting and keeping busy.  Why does it still hurt so much?
He is a nice enough guy, so I dont hate him.  I kinda made him hate me in order to keep him away from me, because I hurt so much and I didnt want to turn into the stalker ex. 
I just need someone who isnt in my social circle to tell me I am not crazy, unless I am.  I am not depressed, I know depression.  This, I have never felt this emotion before. Its like a weight on my heart that I cant shake, like heart burn!

I have so much anger inside of me that I am scared of myself. At times, I can’t even remember who I am or what I’m doing because I am consumed by anger at you. I remember the person you were a month and a half ago, the person I was so in love with, and I don’t know where he has gone. That is who I miss. I don’t miss the person you are now. I despise the person you are now. I find myself wondering at times if the beautiful, wonderful person you used to be is just on hiatus. Maybe he will come back someday? It will be far too late for us, but maybe he will show someone else how wonderful he can really be.


Beyond my anger, there is my fear. I am full of the fear of letting you go. I have made plans to move away and leave this town behind. I moved to this town for you. By leaving this town, I really am leaving what’s left of us behind. You might say there is nothing left of us. You’re probably right.


Buried deep behind my anger and my fear is an intense sadness that does not go away, no matter how much time I give it. It has been five weeks. I count the days, whether I want to or not. I don’t know what I’m waiting for. I can honestly say that I don’t want to be with you. I want to be with the person you were. I feel the deepest sense of loss for the person that you were, and I think that’s why I try to comfort myself by saying you’re on hiatus; I don’t want to have to deal with the thought that you’re gone forever.


I still feel a dead weight on my left ring finger where you made your promises. I remember how hard it was to leave that ring outside your house when I found out that you were willing to break every single wonderful promise you had ever made me. You’re off now calling some other girl perfect, only five weeks later, and I am writing about you. There are reminders of you everywhere. I wonder if you feel the same. I wonder if you’re actually as angry as you pretend to be at me, or if you’re just trying to convince yourself that you are because that’s the easy way out. I wonder a lot of things about you because everything that you have done for the last five weeks has been completely uncharacteristic and frankly quite alarming.


For three years, you were everything. You were the best friend I have ever had. You were the person that I wanted to spend my life with. You were the person I was convinced I would. The person you are now does not even resemble the person that I spent three years with, except physically. You look the same, but something inside of you has changed. You have turned cold. The compassion and care that I always admired you for (something I felt that I lacked) is gone. We spent three years loving each other, and you have spent the last few weeks calling me insane, tearing me down, and making me hate myself more than I already do. You have already taken away every ounce of happiness in my life. As I try to rebuild without you, you adamantly try to crush my foundation because I fought for what was right. Does some part of you know that I was right? Will you realize it years down the road? I don’t know.


I wonder often what will happen if we don’t speak for years and then we just bump into each other somewhere. What will we say to each other? Will we say anything? Perhaps we will be cowards and pretend not to see each other. Perhaps we will look each other dead in the eye and keep walking. Perhaps we will reconnect. Or perhaps we will never see each other again


I don’t know if you’ll ever read this. This isn’t like the last letter. I’m not going to go leave it at your house. I am going to send it out into the universe. Maybe you’ll read it, and maybe you won’t. Your eyes are not the reason I am writing this. My heart is. I am trying to heal, and writing this down is helping me let you go. I have already let go in so many ways, but there are countless ways that I am still holding on. Why am I holding on to nothing? Why am I holding on to something I genuinely do not want? I am not being untrue when I say that I don’t want you.  I don’t want to be with you. I want to be back where we were a few weeks ago, but that time has come and gone. You have made your decisions, and you have forced me to make mine. I have had to deal with my entire life shifting. My entire focus has had to shift because I had made you my focus. I can’t decide if that was a mistake or not. It is certainly why I am so hurt, but it made me so happy at the time. Hindsight is an interesting thing.


I will never say that I deserve better. I know that underneath the horrible choices you’re making now, you’re still a good person, and I think that that person will return eventually. What I will say is that I deserve stronger. I deserve someone who wouldn’t walk away from me. I deserve someone who can keep the promises he makes me, no matter how much time goes by. I don’t know if such a person exists. I don’t know if I will ever find him. If I do, though, I will truly be able to be glad that things ended with you, and that kind of closure will feel amazing.


My solution to dealing with our breakup is different than yours, though. I am not jumping into something else. In fact, I don’t plan to date for a long time. I plan to get to know myself again and remember why I love myself before I ever try to love someone else again. I plan to listen to music. I plan to sing. I plan to write. I want to travel, and I want to believe in love, even if I can’t have it right now. I will believe in love, no matter what happens to me.


I am sure that I met you for a reason, even if I can’t fathom right now what it was. Obviously, I got experience out of our three-year relationship, if nothing else. I think it had to have been more than that, though. I think that I will figure out in my life why I met you, and I think it was for more than experience. It has been one week since I talked to you. It has been five weeks since you deserted me. For the first four weeks, I struggled not to text you or call you every second of every day. This week, though, has been easy. I have found that I don’t like who you have become or who you’re pretending to be, and I have found that the things that you have to say are only mean and cold, and I am not interested in being berated. 


I will never back down from my knowledge that I have been right this entire time. You made the wrong decision, and I tried to stop you. You are continuing to make the wrong decision, but I am finished with trying to save you from yourself. You will make mistakes, and you will grow, and someday, you will regret. You may not think so now, but you will. Give it a few years. Give it a few heartbreaks. Once you feel what I’ve been feeling for five weeks, you will regret the way that you have treated me.


I want to remind you that I didn’t deserve this. I was not perfect, but I was not so imperfect that I deserved misery, and misery is what I have gotten. I have learned to put myself back together for the sake of going on, but I am still not whole. I still cry. I still have panic attacks. I still miss everything about us, even though I don’t want you back because I don’t think “us” would be the same when you are not.


Goodbye. Goodbye to the first time I met you, when I was literally awestruck by your smile. Goodbye to our first kiss at the bottom of your stairs, a complete surprise to me. Goodbye to the shooting star I saw right before you asked me to be your girlfriend. Goodbye to sleepovers and endless hours of South Park and American Dad. Goodbye to fighting and making up. Goodbye to the security I felt with you. Goodbye to your family and your dog. Goodbye to wonderful birthdays and holidays. Goodbye to August 13th. Goodbye to dinner and a movie a million times. Goodbye to showers, and goodbye to you.

We never really had a huge falling out, she just felt that we weren't right for each other.

My girlfriend and I (early twenties) dated for 2.5 years and we just broke up.  During the time we were dating we got so close.  I really didn't see it coming until about a week or so beforehand but even then I was in denial.

I unknowingly, or rather unintentionally, put her in front of my friends over the past few years and as a result I only had a few friends that actually cared about me when we broke up.

I definitely structured my future around my life with her.  Now that we're no longer together I feel two different feelings about my future:  
-On one hand it's missing its core and the future is now uncertain.
-On the other hand, there are now a lot more possibilities.

A lot of my friends have been getting married recently.  My brother is also getting married soon.  It hurts to be surrounded by prospering relationships when mine has just crashed and burned.

I mostly just wanted to get this off my mind, but I would appreciate any advice.

Before we broke up, he said ""if it doesn't hurt when you leave the relationship, then you weren't in love with them."" Well it hurt, and it hurt a lot. He was a friend and a lover and I thought so highly of him. He obviously didn't think the same of me. And on top of that, he burned our friendship to the ground over a misunderstanding (apparently, returning his request of ""let's be friends"" meant to him ""hey, I want to be the only woman in your life"") and that hurt the most. In fact, that's what I was so hung up on. Maybe he was angry or upset and didn't mean what he said, but who knows? I don't.

But why should I get hung up on that? Beating myself up over thinking I wasn't good enough won't do any good. It just didn't work. There was nothing I could do to make things work. It's sad, but I know I didn't do anything wrong. As great as I thought he was, he just wasn't capable of loving me. Now, wouldn't it be great if I could be with someone who is great *and* loves me very much? That would be wonderful. I'm worthy of having nice things, so why try to settle on someone who wouldn't give me what I wanted in a relationship?

I know I'm a good person. I definitely know that. Nothing has changed since that day. I woke up the same person that I always was and goddammit, I'm done being bitter. It takes up so much energy. I'd like to be friends again someday (hopefully sooner than later when I'm old and gray, honestly. Burning bridges is not in my tastes), but that's not a primary concern right now and there's nothing I can do about that, either. What I *can* do is continue being the person I am and move forward with my own life. I was so afraid of moving on because I thought I didn't have anything to look forward to, but it turns out I was just being a Negative Nancy pessimist pants. There are friends to meet, labs to work in, dreams to achieve, books to read, new foods to eat! I haven't even experienced a good fraction of the world yet!

M(30) broke up with a F(31) because she was dating a F(30) and eventually brought her to our home to our bed, and I caught them on the act. 

She is now her girlfriend and I'm happy for both of them, but can't help missing her all the time, the apartment feels empty without her. 

Anyways, she called me today, she said she missed me and wanted to hear my voice. I kept the call brief and just said:
I'm glad your ok, that you care about me, but I still need space and
I won't be calling you anytime soon. She sobbed after I said it, and I felt bad for forcing her to keep the call short.

I went drinking with friends, and when I got home, I almost called her.
Decided not to, and check her Facebook instead (I have her on hide, not blocked or deleted).

It hurt like fracking hell, seeing how all the photos of us together are now replaced by photos of them, how quickly she's calling her her GF, etc, etc etc.

So fellow /r/breakup you'll probably break this no Facebook or the no contact rule, just know, it will hurt like hell.

I just wanted to say, it doesn't have to be a tragedy. It's going to hurt, but you'll live.

Of course, this isn't for everyone either.

I still care deeply for my ex, and he cares for me, but we're just not good for each other, at least in a romantic relationship. His insecurities combined with my unhappiness with monogamy (I never cheated, he gave his consent for my other sexual encounters, and he had my consent to be with other girls too) and the fact that we've both got a lot of baggage from childhood just caused too many problems between us. It was unhealthy. We love each other, but we're not what the other needs at the moment.

Sometimes, you just need a break from being together. Go out and do your own thing. Maybe you'll wind up together again, maybe you won't. Don't base your decisions on hoping for it to work out.

I. Hate. That. Feeling. 

Why can't I just move on and feel like I did a couple days ago! I remember that I just didn't care, I felt great about myself, and I was actually smiling! WHAT HAPPENED!!!
...

Last time I felt great, and several times before that recently, I specifically stopped everything I was doing. It is such a rare occurrence in light of the recent break up for the clouds to open up momentarily and sun to shine into my life. When it does happen, I really stop and *savor* the moment - I start thinking about what it is that makes me happy and I try to capture whatever it is as if I could put it in a jar and open it during moments that I feel bad.

The truth is, getting over someone is not a linear process; you don't go from feeling horrible to feeling good step after step. There are the phases that you go through, but you cycle through them. Every time you feel bad you need to **know as fact** that you *will* feel better than that! Gradually, you DO feel better, but it's gradual and it's *on average*. You will have good days and then there will certainly be bad days - I am going through that right now and I decided to write this to help me and help you when you find yourself here.

The cycles become less violent and you start to tolerate the feelings a lot better. It still is painful and you feel heartbroken, but try to think about it this way; 

* Compare the way you feel to the first week; cherish the progress that you have made! Still a long way to go, but don't lose sight of the healing that took place
* Grieving is a healing feeling; when you feel bad about something, let yourself feel bad. I cried in the beginning when things got too difficult, but afterwards I felt better. Feel bad now, take some time and go to the bathroom to sulk for a couple of minutes. You will get bored fast and make sure to look in the mirror on the way out. Look at that attractive person looking back at you! You're healing!
* Look at ALL you learned; I have no doubt in my mind that you are a STRONGER person now. I know that you would never let anyone pull some of the stuff on you that you let yourself tolerate before. Your next relationship will be **healthier because you won't let it be otherwise**
* YOU are worthwhile; think about all of the work you're doing to heal yourself! You are working every day to put yourself back on your feet and start being happy again! You have started to do things differently, you have started new things, you have GROWN and you are worth more now than several days/weeks/months before! You are growing up and this experience has accelerated how much *you care for yourself.*

I'm in the pits today. I ran a big race yesterday and today my body is weak, I am mentally fatigued, I have a backlog of work, etc. and I am in the pits. Looking to find something positive is not easy, but I know that I shouldn't focus on that day that I will feel happy again at the expense of comparing it to today because that is not going to make me happy. I *should* look at where I am, how far I've come, and *know* that this attitude is healthy.

Then after 3 months, he accused me of cheating on him with my neighbor (so very no!) and dumped me. A few weeks later we talked and worked it out, and started 'secretly' seeing eachother again- because he said his roommates/best friends hated me and he didn't want to deal with their drama. It was messed up but I was happy, until 4 months later he said one of his best friends told her that I had once confided in her that she raped me. (He didn't, I would NEVER say that, and now I'm pretty sure she never told him any such thing) And it was off again. 

Every few months he'd coming running back to me, needing me, telling me he really cared, and every time I somehow thought I had something to prove and I was the most brilliant psudo-girlfriend that anyone could ever be. I was utterly devoted to him and his happiness each time and just so grateful that he was back.

6 months ago he came to me again and I could finally tell him I thought I was over him and we should be friends and stay in eachother's lives. He had a girlfriend, so I figured it would be easy to maintain. After a couple of drinks, he he professed his undying love for me, his regret at ever leaving me, telling me he didn't love his girlfriend, saying she used him and made him feel miserable and he had put up with it. If only he had put a fraction of that much effort into our relationship, we'd still happily be together. He said I had never gotten out of his head, that he saw a future with me and couldn't stand the thought that after all this, we wouldn't end up together. He admitted his roommates only ever hated me because he told them lies about me, and me lies about them to keep us apart so they'd never know about the years we were on and off. He wanted to make everything right and live happily ever after with me. It was all I had ever wanted.

We texted all day, every day. Hung out almost every day. Eventually our groups of friends all started hanging out, too, and everything seemed better than ever. It was enough to convince me it was real.

For months we didn't do anything- he was in a relationship, I didn't want to be that girl, and he didn't want to be that guy he said. But he begged me to just wait until they broke up, and reinforced all the time how much he loved me, planning out this picture perfect future with me. I decided this time I would fight for it, because I was in love, and it was the most real thing I'd ever felt, and he felt the same, and it just had to end with us together.

Eventually I broke down and slept with him. Obviously, I'm not proud of it. It killed me every day, I hated who I had become, and I told him so every day. But he told me to just stay, not move on, just wait and we'd have it all. I let myself be convinced it would all be worth it, so I shoved it down ans suffered with my guilt and rollercoaster of emotions. The one time a couple of months ago that I had meekly if he still said these lovey dovey things to his gf (afterall, they had now been together over a year), he got mad. Like, livid. Yelling at me in the street until I cried and told me he had opened up his heart to me and loved me more than anything and how dare I throw that back in his face. He just needed a new job before he could dump her because they worked together, so I went and got him a new job at my friend's office. At this point, I thought it had all paid off.

This is when he told me he never had any intention of leaving his girlfriend. He was going to take the job for 3 weeks, then quit (screwing over my friend who got him the job), and move back to our hometown with his girlfriend. He tried to act like he felt bad about it, but after days of me trying to get answers, turns out he knew going in that this could never be more than a game. It never was anything but. I couldn't believe it because who could commit all that time every day to someone they didn't have feelings for? 

But it eventually came out that he just saw me as a toy. His old toy (the gf) was getting boring, so he'd come back and make this puppet dance. It was fun for him, and made him feel powerful to control all these people in his life. Everything he'd ever said was a lie- even when it didn't matter, just stupid little things, he'd always lie about for the sake of knowing he could get away with it. 

He didn't feel bad about hurting me, he felt bad that his toy was broken. Looking back now and seeing all these signs- the lack of empathy, the compulsive lying, the anger at being questioned, the knowing exactly what to say to make someone believe what you want, the promiscuity, the control issues.. He seems like a text book sociopath, and I was actually frightened of him.

I told him to stay out of my life from now on. I know I'm glad he's gone. I know it was all lies, and I'm lucky to be well away from it. But now what? 

I'm left knowing that the one man who loved me for me, who thought I was worthwhile at all, never felt any of it. That I was an easy mark for him because I was just that worthless. 

In the last decade, my first fiance (almost 4 years together) brought another girl to bed. When I refused him sex, he rolled over and had sex with her. Right beside me. On Christmas eve. 12 hours after I had picked out my wedding dress. 

My other major relationship wound up with my pregnant- and, as it turns out, the father of my child cheating on me through the whole thing.

The sociopath isn't the first guy to tell me I'm actually a worthless human being, it's just that I thought finally someone DIDN'T think that. That's the hardest part in all this, and I just don't know how to move on. Now I go to bed at night, alone, knowing that this is what every night for the rest of my life will be like and I just don't know how to cope.



TL;DR: I'm utterly pathetic, every guy in my life has let me know how worthless I am, and the one guy I thought loved me for all my awkward, sweet, way too-trusting nerdy self, actually just saw an easy mark to manipulate for years for the fun of it. How do I come to terms with being totally Forever Alone?

I just wanted to give a giant **THANK YOU** to you wonderful people who post on this subreddit. I wish you knew how much you helped people. I tried to be best friends with the above ex, but it was tearing me apart daily inside. I wanted to believe that ""no contact"" was only for some people, not for *us*. I called her today, after talking to a member of her family and initiated no contact. Spilling everything out felt good, and a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. 

Obviously, I want her back and would give it no second thoughts if she reconsidered, but I'm not banking on that. You guys (and her family member) gave me the courage and validation to do what needed to be done. It sucks, but it's liberating. Anyway, I just wanted to give my appreciation to all of you for being such a wonderful community. Keep on helping. You got me to the point where I want to be active here too, just to help others in that respect.

Today I am girl missing something that made her simultaneously happy and miserable.

Today I am allowing myself to acknowledge that it was real, and that it makes the loss that much worse to bear.

Today I am admitting to myself that I am happier without that relationship, that I have been hurting and crying and missing, less often and less intensely.

Today I am allowing myself to acknowledge that it doesn't go away even though I am moving on.

Today I am allowing myself to postpone my planned self-care and to continue to shirk social obligations in favor of this inevitably regular flood of grief.

Good grief, they say.

I understand that it is good, that I have to go through this every time to learn it all over again and to learn it better each time. I understand that wanting it to go away makes it worse, because I am acknowledging the power it has over me. I understand that I will still wish for it to go away when it rears its ugly head because I want to believe that I will be happier without this ""good grief"", and instead with ignorance.

Ignorance is for sitting at my desk at work realizing I have an easier time appreciating each marked off task, and eagerly anticipating feedback on my new leadership roles, when I do not, and do not need to, remind myself to project ignorance.

Ignorance is for shutting down my emotions when grief starts to wake up again and for taking a day each weekend to mope and be despondent, or rushing home from the library, just so I can cry for an hour or two as soon as I reach my apartment door or wake up facing the next day.

Ignorance is not for the few chocked sobs that escape as I walk through the mostly empty courtyard a block away from the front door.

Ignorance is not for detouring the front door to avoid the doorman on the rare days my eyes do not clear up as I pass the last of the Christmas animal decorations.

Today I am being present and aware before I leave the apartment. I will feel everything as intensely as they really are (at the level I try to ignore the rest of the time) and I will embrace the moments when intensity feels like it could be too much for me.

Today I am letting my grief out of its box of blissful ignorance in order to let its rawness wash over me, and to let my power smooth it over like a pebble in a stream.

When I am ready to put it back, or when I decide to, it will sleep until its nightmares are fitful and brief. But I will be back in ignorance, and I will eat my first meal today, and I will perform my self-care by eating my meal slowly and purposefully, and by engaging in all the e-mailing and sweeping and washing I had planned for keeping up with my real life, the one where I feel accomplished and apologize for mistakes and learn new things and grow into myself.

That is all I need from myself, and whichever life I build that provides all those things is the only life I need to focus on. Me and my ignorance, making it in life, and making a life.

They force us to reevaluate and change habits that have been formed over many months, or even years. But often the depression caused by the big split makes us think and act irrationally. So how do we help our need to stand under a window sill with a boombox? Make a list.... yes...it sounds cheesy. There's a method to the madness. 

Make a list of all the things that didn't make you happy in the relationship, whether it be her parents not accepting you to the fact she's seasick, write everything down and fold it up into your wallet. 

When we miss someone our brain automatically thinks emotionally, it remembers the good times, the cute, and the funny (memories that shouldn't be forgotten, of course). To stop yourself from falling into a depressive state, reading over your list makes you transition from the emotional state you're feeling to a completely rational one. 

Simply ask yourself, if someone came to you and gave you this list, would you recommend staying with the partner? Most likely, the answer is no.

Ex Fiancee (who is actually also a redditor for that matter) left me two months ago saying that he wasn't in love with me anymore. He left the apartament where we were living, letting me pay all the rent and utilities, and he moved back to his parents.

There was a lot of friction between us (it still is) because I recommended him to be  hired in the IT company I have been working for the past 6 years. Needless to say that I have to work with him &amp; see his face daily and everybody at work knows about this. He has promised to leave this place but in vain, nothing has happened so far (he has a pretty big debt to pay and he won't leave until he pays it off).

OK, fast forward to today, I have done pretty well lately on not contacting him. Since the breakup, he hasn't called not even once, not even to say 'happy new year' 

I still have some remaining feelings for him, and I think it's highly related to the fact that I hate being alone. I still live in the same place we used to live together for about 6 months and the memories just return from time to time. 

In one day I feel like I hate him and I don't want to see his face anymore because he treated me so poorly (I feel used &amp; abused as he's been lieing about his feelings and told me he loved me although he didn't ... and I gave my all to him, helped him financially, helped him get a better job, helped him go to university and loved him with all my heart... ) And then I start being super mean to him, at work and in personal messages just because I see him and I remember myself how much damage he has caused me. I am physically sick, I've lost about 6kg and I still have little to no appetite for food, and when I told this to him, he told me it's my choice to not eat. (WTF?)

And then in another day (like now), I feel like crying and just calling him and telling him how much I love him and that I want him back. Actually I already messaged him on yahoo messenger but just random stuff, good thing he didn't reply. 

I really don't know what's wrong with me. I often dream of him (I can't control my dreams, I just want him out of my head). Last night I woke up in the middle of the night, I felt like I didn't know where I was, and my heart started pounding like crazy from fear.

What can I do to forget? What can I do to stop dreaming of him? I've already cut all contact with him and I never talk to him, but I see him everyday at work and it's crushing me.

Any my ex-fiancee, if you're reading this, SCREW YOU, you are making my life a living nightmare... 

Edit: what's wrong with me? do I need to see a specialist doctor?

I'm around 25 years old and I went through my first breakup. It was soul crushing. I'm usually a very cheery and controlled person and so when it happened it hit me like a truck. I knew it was bad when my mom asked me ""are you all right?"" and I said ""no."" She was crushed, because I have never given that answer in the past. I couldn't sleep at night, and everytime I woke up in the middle of the night, my thoughts would immediately rush to the situation I was in. I would helplessly lay there and feel my body go into stress mode (heaviness in the chest, something caught in my throat, and adrenaline rushing). Sometimes it would take hours before I could sleep again. At work I would sit in meetings feeling the heartache, even when my thoughts weren't necessarily focused on her. I was so afraid of being alone, I would constantly IM everyone and call people, because of the fear of the sadness that would rush in the moment I had time to myself. As CS Lewis once wrote: ""Part of every misery is... the misery's shadow: The fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief."" That's exactly how I felt. 

I had to go to a wedding during my recovery time and it was really hard. I expected it to be hard to watch the couple in love interact with each other, but what I didn't realize is that, at a wedding, every couple is extra romantic. And it didn't help that the songs that she and I used to sing kept playing at the reception. 

During this time I just couldn't get myself past her. I kept thinking that somehow there wouldn't be anyone as perfect. Anyone as charming and beautiful. As funny and engaging. I kept feeling like somehow I just missed out on the best person ever, and every other girl that would come in the future would be a step down from her. 

But then... time passed and the feelings started to seem... farther. The thoughts were just as frequent, the what ifs, and the missing her. However, they stopped being accompanied by the heavy ache. Before, when I saw other couples it made me sad, but as time went on, I started looking at my friends' wives (not creepy) and realizing that they were pretty awesome too. In specific ways they were even more awesome than the girl that broke my heart. That perspective helped me be more objective about the whole thing. Yes this girl is awesome, but you know, she wasn't perfect. But for whatever reason, I had placed her in a pedestal and, in some ways, had fallen in love with an idealized version of her. I adored her so much that I couldn't imagine ever being able to be friends with her again. However, now that I can see things a bit more clearly, I think with time I will be able to be close to her and not have feelings for her just fine. (Warning: When bringing people down from the pedestal you have placed them in, make sure not to become bitter. They haven't disappointed you, your projection of them has, and that's hardly their fault)

This morning I woke up at 5:30, as usual. However, for the first time, I was able to go back to sleep immediately, without rolling around in pain. I am sure that in the future, on occasion, it will still come back and hit me. But, I can see it getting better. And it feels awesome to remember the things that used to bring me joy. Being able to live outside of the constant shadow of grief. 

I know that things might seem bleak. That you might be in more pain than you have ever been in your whole life. You may be grieving to the point that it feels like fear. Even the things that you used to enjoy, and that you want to use as a distraction, aren't powerful enough to take your mind out of it. But know that it does get better. Here are some things that helped me: 

* No contact.
* Go hang out with people. It really helps. Find friends that you can spend time with just to keep the loneliness at bay. If it's a close friend, and you absolutely can't feel happy because of your situation, talk about it with them. Most people I know are more than open to help you out. 
* Don't be afraid of the sleepless nights and the pain. Things started changing for me once I started being ok with those things. Yea I am going to physically hurt throughout the whole day, and roll around in bed at night, but it's ok. Like every feeling/emotion, eventually it will have diminishing returns, and your body will learn to not freak out at it. 
* Journal! This helped me a lot. Specially if you have a racing mind. Sometimes just having your thoughts written down helps to take your mind off of it. It's like when you write an appointment in your calendar, your mind sort of takes that as a permission to stop thinking about it. 
* On the other hand, don't obsess over it. Sometimes the sad thoughts become so familiar to our daily routine, that we continue to think about them way past the point where we need to. At some point in the healing process (after having grieved enough), make an effort not to talk about it or think about it. When the thoughts come rushing in, just force yourself to think about something else.

I have to thank all of you for this community. Just knowing that I wasn't alone really helped me. I feel like I'm on my way across the bridge. For those of you guys that feel like you're still super far from the bridge... you'll get here on your time. See you on the other side.

We met in college (I'm 29 male, she is 29 female), our freshman year.  This was over 10 years ago.  I fell in love with her almost immediately.  We dated seriously for about 5 years.  I was about to propose to her, until the relationship ended by her choice, because of a multitude of ""reasons.""  Careers after school, masters programs, religion, seeming to not have the same interests anymore, etc.  Basically, just anything she could say without having to say (what I thought was the real reason) that she was no longer in love with me the way she was before.  

This didn't matter to me, for some reason.  I still loved her as much as the day I had first said ""I love you"" to her.  Continued putting her on a pedestal.  Felt like I couldn't breathe without her.  And so we remained friends.  This friendship quickly became unhealthy for me.  Because basically it put me into a one sided relationship.  I was still trying to celebrate valentine's day with her... bringing her flowers, while having her just look at me with looks of disappointment.  After about a year of this, I decided I needed to try to move on (yes, we were still intimate whenever we met).  So I told her that I could no longer have any more contact with her.  Because even imagining her getting close to someone besides me drove me insane and I knew (as much as it hurt) that she no longer wanted to be with me at this point.  

I wanted to see her one more time before we said our goodbyes, but she was disappointed.  Disappointed that I had pretended to be her ""friend"" and had not moved on.  So the ""friendship"" ended, and we both agreed to not contact each other until I was ready.  

Fast forward about 5-6 years to present day:
After countless ""relationships"" and flings on my part, I figured I was completely over her.  But I just wanted to see how she was doing.  Because she had been such a large part of my life, I didn't' want to erase her out completely.  So I asked her to have dinner with me.  A big mistake on my part.  As soon as I saw her, everything I had worked on for the last few years just broke apart.  And I knew immediately, that I still loved her.  Loved her so god damned much.  Dinner ends and we parted ways.  But now, a few days later, I'm sitting her reeling back into the alcoholism I had to combat after our breakup.  Stuck with the same god damned ""empty"" feeling all through my body that I had felt the day she had first broke up with me.  

So basically, I want to ask a larger populace.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  How do I move on?
 
TL;DR: 5 year relationship.  She ends it.  I love her so much it feels like it's just a part of who I am.  5-6 years after breakup, I ask to see her because I'm an idiot and think I'm over her.  I'm not.  I now feel the same as I did 5-6 years ago and want to remain in a drunken stupor so it doesn't hurt.  What do I do?

I am 21 years old, female. My now ex-boyfriend, A (24 y/o) just broke up with me. We were in a long distance relationship, a 1.5 hour flight apart, but had seen each other at regular intervals. We also emailed and talked on Skype daily.


He found out several hours ago that his mother is ill (possibly terminally ill). He loves his mother. He is a responsible and kind individual. His sister is mentally ill. His mother takes care of her. His father is growing old and is busy with work and his brother is irresponsible and would not be able to properly take care of his sister. This means that task would fall to him.


We had a conversation about his mother's health and the future of our relationship. He said he couldn't be with me anymore because our relationship is no longer practical. I am still in school and plan to do my Masters where I am now. He will be busy with his family and could not leave them. Due to circumstances with the well-being of my own family members, I cannot leave mine either. We would not be able to see each other as often as we have been for possibly years.


I understand this. Really, I do. But I am also a selfish person. I feel so devastated. He asked me to be friends. I could never leave him at a time like this. I love him and want to be there for him. He is my best friend.


However, he is also my first love. A while back, I was severely depressed. In my first relationship, my boyfriend was emotionally abusive, pressured me into doing certain things and was, in retrospect, a jerk. I was very sad when we broke up but I kept reminding myself, it's okay. He wasn't right for you. I felt like I deserved the way he treated me, yet hoped I would find someone who truly loved me.


When I met A, he was kind and funny. We have so many things in common with each other. He was there to support me and was patient, encouraging, and listened to what I had to say. I tried my best to do the same for him. Whenever something made me happy, he was the first one I wanted to tell. I could spend nine hours talking with A about anything, and still have more to say.


I fell deeply in love. I had a lot of probably naive thoughts. I believed I would marry him someday. I thought about how many people would be at our wedding. I imagined having a family with him. He thought the same things about me. I thought things like, ""people spend their entire lives searching for something like this. I'm the luckiest person in the world to have already finished looking.""


Life isn't fair. It sucks. I feared I didn't deserve him and it looks like I didn't. I am young, I know this. I have my whole life ahead of me. But I can't imagine not having such a big part of my life right now. And I won't be without him, because he asked me to stay his friend, and I want to be there for him while he has to deal with this.


He is still my closest friend. I realize that one day he will find someone else. Someone who lives closer that can make him happy. He will probably stop going online then. Maybe I will have found someone else too. But I'm a selfish person. I love him and want to be the one he loves back. I don't want to find someone else, even if I have to wait years before I can see him again.


But life doesn't work that way. I have to suck it up and be there for him. And despite my wishes, ultimately I want him to be happy. I want his mother to be okay. I want his family to be okay. I want him to have a good life, even if it means he forgets who I am. Isn't that what loving someone is, anyway?


It feels nearly impossible to go on right now. He was what drove me to want to do better, and to create my own path, so that one day we could have a happy life together. I want to tell him I love him, more than he knows. But I need to stop being self-absorbed and just be his friend right now, and listen to his worries and fears. I have to stop thinking about myself no matter how I'm feeling, because what he is dealing with is worse.


It helped a lot just to type this out. If anyone read this far - thank you. It means a lot.

[Original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hks49/try_as_he_may_he_simply_does_not_love_me/)  I was working a not so busy night shift and found myself feeling hopeless. I felt like I was **never** going to get over my ex. I was desperate for someone to tell me otherwise. So, in the form of a poorly titled post, I poured out the story of my broken relationship. That post received a few comments from some wonderful, helpful souls. I just wanted to say thank you to those peeps, and to tell them, and you, that while it's only been a week for me, and while I thought I'd still be completely numb and lost to it all, **it got better.**


I want to hug every heartbroken individual tonight and just show you where I am, not only because I am so damn proud of my progress, but also because I want you all to know that the pain is only temporary and that you will prevail like the damn champion you are.


So, last Wednesday, after the rush of the late evening had ended, after all of the residents had received their medications and any socializing was through, I found myself having too much time on my hands - I was back to being a prisoner of my own mind - I was back to thinking about *him* and how he was no longer *mine.* I checked the local sports complex website to see what time his team was playing hockey that night, and recalled how he'd always text me within a few hours after his game, after he'd had a few beers with the team, and he'd tell me how the game went and ask me how my evening was. The sudden crushing feeling of knowing that for the first time I would not be receiving that text, was nearly enough to make me want to curl into the fetal position right there at the nurses station at my work, but I made it through.


So, it's been a week. A week since I have talked to him. A week since I have seen him. A week since I have held him. And a week since I've stopped all of this ""him"" bullshit, and finally started with the ""me.""


Last night, for the first time since the breakup, I turned on my laptop, stared indifferently at that desktop picture of he, my son, and I looking happy from just a couple short months ago, and I realized, ""hey, I feel okay. This is okay so far."" So I changed the desktop picture, and since I was feeling strong I carried on to iPhoto to look at the many photos we'd taken together. Amongst all of the cutesy photos of us, were tons of screencaps of cute text message conversations we'd had together. I opened and reread them, and yes I thought this would erupt feelings similar to what I'd imagine it feels like if someone were to physically put a knife through my heart, but it didn't. Not even close. Again, I was okay. Then, I looked at photos he'd sent me. Photos of him doing silly things with his hair(it was shaggy near the end of our relationship), a photo of him with his *perfect* beard covered in snow from when he was shoveling out his driveway during a storm, a photo of his bloodshot eye after breaking a blood vessel during a pukefest that followed a night of drinking with the guys, and lastly, a photo of his car, the car that he wooed me with on our first date as we drove around laughing and holding hands, the car that I had dreamt of us happily driving away from the chapel in, with ""JUST MARRIED"" and streamers hanging from the back, the car that I wanted our child(ren)'s trip home from the hospital to be in, because he **loves** that car and I loved him. Well, you know what? That shaggy hair isn't as adorable as I thought it was. And that beard isn't perfect.

He's not this perfect, one of a kind, I'll never find someone better, guy that I made him out to be. In all of the ten months of our relationship, I had placed him on a pedestal, and I was too damn blind to see it. Now, instead of feeling defeat, loss, and hopelessness, I feel overwhelmed with feelings of happiness and hope for the future. I know that I'm going to find the one for me. I feel like for the first time I can accept that this man was not the ending to my love story like I'd dreamt of him to be, but rather that his presence is merely a chapter in my story and that my true soulmate is now just one chapter closer to me.


So while I reached out, hurting like hell and looking for your stories of light at the end of the tunnel just one week ago, today I'm reaching back out, hugging you and offering you my own story of light at the end of the tunnel. It's damn beautiful over here, and I can't wait for you to see and feel it for yourself soon enough.

Just silence?"" but then we started talking. 

I started crying and told him how I was feeling about the whole thing and how I now felt about myself (esteem wise) and how I felt like I wasn't enough to make him happy or be with him. He got kind of mad at that, telling me to ""stop with all the self-detrimental bullshit"". He never meant for this to happen, for me to fall in love with him and then have to leave me. He's sorry how everything happened in the end, and he regrets how he handled it. He said that would be the only thing he'd change about our relationship. 

We talked about his problems, which was our reason for breaking up. He made a comment about how unless he was with me, his family or at work...he's usually drinking with buddies and he thinks it's a problem that he just can't casually drink--it's all or nothing. I told him he should tell his best friend that and have him stop putting him in positions where alcohol is involved. He's worried about saving for his own place and making himself happy. I told him he can't do it all on his own, he isn't Atlas and cannot bear the weight of the world. He needs the support of friends and family. I told him he should talk to someone about his problems and he agreed, even though he doesn't believe in much of that stuff, and that he was seeing it is a real thing lately. He asked where we go from there, neither of us had an answer. 

We talked about what our families said. He made a comment on the Lego (a gift I had gotten him a week before the break up and couldn't return so I stowed it with his items) and called me a big suck, he offered to pay me back for it but I declined, since it was meant to be a gift. He apologized for making me feel so shitty and down. He said he doesn't want me waiting around and I mentioned how it made me feel to think of him with someone else, he said he wasn't anywhere near thinking about another relationship. 

Finally he said he'd have to leave soon and we walked to Macs to get him some change for the bus. It was really hard to say goodbye. We hugged for a really long time and I cried again, he cried too. Finally we both kind of stopped and he said ""I guess I'll see you when I see you?"" which made me start crying again. He kept apologizing, hugging me, and saying he was sorry and kissing my forehead. Finally he had to push me away for us to stop and we parted ways.

I feel like things will get better now. We spent over an hour and a half talking and just enjoying the silence between one another for the last time and I think I understand and can now move on.

But I should have kept going out and I should have kept making new friends.  I just should have.

He wanted me to go out and he went  out sometimes, but it almost always turned into me worrying about which girls were hitting on him and whether he would want to cheat.  Unfortunately I had my reasons for worrying, but I should have figured out something different than staying home so much.

Back to my point.  It was fun to go out.  It was fun to dance and laugh at my friends.  I liked being told that I was beautiful.  It was weird to be hit on and not be able to say that I had a boyfriend.  I just talked to them and walked away.  I'm not interested, but it was nice.  I know that I will feel like I'm cheating if I do like somebody, but for now, it was just idle chatter... and it was nice.

I wish I had gone out while I was with him, because it would have been so nice to come home to him.  It would have made our time together so much better if we had done our separate things.

It feels like a breath of fresh air.,17,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hjl6z/i_had_an_epiphany_for_the_first_time_in_our_three/,"A little back story, feel free to skip: He and I (F) got together in 2010. May 7th to be exact. He was 16 and I was 14 and it was perfect. He was (is) my neighbor. 

We went through several breakups (I was always the breaker) but we always got back together for the wrong reasons. He was my best friend though, and we never really separated. We went through a miscarriage, my father going to jail, deaths in the family, everything, together. But we've made mistakes and we are no longer the people we started as. 

We broke up 18 days ago, and it has been hell like always. I am always dead set on breaking up, but once we do I just fall into a pit of depression. But last night for some reason I had a breakthrough. 

11 Realizations:

1. You have always succeeded in making me jealous. You used to have control over how I felt. Not anymore. I decide how I feel. 

2. Part of me wanted a guy to compete with you and your new girl. I no longer feel like I need one. I will learn a lot on my own. You can't force a good connection or create the perfect circumstances to meet someone. It will happen when it happens. 

3. You are hurt just like I am. How we deal with it determines how we'll each heal. (Read: I'm facing my emotions and he's distracting himself with another girl) 

4. I imagined a summer fling when I thought of us breaking up. I may  not actually be ready this summer. Or maybe I will be, but I may not find someone that soon. 

5. I committed to the pain this breakup would bring when I decided to deserve better. I will do what it takes to get there. 

6. I have not been a perfect girlfriend, nor you a perfect boyfriend. This is no reason to feel guilty anymore. Nothing could have fixed us. 

7. I have to own the hurt and just bear with it. It will end someday. Good things will happen again. 

8. I want you to be happy. 

9. I will be 100% okay without you someday. 

10. I am still going to miss you, but at least I will be hurting for the loss itself, not something you've intentionally caused me. 

11. All of these realizations make me feel like I don't want to run over and knock on your door at any given moment. But you are my neighbor and I can't avoid you forever, I think being armed with this may make it easier to be around you.

1371170349.0,15,self.BreakUps,1gb272,9yr relationship finito - Request for some support,17,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gb272/9yr_relationship_finito_request_for_some_support/,"Im 32, been with a girl for 9 years.  We started off in the UK when I was 23.  Moved to Australia and been here with her for last 5 years. 

She had just been back to the UK to see family and friends and thats where I guess she made the decision to breakup.  On returning, was little communication and although we slept in same bed she seemed very anti any touching.   

Just broke up at the weekend.  It was an amicable breakup as opposed to one of us cheating or something.  I still believe that she genuinely is a nice person who is loyal and genuine, I believe its because we have just grown apart.  It was definitely her decision and not mine, although I knew something was up for awhile. 

In hindsight, all the signs were there for the past year - lack of intimate communication, less frequent sex and when it did happen felt like a chore on her half, and the small stuff like sharing less photos of ourselves on facebook, hiding her facebook relationship status, going out together less, etc   

I think a big factor for her not doing it sooner was residency in Australia. Currently she is under my sponsored work visa which is currently being turned into residency.  If I was spiteful (and I am not), I could take her off it = there is no reason to do this.

Ive got about 2-3 close friends out here, and about 10-20 people I consider friends but would not confide my deep feelings too.
Anyhow, she moved into a friends house and left me in 'our' house with a lot of accumulated furniture/stuff/cat.
So, I took the week off work, and glad I did as my head has been all over the place and not been able to think logically.

First couple of days i bounced a message a day to the X, but nothing crazy.  Really just wanted to make sure she was ok as I know this was tricky for her as well / and a 'are u 100% sure uve made the right decision' to which she responded yes (with some nice thoughtful words about not wanting to end up staying together but hating each other/etc).  I needed to hear this to ensure that I needed to start the process of getting over her and not regret trying to get her back if she was unsure.
Ive done all the usual things like remove her from facebook, deleted her number, but there will be a need to talk at some point in the future to iron our residency and what to do with the cat. This is fine, but will wait for a month for things to settle a bit, or ill communicate through a neutral friend.

Over the week, I will admit I did drink fairly heavily for the first few days (not until the night), and have had trouble sleeping/eating all week.
Yesterday my friend cooked me up some food, I didnt touch a drop of booze and due to the lack of sleep i got to sleep ok without the need for a nightcap.

I have done breakups before, but this one does feel a bit more painful than prior ones.  I think its more because of me being older, ideas of familes/settling down where in my head, im in another country (that I love), and although it was refreshing to have an amicable breakup (ive had a few drama breakups in my past), it also leaves you not having good reasons to hate them/know its over.

I would like to think that theres enough advice on the net/this sub for advice on getting over a girl.  Like I said, ive been there before so assume that I will just have to go through the motions and deal with it.  Still any tips would still be nice.

Here are some issues I am trying to work through:

* I work in technology, and often do a lot of presentations/deliver training and web-development = one fear I have is that I know my self esteem is low/my brain is constantly having the usual waves of questioning everything about life, and I hope it does not impact my work.  I love my job and usually I spend a good 1-2hrs a day in my own time learning new stuff.  That has'nt happened this week (as expected).  I guess I will just have to go in on Monday and just get on with it.

* The house.  For the first few days I was still expecting to see her around the house, especially when I woke up.  Ive deicded to start downsizing my stuff.  Sold a few big things already and with her stuff gone as well, theres now a few empty rooms.  This is the big decision I need to make (which likely I will have to work out myself) is what to do next.

1) Stay here and get someone else to move in. 

2) Move out to a smaller place and live alone.

3) Move out to someone elses houseshare.

4) Move out to a place and rent a room to someone.

Im leaning towards #4 and I am not rushing into it, but just investigating adverts on real estate/gumtree (craigslist) to get a feel for whos out there. Its just not that much fun living in a fairly big empty house on your own, with a computer to keep me company.  I do like my alone time, but dont want to turn into a hermit.  I kind of thought that I was too old for dealing with houseshares now, but then the company could be good (depending on the company I guess).

* The cat.  This must be a common one.  We both love the cat.  He is an outdoor cat.  For me, he reminds me of 'us' but that might pass over time, just dont want to end up in another relationship in a year and be cuddling the cat and being reminded of an X.  Currently ive said she can have him.  The only concern i have is that she may well return to the UK, so cat would have to be then passed to someone else. Also, I earn more and have the option to choose a house that has a garden and roomates that dont have dogs/etc. 

* Meeting new people.  Most of my friends are settled down, and like I said, I mainly only see 2 or 3 of them regularly.  Been connecting with good friends back in the UK who have had some good words to cheer me up.  Although a best mate has been really awesome with coming around nearly everyday this week, I dont like the fact that his girlfriends sitting at home on her own or im around there being a gooseberry.  Just feels a bit awkard.  I guess I need to start looking at some things to get into to meet some new people.  I am ashamed to say that i have spent a fair bit of time on OkCupid the last couple of days.  Mainly just to try and see whos out there and get into talking to talking to female strangers again.  Its actually been quite nice and although I would not even think about dating anyone for a good couple of months, it seems to be a good distraction for when im thinking about the X.  Any thoughts on this?

Thats enough words from me.  Quite helpful for me just pouring that out.  Let me know if you have any advice for me and thanks in advance.  Theres been some good reads on this sub that help, but would also be good to hear some advice from any people in their thirties as well.

So, it has been 5 months. I am a male, 20 years, old, she is 19.  We broke up 5 month ago after an on and off relationship for 3.5 years.  So, how do I feel about it now? Well, I miss her..still.  In the past, it has been hard for me to tell whether I missed being in a relationship, or if I actually missed her, turns out it was her.  We talk every once in a while on Facebook as friends, and I don't think it makes it harder (but maybe it does).  I acknowledge at this point that we probably won't go out ever again, and fortunately, I am to the point where I am okay with this.  It has been shitty, but I chose to take it in the best way I can, and it has made me a better person.  She is doing well, and I am happy for that.  I'm sure it will be hard when she dates someone in the future, but that's nothing I can get mad about.  If things worked out the way I would want, we would have one more chance together.  I miss her a lot some days, and not so much others, but I think in the long term there could've been something there.  I guess my lesson is: Take it the best way you can, and make sure that you are always the top priority.

I was doing no contact for a while, and the ex texted me last week. We chatted and agreed to meet up for lunch yesterday (Sunday). I wanted to share my experience with it and the breakup.

She had concerns as she is Native American, and there are cultural implications involved in dating outside of the race. Things like kids have to have a certain percentage of native heritage to be considered for tribal inclusion, the two of us couldn't live on her home reservation, as my heritage prevents, it, etc... But we discussed those and determined that we'd cross that bridge when we came to it. We were happy and loved each other. She works in Native American health care, and was increasingly becoming more culturally connected to the native community (we live in a big city, where there are a lot of natives but she didn't have a lot of access to a cohesive community until she started her job about midway through our relationship). 

During the last two months of our relationship, she really connected with a native guy who she had met through a work function. They were around each other quite a bit during that time, and when they weren't together the texts were flying. I confronted her on this, but she assured me they were only friends. Eventually, because of her relationship with this new guy, I told her she needed to take a step back and evaluate our relationship and whether the cultural differences were insurmountable. And that if they weren't, I was ready and willing to continue our relationship. 

After a week, she let me know that she had feelings for this other guy. There was no physical cheating, but as I suspected and confronted her about, there was definitely emotional. I was livid at first. Reacted with the standard ""I knew it! You betrayed me!"" type of stuff. And after a pathetic week of bargaining and pleading, I began NC. It lasted about a month, until she reached out. During that month I did a lot of thinking. Objective thinking. Removing me from the equation and really thinking about what happened. 

She fell for this guy. It started happening while we were dating, but it was legitimate falling. I've fallen for girls before. And when it happens, it's like your heart is saying, ""Full speed ahead"", and your brain is saying, ""I can't stop this thing even if I wanted to. I don't even know where the brakes are!"" I know this feeling. I felt it for her when we first started dating. It sucks that it happened on my watch, but it happened for her. She handled the situation poorly, and during that month and a half of the texting she should have said to me, ""We need to talk"". But overall she's a great person that handled a situation poorly. When we split up, she told me that she didn't want it to be happening, and that's why she never wanted to talk to me about it. Like I said, handled it poorly. But it's a learning experience for her and for me.

Yesterdays meeting was nice. We talked about what was going on in each others' lives, and we talked specifically about her and her new relationship, at my prodding. She said she felt weird talking to me about it, but I explained my epiphany. The two of them are in love. She admits it's moving quickly, but there's nothing she can do about it. Her heart is steering the ship. They've talked about moving together to another state with a stronger native american cultural base. They've talked about marriage, although she says it's definitely way far off. I mean, they're in love. And I'm legitimately happy for her. I don't know if this is a strange way to think, but if our relationship ended because of this guy, I'd rather that this guy be the one that she ends up with. Has kids with. At least our relationship wouldn't have ended in vain because of some dick she met in a bar. I mean, can anyone truly be angry or upset with someone for finding love? We loved each other, but this seems different for her. And I'm happy for her. 

I think we'll probably continue to talk. Obviously she has a lot of other things on her plate right now, so we won't be as close as before. But I just wanted to share my experience with this. I had taken a lot of introspective steps in figuring out this breakup, and I was ready to see my friend again. Sometimes it is possible. Not pushing anyone in any direction, but do what you think is right for you. And really think about the breakup if you're able. It can totally help your brain.

TL/DR - Broke NC, had good talks, feeling pretty okay ",,False,,t5_2ra79,1366634882.0,,,True,t3_1cuyx9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cuyx9/nc_broke_and_it_was_good/,
1366438011.0,13,self.BreakUps,1cq8e0,For those who have been dumped...,17,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cq8e0/for_those_who_have_been_dumped/,"Hey, listen up here for a minute and actually read this through instead of the short and sweet below.

 Now I have given advice, shared my stories and poured my heart out on R/breakups...it's been rough, it still is in a lot of ways to deal with what has happened. I mean like many who have been suddenly and shockingly dumped with no provocation and seemingly in a perfect relationship it's incredibly hard to deal with. You love someone, you probably always will but you have to figure out how to move on now. Here's where I have come to so far and what I suggest you remember.

Now, I moved to a new city two weeks ago, I was dumped two weeks prior to that after my GF realized she was moving far away and the LDR we had been doing was too hard for her emotionally (crying at nights and all with the lack of physical contact); we both admit that it was that difficult and that everything we said and did was real. Now even though we both gave it all we had, or so I thought we both were giving it all we had, I was ruined by her and really hurt beyond explanation, still am, always will feel disappointed in her really and always, always will have a strong love for her. 

However in the time that's past since, I kept no contact and being alone in a new city with few to no friends I have actually come to make several friends, both at work and outside. The friends I made outside of work were through one simple act. I went out! I went out and I acted like me but was not afraid to talk to strangers or say what's really on my mind. No, I didn't sulk, no, I didn't cry; I just was me, I was real and it works. You'll always feel love for the ex that hurt you, you will likely always want them back; but you can't dwell on it forever. It's their lose really and you can only keep moving forward.

Look, just tonight alone I had more people try and buy me drinks than I could even accept, it was crazy. I did nothing special, I acted myself. I didn't go home with any woman, I didn't get any numbers. No, that's not me, I am; first off not ready; and secondly; madly in love with the woman I always dreamed of who, yes, hurt me like no one else. So while that part of me didn't change what changed is that I actually got more confident, gained some great friends, found out I am far more of a catch than I kept thinking I am and you all should too. Remember you're better than your ex in that regard, you were the strong one, the one who was committed. You know what you wanted in life and who, you weren't confused. 

It turns out, much to the chagrin of my humbleness, that I am someone that woman desire, not only physically but mentally. Awesome! I am a hot guy or at least an attractive enough guy in the sense that good looking and decent woman want me for who I am, enough that I feel guilty even though I was the one dumped, wow; kinda cool really. You all are attractive woman/guys my fellow dumpees; don't hide it, show it, be yourself, be confident and get out there and live your life. 

If our ex's want us back, realize they screwed the pooch, then fine, let them come back and you can decide if they are worthy to be back in your life or not. 

For me, I would welcome them I am sure but I am also happy to know that if they don't see their mistake that I have lots of people wanting me. When I am ready I can then proceed down that path and someday, like you, I'll find true love if this EX of mine can't see it as clearly as I; and you know what...that's her lose and her regret to live with, not mine. She is aware of the kinship, love, trust and bond that she decided to drop between us. I have that in me and I have that confidence and passion which I fully understand, so buck up and remember this line I am paraphrasing; ""You get busy dying or you get busy living!"".

**TL:TR: You dumpee's have nothing to fear. Be yourself, be confident and you will get back in the game. If your EX really means that much to you and they realize there mistake it's your job as the better man/woman to decide if they deserve you though, be wise and be confident!**  ",,False,,t5_2ra79,1366768341.0,,,True,t3_1cq8e0,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cq8e0/for_those_who_have_been_dumped/,

This much I have learnt. I saw a photo of myself from summer vacation last year and realised the day after it was taken my -ex destroyed my heart. It was through e-mail. I didn't even hear his voice. 
The pain is visceral and it's sickening and I can't escape it.

I haven't seen him in almost one year. He rightly cut me out of his life.

I was insecure and cheated on him and withheld the truth because I was so scared to lose him. He took longer than me to fall in love and I was mistrusting. By the time I realised how deeply I loved him I had already broken us. The irony that my selfish need to be loved meant I lost the man I loved above everything, is not lost on me. 

I don't deserve sympathy and I don't deserve forgiveness; I was pathetic and unthinking and not the person I hope to be today.

For all those who have been cheated on; I am so sorry. I don't know what the circumstances were in your relationship but betrayal is almost too painful to bear in love.

So a year on and it still hurts. I can point to it in my stomach. There are days when I forget and am happy. Then there are bad days and I feel like I will carry this pain around forever and it is just too much. I starve myself to try and feel absolved and show the world how sorry I am but it's just isolated me more.

I don't think that ""once a cheat, always a cheat"". It hurts me so much to read. Sometimes we learn from experience; sometimes these experiences affect us more than we'd ever realise. 
I will never cheat again. Never. It is not worth the absolute torture.

You live 5 miles away you lazy bastard. 


On your days off you sleep all day. All day. I hate that about you. Your lack of motivation is a huge turn off. Why did you bother saying you wanted to be better? Why did you keep telling me you could fix it? I gave you an out, so many times. Why did you have to lie to me and yourself? You ignored me when you didn't want to deal with something. Grow up. 


Life can be a bitch sometimes, but nobody owes you anything. You are not entitled to anything. I really wish you understood that.


You complain on a nearly constant basis. You always liked to use me to vent, but you never asked me about my day. If I had a problem, you told me to ""deal with it"". Screw you. 


You forgot my birthday. I really don't know why you bother dating. According to you, your previous girlfriends always told you what to do. I certainly understand why. You are careless. It doesn't matter how many times you say you can be better, or that you care or that you want to work it out. You expect everything to be easy. By not putting the work in, you just make everything harder on yourself and everyone else. 


I'm not your mother or your keeper. I wasn't going to ""make"" you do anything. Take some responsibility for yourself and realize you are the one who makes these choices. You can't blame anyone else. ""I don't know"" is not an answer. If you don't care enough to have an honest discussion when things get serious, stay out of relationships and be by yourself. Spare the next girl the trouble.


I didn't need flowers or expensive gifts. I needed you to care and make the effort. I needed you to give a little instead of just taking. This went on for over a year. A year of my life full of confusion and tears and feeling like there was something wrong with me. Obviously I need to search myself for the reasons why I would bother. But I'm not your problem anymore and you aren't mine. 


I honestly do wish you well. You were not a very good boyfriend to me, but you were often fun to be around. Thank you for the experience. Please be nicer to the next girl.

Deciding to restrict her access to me on the facebook hurt more than it should have. 

She and I were madly in love, her 24[f], me 25[m]. We had plans for the future, big plans to move to a new city, new state, and begin to build our lives together, we were together for 2 years. But then things got stale, and we both had our doubts, and a slightly unhealthy attachment to each other emotionally. Because of this we decided that the best thing to do would be if we decided to call it quits. We haven't completely cut off contact, which hasn't exactly made it any easier on either of us. We still love each other, but we just weren't right for each other, and we knew this. 

Back to my initial point. Social networking has made this process more difficult than it should be. I find myself checking her FB, even though I know she's restricted my access and I cannot see anything she hasn't tagged me in. I'm glad she's done this, as I have restricted her access as well. Then comes those pesky photos. I don't want to delete them, not now, because I liken it to deleting memories, but the problem I have is that they were GOOD memories, memories that I want to hold onto. They were painfully wonderful memories that we made together over the past two years, and I'm just not ready to let go of them. 

She called me the other night, drunk, in tears (admittedly I was drunk too), because a girl who I am friends with liked a photo on my instagram. I am not seeing this girl or anything, but I know she saw it. I have since set everything on there to private, and we no longer follow each other on that particular site. She just kept saying ""Why? Why does this hurt so bad? Why did we do this to each other?"" And I couldn't answer those questions. I still love her, and I know its time to move on. 

I'm trying to pick up the pieces and remind myself that this was mutual and for the best. Nobody said it would be easy, and there are times where I find myself wanting to call/text her so bad, if for no other reason than to hear her voice. But I can't, I can't do that to her, I can't do that to myself. I still love her and wish her all the best in her life, and I hope she finds herself out there. I can only hope she wants the same for me. 

Anyways, that's my rant for now. I just needed to get some of that off my chest to people who know nothing of my situation/our relationship who are indifferent and supportive. Thank you for taking the time to read.

And I followed - believing your path. 'Close your eyes' you said. So I closed my eyes. 'Now sing a song'. Which one? I know many. 'Any song'. My eyes were still closed. And there I was, standing in the darkness, chanting the most beautiful words that come to mind - for you.

'Hold my hand' you said, and I did. The tenderness of your skin sparked an instant attack of pleasure upon my veins. You walked me through the unknown - I felt energized. The smoothness of the air dueled with your flowery scent for my attention.

I could feel the pattern of the ground shifting and your dress clinging against my thighs. The sound of our movement turned clattery as we strolled through what was a mystery to my senses. Could it be a shore of pebbles? Perhaps those are twigs in a forest? Or the rough road to a village?

You giggled naughtily as I remained puzzled. The only image I had in my mind was of you, detached from any decor or scene. How beautiful is your smile and how sharp is your gaze. The wind breathing down my neck must have surely accentuated your wavy hair. Your eyes, an endless sea of joy remained our only guide.

Happiness, I felt. It didn't matter where I'm going, so long it included you. It didn't matter where I was or where I would be. The past, the present, the future - they fell short of this timeless experience. The only thing that mattered was my love to you. For what is a world without love?

My legs were heavy. Our lazy walk turned to a stride uphill. I felt compelled to reason. And yet you remained censored on telling our whereabouts. 'Only a mile ahead' you said. It felt weird to trip endlessly in the darkness, but I followed - believing your path.

We stalled for a moment. You loosed my hold and patted me on the cheek. I could hear my bristles whistling against your arms. Nothing understood me better than your touch. Synergy is chaos compared to how your fingers caressed my hair.

'Kiss me.' Your voice reverberated flirtatiously in the corridors of my heart. My nerves adjusted themselves to your clutch. And when you kissed me, I felt compelled to visualize your nose. How sweet is your tongue and how soft are your lips.

Harmonious we were. I felt possessed - not by a demon - but a Venusian angel. I felt like a child who munched on a lollipop for the first time. I felt like a stray dog finding a home, or an eagle, finding his nest. I felt what you felt - the essential symbiosis of two organisms.

As you let go, I imagined an insurmountable river dividing us. 'Come' you said, reassuring your presence. You signed your masterful act of affection with a final peck on my forehead. Vertiginously enchanted were the gears of my thought.

You retook my hand and resumed our journey. Each and every one of my heartbeats was synchronized to match your grip. It wasn't a day-dream. I was there. You were there. And even though I didn't know where we were. I followed - believing your path.

Then, we finally stopped. 'Open your eyes' you said. I opened my eyes and winced at the sight of your tears. Behind you was the edge of a cliff. 'This finite world will extinguish all we have' you wept. I couldn't rationalize your intentions, but I was, nevertheless, imbued with terror.

'So I've found a way to eternalize it' you added. While still holding my hand, you took a step back and expected me to fall with you. I tried to hold you still, but you pushed me away and dived to oblivion. This time, I couldn't follow - I didn't believe your path.

I couldn't fathom what I had witnessed. Your eyes gazed mine in reconciliation, accepting my decision. Your frame turned smaller, and your gaze meaner. This time, your felicity contrasted my horror. And with a light thud, you crashed upon the terrain, erecting a pool of blood. I let out a mighty howl.

It felt like a dagger stabbing me in the chest. In slow motion, shards of lament rained upon me. I felt like a baby losing his mother. I felt like a bee in a lake of insecticides, or a scorpion, encircled by fire. I felt what you didn't feel - as you didn't feel anything.

I was watching you, from a sound distance, willfully lifeless and beautiful. This glorious creature who could turn water to wine. This magnificent embodiment of bliss. Why have you led me astray? Why did you choose the wrong end? Why did you leave me in a world without love?

I wanted to follow suit. Perhaps you were right - only an inch away was the answer. And our amorousness be restored. I closed my eyes again, but I couldn't see your image, only what it had shadowed. I could see myself, the world and everyone else. I grinned sarcastically.

And then it occurred to me that I love my life. I love my friends. I love my family. I love my society and culture. I love nature and I love freedom. I love reason and cause. I also love myself. I love a world that excluded you. I refused to love you anymore.

Even though he was an asshole and it was one of most emotionally trying months in a long, long time for me (as well as a month of 'decline' before we broke up), I realized when we had our official ""ok-we're-doing-this-again talk"" that we needed the break. It's definitely injured both of us, and it's going to take a while to fix, but it allowed us to set ground rules and have a mature conversation about why we hurt each other, and about how we can genuinely try to fix our issues.


So things may suck right now, but if there's a chance, you'll know in your gut that it's still there.

EDIT: i realize that this doesn't happen very often, and I don't want to give false hope. So, here's another thing I learnt: breakups can be good because they make you confront your faults and eventually, when you've made it through the worst (which is where I was getting as soon as we got back together), you'll end up being proud that you could make it through. You can forgive yourself for all the terrible mistakes you make along the way, and have new confidence that you were able to get through this, and face this. You know who your friends are (and who aren't...) and you find new ways to push yourself. You might even find new passions along the way.

We were together for three. Since then I've had some really *really* low low's, with only a handful of good times mixed in. 

There still has not been a single day that I don't think about her, and no matter what I do (regardless of whether or not it was something we shared - music, movies, food, whatever) she's still right there in my head and heart.

Even typing this out now is causing me chest pains and sadness. 

I've talked to friends and family about it, and even through their understanding and advice I just can't shake the feeling deep down that I really did lose someone extremely unique and special. No one I've ever been with has ever had this kind of impact on me - during the relationship or after.

I just don't know what to do, I'm so tired of this and want it to stop. I figured at this point down the road, some kind of numbness or acceptance would kick in and I could move on... but most days it hurts just as bad or more, to the point where I almost physically can't get out of bed, eat or do anything else.

Background: I (M23) was dating this amazing woman (F24) for about 4 months, and we had been talking for a few months prior to that. I am in the military, and do not live in my home state, where she is. I come home every holiday to see her, knowing that my time in service is ending soon, and I'll get to move close to her afterwards.

She is a widow, whose husband died of a very rare form of cancer. but other than that, a very happy person. Very involved in music, has a great job and fluent in German. Almost done with her degree in German and music.

I want you to know I truly love you, and this decision wasn't easy.  Just because I made this decision don't mean I love you any less.  This doesn't mean I don't think of you or dream of you.  It just means I'm trying to do what's best for the both of us.  It wouldn't be fair to keep you around when I know deep down that what we have isn't stable or healthy and it can't be fixed.  It would be cruel for me to stay and hold you and kiss you, while knowing I'm not committed to the same thing you are.  I would love to do those things.  I would love to see you and hold you when you're crying and tell you you're handsome and the best when you feel down.  I would mean what I say.  But it would be cruel to do those things knowing that it would never last.  I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry it didn't work out.  

I don't blame you for the ending of our relationship.  It always takes two to make a relationship work, and I know it's not just one person's fault.  You were there for me through a lot of tough times in my life, and I appreciate that.  There were times were you made me feel safe and wanted when I felt I had no one else.  You were there for me to listen to my insecurities and try to encourage me when I felt down.  You made me smile and laugh.  I could be myself around you and be silly and not be self conscious. I really appreciate you, and I value you a lot.  You're a strong man.  I know you feel very sad and broken, and I have contributed to that.  But you are so strong, intelligent, and motivated.  So I know you will find yourself again.  I know you will come out of this a better person, willing to love again.  You weren't just my lover, you were my friend as well.  And I hate to see you so down.  I know that we cannot be in contact for you to fully heal, but I want you to know I wish you all the best.

heres is TLDR backstory: im 29m who dated a 27f for 6 months or so. I was in love with her more than i have ever loved anyone else.. things weren't working and i broke up with her despite the fact i am in total love with her.. i actually ended up finding out she cheated and now has a new bf.

the good news is… im still alive and my heart is still beating. its been 8+ months since ive seen her.. i think of her every day and i still miss her. but something has come over me. i realized there is more to life then girls and relationships. just go fucking live your life man. be awesome. be the best you, you can be. no one is going to give a shit about you unless you give a shit about yourself. I know it's cliche but inside every single human being is a light that burns… its up to you to put gasoline on that flame and blow up to be something amazing.

- one way to be amazing is find inspiration through other sources… actors, body builders, musicians, dad, uncle, comics.. Anything that is positive. Emulate someone successful!

- go to the gym. it releases endorphins.. it also helps your libido. trust me on this one. Rome wasn't built in one day. no one cares if you have a six pack or whatever.. just go to the gym and you will instantly feel better about yourself.. remember, it's what you think about your self what matters the most. 

- hang out with friends and have guy nights.. i recommend the weekends because there will be more girls out.

- READ or listen to anything by Neil Strauss. He wrote ""The Game"".. It will seriously change your fucking life. you will immediately stop feeling sorry for yourself and want to change your behaviors once you have finished watching this dvd.  listen to it at work or wherever, just don't ignore this. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGTX-hz5YRA

- Read about other pick up artists.. most of these guys were down and out losers with women but have changed their lives and social status by modifying their philosophy and way of thinking. 

- Get a buddy who is willing to be a fellow wingman.




TLDR: i used to want to kill myself… i would only find pleasure in thinking of creative ways to die. I miss my ex, sure, but she isn't worth me killing myself.. after reconnecting with an old buddy after my breakup, he has shown me about being a pickup artist.. my buddy isn't the best looking guy but he doesn't give a fuck. he is flowing with confidence. so now, instead of worrying about my ex, im more worried about how many girls i can meet in a week. i don't want to die anymore.. hell, i just realized how awesome i have become and texted my ex gf with some small chat.. she has a bf and whatever, but i have now taken her off the pedestal. who cares if i end up with her again.. i just want her to see how amazing i am and that im able to move on from her. 

Well guys, it's not an easy process but there is certainly light at the end of the tunnel. there will be some dark fucking days ahead, but who gives a shit. keep on being awesome!

Living well won't be as sweet of a revenge, or be a revenge at all. My ex being a non-emotional type will probably never actually ""beg"" for me back, even if he wanted ""us"" again. My romantic expectations would likely be dashed, as usual.

What am I trying to get at? Maybe I fear that I'll have this amazing successful life but the success won't taste as sweet without him acknowledging it. Like even after all that, he'll still have power over me somehow. My entire relationship with him was essentially me chasing for his total approval.

And I've had my downs, [Second post on the breakup](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11yqdb/update_a_relapse_an_overactive_imagination_and/).

I think I'm doing surprisingly well now, actually. It's amazing what some time and space will do. I haven't spoken to her for a little bit and I've been focusing on improving myself and, you know, it's exactly what I needed.

I started working out again, started running, and started hiking on the weekends - I'm so glad I'm doing this. The endorphins really make a huge difference. I'm not really in good shape right now endurance wise, so the running and hiking is really kicking my ass, but damn does it feel good.

I started making a schedule for myself: Monday: Go for a run, work on picture book idea, contact my business partner about our game; Tuesday: Go to the Gym, create story ark for picture book, go out?; Wednesday: Game night, Run?... etc. Scheduling things has really helped me stay focused and kept me from coming home and just sitting on the couch, a habit I'm working on breaking. The more I do all this stuff, the less I feel like sitting on the couch all night vegging out (one of the things I did that contributed to killing the relationship).

I ordered a huge map of the world. Why? Because I have always wanted to travel and I've always found reasons not to, and now I'm going to be reminded of it every day. I'm going to put markers on there to mark where I've been, and I'm going to put markers on there to mark where I want to go, approximately when, and how badly I want to go there (another reason things fell apart: I wasn't pursuing my own dreams and was using her to make me happy).

I've picked up Rosetta Stone and am going to learn three new languages. First on the list is Brazillian Portuguese, because the World Cup and Olympics are going to be down there, and I've always want to go to Portugal. Next, a language from Asia (not sure which, maybe Mandarin?), Last, a European Language (German?). I feel like this should really help me exercise my mind and get me thinking about other cultures in ways I've so far not. I'm actually incredibly excited about this.

I played this game the other day, it really helped me feel good about myself, and has set me moving forward faster than anything else. Take out a sheet of paper, or open up a new doc, or just say it aloud. Start with the sentence, ""I like BlastedToMoosh (your name instead of mine), I really do,"" and then list all the things about yourself you like. The only rules are you can't include caveats like, ""I like BlastedToMoosh because he's pretty hot, but he could lose some weight,"" and no negatives. I really recommend saying it aloud when you're alone, that felt amazing.

Anyways, I don't know how much longer I'll be here, but you've all helped quite a bit. It's been very cathartic and therapeutic to write to you people, and I appreciate all the sentiment and advice.

Guys and Gals, do yourselves a favor and don't forget that someone out there loves you, whether it's your parents or your best friend or your sibling or your cat, and don't forget that you need to love yourself too.

I [21M] just got cheated on by my [24F] girlfriend to end a 3-year relationship. Found out 3 days ago. It was my first love, my first real relationship, and I realize now that I was naive: I thought that we were better than all the couples that cheat, lie, and hurt each other. For the most part, in our relationship, we communicated well, we supported each other, and we were in love. But we had difficulties too. In the end, she was overwhelmed with some family issues and difficulties at work, and she started growing distant. Then, she wanted a break. We talked about being faithful during the break, and she wasn't. She cheated on me with a friend, so I left her. She pseudo-cheated on me once before, and I promised myself then that if she ever broke my trust again, I'd leave. So I did. We had a lot of hardships in our relationship, and I have thought of ending it many times before. I never did though, because I was committed and in love and pretty damn scared to. 

The pros and cons:
If she hadn't cheated, we might have stayed together. We never had a *reason* to break up. She thought that maybe that's why she did it--to give us a reason. The good part about being cheated on is that I'm not having any doubts. The more time passes, the more pissed off I am at her. The more I realize that I deserve someone better--someone that respects me. I know I'm better off alone for now, and hopefully I'll find someone that is more compatible down the road.

The con is that I feel betrayed. I've known her for so long, and I never thought she could hurt me like that. But she did, and I'm realizing that she wasn't who I wanted her to be. I can't fix her problems, and they were in the way of us having a happy relationship. For the shittiness of the situation, though, we ended on good terms. We both know this is what's best. We both still care about each other, I just can't ever trust her again. Maybe someday we'll be friends.

I'm happy that I'm not having any doubts. I hope it'll get me through the grieving process faster. Have any of you been cheated on to end a relationship? What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of that being the end?

&gt;Dear J.,
&gt;
&gt;I didn't write this email while upset. I'm calculated, balanced and as cool as a cucumber, I can assure you.
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes I wonder if you have any respect for me at all. After we returned from our vacation, at first I thought the liking was mutual, but you gradually turned colder and treated me like a meaningless one-week stand, a notch on your belt. The flirting and pet name calling were gone. You didn't want me to come visit you in December. You said you had no feelings for me whatsoever. You replied with ""OK whatever"" (actual quote) when I wore my heart on my sleeve. 
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you just keep chatting with me because you're lonely/bored, I don't know. This makes me feel used. One would only agree to that if she has very low self esteem. I think I'm worth more than a f*ck and a fortnightly IM. 
&gt;
&gt;This isn't working for me. I'm moving on with my life. Go do some thinking. I'll be here (not for very long though!) if you wake up one morning and realize that 'hey, that chick is cute, she thinks very highly of me, we always had so much to talk about, she's the only girl on this planet who was able to put up with me for 6 years, and since interplanetary travel is not yet affordable - she might be worth it after all!'. If you're not interested in more than a platonic friendship, then don't IM me for now, okay? 
&gt;
&gt;Maybe in a few months or years I'll be able to resume this as friends-mode correspondence, but not at the moment. 
I'm not backing off from my decision this time.

I wont get into the details of the breakup itself, except to say that it was largely my fault, I fucked up badly and lost someone I cared a lot for. And fully deserved it.

Needless to say the breakup was shit and it effected us both emotionally, though I dealt with it with less grace than she did and since we still lived together for the first month or so I found it incredibly hard to stay composed infront of her on a day to day basis. The worst part was being a stranger to someone who lay literally 10 feet away in the next room, the room we had shared for the year...

Anyway, in the months after we moved out during the summer I found it increasingly difficult to deal with the loss of her. I moved back home, in with my parents, and felt extremely lonely on a regular basis since all of my close friends now work around the country. I'd see one of them once a week if I was lucky.
Meanwhile, I looked at her world from afar in the little contact we now shared; new, bustling, and exciting. She seemed happy so quickly and it was this apparent disparity in how we felt that killed me. She even sent me a text at one point saying she didn't miss me anymore. This hurt. Alot. Mainly because I just couldn't bring myself to get on without her. My best friend for nearly 4 years. Immediately after the breakup she had put in alot of effort to extend her circles and meet new people (mainly guys, to my horror), something I was too stubborn to do in the midst of exams. She was even openly flirting with an 'old friend' off of her course. This is something I lost my cool over a few times and confronted her on.

In this time I sort of went on a rollercoaster ride swinging between indifference/apathy towards her and her life and just being downright distraught at times. I tried the usual stuff; got in shape, jumped in at the deep end, went on a few dates and even started regularly seeing one of them, though I clearly wasn't ready!
But, to an extent, the dating worked. And whilst I was dating I rarely thought of my ex at all. These momentary distractions were, at first, the relief I desperately needed to displace my loneliness and turmoil. But more and more I started to feel like all of it was useless since not one of them fit the bill to be my ex's successor (at this point I'd found out she was sleeping with, and 'pursuing a relationship' with the guy mentioned earlier. So going back was now out of the question. At least for the time being.) It all just felt futile. And I started to lose interest again in dating...

So jump to now. A few weeks ago I moved back to university, a house with 5 complete strangers. We do the traditional thing of getting drunk and get to know eachother. One of them I get along with incredibly well and we share alot in common! I was so happy. She sort of filled all the blanks that seemed to be lacking in the girls I'd been dating.
Then the stupid thing happens and we get really drunk and we kiss. I ended up sleeping in her bed (nothing more than kissing happened, we spooned) and since we've talked about it and had a laugh and we get on really well. I really feel like we could have a very close friendship.

Which brings me to my realisation...

It dawned on me in the days following that night that the reason i had suffered so much during the breakup is because I was trying to find a like for like replacement for my ex. Another basket for all my eggs. A substitute. And then, looking back, I noticed all the little things that my ex had done in the time since we broke up. She hung around regularly with guy who likes playing video games, something we used to do. The guy off her course, he replaced our intimacy and close friendship. The people she lived with and work, replaced the fact that we used to live together and be almost always close, always chatting. Always together. So she had constant momentary distractions.

Now I'm looking to spread all the things i loved about her and find them where I can in new people and friends, instead of trying to replace her directly.

**TL;DR**

**I think that the key is to try to let go, and put your eggs in a few or many baskets. Find people that tick some of the boxes your ex did. Overlap them. Distribute the substitute over many people because your ex IS one of a kind, and you wont ever find someone like that again. You will find someone different. Someone better. But only when you are ready... and in the meantime find happiness in the people who surround you.**

It's hard to go from being with you all the time, to pretending you don't exist. 

9 years worth of emails, photo's, keepsakes, memories.  I know when you call me, you're reaching out to me, telling me you're ok and you knew it had to happen.  It's not that I'm angry, or I don't want to talk, to give you a second, third, fourth chance to prove you're worthy of me loving you unconditionally.  I shut you out because it hurts to talk to you, because I gave you so many chances, and I know it'll just end up in another fight, more yelling, and unhappiness.  

I keep telling myself that anyways.  I shut you out completely because I want to move on - I want to move on so you can move on.  I want to heal and not feel pain or sadness at the life we could have had together.  

I know that tone and anger in your voice is because you're hurt, confused, upset.  You don't need to pretend, I've known you for 9 years.  I know when you're lying and when you're telling me the truth.  

I left you because we both needed to grow in a healthy manner, because we weren't willing to compromise, because you were miserable with me leading you in your life.  You need to find your own happiness without me.  I left you because I can't keep waiting for our potential future.  

I'm not angry at you, I don't hate you.  I didn't take down the Facebook photo's right away because part of me wanted to keep our relationship alive.  Every time I look through the photo's and think about the memories, I instantly remember all the good we had together.  Fun trips, dates, exploring, you supporting me at my lowest and being there at my best.  

But I also remember all the bad times, the fights, depression, the desperate calls for attention.  I tried to get you help, to get you to counseling, to go through all your pain with you.  But you didn't want the help, you didn't want my unconditional love, you didn't want my support.  That's why I left you.  I left you because you weren't willing to share or improve yourself - while I kept giving and giving, emotionally, financially, physically.  

Part of me really wants us to run into each other years from now, with all of this resolved.  To be more mature and understanding, and realizing our break up was just a big hurdle.  I know this probably won't happen. 

I hope that I've made you a better person regardless of my expectations, I always truly loved you.  You can know that you've helped me become the man I am today and I wouldn't have been able to do it without you. 

I miss you a lot, I still think about you constantly. 

Here's to the both of us finding our own happiness.

I'm now near 4 months into the black hole called being single. I have my good days, but mostly, the dark days far outnumber the good days.

When 'we' started, my ex swapped her previous boyfriend for me. I couldn't care less, but always wondered why. I remember her being very distant and cold when I asked about him. As if he didn't exits anymore and what they had was nothing. They were together for three years and I never understood how she had put it all away. But I respected her boundary and did not probe any further.

Eleven years later she swapped me for a co-worker. Destroying my world, my self-esteem, my trust, my dreams and a whole lot more. Near the end the relationship went sour. I didn't understand what was happening, but the moment she started to develop feelings for he co-worker (with wife, kid and house...), I became more and more of an evil thing in her eyes. She started to resent me and I couldn't do a damn thing about it. Some futile attempts of mine were met with complete lack of enthusiasm. She left me in the dark for months. When her co-worker acknowledge the same feelings, she dumped me the next day. Saying: ""I don't feel it anymore"".


**There were four things I was sure of.**

* She was the one girl I wanted to grow old with.
* She was honesty herself.
* Our love would last forever and survive anything.
* She would be the last person on earth to cheat on me..

Well, I guess I was really wrong about a lot of things, especially number four. 

Owh, did I forget to mention she didn't tell me the truth? That I had to find it out on my own? All the while listening to her telling me what was wrong with me.

I don't wish anybody to have an end to their relationship like I had.

I fucking hate her and damn it, I fucking love her. I have been in No Contact for 49 days, broke it, send a small 'I miss you' email, got a short reply back asking how I am doing and finally responded to that. I wrote down the truth, relative long email. Never got a reply. 

The realization the two of us will never get back together is finally taking shape and sinking in. I have a very hard time accepting.

I've seen many posts lately that are callous, hateful and self-depricating and I want to address those sentiments. I'm not here to judge, admittedly a certain amount of resentment and anger were necessary in my healing process.  For most of us, it's like a car accident, for at least a while, it's okay to be upset and disoriented.

After over 7 years together my girlfriend suddenly developed feelings for her personal trainer, before I knew it we were broken up and they are now together.

Our relationship was a lot of firsts for the both of us, our first girlfriend/boyfriend, our first sexual partner, my first kiss (and for me the only person I have kissed). We both thought we were going to get married and have kids and grow old together, nothing made me happier than the thought of sharing the rest of my life with this person. Well you all understand what I mean so I will get into the nitty gritty of it.

We had been living together for the last 3.5 years. About 8 weeks ago she decides that we are broken up and she starts going out in the evenings. I had been getting suspicious of the amount she had been texting in the recent weeks as she was definitely not the texting type since I had known her and she had also been talking a lot about her personal trainer at her gym. Well I looked at her texts (I know, I know, crossed a line) and she and him had been texting constantly for hours at a time, like several texts per minute for hours at a time.
So I confront her calmly about this and she confesses that she has been really confused of late (hence breaking it off with me) and although there was nothing at all going on with her and her personal trainer, that she definitely needed some time alone to reassess things. 

Now starts the very trying times for me, as unfortunately we were still living together in our tiny zero bedroom apartment until we could both find alternative accommodation, sleeping in the same bed and still acting as a couple, still kissing at times (but not having sex), all the while her ""text relationship"" with her personal trainer grows and grows while all I can do is watch.

Wow this is getting very long, sorry guys, I will try to wrap it up as I'm rambling. So pretty much after about 4 weeks we move out separately with me under the assumption that things were going to work out for the best for us in the long run as this is what we both said that we wanted long term, we both agreed that there would be no sex with other people, those were the limits. Anyway about a week after moving she is pretty much with this personal trainer and we talk on the phone and she says that she has already kissed and implies that sex is likely to happen.

Anyway the things I am struggling with that constantly occupy my thoughts are:

* After being with someone for so long, seeing them everyday, talking to them everyday, connecting with them everyday, going through so much and having so much together, how does one just go on alone after? How does one move on after what feels like a loss of identity? You feel as if you ""together"" was you, so who the hell are you now?

* After feeling like you know someone better than you could ever know anyone, to them talking to you like a stranger, can you ever truly know anyone? Is it worth becoming this emotionally attached to a person when they can change in what seems like an instant and cause you more pain than you ever thought you could feel?

There is so much I have left out but I will end it here as I'm sure this is already to long, my first ever post so please be kind, if you want more info I am more than happy too oblige.

I simply do not even know you anymore.

All of your standards that you had instilled when we first met have gone along the side of the road, you are fucking lost and you will not admit it. You repress all of your emotions. I wouldn't doubt if in the back of your mind you imagine that tomorrow you will pull into our driveway and this house would still be yours, but it's not.

You chose to leave because you felt stuck, that you needed to find happiness. You needed to be alone and with your family. Well, if that was the case why did you decide to move in with your friend who has always hated me? I can't imagine the shit she fills through your head. And then you listen to her every word, and hold onto it like it's gospel. 

And then, you replace me with him. Within 6 days. You really showed me how much I meant to you with that. I know, I know you just don't know how to handle your life on your own. Well, it's time you do. It's time you quit lying to yourself. You're moving back to Florida in a few weeks. What are you going to do then?

All of your friends that we had are seeing you for what you really are. WEAK. You are so fucking weak, even when I thought I was weak. Even when I sat down at night just grasping onto anything that was yours and crying on the bathroom floor. My weakness is minimal to what you are.

I could see it on your face the last time I saw you. You are so uncomfortable. You have no sense of normalcy. You don't even have a grasp on what you are losing with our animals. When I lay in bed now, I hold our love children, the ones we grew together. Not only did you walk out on my life, you walked out on there's and you're to WEAK to even attempt to come back and spend time with them, the ones you swore you'd fight over.

And your friends now... or should I say what friends? Your close niche group of people who will as easily forget about you the second you step on that tarmac when you depart from Wisconsin? No one gives a fuck about you, you've built this barrier that has pushed everyone away.

But, alas, I am the guy. The one who no matter how much shit you've put me through, has always been there for you. And you've cut me off completely from your life. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUR TIME TOGETHER, THIS LAST REMAINING MONTH. There wouldn't have been any bad blood and you could have left for Florida, and I would have seen you off knowing this is what you wanted -- but you didn't. You just ran everything into the ground. And at the end of the day, my dumb ass will probably stand next to you.

BUT NO I WONT, because after I sat alone and though of every scenario and after I sat at the very bottom and looked around, I realize I was the one who won here. You were holding me back for what I should have stood for. And I can finally be myself now.

But at the same time I can't. I slept with one of our mutual friends a few times just to pass the time, and it just made me sick. I can't move on. It feels right in the moment but then my stomach gets weak and I imagine running my fingers through your part and kissing your ears and resting my head on your breasts.

I want release, I just want release. I want new love I want a Disney ending, but before I can get that I need you to know how I feel and that you need to open your eyes and feel what I felt instead of hiding it because you are so fucking dumb and you have no grasp on the concept of overcoming and being a better person.

YOU NEED HELP. Remember two years ago when I had this same problem, that I felt stuck. Well I got help, and I cared. 

And I still fucking love you above and beyond, you are my stars, my sky. My everything. I have nothing. But it scares me to say that it feels good to be moving on... but I'm scared. I don't ever want to die alone.  ",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_utn0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/utn0h/an_open_letter_to_a_former_lover/,

I have cut down on smoking weed a lot, and have started going to therapy with a great therapist who is helping me work through my intense issues (C-PTSD from childhood abuse from my mother). Also, I volunteer at a local shelter a lot more, so now I get to walk and play with awesome rescue dogs and make their lives way better whenever I want to.    

I am happy now, and before I met this girl I wasn't happy, I was in a dark place. I was settling for her in a lot of ways, and now I realize that even though I'd like to be on good terms with her going forward, I really don't care either way, she is just, as gotye says, ""someone that I used to know."" If I run into her, I'll share some kind words if I feel like it, but all that pain is in my past, all the ways we hurt each other don't matter anymore. I didn't have much respect for her, she was narrow minded and her situation would have limited my options in life.    

I'm going to change the world one day, but not if I was stuck in a relationship with the first girl I fell in love with. I was immature, I didn't know what I was doing, and I realize that now. I did not like the relationship, I liked being able to have sex and companionship without putting much effort in, and that isn't a relationship, or even healthy.    

So, I just wanted to say thank you, r/breakups, the advice, feedback, and kind words you have given me, as well as just having a place to vent, have truly put me on the path to becoming a better person. Even the criticism I have received from some of you has opened my eyes to how controlling and insecure I can be, and I'm thankful for your honesty and bluntness.    

No contact works, even though it hurts, as does working out, and hanging out with friends and family. Take the advice guys, and it will get you through it.    

A quote that someone else shared with me that hits home:    

""Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.""

-C.S. Lewis

She ended it bc she was getting ""complacent"" and wanted to be single and free again.  It was a bullshit excuse but I couldn't do anythign to change her mind.

Did the normal Reddit thing: delete number, delete Facebook (went a step fartehr and deactivated for a while), and NO CONTACT.

Fast forward to today. She sends me a random text asking how I am and like an idiot I answered and then we had about a 2 hour conversation about everything.  She told me how she has been hooking up with some guy for about 2 weeks and she says she is really happy.  Of course I am heart broken and eventually stop torturing myself and stopped answering.

Moral of the story....DON""T BREAK NO CONTACT.  DONT DONT DONT.  You will end up worse than before.  Listen to all these people because I thought I was the exception to the rule.  There are no exceptions.  You have to stay strong people because I feel like I am back at square one again and just wasted 3 really productive weeks.  Block her number if you have to.

I know i shouldn't beat myself up as much as i am right now, but fuck man I think this is exactly what she wanted.

I tried rekindling after, but she didn't want to.

 i broke up with her finally after being obsessively jealous over a more recent indiscretion i found out about that happened in october. it was during finals week right before winter vacation and i just couldn't take the jealousy anymore and had enough. afterwards, she became overly attention-seeking, calling 80+ times a day without leaving a single voicemail, texting incessantly with no replies etc. I was with family at this time, so it was easier with their support to ignore her and my feelings about the break-up. But since i've been back at school i've turned into complete shit. 

now: she is officially with another guy. we talked tonight and she said that she wants to finally let me go and has been seeing a guy (i saw them running together down the street a couple weeks ago. ow) and wants to 'do things right with him.' in a way, this is a good thing. it's supposed to be right? Won't this make it easier for me to get over her? ARGH I hate being subject to emotion. I have literally reasoned out every positive conclusion: that what we learned from each other was special and she was just not the one for me; that we both made each other happy when we were together, and i should remember how happy she made me and be glad i ever experienced that happiness in the first place; that she was the prettiest girl i'll [likely] ever be with and that i'm the fucking man for even getting with her in the first place, let alone have her be mine for almost 2 years. But there is SUCH an enormous difference between reaching conclusions and accepting them. 

My friend told me that what I'm feeling makes me human, but no one is not human just because they're not feeling something. 

I wonder how she got over me so fast. I had talked to her in january, not even a month after we broke up, and she had a hicky on her neck from the previous night. she either didn't realize or didn't cover it up, but it fucking killed me. I spent almost 2 years with this girl. I can't even think about touching someone else..when I do I get sick to the stomach. Is there something wrong with me?

I also officially have zero self-confidence. I don't know where it went but damn does it suck. I have done everything possible in order to try and socialize: going to concerts, blowing money on booze at bars and parties. There have been a number of opportunities to ask girls to dance or talk to someone, but i just can't anymore. I don't know where or how to start. 

I do wish her the best but i can't help but feel so hurt at the same time. It makes me so sad. The reason I broke up with her in the first place was because I was so jealously obsessed that I was literally going crazy. But do I really feel better now than I did when I was in that relationship? It's really really pathetic that I can't say that I do. It's not the same but just as deep a pain. 

I know that I am blessed with so many things in life, but right now, none of them can make me smile. = ( everyone keeps saying that time heals all, but time passes by so slowly. it's been 3 months and everyday has been a slightly different level of sadness: depression, loneliness, self-esteem issues. when will this ever end? thanks for reading or not, i guess i just wanted to type all that out

We ended the relationship and cancelled the wedding 15 months ago. We lived in another city two thousand kilometers from our friends and family. Unfortunately at the time of the breakup I couldn't afford to move back home. I spent a year living with no money saving as much as I could to get home. During this time I experienced some of the worst times of my life. The worst of which was when I was attacked and raped by another man. 

It took some time, but I healed from that and moved on as a better person. Just recently I landed a great job back in my home city and moved in with my parents. They were happy to have me back safely and things have been good. Recently though I started talking to the ex again. Things were going well and we agreed that it would be cool to try working things out. So tonight we organised to head out with a few friends for a catchup. I finished work after everyone and when I got to the bar she was there with another guy kissing him. She saw me arrive and came and kissed me on the lips and introduced me to a much older man who she said was a casual hook up of hers. I gritted my teeth and had a beer. A short while later she came and chatted to me privately and said she was open to us being together again. She said she was sorry I had to see all this and tried to make out with me. After we went back inside and she sat next to him again. I got up and pretended to go to the bar, but went outside to be alone. Then my friends came out and said my ex was heading home. She then came out and tried to kiss me again. I stepped back and told her she completely disgusted me and I left. Reddit, I'm done. For a long time she has fucked with my emotions because she knew I love her, but I'm done. I can't deal with that shit. She breaks my heart again and I am out.

1324508319.0,14,self.BreakUps,nlubn,"Heartbreak experience of a 31yo male, plus some notes and reflections 5 years on.",17,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/nlubn/heartbreak_experience_of_a_31yo_male_plus_some/,"I thought I'd write this up partly as a cathartic exercise for myself, and partly to help others in a similar situation. 

I first got together with Lisa when I was 22, and she was 19. We were both young, immature and living a lifestyle centred mostly on excess and partying. Both of us had emotional hangups of one sort or another, but we were also both intelligent, passionate and fiery. We hit it off pretty quickly.

Lisa and I were together for four-and-a-half years. The first two-and-a-half years were more eventful than many longer-lasting relationships. We went through a lot: pregnancy (just a few weeks after we first got together: she eventually decided to get an abortion, with my support). Cheating: After a year of being together, she slept with somebody else: I knew I'd probably been emotionally neglectful, but it still hurt me more profoundly than I ever expected it to. The experience shook me into life and pushed us back together still closer.

We could snap at each other and fall out at a moment's notice: frustratingly it always seemed to happen in public, with friends or family present. But at other times we could be a foil for each other that nobody else could rival: discuss, challenge and inspire each other to be better people. In particular, she encouraged me to take a step which seemed far-fetched at the time, and leave my partying lifestyle to go to university. When I found the perfect course in a beautiful, far-away town we leapt into the unknown and decided to make the move together.

The next few months were some of the most exciting of my life: we worked together planning the move, were deeply in love and seemed to be on the cusp of something special. There's no denying that some problems continued: we could still fall out with each other on a dime, but we were committed to each other and very serious. Nothing that happened afterwards will make me forget that time: it was special.

We moved to the new town, and things seemed good, at least on the surface. I was a few weeks into my course when Lisa arrived home to our flat on a day I'll never forget. She was nothing like her usual self: she'd put up an impenetrable barrier. She was unhappy and she wanted to leave. I couldn't get any more details. I couldn't make her talk or open up. I was so angry because of this, I was sobbing with her, begging her to talk. But she wouldn't. I think that she knew that if she did open up, she would be unable to leave me. And I knew that because she wouldn't open up, she was deadly serious. There was no doubting that the love of my life, the girl who had been the centre of my life for almost a quarter of my life was leaving me, for good.

For the first few weeks there was just numbness. I cried a bit on the first couple of days alone, then it dried up. I through myself into my uni work during the day, and got drunk every evening while I packed up our flat. I was angry with her and I tried to let it out, but it felt like I was trying in vain to interact with emotions far stronger than I was able to handle. I just kind of plodded on trying my best just to survive, just to keep going.

After 6 weeks, I couldn't cope with not knowing what was going on. On Christmas Day I succumbed to weakness and read Lisa's email. I discovered (no surprise of course) that she'd left me for some other guy. I completely lost it and broke down in front of my family. Then on the worst and longest train journey home ever, I was stranded in the middle of nowhere after hours of travelling. Again I just broke down on the platform, sobbing uncontrollably. I'd never felt so much emptiness or loneliness: it didn't so much feel that I'd lost a limb, as she'd taken 95% of who I was with her. Not just her but her family, who I loved very much and I knew I would never see again. I felt like almost nothing, the thinnest of shells of a personality, the only part she'd left behind. I knew it was going to take a long, long time to feel better again.

That was exactly five years ago.

The fact that I'm writing this tells me that I haven't completely moved on, but I want to note the positive parts, and make a few field notes.

The first 0-6 months of a breakup like this are pure survival. I had to just go into auto-pilot and do my best to ignore a lot of the emotions: they were just far too strong to ""deal with"". 

I remember trying to go to bed with another girl 3-4 months after the breakup. I was kidding myself that I was starting to feel better. Oh dear.. what a disaster. that was a wake-up call to give myself more time.

After 6-8 months the edge came off a bit, and the daily pain, while still considerable, noticeably decreased. 

It helped so much to have my university course to focus on. This is the biggest advice I would give to anybody in this situation. **Give yourself something huge and extraordinary to achieve**. It should be extremely challenging and expected to take at least a year. Travel, study, write a novel, learn to program, just do something amazing. This is a great survival mechanism. I don't know where I'd be without it.

After less than a year I had a fling and the best sex of my life with a great girl. It was a lovely experience. but it was still far too soon and I couldn't develop it into a relationship. That hurt a lot at the time.

It took a full 2.5-3 years for me to stop missing Lisa every single day. The pain was like waves, at first it completely overwhelmed me but slowly and almost imperceptably the waves decreased in frequency and intensity. 

2-3 years however is a long time.

Finally, after 3 years I started genuinely enjoying being single and celebrating it. It felt absolutely amazing. I loved being with myself every single day. I celebrated the fact that Lisa had left me, and felt joy again. At this time I started seeing another girl, but I was so much enjoying being single that I did everything I could to avoid it becoming a relationship.

After another year, this girl got tired of waiting for me and broke up with me. Ironically I was heart-broken again, and I still am to a great extent. But the reality was that even after 3-4 years of healing, I still wasn't emotionally ready for another relationship. I do hope I meet another amazing girl with whom I click to the same degree soon. I think that now, I'm finally ready to throw myself back into love.

I do look back on where I was 10 years ago and compare it where I am now. I'm now 31, have a great job and my own company, a degree and a good life. I owe some of that success to Lisa, however much she broke my heart in the process. I hope she's doing ok, whatever she's doing with herself.

I knew the second I saw her that we were meant to be. My stormcloud, my snow white, I am so sorry.

I'm not sure why this is--why there aren't more older people who post--though I have an idea.  It's what they say: you never forget your first love.  Now why is that said?  Is it  because so many spend their lives with their first loves?  Of course it's not.  We say we never forget because we lose them.  

And the older people know.  It never hurts less.  At each age it brings different questions.  But at each age we know we can survive.

You see?  Everyone is like you.  Everyone has had his/her heart broken.  It is as much a part of life as puberty.  If anything, maybe it marks the end of puberty, the first step into the sorrow and wisdom that is adulthood.

I've been thinking about this lately because I've been reading an author I'm going to recommend to you.  His name is [Jonathan Tropper](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_12?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=jonathan+tropper&amp;sprefix=jonathan+tro).  Start with the book right there on top--[The Book of Joe](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Joe-Novel-Jonathan-Tropper/dp/0385338104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322966851&amp;sr=8-1).  Then most likely you'll want to read them all.

It's possible that his main characters are too old for you.  Most are in their late 20s or early/mid 30s.  But all of them, *all* of them, have had their hearts broken.  And all of them, astonishingly realistically, are trying to rebuild.

Here's something he wrote in his novel [This is Where I Leave You](http://www.amazon.com/This-Where-Leave-You-Novel/dp/0452296366/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322966851&amp;sr=8-8):

*Sometimes, contentment is a matter of will.  You have to look at what you have right in front of you, at what it could be, and stop measuring it against what you've lost.  I know this to be wise and true, just as I know that pretty much no one can do it.*

Essentially, you have a choice in life.  It's a choice that all of us have faced and decided.  When your heart is broken, you either continue as best as you can, or you give up and end your life.  Many have given up.  Suicides are far too common.

But one thing is true: no matter what you do, at some point in your future you will die.  And you will be dead forever.  You only ever will get this one chance to experience life.

And, given that truth, if you choose to force it now, you prevent yourself ever from the possibility of knowing joy again.  Ever from the possibility of knowing love again.  And you verify what your lost love has told you: *that you were not worth it*.

On the other hand, if you persevere, if you try just to get through this day, and then the next, and then the next.  If each day you try to find one good thing you can do that won't hurt anyone else and will bring you joy.  In time you will find that while you may not have filled that hole in your heart, which once was bursting with love and hope and, really, innocence, you will have healed it.  You will have let time do its work.  

And you will be ready to love again.

We were dating for 5 yrs and had lived together for 2.

I am 24m she 23F.

Last two weeks we haven't seen each other a lot (she lives on an appartement with a friend) because she always had an excuse.

This week she just told me that she wants a break telling me she isn't sure I am the one for her. She knows she loves me but she just doesn't know if that is enough for her to be happy.

She was feeling very depressed lately and the doctors said that there was nothing wrong so she knew it had to be our relationship.

That night she met a guy going out with her friends and exchanged phone numbers. This happened at the start of the two week period I almost never saw her. They started texting each other, met up one night and she said she just kissed him once.

First she started by saying our relationship was fun for a while, but not for longterm. Asking me some time to reflect and find out if it really is more for her then just fun. That she doesn't want to blind for her own luck anymore.

Then she said she was doing it for me as well, saying I should get back what I give and some recognition for what I do. She couldn't do that and she wanted to find out why not.

Then I called her and asked if there was something I should know, because this was strange. In two weeks time our dreamrelationship just went to no relationship at all without a lot of explanation.
That's when she told me what happened.

I spend the night there telling her I would find a place for all this and still love her. I mean, I was litterly thinking of having babys with this girl.

She told me I need to give her some time alone to think. That she really hoped we could be together again, but only when she is sure it would be for good. She needed to be alone. So we had a semi-nice night together with a hearthbreaking goodbye in the morning.

Now two days later she texts me that she is still texting with the guy she cheated on me with and that she might see him again.
I'm all angry like wtf are you doing? This is breaking my heart, you wanted me to leave you alone and now your saying there is a chance you are going to see him again? And why are you texting him if he was a way of showing you and me that there was something wrong?

I don't know what to do.

I want to give her time to reflect but it just feels like giving up and 
that I am losing it all.

I feel so alone, sad and imsocold.

I can't stop hurting.,15,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/jbxa8/my_wife_of_45_years_left_me_the_day_i_returned/,"(I'm sorry it's very long winded, I just needed a place to write it all down... To meet the rules - I'm 25, she is 23. We have known each other since we were 15/13 respectively. While we did not officially get together until we were 19/18, we always knew we would be, and were always extremely close and ""in love"".)

The first sign was 2 weeks previous, when I told her I was struggling there with the social isolation leveled upon me by my working hours. I wasn’t sleeping well, and I was having increasingly aggressive mood swings. It was so bad that at one point, two soldiers were walking slow in front of me on the sidewalk and it took all I had to refrain from screaming “FUCKING MOVE” at them. I sent her an e-mail telling her I wanted to come home, that I had a new company lined up and that I missed her. I told her I was struggling terribly with the social isolation, that it was making me crazy and depressed.

I expected a warm, supporting e-mail in response. What I received was her telling me she didn’t really want me to come back, because she was enjoying how things were with me not around. That’s about the most hurtful thing you can say to someone that cares about you. I read this e-mail at work, and very luckily the base was attacked a couple minutes prior, so I was sent to check on some people in time to get me out of the building before I broke down. I called her immediately, and we talked and talked, and through it all it came out that while she was having more fun with me not around, that wasn’t something that had to change with me home. She told me she knew we could work our issues out, and it would all be fixed. I was happy for the next 2 weeks.

The second I walked into the house I knew something was wrong, terribly wrong. She was distant, cold. We started talking. She wanted it to be over. She was no longer in love with me, no longer found me attractive. I guess it’s important to say I have always been, by far, the dominant personality in this relationship. Not at this moment. I have never felt more pathetic. I begged and begged. I assumed, naturally, that there was someone else (Note: There wasn’t someone else. While this is my, and everyone elses, natural inclination, there just wasn’t. And to be honest, I -WISH- there was someone else. At least that’s understandable. That’s a lot less personal rejection..) There wasn’t. She just was unhappy, and wanted out. The next morning I woke up and cooked breakfast, something I had never even done before, trying to show her things could change. Looking back on it now I feel so low and pathetic for doing it, but I was desperate. She didn’t touch the food.

She agreed to go to counseling, so 4 days after I got home, we met with a therapist. The therapist did a great job of getting a lot out there. My wife felt that I had always overshadowed her and always would. I make roughly 12x the income that she does, so naturally my career has taken priority. She said we had grown apart because I’ve been gone as much as I’ve been home. She said, in social settings, she felt that I was so much funnier and more social that she couldn’t be anything but a background object. She felt that I was so much smarter that she couldn’t be an equal. This hurt. I didn’t know what to do. But by the end of the meeting, through tears from both of us, I actually saw progress being made. I was fucking ELATED. I knew I was right about counseling, I knew I was going to be able to get my marriage back and to stay with the person I loved.

I was wrong. Later that night, we were in the living room, and I started trying to talk about how well the counseling had went, how happy I was that we were going to be able to fix things. She was once again distant, and that’s the moment I knew it was over. I was emotionally drained. We talked, she said she didn't really want to fix things, I got upset, and I left. I hadn’t even unpacked my bags, so I just grabbed them, got in my car and left. That night was 4 months ago.
A week after that night I went to Vegas with a friend. Half the time I couldn’t even eat. I had an emotional breakdown at training for my new company about 2 weeks after that night. I’ve had terrible ups and downs in between, from days where I can not stop thinking about her, to times where I’m fine, life is grand. I’m back in Iraq now, which is good for distraction. I dated a girl during the last 3 months of my time home, and while it distracted me at first, I knew the pain was always still there, I was just avoiding it. 

There’s been some... drama? wherein she’s still on my car insurance because the divorce isn’t finalized, and I don’t need to get nailed with a lawsuit because she got in an accident without insurance. She can barely make ends meet between her apartment and other periodic bills, and can’t afford car insurance on top of that. When I would contact her to see what was going on with her car insurance, she would ignore texts for 3-4 days at a time, until I would call her work (nothing crazy, just a “hey, stop ignoring my texts”.. this always worked). She was frustrated because she couldn’t pay the bills. While I’m sympathetic because I still care deeply about her, I won’t pay her bills.

I called her just now to try to figure out how close to finalized the divorce is, and to find out what is going on with her insurance, because I hadn’t contacted her since I left the USA 14 days ago. Hearing her voice was too much for me. I got off the phone before I teared up. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why this won’t heal. I don’t know how to get over this. The only person I loved in this entire world decided I was no longer important enough to be with, not even worth trying to repair what we had. I have no idea how to recover. I dream about her a couple times a week. Once, it was her walking away. I tried to convince her to come back, and finally she did... then she decided to leave anyways. I kept calling to her as she walked away, but she never even looked back.

I'll try to keep the story brief.

Senior year of college, I began dating Andrea. She's the most incredible girl I've ever met (my Derpina, if you will). We saw each other every day for our last 6 months of school, sacrificing sleep, friends, food, etc. to squeeze out every minute in her presence I could.

We graduated in summer 2009 and then traveled together that summer. But when the fall came, I had one more quarter of school and she had decided before we'd met that she wanted to move to Mozambique to volunteer after school. I obviously supported her decision and rearranged my life in any way I could to make distance work (waking up at 3am for a little skype time, letters, gifts, etc.) But I realized it wouldn't last unless we were together. So I decided to move to Mozambique in January 2010.

As soon as I got there things were off. She was short and cold with me and we fought a lot, a real rarity for us. I'd heard rumors from her friends, but dismissed them as impossible. Then one night, when she was out until 5am but I stayed home, I saw an unlabeled book on my pillow as I went to bed. I opened it and saw it was her diary. I closed it because I didn't want to snoop, but not before I noticed the words ""five-night stand."" My heart sank. She'd been having an affair with some guy named Allen.

I promptly packed up my things and flew back to the US a couple days later, head down and broke as a joke.

Fast forward a year, the toughest one of my life. I didn't speak with her for the entire time, but finally emailed her 6 months ago to forgive her and get it all off my chest. To my surprise, she was incredibly contrite and remorseful and it seemed as though there could even be a budding romance because she was moving to my city soon. Though at first really excited at the possibility, I began to worry more whether things would be different this time and whether she would be willing to do what she had to do to earn my trust back. Long story short, we weren't romantically involved for the first three months she was in town. I saw other girls, but each time, I would end up comparing them to Andrea and found them woefully lacking. Andrea was the one I thought about when I went to sleep. I couldn't be with other girls when I only thought of her.

So I spilled my guts to her a week ago. She cried and told me she'd had the same feelings, that she still loved me. I was honest that I didn't know exactly what to do and that I'd need her to rebuild trust, but it felt so great to share that love again with her. We spent the last week chatting, sending notes, links, just like old times. I was so excited.

I went to her house last night and towards the end of the night I asked her straight up if she'd given any more thought to what we'd talked about last week. After I told her again how much I still cared for her, she was much, much colder this time. She said she didn't think there was anything we could do, that she didn't think she was willing to do what would be necessary to earn back my trust. I quietly took my leave and rode home listening to whatever sad song I could find. She called an hour ago. She told me she had to be honest with me, that she'd be seeing someone. With him since March. My heart sank again. It felt like Mozambique all over again.

I'm heartbroken. Over Africa. Over the year spent trying to get over her. Over letting myself fall back in love with her. Over getting trampled on again. Over loving her and not being able to have her. Over loving her and not getting her love back.

While I was on the phone with him I wanted to bad to tell him to stop telling me about anything that had to do with her, but I couldn't tell him to stop. I felt like I was waiting for him to tell me that her and the new guy that she left me for were no longer together or something along those lines. I was under the impression my ex deleted all of our mutual friends since she deleted family members, and a couple friends of mine. However she must have missed this guy.

My good buddy is still friends with her on facebook and was able to see all of her info and stuff. He basically told me that she pretty much didn't have any pictures of me, or of me and her up anymore, which I was expecting. I figured that much. I guess the thing that got to me the most, was that she has herself listed as in a relationship with the guy she left me for, and that struck a nerve. I knew she left me for someone, however I was just assuming it. I had no actual evidence and this was a blow to my ego. 

This whole time I was kinda hoping that she would realize she misses me, or that she messed up, or that she didn't really like this guy and come back to me like she always has in the past. In times past, (3 times) she has left me for a guy only or a short period of time, then would come back to me. This time however it is different. Something must have clicked for the two of them and they have been going strong now for 3 months. So it looks like this might be one of those rebound relationships that blossom into a beautiful marriage and blah blah blah. FUCK I hate this shit and wish she would have been faithful to me and just loved me for me.

It is so disappointing to know that she basically wasted my time, especially this last time around. Why the hell did she ever even try to get back with me if she was ever going to leave again. Why would she put me and us through the whole ""getting trust back"" stages if she was just going to leave again. I feel like I have taken about 4 steps back in the recovery process and want to call her sooooo bad and express my love for her and tell her how much she means to me. I don't know why but I wanted to marry this girl if she could just get her shit together, and stay committed. Aside from her leaving on a ""whim"" we had a normal relationship. Where we were best friends, and so comfortable around each other.

I have my fair share of friends, sure. And some of them are quite close. But no one came even remotely close to the chemistry and connection my ex and I had. We became (fast) best friends as soon as we started hanging out, and if she did not have a boyfriend at the time I am certain that we would have started dating almost immediately.


But we didn't, and we continued to let our friendship grow. She became one of my closest friends; someone I not only felt comfortable being my confidant and a confidant to (which several of my friends are), but someone I just felt comfortable around. Spending hours upon hours with her was an easy task, something that is not so easy to do with ANY of my other friends, even my other very close friends. 



Even my best friend now (a guy this time) doesn't have the ""best friend"" connection that her and I did. And more and more I keep thinking not of the times we were dating, but of the times when our friendship was cultivating. How even before I had feelings for her, I just felt very comfortable around her as a person, as a good friend. I look back on those times and think ""oh my god, did I have feelings for her then too?"" Just because of how incredibly easy it was to talk to her for hours on end. 



Nobody I have met before or since have I felt that way about. And I'm getting very afraid that I will not meet that person. I just want that close of a friend again, even regardless of any kind of romantic intentions. I miss my best friend. It's been many months since the break up and I know that she is/has gotten over me as a romantic partner, and since I can't exactly be her friend without unrequited feelings popping up I have pushed her out of my life. And I am sure sooner or later she is going to get over me as her best friend, or even friend, as well. I want to get over her, I need to get over her for my own sake and sanity, but more and more I am thinking how difficult it would be to find that person.

Memories can’t be erased. Forced to face each day with the same dull ache. Fake a smile and act like everything is just fine. Isn’t it easier to just show how you really feel? Like for instance, cry when you want to without feeling ashamed and fight the urge to hide the tears. Be able to tell that one person whom you love and hate, that he has hurt you beyond repair and even though he has mistreated you and lied and cheated you still love him. How you hate yourself for being so weak to still be his good friend even after all he has done, how your happiness still depends on whether he talks to you or not and the fact that you apologize for things HE should be apologizing for. 
How did it come to this? Where were those high standards you set for yourself when you were still schooling? There was a time where you swore that the second a boy would say something mean or flirt with someone else, you would drop him and move on. What happened to that girl who was brimming with pride and confidence? It seems to be another lifetime ago. Now all that’s left is a broken woman without the strength to move on and who still clings on to the man who has no value or feelings towards her. 
Why can’t you move on? Is it the fact that you see him every day? Can love be so cruel to make you believe that there is still hope in something so toxic? 
Endless questions. No matter how many times you promise yourself each night, that because you deserve you won’t look at him even, the next day the minute you see him you are back to being his best friend. You know all his faults, you know all what he has said and done to you but you can’t escape him. You are trapped for every second, every minute, every hour of each day.

My relationship was a prison. I don't mean all relationships are, but mine was. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship, I was verbally assaulted constantly. I was not allowed to concern myself with problems that weren't my fault. I was not allowed to go out alone without my ex, but she was allowed to go wherever she wanted. I was not allowed to ask for sex, but I had to be ready whenever she wanted it.

I was constantly depressed. Being free and happy has made it very clear that I was very depressed in my relationship. I gained a lot of weight, had little motivation, and cared very little for anything except making my SO happy. Focusing on me has made me very happy, much leaner (45lbs down), and very motivated. I also now have a persona and identity, before I was whatever my ex wanted me to be. I have become my own person, still with some work to do but, I have my own feelings and personality.

I have some great friends and some not-so-great friends. Immediately after the breakup, I had to start filtering out some of my friends. some of my friends had wives that would pressure them into talking to me about my ex. I've had to lose a few after they would not stop doing this. When my ex was having a rough time in a new relationship, or whatever, I would hear about it and how I need to go back to her. On the other hand, I had friends that quit contacting her, stood by my side every time I needed support, and were always helping me keep my head on straight.

I have some things I need to work on. I'm particularly sheepish in social situations and i'm working on it. I try to take the lead, stand out in front of the group, and speak up more often. I used to not be this way, but my social situations and friends were controlled by my SO. I also have a tendency to not want to try new things, I made a goal to do at least one new thing each week. So far, I've started doing bi-nightly walks on the boardwalk, I've tried 10 new restaurants, started doing monthly exercise routines, and I went down to the city to do a pub crawl. 

I'm the one that matters now. It doesn't matter what was done to me in the past, it just matters what I do for the future now. I'm worried about me and what I want/need to do. I'm finally able to own my geekiness and gamer lifestyle.

That's all I can think of for now. Thanks /r/BreakUps!

This sub is good for the first few weeks or months, but after a time it will stop helping you. There's only so many uplifting stories and self help articles you can read before you eventually need to start *doing*. You need to start forgetting and getting over your ex, but being constantly reminded of them, through facebook or friends or reddit (this sub) is counter productive. 

Block them on facebook, block their friends too, hide posts from mutual friends that you know will mention them/tag them in pictures. Delete their number and their friends numbers, delete your call logs. Delete the pictures of them you have on your phone or your computer (or if you're a nostalgic fucker like me, lock them away in a folder you won't actively search for, like cloud sharing or at your parents house). Lastly, unsubscribe from this subreddit and other self-help reddits (/r/depression, /r/relationships etc). Stop yourself from being reminded of them. Seeing other peoples relationships, happy or sad, will just make you draw parallels and remember them.

I honestly think that our relationship outgrew us. Or maybe it was that we outgrew the relationship. I'm not trying to say that we're meant to be together or anything like that. Our lives are getting ready to head in totally different directions; that would be foolish. But I can look back at our time and smile at something funny we did, or the great times we had. I think that's a good thing. I'm not upset or angry, I'm just happy that you were there during a time when I needed someone, and we did have a lot of fun.
I guess I just wanted to let you know that you're on my mind. Never really left. I understand and agree with the reasons of why it had to end. I'm okay with you moving on, too. I'm not bitter about it; I knew you wouldn't stay single long.
I'm not saying that we'll ever go back to being those people again, or that there's any hope for that relationship. But maybe someday, for a brand new one, if we could ever let go of the past.

It is worse when you realize that you made a mistake. 

There is no going back now. But today is that day today. Where on a bus I shook uncontrollably from tears, where my soul collapsed in on me and my mind stopped being strong. Where I realized how much I wish I was at his feet, and that every moment I am not, I want to be more and more. 

I remember the time I looked into his eyes, and had a thousand words to say to him, and I knew that there was no need, he could see it in my eyes, that as I spun deep into subspace, he was the only thing in my world and I was the only thing in his. 

I don't believe you can fall so fast. But now I am falling and I pushed away the only person who can catch me. I can never ever express in real life all these stupid words, but I can place them on the internet, so everyone can see my heart is breaking, and in some cathartic way; someone out there will read the pain.

Sadness, Anger, helplessness, empty.  I still feel like something is missing like that old comfort with her. I lost my best friend the woman I wanted to marry and have children with. I was completely devastated over this. This was the one relationship in my life that I was able to tell her everything and completely open up to. 

She called it off because she believes we where not bringing the best out of each other in the relationship. So I did everything under the sun to try and get her back, Basically I promised empty promises and just about groveled at her feet. We started the no contact.
Little back round on myself I am the person that wants to help everyone, always being that person to smile at anyone and always smiling. I give money to people if they need money. I help random people, I see a car broken down on the side of the road I would be that person to help you out. All for the cause of everything in the world is connected you show someone kindness and they will show a random person kindness and it keeps going and when it comes full circle back to me. 

Now for the the key point that helped me out.

I re read all of the texts I sent to her, I saw everything I did just to get her back to feel something again with her, then I saw everything that I did for her for them, I realized that the person that tried to get her back was not me. Was not the man I want to be. I fought myself over and over and over. So I told myself , that man is not me nor do I want to be him again. I said all of my best qualities over and over out loud. Then last night after I got home from the gym, I shaved for the first time since march 16th the day of the break up. I feel great, I feel on top of the world, I will be that person I want to be!  Since my last post  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1biyt9/to_everyone_going_through_a_break_up/  ) I have helped quite a few people, they are on the same track I am and getting better. 

The key to help out is you need to find that person you where/are before the break up, heck before you guys/gals met. Once you find that person again you will be able to build and shape that person you want to be. 

Now for me I have a long road but I have everything planned out, First I want to feel right in my own body, So what I have been doing is on my birthday ( march 24th ) that passed I joined a gym. I pushed myself working out crazy, then I felt that I was doing the same thing over and over in the gym so I met with a personal trainer, they gave me a path I need to follow, ( payed some monies ) and I now meet with a personal trainer 2 days out of the week. Now I have a long ( LONG ) path to go because of how big I am ( 6'2"" 348lbs ) to reach my goal weight of 220lbs. I have before pictures and will let people see after I get close to my goal and see the changes.

After graduating from college in June 2011, I moved to San Francisco for a job and a girl. Two months later, in the span of a week, I lost both. To save you the melodramatic hyperboles, I’ll just say this: it sucked.

The good news is that—besides a couple instances of literally crying home to mommy—I pulled my shit together and followed through on my dream of starting a company.

A couple weeks into my newfound self-employment, I was enjoying all the benefits. The freedom to wake up whenever I wanted. Freedom to work on cool projects with amazing people. Freedom to watch Bizkit the Sleep Walking Dog seven times in a row. It was amazing.

But that freedom brought downsides.

I started to notice a few bad habits forming. The most prominent was constantly checking my ex-girlfriend’s Facebook when I should have been working. Scrolling through pictures of us together, subconsciously comparing myself to new guys she had friended (pshh, this douche bag went to Sonoma State), and dwelling on the fact that I missed her.

One day, while browsing her Facebook for the 3rd time instead of working, thinking “well maybe there’s a chance we’ll get back together…” I woke up. Alright dude, enough is enough. Time to snap out of this.

So I made a simple resolve: unsubscribe from her Newsfeed. Don’t check her Facebook for a month.

And I did. And to the surprise of my oh-so-broken-heart, it wasn’t actually that hard. Looking back on it now, it was a huge step that helped me get over my first heartbreak.

If I’m being honest, I still look at my ex-girlfriend’s Facebook. However, this random experiment crystallized a truth I had known theoretically but had never witnessed so clearly:

I can change my habits.

And that little thought planted a seed which grew into a Sequoia-sized Venus flytrap. It would become the most ambitious undertaking in my life to date. It’s why I found myself with 10 of my closest friends at Benihana’s skipping over the hibachi steak and ordering fried tofu. It’s why I found myself renting a sailboat to sail underneath the Bay Bridge en route to a Berkeley football game. It’s why I found myself, at 9am on a Sunday, hungover and anointing my forehead with holy water at the entrance of a Catholic church...

**TL;DR: Stop checking her Facebook. Or at least Unsubscribe. Seriously!**

I sent her a friendly text message saying hi. No begging to get back in touch with me. No admission of how deeply, painfully sad I feel. Just 
&gt;""Hey, hope you're doing well. It's been a while."" 

She took a few days to text back, and when she did she was receptive and friendly. She went so far as to admit how hard it has been to do anything that doesn't remind her of me, and that she misses me often. That was elating, it was euphoric. And I couldn't hold myself back from continuing. We've been talking for the last three days via text, constantly. Nothing too deep; just reminiscing about the past, talking about things we've missed the chance to discuss together (we're very, *very* similar in almost every single interest and hobby). But as it's going on, I am finding it harder and harder not to ruin this by admitting how I really feel. I'm scared to do it. And it's making me feel even worse.

I understand this was a bad idea. I understand that there's only an idiot's hope that anything beneficial for my emotions will come out of this. Every minute I'm not hearing from her is torture because I'm too scared to ask what's really going on. I don't even know if she's been seeing someone or not. 

This is teetering too close to a wall of text, I know. I have nowhere else to really get this out though.  I can't look at this with any kind of positive outlook... I don't see anything good coming from how this whole exchange between will inevitably lead to. I'm already more of a mess than I ever was before.

Ok Reddit, I have been dating this guy for over 6 months. At first I was very cautious trying to keep it slow, just a few dates here, kissing there, really enjoying the experience. Then he said those big words 'I love you' I was practically shaking when he looked into my eyes. And I knew, I loved him! I finally felt like myself, like my nerdy 15 yr old self was alive again and I was no longer afraid. We'd stay up and talk, go out or stay in bed all afternoon. Sure we had our days apart but he flooded my phone with texts of thoughts, of sweet nothings. He would talk about us moving in together, and how comfortable he felt around me. He would constantly look at me and when I'd ask what he was looking at he would say 'Just you, I am just amazed you're with me.' and one REALLY big thing he did was, he would play with my rings on my finger and carefully take them off and back on, again when I asked what he was doing, his response: I am practicing. And then he'd give me the biggest grin in the world.

Fast forward to now. I recently had a friend die in a terrible accident and really needed someone there for me (as much as i denied that i did) and my boyfriend kept pressing “it is ok you need to be vulnerable around me, you need to let me comfort and take care of you” amazing! awesome! everything my little girl heart wanted to hear!!! 
Two days later? He's telling me 'its just not working out' and the ONLY thing I can think of is our small spat over video games. 

Here's the thing: We made plans one night, the same night he made plans to play online with his buddies. And instead of TELLING ME the mistake he made, he hid it until late at night. We were getting physical and I really needed some good sex to cheer me up. Right in the middle of sexy time, he checks his phone and goes 'oh its late I need to get online' and I laugh and go 'Oh do I need to leave?' and looks at me his face red with embarrassment 'Do you mind?'.....

Of course I mind!!! So we got into it, i told him how horrible that made me felt and that if he cannot make me a priority then maybe he needs to reevaluate what he wants in a partner. Then he shuts down, just goes 'well thats who I am, sorry I made you feel that way but what can I do?' He REFUSES to apologize. Until finally I talk him off the cliff and he goes 'lets just go to sleep' and doesn't get online and holds me all night. 

But for the next three days he doesn't text, call, nothing. So finally I give in and text him 'do I need to come get my stuff?' his response?
'Yea'

My heart is broken. I got my things, and the person that I saw wasn't him, it was a ghost. He kept repeating 'It was just too much for me' and 'I don't want to talk about it right now' and I just kept asking 'What did I not give you? What was too much? Why can we not work it out' 

You have to understand Reddit, I have been through a fair amount of relationships, hard ones, stupid ones, passionate ones. But I have always tried to work it out in the end, to at least hear someone out. So to have someone just suddenly break up with me and give me vague answers angers me as well as breaks me. 

So now I am just a mess, sure all my friends have said 'He doesn't deserve you, he chose you over a video game' and although my brain agrees with it, my heart still hurts. All I keep thinking is 'Who is going to watch Star Trek with me?' I felt like I really found a great friend, and a great partner, someone that made me feel normal when all my life I have been teased by my hobbies and other quirks. I tried my hardest, to be honest, not clingy, and clear as possible with my expectations and emotions. Not only that, but I feel as if I was led on by him, that maybe he didn't control his emotions and didn't realize what he was getting himself into. I just feel betrayed, angry but worst of all ashamed. I am ashamed I gave so much and really allowed myself to be myself, and in the end still got hurt. 

Please Reddit, will it get any better? Is there someone out there that will still watch Star Trek with me? Thank you for any feed back or words of kindness/encouragement

Four months ago you said you needed your space. You told me you needed to figure out who you were alone. I cried over you, I thought that I loved you and that you were the only one who could make me as happy as I felt at the time. Four months away from you and I realize now it wasn't love. You were my first real girlfriend and the first girl I let myself be myself around. That's why it was so difficult for me at first.

I found out you were talking to your ex again and you lied to me telling me you were just friends, that you no longer loved each other. I found out that you're all depressed because ""you're in love with him and he wants nothing to do with you"". I can't tell you how happy that makes me. I told you that you'd be miserable without me, whether or not I meant that involved actually being with me or not. I treated you so well. I put up with all of your promiscuous ways, even when you claimed you were just a nice, outgoing person. I did everything you wanted me to do for you and what did I get in return?

I mean what I said three months ago, the last thing I said to you before blocking all communications with you. I still mean every harsh word of it. I told that girl from 8 years ago all about how I felt, you helped me realize something when you hurt me. It went well, better than I'd expect it to go, and I regret that I wasted almost a year with you when it could have been with her.

In fact, I regret ever knowing you. I've had three months to let my anger resolve and I still feel the same way I did when I was at my angriest. You told me I was clingy, that I kept you from doing things, hanging out with your friends. Three months later and you still stay in almost every night playing games rather than having a social life. That's a fucking joke. I held you back? I'm nowhere around you and you do the exact same shit you did when we dated. I wasn't holding you back from anything I was the only thing that made you happy.

I know you're depressed, and again that makes me happy. Throughout our entire relationship no matter how much you would hurt me I would never retaliate. I always swallowed my pride and tried to talk things out. Now I can say any bad thing that happens to you, you deserve it. All that sadness and loneliness you feel, you deserve it. You are a terrible person, not only because of what you did to me but because of other things I won't mention on here. You deserve nothing but the worst from everyone you encounter. I hate you and I was a fool to ever thing I could change such an emotionally separated bitch.

For those of you in a fresh break up, it gets better. I've spent two months doing things that have made me happy now, after a month of feeling sorry for myself.

1361667887.0,13,self.BreakUps,193wvq,I (24) broke up - more or less! - with my long distance gf (22) 6 months ago. At Christmas she cut off all contact. Suddenly feeling the pain and regret.,16,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/193wvq/i_24_broke_up_more_or_less_with_my_long_distance/,"Well... that's it! From one English speaking side of the world to another, I met a girl on a study abroad and immediately fell in love. So many tears when I had to go home some months later, but soon after I returned we agreed a long distance thing. We eventually worked out that we could still 'do stuff' with other people... and by the end it was a little ambiguous as to how we'd describe our 'relationship' - but with the idea that, when education etc was over we'd somehow find a way to be in the same country to get together. We visited a couple of times a year, and our last pre-breakup visit was actually the best, vacationing with her family. I loved it. When she next visited however, we ended up officially breaking up.

In all honesty by this point the relationship had become fairly one-sided, with her seeming far more interested in me than I in her. For some background, we've both suffered from quite serious depression, and she unfortunately ended up suffering with that and some other vague addiction problems... I'm not really sure how that affected things exactly, but obviously it didn't help! But when she visited we always had fun - or actually, and what I suppose shows how 'real' our relationship was - though I didn't realise it at the time - was just how 'settled' that fun was. We didn't feel the need to go out and have loads of exciting events on. We just stayed in and watched tv together, watched our favourite shows together, learned random facts together, made up silly games with our cuddly toys together. I'd get annoyed with certain things about her - sometimes a bit obnoxious with her political views, I don't think I cared much for her friends, and I sometimes imagined some of her habits were a little gross - but thinking back none of them were really too serious. I think a lot of it was my super-high expectations combined with my depression getting in the way of things. I don't know.

But anyway all this ended up getting to me and, after a lot of balling and crying, we more or less agreed to break up during her last visit... although just before she left we decided we might try after all... but we didn't talk all that much online afterwards, and a month or so later she skyped me and broke up with me properly... in a way I was relieved - I'd had so many doubts about how things would possibly work - I'd feel too guilty moving as I'm an only child and have very clingy and easily upset parents, plus a bunch of other stuff - but obviously also not great. Also I'm ashamed to say I'd been sort of getting together with another girl... this was actually totally 'allowed' by our relationship contract - she was doing some guys as well too - but, as the relationship looked semi-doomed, I did have it in my mind that maybe things could get more serious with this other girl if that officially failed.

Anyway, I stayed chatting to the ex on skype... still fairly close, and a month or so in she  said she still loved me, and we talked about how hard that was. Some months later, around Christmas, I noticed we hadn't really spoken in a couple of weeks - I'd been busy and away - and sent her a quick message asking how she was. Her reply broke me to pieces: she wished me the best, but said she'd found someone else - who wasn't terrible and didn't treat her badly etc - and didn't see where I fit into her life now, and that we shouldn't speak. I replied saying how sorry I was for any time I'd hurt her and I hoped we could still be friends, but no reply. I tried to respect her feelings and just leave it at that. But God.  I lost my virginity to this girl, I shared so much with her, and, whilst a lot of passion had gone on my end by the end, we were just so comfortable with one another... I didn't realise just how comfortable and constant our chat, even if 'just' through text and skype, really was... until it dried up for good.

I've tried to block a lot of that out since then. I'm actually still vaguely seeing this other girl, although who knows what will happen there. But I'm really not over what happened with my ex. The problem is: Is it that I'm just not over losing her friendship, and am devastated at being totally cut out her life? Or am I actually not over her as a girlfriend? Or perhaps in some ways over her in as much that seeing it possibly wasn't for the best, but just not over the loss of the relationship? Our relationship status was so fuzzy towards the end, as was the beginnings of my thing with the new girl, so I suppose I haven't really had a proper time to grieve for the relationship and figure things out.

I'm so scared that I've lost what was possibly my perfect partner for good - maybe I should have moved? Maybe I still could - I'm not certain she really has found a new partner and isn't just saying so as a way to move on and deal with the pain of the loss from her end, and even if she has it doesn't mean she doesn't love me deep down... - but is this a terrible way to think? Maybe the relationship ending is for the best, but I'm still being unfair on my current partner given I'm having lingering thoughts over the ex? But then maybe the only reason my thoughts are turning towards the ex is because I'm analysing the current situation with the same bias I probably showed my ex... i.e. I'm focusing on all the negatives and looking to a golden past that possibly never existed... the same thing that probably helped destroy my last two relationships... so maybe I'm in danger of throwing a good thing down the drain here worrying over a lost cause.

Anyway I was a bit of an idiot and sent her an email earlier, I don't know why... it just all came flooding back yesterday, I really do feel devastated.. anyway it wasn't too psycho I hope, just explaining how I recognise I didn't appreciate a lot of the good stuff during our relationship and how sorry I was. I made it clear I wasn't trying to win her back against her will or whatever... just that we were maybe both a little stronger now, and that it wouldn't hurt for us to at least talk... we really do have so much in common - and not just the bad stuff like depression! although of course that was a comfort knowing somebody understood what you were going through. I doubt she'll read it, but I pray to God she does and at some point agrees to just talk. Maybe we're not right for each other, but the idea that decades could pass - that one of us could die - without us ever talking again, with this girl I shared so much of my life with... freaks me out and genuinely scares me so much.

I'm really sorry that this has turned into a bit of a rant, and I suppose I have no direct questions. But if you have any advice, have been in a similar situation, or just feel you can help... please do

I'm still learning as I go on and would like to share the process of getting through it. Like everyone here, I fell for someone, I fell for them hard, too hard maybe, nonetheless I fell and got completely shattered when she [24F] decided to leave behind everything we had. Like a lot of lonely soldiers on this sub-reddit I had no one to talk to, no one to help me put myself together. I had to help myself picking up the pieces slowly building a better version of me.
For a few days I told myself that it was only temporary until she figured out what to do, told myself that she was just getting her head clear. Big mistake! It was only about 2-3 weeks later that the real pain hit, the fear of being alone, the thought of never finding a true love again. These weeks were the worst. Being young this was the most emotional pain I've ever felt and you know what, **I'm kind of glad she broke it off** it help me see within myself and I came out a better person. I know this is a big cliché but it couldn't be more true for break ups, what doesn't kill makes you stronger. It was a learning experience no matter how much pain I felt at one point. I'm not ready for another relationship, I probably won't be for a while, it just gives me time to work on myself. I might make the same mistakes again, I might not, all I know is that I will be better prepared for everything the next lucky girl has to offer.

**What you came here to read:** It harsh, but it's the truth. No matter what the reason was for the break up you will be feeling a bit of denial at first, false hope of getting back together, confusion of the situation, you will be making excuses to convince yourself it's not over.. etc. In time you will be missing your partner more and more because of all the time spent away from each other, this for me, was the worst part of it all. After a while, you start to think about him/her less &amp; less. I went from thinking about my SO every other minute, to every other hour...to only a few days than finally only once or twice a week.

**TL;DR:** It gets worse. Worse and worse every day until one day in a few weeks/months, it starts to get better. It might not seem like it ever gets better, be strong it does, you just have to power through.

The only time this concept even really bothers me though is if I see porn.

That's all I'm feeling right now, a kind of numb relief.

The first week was awful without you, trying to figure out what went wrong, what I could have done better, replaying everything in my head wondering how I could possibly spend a day without you in it. I cried a lot &amp; just felt completely lost. 

After clearing my head &amp; looking back on everything over the past 6 years, I've realized that you really aren't the right person for me &amp; I should be thanking you for doing something I couldn’t have done myself.

I love so many things about you:

* Your smile, eyes &amp; charming good looks
* Your infectious personality, you always put yourself out there without a second thought &amp; people are just drawn to you (something I'm a bit jealous of)
* Your drive, you haven't given up on your dreams &amp; I don’t see you doing so anytime soon, no matter how tough it gets.
* The way everything felt perfect when you were around and I was wrapped up in your arms.
* You always made me feel like things were going to be okay.
* The way you pushed me to step out of my bubble, to not care so much &amp; be myself.
* Good listener.


But there was also so much that drove me crazy about you;

* You are terrible at keeping plans
* Never made me feel like a priority
* Your communication skills are terrible
* Selfish 
* You often talk about people behind their backs.
* You weren’t really good with romance. I want someone who will buy me flowers just because, someone who will call me just to tell me they love me, that goes out of their way to see me often.
* I felt like a backup.
* You never wanted to talk about conflict; you bottle everything up until you shut down &amp; would ignore me for days until you figured it out yourself.


We've gone through SO much together in the past 6 years &amp; I was so in love with the idea of being with you that I pushed aside so many of my feelings &amp; put up with so much bullshit from you. You made me feel like I wasn't good enough, like I was crazy &amp; needy because I wanted to spend more than 2 days a week with you, because I wanted you to pick up the phone once in a blue moon to tell me you missed me, or to make spontaneous plans. You were a better friend than a boyfriend.
I hated having to be scheduled in to your life. 


I hate even more that I allowed myself be walked all over, that I pretended to be okay with all of this because I loved you, because I was scared of what life would be like without you. I was stubborn &amp; didn’t want to  listen to everyone around me telling me that you weren’t right for me as a boyfriend, I took a chance and followed my heart. I knew that if this relationship didn’t work out, our long friendship would be over as well, but I held on hoping that it’d be okay. I hate even more that you looked at your life and decided that you just couldn’t have a girlfriend, that I was the one thing out of many that could be replaced. I understand being stressed and overwhelmed and not knowing what you want with your life but it’s pretty shitty that you felt as though you couldn’t talk to me about it. 


Not everything was bad though, we had some amazing times together. Matching tattoos, road trips, new relationships/breakups, staying up all night talking about nothing, countless concerts, graduations, post-secondary life, life crises, time spent with each other’s families, sneaking around trying to convince everyone we were just friends (which sometimes lead to jealousy, fights and anger but it was fun), skinny dipping, knowing you were just a phone call away, feeling like we could just take on the world  &amp; SO much more. 


Now, you want to stay friends but on your terms. 

 
I can’t do that anymore, as much as I’d love to just fall back into being best friends, I just can’t. It makes me sad, really sad to look at everything and know that it’s best for both of us to open new chapters in our lives. You slept with someone less than a week after we broke up, you showed her off like she was some sort of prize in front of all of our friends – maybe that’s your way of coping with everything. It just shows a lack of respect on your part. You were supposed to call &amp; you didn’t - you broke another promise which sealed the deal. You’re not reliable and need to grow up a lot &amp; I wish you could have done so with me around, but you won’t because I’ve always been there for you when you fuck up. It’s time for me to find out what life is like without you in it. 


I just want you to be happy. I know you will be - I know you’ll figure everything out &amp; follow through with all your dreams. Maybe sometime in the future we’ll be able to talk again, catch up and know we made the best decision for the both of us. Only time will tell.

It's been 9 months, and I'm in a new city surrounded by old friends (who she also worked hard to separate me from) and in a newer, healthier, happier relationship.  My ex and I were only together for 9 months (yes, and we moved in together, which I realize *now* was a dumbass decision, but there's not a damn thing I can do about that *now*).

Me, I got screwed out of ten grand and my ""job"" hasn't had any paying work in a month.  I'm bleeding my savings dry and she's working her dream job and will go to her deathbed convinced she was the Poor Innocent Single Working Mother Who Escaped From A Bad Relationship Again^TM -- just like she tells everyone about her and her ex-husband.  And the people who see the holes in her story there, and who have the temerity to suggest that, maybe, her ex-husband isn't The Devil Hisownself?  They get on her shit-list and forced to apologize.

To keep a long story short, she (22f) broke up with me (23m) about 2 months ago because she said that she lost feelings for me and didn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore.  She was very clear about this, and I wasn't left with any unanswered questions.  It made me very sad, as I loved her, but I've been starting to move on and have made some excellent progress lately.

I was ok with trying the ""friends"" thing, which I can see now was surely motivated by the desire to keep close to her to keep up the possibility of us getting back together.  Every time we did something as ""friends"" was extremely difficult because everything between us seemed so normal, we were still very compatible and able to have fun together.  But my mood always came crashing down the next day when my brain realized that she still didn't want to be with me and that she wasn't going to change her mind.  This hurt very much.  And it hurt that it seemed like she was so over the relationship already and able to act like this around me.  I decided that staying out of contact with her was the only way to let myself heal and keep myself from re-opening the wound.  The less reminders of the relationship the better.

Ok, now to my current problem.  Even though I've been trying to keep my communication with her to a minimum (hoping that she gets the hint) she has still been reaching out to me every few days with totally random stuff.  Like, calling me just to say hi because she was bored.  This has been messing with my mind, and causing me to overthink everything.  Does this text mean she wants to be close to me again? Does this phone call mean that she is ready for a relationship with me now?  I keep running in circles.  It hurts when I reply or answer back, but I haven't been able to ignore her either, as I don't want to be a jerk to this person who didn't really do anything mean to me aside from breaking my heart.  And it's hard for me mentally because it seems like she's being pretty selfish by trying to keep me as a friend without knowing how much this is hurting me (since I still have feelings for her).  I could have a conversation with her about this, but that doesn't seem too appealing to me either.

I hope that wasn't too rambling, my mind is just kind of a mess with this situation.  I'm finding myself wanting to talk to her and reach out to her and finding out about her life now when a few days ago (before she contacted me) I would have been fine with staying out of her life altogether.

It's been two months and it's been getting better. We dating for ~1.5 years, and he was the first guy I really wanted to marry, thought he was the one. But he wasn't happy, for whatever reason. Said some unfair and hurtful things as he tried to figure it out. Then he said that he had feelings for a mutual friend, and that they might be better together. Ouch. He said he would take a step back from her, as he figured out our shit. (Wouldn't totally abandon her since she's going through a tough time and needed a friend. Whatfuckingever.) Two days later when I called him they were at a concert with some other people. That blew my mind, because loyalty is his big thing, and I would have sworn prior to that week that he had a heart of gold. Best person I knew, would never intentionally hurt someone. A couple days later he told me he just wasn't that into me. Could list off all these amazing things about me but it wasn't enough. He didn't love me and never had.

That was two months ago, and I really have made progress. I've been able to forgive him for a lot of what he said, and made strides to not dwell on my feelings. Time heals, or so they say. Still think about him too much, but doesn't everyone. Then today I saw pictures of them holding hands on facebook. Dunno how long they've been together. It shouldn't be a surprise or be as hurtful as it is, but it stings. It means that all the times they were hanging out at the end of our relationship, it wasn't just him lusting after her. They were falling for each other. And he was my boyfriend.

Call me selfish, but I think it sucks that he's dating the girl that he let intrude on us. Given enough time, I knew he was going to date someone. But her? Before this, I would have said she's the sweetest person ever. But I really hate her face right now. It's not fair to her but I couldn't care less. I'm afraid of running into either of them when I go home for Thanksgiving, because I'll probably say something stupid. And there's nothing I could say that wouldn't make me look crazy. Because now no matter how much I'm hurting, I'm the interloper. And he's single, so he can do what he wants.

I had the shittiest summer in my life. from here to there, in mid-july I went NC, not declaring anything, and it has held steady for almost 2 months. it felt to me like I was dead to her. then a week ago, out of the blue she texts me, like we only just spoke: *""how are you?""*. I cried, but held myself from replying. 3 days pass and she texts again: *""it scares me to think that you're not doing good""*. I haven't replied to this as well, only cried. but in a way it threw me back a little, started waking up missing her, or more exactly - who she used to be. 

I know this shouldn't set me back but there is still some % in my head that, who knows, she might come back. and I know she's done me wrong and I shouldn't. but I'm really trying to realize - what the hell is she thinking? she was aware on how deeply she hurt me all throughout this summer, and after all this radio silence when I was pretty much sure I would never hear from her again - suddenly she texts? and if she's so scared about my well-being, why doesn't she call? is it all about her dirty conscience?

when she parted she said ""I'll always think of you as my best friend"". but do best friends really break-up in this manner? 

**TL;DR - Girl broke up with me 3 months ago for another guy. last week after almost 2 months of NC from my side, she texts me asking ""how I am"" and declaring how scared she is that I might be in a bad condition. I haven't replied to any of the messages. what does she want, what is she thinking? what triggers her to check on the dead after so much time?**

1347511124.0,13,self.BreakUps,zt2s6,Last night I (f24) ran into my ex (m23) for the first time in four years,14,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zt2s6/last_night_i_f24_ran_into_my_ex_m23_for_the_first/,"Six years ago, during the summer before I left for college, I was in a great, carefree, happy relationship with a really sweet guy. We had a great summer together and I cherish those memories. When I left for Chicago to go to school things got serious. He really saw a future for us, complete with children and a house in the suburbs. 

Like many young teenage girls, I was an idiot. I freaked out, broke his heart into a thousand pieces. Started a doomed relationship with an older military friend of mine, went crawling back because I missed our friendship blah blah blah etc etc. I was a dumbass.

Through mutual friends I heard that he went off the deep end: started drinking heavily, was very bitter and angry (who could blame him?). I felt really guilty, and he and I went back and forth between trying to be friends, hating &amp; hurting each other and sleeping together between relationships. It was a bad cycle. 

I dropped off the radar, decided to delete my facebook account, our circle of friends became different, and I didn't really see him anymore. I  moved forward, grew up, fell in love. I don't regret that our relationship ended, because I met my fiancee and couldn't be happier now. I am a different person now because of that experience. However, I do regret the way I handled things. Sometimes I think about that, about the way things went down back then, and I hope that he has found happiness too. 

Last night I ran into my ex for the first time in four years and it was surprisingly pleasant. Genuinely polite and friendly, not the fake lets-make-small-talk-because-we're-in-public-and-that's-what-people-do. I was walking through the frozen food section of the grocery store when I saw him round the corner and walk towards me. For a minute we both stopped and I smiled instinctively. I thought he was going to turn around and ignore me for a second, but then we both walked to each other and said hello and just started talking. It was completely natural and really nice. Each of us inquired about the other's family, life, work; we spoke briefly about a mutual friend who is travelling in a different country; we talked about our current relationships; we hugged and said goodbye and that was it. Even after all the drama and pain we put eachother through, it was possible to see one another again after a few years and smile genuinely. 

It doesn't always seem possible, right after a break up, that you could ever see that person again without crying or yelling in anger. But I wanted to share my story and give hope to someone, anyone who regrets the way things ended with an ex, and hopes for a day in the future where the anger is gone.

Stand in front of the mirror. Imagine what you'd tell them and how they would respond. Release your hurt and anger into this fake conversation. Do this when you have time to get upset. Do not do this before you go to work or class.

I was telling him how selfish he is. That his ultimatum to either listen to him berate me or walk out forever was his way of saying this doesn't matter to him. I don't matter enough to give me respect. I tell him I'm hurting.

I remind him how I didn't want this relationship when we started dating a year ago. Because I was afraid of being around people again after my marriage fell apart. I was afraid to find out that I was right, that people are selfish, uncaring, rude, and most of all, stupid.

I give him all the examples I have where he revised history in his mind to make his memories more conducive to his point of view or state of mind.

I tell him that I have a right to be unhappy with someone treating me poorly. That his dismissiveness was the most hurtful thing of all. YOU ALMOST HIT ME WITH YOUR CAR BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO WATCH ME IN THE MIRROR. MAYBE IF I HAD BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME, YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME MORE ATTENTION? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

And when I start to get angry is about where I stop. I know this part is unhealthy, but getting things off your chest out loud, sometimes helps. I let anger cauterize my pain, and then I seal it off from the rest of my mind so I can focus on other things.

I wave and she totally ignores me. Later I tried talking to her in passing and she said that she was busy and walked away. Up until this point we had been facebook friends, albeit without chatting with each other.

At the time I was pretty devastated, shocked, and confused. Devastated because I saw myself marrying this girl. Shocked because it was so out of the blue. We had literally just got back from two trips, one to visit my mother and introduce her to that side of the family, and the other for our 5 year anniversary. Confused because she said she was never happier with anyone else and that I was all she ever wanted during said trips.

This all happened a week after our trips. I was a walking shell for all but two days. My friends came to my rescue and bounced me back to life. After the dust settled and I had a chance to look back and reflect on the last 5 years, I came to realize how unhappy I was, how complacent I got, and acceptable these notions as an inevitability of life. 

During our break up discussion and my post break up contemplation, I came to realize quite a few things: 

1. We both set exceptions for one another and failed to meet them.
2. We never communicated about our feelings/desires anymore. 
3. When we got angry with one another we would have our fight but never really resolve anything. It would bottle up into this massive ball of hatred and erupt about once a year around the same time.
4. Sex was out the window.
5. She hated that I quit my job to pursue my dream and would have rather had me working than going to grad school.
6. She wanted a ring, and I told her, *from the beginning*, that I wasn't interested in marriage until I felt I was ready (i.e., finished my schooling, got my job, established a foundation to build a future with someone). I don't want to start a future with someone and have to struggle to build a life. I wanted to be self-sufficient first.
7. She never did anything for me ever if it didn't mean she wouldn't get something in return.
8. She cheated on me twice, as far as I know it was just kissing, but really, who knows. I should have walked away after the first time.

I have to thank her though. I learned so much from being with her and I've managed to grow as a person out of all of this. Despite our failure to mature as a couple together I've matured as a human being. However, I'm very grateful she initiated our break up. If she hadn't I would have been stuck where I was still.

I broke up with my ex (20 F) last September and I made the mistake of seeing her very regularly and speaking with her, up until June 14th. We were having a fight because I called her out on making up an excuse not to visit me,and something clicked--I realized that she was a lying, opportunistic, soulless person who would take advantage of my trust for as long as she could.


I was very much a wreck after we stopped talking, but I found proof that I was right in our last argument the day after we fought, so at least I had *something* to hold on to. the last month has been very eventful for me-- got beaten up by a bouncer, got two jobs and an internship, been volunteering for political organizations, studying for the lsats-- but nothing could truly take her off of my mind. my ex didn't have a facebook, so i blocked her closest friend, but i would still look at her other friends' pages, just hoping that someone posted a picture of her. looking at her twitter always resulted in me wanting to throw up, so i made myself stop that a while ago.

I know I'm not out of the woods yet, and while I'm currently at home, where running into her in person is *extremely* unlikely, I'll be up at school in just over 6 weeks, where we'll be living down the block from each other. My goal is to be able to pass her on the street, give her the slightest acknowledgement that I know her, and keep walking by, and I think I'm at the point where this is a very likely possibility.  


If I had to pick one thing that really made this process a lot easier for me, it was the fact that I started talking to other girls who I was interested in.  It sounds like such a simple solution, but I had no idea how effective it could be.  My friends used to tell me ""get a hobby,"" or ""do something to occupy your mind,"" but I always greatly underestimated how much my mind would be occupied if I even just started talking to other girls. 


Guys and girls, it does get easier. Part of the whole process of breaking up is realizing that it's actually over, and that the life you envisioned for yourself before your breakup is already over.  Now you have a new life and so many opportunities to cultivate new relationships, revisit old ones with old friends, or just have some time for yourself. Just repeat the mantra; No Contact, Block On Facebook, Gym. We're all going to get through this-- we're better than them, and we'll show them that we deserve better than what they offered us.

1339838771.0,13,self.BreakUps,v4txm,I'm single again after a 5 year relationship. I need some help.,17,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v4txm/im_single_again_after_a_5_year_relationship_i/,"My now ex girlfriend(21f) and myself(20m) have just broken up. We had been dating since we were 15. She knows my Reddit account and I don't want her to kick me anymore while i'm down. I need to vent, I have no one to turn to. If you don't want to read the story I understand but there are questions at the bottom I would really appreciate answers to! Here is the story:


It started in 7th grade(about 13 years old) when I met her. I was an extremely overweight kid. No girl had ever given me a chance to really talk to them at this point in my life, no girl would even look at me. She did. She gave me a chance, she rolled the dice and I still don't know why. From that day on I wanted to make sure she was happy. I had a crush from the first day I met her, but this girl was completely out of my league. We quickly became best friends from then on and I would give her advice on everything she struggled with, which was mostly guy problems. I was essentially friend zoning myself and I didn't even realize it because I was only in 7th grade. But I continued to be there for her through anything. This continued for about 2 years.


We get to high school and it's a new and exciting time. I have lost around 70 pounds from training to play football at this point. Our friendship is as strong as ever. Within the first month of high school she has her group of friends tell me that she likes me. I didn't believe it for a solid month, she had never given me signs of that. I thought this was a cruel joke that her friends were playing on me. I was thinking they just wanted me to ask her out so I would be embarrassed in front of everyone in the school. I mean... A GIRL wanted me? A GIRL had feelings for me? THE GIRL had feelings for me? Well after that month I grew a pair and asked her.


She said yes to my complete surprise. People thought it was a joke that she was dating me. From then on I made sure she was the happiest girl in the world. We would get made fun of everyday because of how attached we were. We would literally be holding hands the entire time we were together. She became my first kiss about 3 months into dating. I was too nervous to make the first move so she did. I had never been happier after that though.


Well after about a year she ""cheats"" on me. She kisses an ex boyfriend who I had given her advice on. It crushes me but we remained friends. I couldn't live without her. Me dating her made other girls curious about me. I had more girls texting me and calling me than I could believe after we broke up. I ""hook up"" with a few (if you can even call making out hooking up). About 5 months pass since we broke up. She apologizes in tears for everything.


We start dating again. We lose our virginity to each other during this time. But sadly the relationship only lasts for 3 months. A 21 year old who helped out the teacher in one of her classes started chasing after her. She apparently tells him everything and he convinced her that I was only dating her to get into her pants. He told her she was going to get hurt dating me. So she breaks up with me again.... And of course starts dating him.


Well we stop talking after that and she dates him for about a year. I still love her after all this time, I'm envious of what this other guy has that I don't. She comes crying back to me again after he breaks her heart. We get to know each other again. And me being the sucker I am took her back again.


This is when the real relationship begins. We were starting our 3rd year(junior year) in high school. We were both determined to make this work. About 10 months of us dating pass and something we were never ready for came up. She had gotten pregnant. We made the toughest decision in our lives to abort the baby. We both decided we couldn't provide the life a baby deserves. It cuts me deep but I have to stay strong for her. I still to this day carry around the ultrasound of the kid everywhere I go. It has been my inspiration to become a better person. No one besides us to this day knows about the abortion. After the abortion our relationship grows so much closer.


We continue to be the happiest couple throughout high school. We communicate, we laugh, we go on dates, I would get excited to see her texts and calls come in. High school finally ends and I get a summer internship offer at Google and 3 universities offering a full ride scholarship. The closest being a school about 2 hours away. She didn't perform too well in school so she decided to stick with community college in the town we had lived in. At this point we decide we were going to stay together throughout college. Because of this I decide to stay as close as possible. I go to the college that is 2 hours away.


This is where our relationship starts to strain. I move out for the first time with roommates I don't know. My original roommate was supposed to be a 27 year old bank teller. But he didn't really live well with others so I end up with the only other apartment they have open at the time. This apartment was co-ed. I was going to be living with 2 girls for my freshman year. Imagine my girlfriend's excitement when she heard this. I can tell she's hurting at this point. She wants to move in so bad with me but I didn't want to put her in a bad financial situation. I told her it wasn't worth the debt to get the same community college education 2 hours down the road. (I understand how dumb that sounds now but if we were truly staying together long term I wanted to keep us in good financial standing. I regret that decision still to this day.) I drive up each and every single weekend during the school year to see her. I wanted her to know I love her and cared about her. I still surprise her with dates and flowers. Over the summer I would stay at my parent's house and bring her lunch at work everyday.


We go another year of doing the same thing except I live alone this time. This next year we had planned to move in together. I still drive up every weekend in order to see her. And In order to show her I love her. Well because of this and because I have to keep a high GPA for my scholarship I don't and still don't have a social life in college. I work hard all week so that I don't have any homework left over for the weekend. Our relationship is still strong this entire school year.


This last month when summer started has been where it got bumpy. She starts to tell me she doesn't want to go to my school anymore. She wants to follow her dreams and go into fashion merchandising... This kind of saddens me but I tell her to go for it. Shoot for the stars. The problem is that the fashion school she wants to go to is 8 hours from my school. We definitely would have to have a long distance relationship at that point. No more seeing each other every weekend. This puts strain back on our relationship. I tell her I still completely support her with whatever she wants to do though. We have been dating continuously for one month short of 4 years now.


Well then comes the past few weeks. She starts to ignore my calls and texts. She bails on dates I had planned for her. I learn from a mutual friend that she has been hanging out with other guys in our group when she would tell me that she's sick and can't go out. This makes me saddened inside but I didn't know how to confront her about it. She becomes moody with me all the time. She doesn't know that I know what she has been up to.


Then this week comes. The week that has crushed me completely as a person. She tells me that she has fallen out of love with me. She doesn't get happy when she sees me anymore. She gets annoyed when she sees my face. She hates how I love to spend time with my family and that I am a mommy's boy. She tells me that she hates that I give my dog so much attention. She hates what I wear. She tells me she wants to see other people. She says that she has been in relationships all of her life and she doesn't even know who she is. She doesn't know if I'm the best she wants to see if there are better guys out there. She wants to make stupid decisions and live with them. She wants to hook up with a random guy and regret it. She wants to ""find herself"". And after that she ""finds herself"" we should get back together and get married. I told her things don't work that way. I'm not going to sit here and wait while she hooks up with a bunch of guys and then just take her back. You can't have your cake and eat it too.


Mind you this all came within a couple of days. She built all of this up and just exploded these past few days. I told her she needs to tell me these things and not let them build up like this. I can try to fix things but I can't fix everything at once. I've always been fine with her talking to other guys and making new friends. I never breached her privacy in any way. I trusted her. I loved her. I tried to continue to surprise her as much as possible. I took her out on fun dates. I loved to make her happy that was all I ever wanted since I met her. I had tried my hardest at that point to be the best boyfriend I could be.


For the last few days she tried to end everything over text. She didn't even try to do that with our shorter relationships. But I told her our friendship is worth more than that and she knows that. I couldn't just let an 8 year friendship end over a text.


Well tonight ended our relationship, but more importantly it ended our friendship.


We met up at the park where we first started hanging out 8 years ago. I hadn't seen her since a week ago. This part may sound weird but I had decided I wanted to end our relationship on a happy note not a sad one. I knew she was done with me it was inevitable at this point but I wanted her to look back and constantly wonder why our relationship and friendship ended. We went and got milkshakes and went ice skating like we were just on another date. It was a great time until it came time to say goodbye. I broke down. We hugged for a hour straight. We cried in each other's shoulders for a hour straight. We didn't say a word for that hour. After that hour of breaking down I gave her a piece of me, a piece of us, to keep. I gave her my inspiration to become a better person. I gave her the ultrasound of the baby we were supposed to have from almost 3 and a half years ago. She had no clue I had been carrying that around with me this entire time. I told her the story behind it. I told her how deeply cut I was by the abortion. I told her why I carry it around. I told her everything. I thanked her for being the girl that gave me a chance 8 years ago. We continued to cry for another hour in each other's arms. She told she had to go after those 2 hours. Before she left I told her to remember the ultrasound whenever she feels down. Whenever someone breaks her heart. Whenever she fails a test. Whenever she needs it. I told her to take care of it wherever she goes. We unexpectedly kiss and she heads home. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes before I could I even move. It's insane how something that has lasted so long can end so quick. I've sat here for a hour and a half typing this. Everything is so hazy right now. I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss our relationship. But most of all I'm going to miss our friendship. I just want her to be happy again.


**My questions are:**



* I've realized I don't even know how to make new friends anymore. I don't want to stay in the same mutual group of friends as her. I know it will only hurt me and I'll never get over her that way... What do i do over the summer to make new friends? How do you even approach people without being creepy? I have a connection to get hundreds of baseball tickets to all the our local MLB team's games, would that be a good place to invite new people to try to make them become a friend of mine?


* Are there steps I should be taking right now to help this process?




* She has hurt me pretty bad this time. Should I be just completely ignoring her calls and texts?


* I need a new hobby to keep my mind off things. I'm open to any suggestions! Please let me know what you do in your free time and why you love it.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_v4txm,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v4txm/im_single_again_after_a_5_year_relationship_i/,

I was falling for him and I didn't know how to stop myself. We always had a blast hanging out, we had great sex, and we were very affectionate with each other.

Even though I never had him, I still feel like I lost him. I feel heartbroken. Why did I let him treat me this way? Why was I so naive in hoping that he would feel strong enough to commit to me?

1333759140.0,13,self.BreakUps,rx66v,A letter to you (x post from r/love),13,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/rx66v/a_letter_to_you_x_post_from_rlove/,"I felt the community of r/breakups would benefit more from this. 

Dear  You,

How have you been?

It’s been a while since we talked last so I’ll try not to talk to fast.

It’s been hard for me not having you around. I keep asking myself why I broke up with you and I can’t come up with a definite answer. Isn’t that funny? I just couldn’t be with you anymore. Something about our relationship didn’t seem right. I can’t tell you what it is because no matter how much I try to pin it down I don’t know what it is, but I know that something between us doesn’t quite work out. There’s this one quote that I found a while ago that sums up how I feel right now.

“He was a major part of your life; of course you’ll miss him; it’s perfectly normal. It’s like getting a tooth pulled out; after the dentist pulls it, you’re relieved. But how many times do you run your tongue over the spot where it once was? Probably a hundred times a day. Just because it was hurting you, doesn’t mean you don’t notice it. It leaves a gap, and sometimes you see yourself missing it terribly. It’s going to take a while, but it always takes some time. Should you have kept the tooth? No, because it was causing you pain. Pulling the tooth was the right decision, but it’s still going to hurt.”

This is how I feel about us. At one point you felt so right in my life. You were a tooth to me. You were part of me that helped me get through my day, chewing my food and what not, but at some point you came loose. When a tooth comes loose there really is only one thing to do. Pull it out. But as the days passed where you were out of my life it felt like a missing tooth. There was gap in my life that you once filled. So I did the only sensible thing and tried to put you back in my life. The problem with that is that, when you try to put a tooth you pulled out back in, it’ll stay for a little, but then fall out again because in the end it’s no longer part of you.  And that’s what I tried to do. Put you back in. That putting the tooth I pulled out back in would put things back to normal, but the truth is it doesn’t. Once you pull a tooth out, it’s no longer part of the body, and it stops growing. 

I miss you so much you have no idea. I wake up day after day and you’re the first thing that comes to mind, and with the thought of you comes the pain of not having you around. I dream constantly about you too. In one of my dreams you told me you were pregnant and I was mind fucked because I never remembered us having sex, but apparently we did. All I did was hold you and tell you I’d be there for you. When I woke up from that one I couldn’t get out of bed for a while. 

But in the end it’s called a break up because it’s broken, and I haven’t seen that until now. I’ve been so naïve and short sighted in thinking that if we’re together we’ll both be happy to see that no matter how much I try to fix something as broken as us, I can’t. I pulled you out of my life, so I should have stayed out of yours. For that I’m sorry. I really am.

I hope that if this letter ever gets to you, that you know it’s from the heart.

For the past two years you’ve helped me through so many hard times and through so many good ones. You’ll always be a part of me that I’ll never forget. I’m sorry that I’ve tried to put you back in to my life so many times. I should’ve seen that it would just end in heartbreak, but I only saw that something was missing instead of seeing that it’s gone for a reason. I’m sorry that I convinced you to come back thinking that everything would work out each time, but I see now how bad I am for you. 

I hope that one day you’ll say hi to me and that we can talk about how we’ve been and that I can clear up anything I’ve confused you about. 

Life goes on and we have to go along with it. That’s something that I’m still trying to do with us. I hope that the next guy that steals your heart will be just as amazing as I am and you can be assured that the next girl to steal mine will be just as amazing as you, and someday we can argue about whose is better. 

You have given me love. You showed me how to be so happy that I cried tears of joy; something only you did for me. It’s been said that the greatest kind of love is the one that awakens your soul and makes you reach for more. It plants a fire in your heart and gives you peace in mind. You’ll always be the girl that did that for me, and I hope that, at some point, I did that for you. Thank you for everything. Every day I thank whoever runs this universe that you were chose to be my first love and I was chosen to be loved by you. 

Thank you.

Sincerely, 

Me

1332171317.0,12,self.BreakUps,r3jn9,"Long Distance ""Relationship""/He vanished/Don't know what the fuck, can't get over it.",16,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/r3jn9/long_distance_relationshiphe_vanisheddont_know/,"Hi Reddit.
I figure the best place to vent about this is somewhere I'm (relatively) anonymous. Strangers give completely unbiased advice, and I kind of need that right now. Forgive me if this becomes a wall.

I'm 29, he is 27. We met through a facebook friend in October. He lives in Michigan, I live in Toronto. Initially it was just a ""hey you're hot, let's chat"" kind of thing...but it quickly developed into way, way more. Constant texting for pretty much whenever we were both awake and near our phones, 4 hour skype conversations, both of us admitting our feelings and how much it sucked that we lived so far apart, but made plans to visit soon...he had to get his tax return so he could get his passport renewed and stay here for a week (I couldn't go there due to anxiety but that's irrelevant).

I've deleted our text history, but for months solid up until the day we spoke last, it was full of him telling me how much I mean to him, how he couldn't wait to jump off the bus and hold me, good morning/goodnight messages every day, and how he hoped I fall in love with him...obviously I was on cloud 9, because not only was I also immensely attracted to him, I hadn't known someone I was so compatible with in years, if ever at all.
A few days before whatever happened, because we couldn't be together on Valentine's Day, he told me to go out and buy some steak and wine, and he would do the same, so we could have a candle-lit skype dinner. Yeah, I know. But I loved it, and I thought he did too since he made a point to post about what a ""beautiful night"" we had.

Fast forward to Feb 18th. That was the last time I heard from him. Everything just...stopped. I assumed he was just sleeping off his weekend hangover, but after a week I started to get worried. I sent a text asking if he was okay...nothing. A few days later I sent a email...nothing. We hadn't had an argument, or discussion about anything out of the ordinary that would have put him off.

I also noticed he hadn't (and still hasn't) posted on Facebook. At all. It's like he just dropped off the grid. I started to get worried he was in the hospital or in jail or something...so I sent his sister a message asking if he was alright. She said she hadn't heard from him either so she'd get her boyfriend to call.

That was the last I heard from her.

A week and a bit ago, I suddenly got a blank email from him at around 4am. At this point I'm really confused and hurt. I wrote back, saying that I didn't get it, but I hope he would tell me what was up soon.
So it's now...I still haven't heard from him, he's totally vanished online (he did post here a while ago but he doesn't know I have an account), I'm still his friend on Facebook for some reason, and I've deleted his number so I don't text him.

I CANNOT shake this. I don't know what's wrong with me. I literally give no fuck if he met someone, if he just woke up one morning and decided he hated me...why won't he just tell me why he decided to bail so I can have that closure and move on?

Moreso...wouldn't it have been easier to just block me or unfriend me online than to go to the trouble of avoiding the internet almost entirely if he did in fact want to avoid me?

And before I get accused of it, I did NOT spam him with texts in any way. I honestly don't want to be lumped in with the crazy. I genuinely was/am concerned that he went from one extreme to another, with no warning, after spending months making me think he was totally nuts over me.

Has this ever happened to anyone? I'm not looking for people to tell me I'm stupid for putting faith in someone I have never met, or that I'm some crazy girl for wanting an answer to something that is incredibly hurtful and cowardly. I genuinely believed this was real and I'm having a hard time dealing with the fact that I have no answer to what happened.


TL;DR: girl meets guy, guy makes girl feel like she's the best thing in life for several months, guy vanishes without a word, girl is super sad.


**UPDATE:** Literally by accident found a post he made this afternoon (19th), on here. So he was just intentionally ignoring me this whole time, no matter what I said, just reading my messages and then carrying on with whatever...I can't even. I was fine, now I feel totally duped and stupid. I poured my heart out to someone who probably just laughed it off....ugh. :(

**UPDATE 2:** All the deleting everywhere. Told him off before deleting him on FB. Trying not to dwell on the fact that he doesn't care...he still won't delete certain things between us (that I can't) for some reason...but the deleting has helped, even though this has never happened to me before so the fact that I still don't and won't ever get an answer will bug me for a long time.",,False,,t5_2ra79,True,,,True,t3_r3jn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/r3jn9/long_distance_relationshiphe_vanisheddont_know/,

I know every ending of a meaningful relationship hurts in its own way. Many of the posts here come from those who have had to endure heartbreak due to their former relationship partner's hurtful actions eventually leading to the ending of the relationship. Now I don't want to generalize, and I know it's not productive to necessarily 'blame' one more than the other. Relationships end for all sorts of reasons, and every situation is unique.

Here though, I'm specifically interested in the viewpoints of those people who are clearly aware that they treated badly their partner whom they professed to love, and then acted in a way that was needlessly insensitive / reckless / hurtful towards them (cheating, lying, etc.). In other words, acted like real immature human beings towards somebody who genuinely loved, trusted and respected them.

How did you view your actions over time? How did you feel about what you had done? Did you feel guilt, and were genuinely sorry for your actions? Did you try to rationalize your actions, or tried to convince yourself that it was all for the better, and never looked back or had any regrets? Did you feel your actions were justified because you no longer loved them (at least in the romantic sense) and so did it for their sake? How did your perspective and emotions change over time? Do you still feel pained by your own actions, or has it lessened so that you've all but forgotten it now?

Did you ever feel like talking to your ex afterwards, ever wanted to find out how they were doing, or feared that any attempt of yours to do so would only open wounds of the past and dissuaded yourself for that reason? Were you ever yourself contacted by your ex? In case contact was eventually reinitiated, how did it go, what did you talk about? Was there bitterness, or did you meet in the spirit of reconciliation? Are you happy that you enabled yourself to have that meeting?

Do you feel you are a better human being today as a result of all that happened, and that you have changed, or do you believe you will again act similarly in the future, or already have?

So, lots of questions to think about. I'd be happy to hear your stories, and maybe it'll help others to read them to gain a better perspective from the 'other side'.

I would like to request (it's already mentioned in the group rules, but I'd like to reiterate anyway), that if this post gets a response by any commenters, for others to be considerate to those who are sharing their stories and not condemn them for their actions in the past, since none of us are entirely immune from 'judging' others. I'll appreciate all your responses.

**TL;DR:** If you broke someone's heart badly in the past, how do you feel about your actions then and now? Do you just accept it as another experience in your journey through life, or do you feel it was a grave mistake that you regret?",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_pasdi,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/pasdi/perspectives_from_those_who_broke_someones_heart/,
1328053116.0,12,self.BreakUps,p59zd,Something I think everyone needs to hear.,13,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/p59zd/something_i_think_everyone_needs_to_hear/,"So I've been reading through the various break-up threads and the AskReddit Threads. There's often two common themes in many of these threads: 1. What do I need to change about me to stop getting dumped? and 2. My Ex is a __________ (insert gender appropriate insult) for dumping me.

The problem is, both of these things are wrong and they only end up hurting you and others.

The truth is much more simple and complex. The reason your ex broke up with you isn't because you weren't going anywhere in life, it wasn't because she thought you were fat, or that you weren't good in bed.

The reason your ex broke up with you is because your ex doesn't love you anymore. Even if they tell you they do, they don't.

There's nothing you can do to change this. And that's not a bad thing.

I know what Hollywood has told you. That if you just work out a little, or wear contacts, or learn to dance, she'll come back to you. But that's bullshit. It's bullshit brought to you by the same people who sell you gym memberships, contacts, and dancing lessons. You know how I know this, I write ads, I prey on your insecurities to get you to buy into this bullshit.

Your Ex realized a little sooner, what you would have eventually realized. That you two didn't have what it took to spend forever together. There was something wrong with the match, it wasn't meant to be. Hopefully, she realized this before you go married or moved in together or purchased something cool that would suck to split. But the truth remains, eventually you both were going to fall out of love with each other.

Which leads us to the second fallacy, that your ex is a bitch for dumping you. That's bullshit that your friends tell you to make it easier for you to realize what I just explained above, that you two weren't a good match. But just because you weren't a good match, doesn't make the other person evil. Jessica Alba and I aren't a good match, does that make her a bad person for not being with me? The same is true for your ex.

Sure, she ripped your heart out and it fucking hurts. And perhaps she could have handled dumping you in a manner that didn't tear you up as much, but the truth is, she did you a favor. Now you're free to find the person that loves you for what you are. 

No, not god's gift to women. But instead, a gift to her. Someone who'll treat her just the way she likes and someone she can treat as an equal.

The truth is, if your ex hadn't dumped your ass, you may never have met the person who makes you happiest in this world. And trust me, there is someone out there who will make you much happier than your ex, even if *gasp* it still is your ex, but the person your ex becomes 5 years from now.

Trust me, you're fine. The break up will hurt, but quit worrying about what might have been and go out to look for what will be. It doesn't matter if you're 15 or 45, you don't have a ton of time on this world to waste it wishing for something that's gone.

But how do I know, you ask?

Well 10 years ago today, the girl I was going to ask to marry me, dumped me for her pot dealer. I was broken. I looked for things to change about me and tried to change myself. I hated her and wished terrible things to happen to her.

It took me 2 years to realize that I didn't need to change. It was ok that she didn't love me. Not because she was an awful person, she wasn't. Not because she was stupid, she wasn't. She was just a young girl who realized she hadn't met the guy of her dreams and she wanted to go out and find the guy she would be happy with.

And when I realized that. I realized that I need to do the same thing she had done 2 years earlier. 2 years later, I met and married my wife. 6 years later, I'm the proud father of two beautiful children, who look like their mother and I go home to my best friend and the woman  I can't resist every night.

Remember that. Because it's hard to make room in your heart to love someone, when it's filled up with hate for someone else.

Good luck.

It's been about 3 months since my girlfriend of 2.5 years cheated on me/broke my heart (we are both 25). We ended things, of course. I'm pretty much over her, but it's been a rough while.

Today, at a beach party, I met a cute girl who was very easy to talk to and we had a great conversation for about an hour while I taught her to surf. I got her number, and after a nice chat for a while tonight via phone and making plans for a few days from now, the last thing she said was, ""goodnight handsome.""

What I noticed was that I wrote a lot about the relationship, things that I thought and things that I learned.  Yesterday I felt good and to help me remember that moment, I wrote an ""I'm awesome"" reflection.  Today I wrote a ""He's going to miss all these awesome things about me"" reflection.

I find that this especially helps with the nostalgia.  It's hard to let go of those good memories and wanting things to go back to the way they were.  That'll take time to work out.  Acknowledge those feelings and try to look at them from a different perspective.  The relationship had some great moments, reflect on what made it great, how you made it great, and take a moment to feel better about yourself and how you'll make a future relationship great.

Try it out, hopefully it helps.

My girlfriend of 3 years dumped me, out of the blue, at the end of Jan. a few days later I learned she had been flirting with another guy in person (they had been getting drinks and went to a show together) and online (they had been exchanging messages online, trading music, flirting heavily, talking about the next time they'd get drinks together, etc) for a couple weeks. Saw this, and flipped out. She claimed she never slept with him while we were together, which I believe. But soon after she dumped me, she started having sex with him, and now is dating him seriously. It. fucking. kills me. I hate knowing she has someone new already, I hate knowing she didn't care to work things out with me, I hate knowing she has someone she is intimate with, someone who she cares about more than me, someone she'd rather be with than me, someone to always hang out with and share her weekends and evenings with. I hate how she'll never experience the deep, profound sadness I feel at the end of a great three year relationship. I fucking hate all of it. 

And I've been doing everything everyone is telling me--working out, pursuing my interests, hanging out with friends, meeting new people, staying busy (working two jobs now), and trying my hardest to ""focus on myself"". It still fucking sucks.

I had lunch with him today and I think it will have to be the last time I see him.  He is nothing but hateful towards me after his 180, when he decided he couldn't be in my future anymore.

He listed causes of stress to be from a million sources other than me, but yet I have to be the first to go.

HOW did he manage to start acting this way towards me???? I think he's doing it because he has to to make it easier on us to end it, but fuck him. fuck him.

Do yourself a favor, cut contact. Block Facebook, block their number, throw away notes and pictures. Right now it's about you. I deleted every single picture we were tagged in together.

The past two months I have been a sad puppy trying to get the relationship to work. Most days I do exactly what she wants, appologize and grovel constantly. She has intentionally uninvited me to hang out with mutual friends, left me alone to take care of myself after my surgery, made me sleep on the couch, made me find a place to move out to (we live together, she kicked me out), etc. She acts like the one time we had sex these past few months is a miracle that she performed for me, so I can't be upset with the way things are.

We went grocery shopping and she left to go hang out with our mutual friends while I drove home to put away all the groceries last night. (Me doing all the work on my broken ankle, her hanging out with friends)

After that, I had a good talk with a friend of mine - who is in the group of people that I know and hang out with, that she TELLS me I can't hang out with, gets pissed when I hang out with, etc. He said that my gf is telling everyone she is single, has been SUPER flirty and tried to sleep with my friend John (who was a true bro and told her to fuck off). Everyone there is confused by her actions. What she tells them is not what she tells me.

So I told her straight up last night - I am done trying. This is over. You are telling all of my friends it is over and are treating me like shit.

I ignored her most of the night because - as she says - we are not dating. We were hanging out with all of our mutual friends and she was definitely the odd man out. Since she tells all of them that we are not dating, I am not going to go out of my way for her anymore. I think our friends have caught onto it too. 

Later we went home. *She grabbed a fucking steak knife and stabbed herself in the leg four times while screaming at me that she was sorry.* It wasn't attractive. It was sad. This poor girl can't lead me on anymore.

It was the first time she has said sorry for all the mean actions the past two months, but it was too little too late. She screamed and cried for me to join her in the bedroom - the bedroom she kicked me out of two months ago before my surgery, where I have slept only once since. I slept on the couch and I loved it.

I still get sad sometimes but here are some things that help me out:


1. At night, when i wake up and have these thoughts, I just focus on my breathing and count until I fall back asleep. I used to spend hours in the middle of the night thinking and obsessing about details, red flags, signs, etc. But this really helps a lot.

2. When I find myself thinking about him and thinking about the good things, I stop real quick and tell myself he didn't deserve me and keep repeating it.

3. There is one response on reddit that I chanced upon but did not like or saved (darn it!) and it stuck and helped me change my point of view. The post was from a girl asking why men cheat and are they always prettier, sexier, smarter, etc. The first time this happened last year (same guy) I blamed myself. I kept thinking, I should have done this, should have done that. This breakup, I was also thinking, why did he do this to me when all I did was love him? Well, someone said on that post that cheating has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the other person. It's not about finding who is sexier, smarter, prettier, etc. Cheaters have a void in them that they try to fill with games and controlling other people. That resonated with me and helped me stop thinking about the whys.

Staying strong through this whole ordeal. I know one day it will all be a distant memory.

These are some thoughts I had some day. Sorry for talking to myself/random ambiguous details of my relationship that won't make much sense to anyone else! Hope it helps? I don't know I just needed to get it out there, I guess.

EDIT: Does this post even make sense? OMG I do not know... Haha!

In life, we learn that even the people who we don’t expect to let us down, will let us down. They will choose to walk out of your life whether it’s for a selfish or selfless reason. But you just have to understand that that is how life works. People will come and go no matter how hard you try to make them stay. Some people will be your friend forever and others will not. But maybe that isn’t such a bad thing, they’re there to teach you something about yourself. They left because either you need to better yourself or you need to learn something. Nothing is forever. And not everything works out. And it’s okay to be sad if something is out of your life, but don’t let it hinder you. Don’t let it stop you from doing you. And yes you can remember the good times, but honestly, the bads outweigh it. You deserve to be treated super special. You deserve to have someone want to buy you flowers on Valentine’s Day or to just call because they want to know what you are up to. Or even text you to know that they are thinking about you. You don’t want to have to spell that out for someone and with the right person, you won’t have to. 

He wasn’t meant for you. You weren’t meant to be together, and that isn’t bad. Not everyone you are going to date is going to be the one for you. He isn’t going to be the only person who makes you feel like that. He’s not the first person or the last person to break your heart. Your heart will get broken.

But you will learn from it. And you will grow so much more because of it. You’re going to be a better person because it’s a learning curve and progress is not linear. It goes up and down, and you have to live with it. And roll with the punches because honestly there is not much else you can do. And time will go by and you will feel better. And you will grow apart and you will realize that there is nothing good there for you. You will not benefit the slightest by thinking that there is something left to the relationship because there isn’t. He looked at you and decided that he was happier without you and that might be tough to listen to, but know that that is what he decided. The happy times were only a small part of your relationship, you tried so hard to fix it and that’s that. You can’t fix everything, some people are just not meant to be together and you have to accept that. You tried your best, and nothing you could have done could make him stay.

And no you shouldn’t be friends with him. And don’t give into that. You’re stronger than that and you’re amazing. So just keep your head up and you are going to go so far. I love you. People around you love you. Stay strong. :)",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1g2auo,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g2auo/some_thoughts_that_might_help_some_people/,

I miss you, and then I remember how much of a shitty girlfriend you were and I feel a little better. I eventually reached a point where I just let go. You needed to be alone and figure your life out. You said you needed to discover yourself, and that made it hard to get mad at you. Because I understood that it was something you needed to do to be happy. You needed to be alone and out of a relationship to figure out what you want. I understood. It was fine.

At least it was fine, until I found out you were a goddamn liar. You didn't have the dignity to tell me the real reason even after we had already been broken up. Even after you texted me because you wanted closure and you wanted to tell me ""the truth"" before we parted ways. And now apparently, you're interested in some guy and you want to ask him out on a date. What the fuck happened to you needing to be alone? Out of a relationship? You said you didn't want any man and you didn't want to be tied down because you wanted to travel and ""discover yourself"". You couldn't even tell me that's what you really wanted? You had to treat me like some kind of child and tell me you ""needed to be alone for a while""? You couldn't just say that your only desire is to go out and fuck other guys because you're a terrified, grown-ass woman who can't figure out what she wants? And near the end of our relationship, you tried to make me hate you and hurt me on purpose so that your cowardly ass didn't have to break up with me first. You are one huge piece of shit.

I fucking hate you, and thanks for that. Because it's giving me the motivation to really move on from you. And you had the nerve to be angry at me because I didn't want to be your friend when we broke up. I don't need a fucking liar like you as a friend. You manipulated me for three years to get your way.

I had a kind of tumultuous year-long relationship with a beautiful but rather volatile woman that ended about a year ago. She had issues with insecurity, jealousy, and anger, and I brought my anxiety and occasional depression to the table. Basically, she was temperamental and angry, and I was withdrawn and emotionally unavailable (as she put it, though I did try to be as ""available"" as possible).

I initiated no contact and actually moved away to be closer to my work. I heard through the grapevine that she had moved on very quickly to a succession of short relationships with what I would consider to be unfit partners - including my former roommate whose emotional disconnection made mine pale in comparison.

I didn't try to date in the past year and have just been working on things that I enjoy and staying as busy as possible. I've actually gotten to a point where I'm rather happy these days, or at least content. I love not having any drama in my life, and I love being able to do what I want, when I want. Selfish, I know! And I'm okay with that.

I ran into her once at a party last New Year's (she was with the former roommate and friend that night, and it was hard for me to see, but I put on a decent show of not being upset). We talked briefly and cordially, and that was it.

I've missed her like crazy at times, though I can always talk myself down by reminding myself of the problems we had while trying to be together.

The other day I woke up and found a text she had sent late the previous night: ""I miss you, I'm drunk. We should get together sometime if you want.""

It was very odd to see - in one way, it made me terribly sad and brought back a lot of memories. In another way, I felt a little bit vindicated as I had thought she'd moved on and was fine with our breakup while I had struggled with it for months and months. I guess we simply found solace in different places - she in the arms of new lovers, and myself in indulging in somewhat self-destructive behaviors (drinking, smoking).

I wrote an email back - very friendly but not romantic or wistful in the least. I caught her up on what I've been up to and wished her well. She didn't write back.

Probably related: After that, I started having dreams about her frequently (this was about a week ago). Last night's was a doozy: I was engaging in some shameful behavior or another and looked up to see her taking pictures through the window. I spent a long time trying to explain myself and apologize, but she simply stayed angry.

I don't really have a question, but just wanted to write this out and see if anyone relates. Obligatory apology for the Wall o' Text.",,False,,t5_2ra79,False,,,True,t3_1eu1rb,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1eu1rb/one_year_later_i_got_a_drunk_text_from_her_me_37m/,

For reference, I am female, he is male, and we are both 22.

Two winters ago I had a romantic/sexual dynamic going on with a boy I'd known since high school. ""Dating"" dating wasn't really a prospect because during the school year we live far away from each other, and plus he is friends with my ex. When the semester started up in the spring, I realized that I still had feelings for him, and he seemed to feel the same way, judging by our correspondence. But when I came home for vacation, he had gotten a girlfriend. 

It was my first bad breakup (though it couldn't really be called a ""breakup"" since we hadn't been in a relationship), so I took it pretty hard. I resolved very quickly to get over him and get on with my life.  But it has been nearly two years now, and I am very much not over him. He and the girl broke up after a couple of months, and we have both since graduated from college and are living at home in nearby towns.

This extended crush takes its toll on my life, because I see him all the time (it would be hard to avoid him without isolating myself from my other friends). I find myself dressing with him in mind, and when I'm with him I'm very conscious about how I am coming off. I get antsy when he takes too long to text me back. All stuff that is cute and fun at the start of a crush, but after feeling like this for more than 100 weeks, I am exhausted. By now a lot of these habits are just that: habits. And I have joined dating sites twice, but with little success (I couldn't bring myself to meet anyone in person). I suspect that on some level, I still believe we might someday get together again, and this is holding me back from a full level of commitment to the get-over. But *how* do I make myself think otherwise? Believe me, I've been telling myself to ""give it time"" for the past two years.

How to make it stop hurting?",14,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1dz34s/24f_i_proposed_and_he_used_it_as_a_time_to_tell/,"**TL;DR:** I proposed at our 3 year anniversary to my live-in boyfriend, truly feeling that he is/was the one. Out of left field, he rejects it, telling me I'm smothering him. I hate being that person, and it's killing me. 

**The background:**

Our relationship, up until now, seemed to have been going very smoothly. I'm absolutely in love with him - without a doubt - and I was under the impression (obviously) that he felt the same way. I'm admittedly a needy person, but so is he (or I thought so?). He used this proposal - after we had told our friends and family - as a chance to tell me how he ""really feels"" about my ""smothering him."" 

**Some background about how I proposed:**

* All I want is his love, nothing else. I've told him this. I don't even want a wedding, and I think it's silly to get a contract unless you need one when having kids or buying a house. I just wanted something to call him other than ""boyfriend,"" because he means so much more to me than that.
* I had his ring custom made. We met on a bike ride, so it was a tiny bike chain. We also have an ongoing thing where we write stories to one another. He is a stick bug, and I am a bird with red feathers. His ring had a tiny ruby on it, which was me giving him one of my red feathers. It didn't cost much, and I used the rest of the money we would have spent on a ring on an international trip - which we will in theory be going on at the beginning of June (he always said that he'd rather spend money on travel than on an engagement/wedding, and I agreed).
* Everything seemed okay - he said yes to my proposal, and he acted happy. I could tell something was a little weird the day after, but I assumed he was just feeling emotional (I mean, it's a big life change). Then, we went out to our favorite restaurant to ""celebrate,"" and along the way - while still on the subway train - he started to tell me how he really felt.
* He started out by telling me, jokingly, that I was turning into OAG. This was fine, and I laughed, but then he gave me a very strong hug to prove his point - almost a violent hug - and he accidentally slammed my glasses into my nose. This hurt physically on top of what I was feeling emotionally, and I started to get sad and suspicious that he didn't quite feel the same way I did.
* We get outside and take a walk before heading into the restaurant. I try to explain to him that I don't even care if we have a wedding - or if we're engaged for the next 10 years. I literally just wanted to show him how much he meant to me, that was all. I felt like he had far surpassed boyfriend status for me, and that he should know that. He's like family to me, and I of course thought he felt the same way towards me, or I wouldn't have asked him.
* We ended the night with lots of drinks, and he used it as a time to get things off his chest. I know it made him feel better, and I'm glad of that, but I feel like I've been hit by a truck. He said that he was excited for me to start my new job, because he knew I'd have longer hours, and he was looking forward to the alone time. He told me that when I flew home for the weekend last week, he really enjoyed that time alone. These are all things that are totally fine - alone time that I would have gladly given him - but he really hasn't spoken up until now. He just assumed I would ""get it,"" and I didn't, because I'm the needy one. I'm the OAG, so it didn't immediately occur to me. We used to have a lot more alone time at the beginning of our relationship, but it seemed like we stopped needing it. Turns out, he still needed it and I didn't. And because he didn't speak up, I just assumed he was in agreement.
* We live together, and I'm hurting so bad. While there's been no formal breakup and he's still wearing the ring, I feel like this is a major realization. I need to change, or this will have to end. And I'm not sure that I can change. I'm a goddamn needy person, and part of me asking him to marry me was admitting that I'm a needy person...and assuming he knew and loved me despite. I'm not Autistic, so my neediness was revealed little by little throughout our relationship - like a normal person. I'm not OAG in many ways (I usually don't talk about it when I feel needy), but when I love someone, I latch on. This has caused a few unrequited love situations in my life where people never even knew how I felt about them. 

I don't know how to move forward. I'm hurting so bad, and I can't find a way out of it. We're living together, so I can't cease contact. I don't think he wants to break up, but I feel like I was broken up with. My world feels like it's crumbling down, and our relationship seems like it was built on top of lies. He was just pretending to be as needy as me, maybe because he didn't want to hurt me. But it wasn't true. None of it was true.

Now I don't know what to do. I can't move, because our lease isn't up until October and I can't afford my half of the rent + another apartment (I'm in a large metropolitan area). I also can't move, because I just quit my job to start a new career. My internship/education will wrap up at the end of October, so I guess I could leave then, but what to do in the meantime?

I feel like I can't heal unless we take some time off, but I can't take some time off while we're living together. I don't have any good friends in this city, and my family is far away...and I certainly don't have the money to rent out a space until October. 

I took off work today and told my boss that we had a death in the family. The truth is, I just couldn't bear going into work like this literally a day after I came in so ridiculously happy that my SO had said yes. My emotions are careening like crazy, to say the least. I don't know if I should take off for the rest of the week and travel, maybe? Go up to Portland? But I feel like that would just be me being sad in another city...I'm not very good at traveling alone. Or being alone for that matter. Like I said, I'm needy.

I tried so hard to get that second chance with you, when after the first time you told me you didn't see a future with me because my life wasn't going anywhere, I'm 25 and I wasn't in school, and I was living at my moms, you're 19 , have your own apartment (Which your parents help you afford) and go to school. 

So I  buckled down, enrolled into school showed you I meant business, I changed myself not for you, but for myself and the memory of my father. You had no right to play me like you did.

I worked hard to get back into your life, and I did. Even when you were seeing another guy I never gave up and it paid off... That night I came over, that night you broke it off with him , I should have known something was fucked up... But I ignored it, I allowed myself to continually be in love with you, because you were a great person. We got along so well and our lives pretty much echoed the same story... 

After a week of me showing you I meant business, you asked me to be your boyfriend again, and I gladly took that opportunity. I had improved on everything that made the first time fail, I was more open with communication, going back to school and thanks to you I was a generally nicer person...

Various times I woke up sweating, from nightmares that you had left me and I was alone again, you kept reassuring me that you weren't going to leave me... you lied...

You convinced me to do some amazings things and I guess I should thank you for that...

You convinced me to get a puppy, a PUPPY, not only for myself but for your dog to have a playmate... even knowing that if we broke up I wouldnt be able to take her back home with me... You convinced me that you weren't going to break up with me, and that you were going to help me raise her... again you lied...

A week after that, you said you ""Loved me but weren't in love with me"" After all I had given you, all I had done for you, I gave you the world, made you laugh, comforted you, took you out, helped you around the apartment... then you lied again...

Your ex was at your apartment a few days before you broke up with me, asking you to ""Talk""... That saturday you broke up with me he was AT YOUR APARTMENT and he ""STAYED THE NIGHT"" It doesn't matter doing what. 

YOU LIED TO ME about it, after I had found out, you sat there and lied to me even though I already knew the answers to my questions... and now look at this bullshit, you're best friends with him at work, and you've basically thrown me into the fucking garbage...

He cheated on you, LIED to you, treated you like SHIT throughout your entire relationship. He was LAZY and unmotivated, and from what people tell me he's not even as good looking as I am. He dragged  you down and I brought you up, if it wasn't for me you'd be dead from killing yourself, and this is how you repay it? By going back to the same situation? HE LIED About his fucking COUSINS DEATH to your face, TWICE. 

Who the fuck does that? And who the fuck are you to sit there and treat ME like shit, when all I wanted to do was give you the world, and show you that you deserved to be treated right.

You played me for an idiot, I may act immature at times, just because I have a personality and I don't act like a god damned drone all the time, excuse me. you're 19, I'm 25, I know what the fuck I want out of life and love, you don't even know what love is.

So enjoy getting treated like shit again, when he lies to you and breaks your heart I wont be there, I won't be your fall back guy or your pillow, because I have more respect for myself than that, and I'm sure as fuck a better person than you are.

So go ahead, turn everyone at work against me, I don't fucking care, I've dealt with assholes before and quite honestly I can do better work on my own. Use me as your sob story, tell everyone about how I tried to get you back, mock me, insult me, I DONT CARE. All you did was lead me on, use me as some sort of rebound... 

It just hurts, all the stuff we did, the things we'd been through... and you just threw it all away for garbage, and you sit there and tell me that you dont want to get back together...

I did nothing but treat you right, like I was raised... you did nothing but play petty mind games.

She cited reasons of me lacking financial security, her feeling stagnant, and her not liking my lazy behaviors.

2 weeks later, and I have finally moved on. 

Now, I'm not saying I'm 100% moved on. I still wish we could talk things through, give it another shot with the vast amount of differences I have made in my life these past weeks. But I feel the ache lessen, I feel my mind focusing on other things.

I have been able to witness her behaviors in a single lady setting, and tho I'm not privy to all of them, I am not liking what I see. I hope for the best for her, but I don't find myself even remotely interested in opening up that box of rocks.

So, whatever you do after your breakup, I want to give some advice from my standpoint.

1) Make sure you sit down and write down your differences. What didn't you like about her, what didn't she like about you. Quantify these, and find out what you could do better for the next person you meet. What you don't want to get in a relationship with again. It will help you pare down the possible relationship candidates.

2) No Contact helps, but if you get the opportunity to talk things through, do it. Nothing is worse than not knowing. Communication is a key aspect of life, whether it be work, relationships, or family. Talk things out calmly, and if you cannot do so, try again another time.

3) Remember that even tho she was your world, or he was your best friend, there will be more fish in the sea. Take your time to repair, collect your thoughts, strategize your game-plan, and then go out there!

I've been distracting myself.. 

I went to the movies. The special effects reminded me of his work. I went to pick out movies to watch at home, all the titles of movies we've watched together and movies he's watched before me. 

I watch my favorite TV shows. I remember the silly comments he made about this episode and that one. 

I try to read the book I was reading before we ended. I remember him asking me what the book was about and I remember his opinions after I told him about it. 

I go to the gym, and I remember the two of us working out together and how me taught me to control my breathing while weight lifting. I remember watching the muscles of his arms and legs as he worked. 

The restaurants we went to. The bike trails and the hiking trails we covered. 

We were together all the time. The only times we spent apart were when we were at work. All of the memorable parts of life, we've shared together. 

So how do I get rid of all of these reminders? To erase these reminders is to erase all things I would consider ""living"". We even brushed our teeth/showered together all the time. 

This is incredibly painful and much more difficult than I ever imagined. I know that one day I will look back on this and I will think that ""I am over it,"" but that's assuming that I can survive this. 

I need some help. I've contacted a counselor, but I am apprehensive. I've never sought help via counselling before and the thought of breaking down in tears in front of a complete stranger is terrifying.

(A bit of a rant) 23m 22f,14,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cfqio/after_35_years_this_is_how_you_handle_things_a/,"For you to handle things the way you did, and pretty much discard me like a piece of garbage after me dedicating my life to you for 3.5 years faithfully is the biggest slap in the face.  What's worse is that you tried to turn this around on me like it was my fault. ""The distance"" did this to us. NO, you giving up and then letting me try as hard as I possibly could to make it work did this.  You cheating (to quote Beyonce: WHOOPS I BET YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T KNOW) did this. 

 You made me take amtrak out to you, only to be 10 minutes late to the station and then subsequently break up with me. You offered me no real reason for the breakup, no support, not even a ride home.  My dad having to come pick me up at midnight in tears disgusts me.  You disgust me.  

After everything we've been through, specifically in the last 2 weeks, I figured that you would have more of a heart about this than you did.  The person I met and fell madly in love with in college would have more tact than this.  More balls.  You are a coward and I sincerely hope that you feel guilty for how you treated me for the rest of your life.  

You didn't even have the balls to look me in the face when you did it.  As per usual, I had to coax the conversation out of you because you are an emotionally stunted child.  I am still in such shock right now, the coldness in your face and the complete lack of emotion is hard to believe.  

P.S. I know you did something really fucked up a month ago when you called me drunk and professed your undying love to me and asked me to move in with you (out of GUILT).  Then you couldn't even be real about you not wanting to move in with me, and let me find out by walking in on your roommate talking about places you guys were looking into.  I know you cheated.  Your roommates got awkward around me for no reason in the last few weeks, and you started being secretive with your phone and your social media accounts.  The real kicker is that after I asked you to leave your relationship status up for a day until it sunk in, you IMMEDIATELY went on and hid it.  Your response? ""I didn't feel comfortable with it up there.""  You are so bad at covering your cheating and lies.  It just astounds me because you had no problem fucking me a week and a half ago, but now all of a sudden you're so over me you can't even break up with me in a decent way?  

 Maybe you wanted to devastate me, I don't know.  All I do know is I am left feeling so bitter and low and worthless because you broke up with me in the worst possible way.  I'm pissed that I didn't clock you right in your stupid little face when you did it.  I should have.  I should have screamed and demanded you be a man, instead of being pathetic about a relationship which you clearly did not give two shits about.  

You are not a man.  A man does not leave someone they supposedly loved for 3.5 years the way you did.  Not right after what happened.  Not without giving me a real reason, or even comfort.  I feel so pathetic for having to beg you to hold me one more time, and having to ask you to give me a real hug before we parted ways.  And for calling you, only to have you ignore me.  A day after you broke it off.  Did you seriously think that I would be capable of letting go of the biggest part of my life in less than a day?  Just because you are over the relationship doesn't mean that you don't owe me anything.  

Anyway, /r/breakups, thanks for reading.  I needed to get some of this out because I feel like it's poison burning a hole in my stomach.  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't do anything but waiver between depression, rage, and denial.  

A final note to you: I hope you continue to be miserable.  I hope you regret your decision, or at least the cowardly way you handled this.  I wish nothing but the worst for you, because you gave me nothing but the worst when you ended things.  I hope your new girlfriend breaks your heart as badly as you broke mine.  I hope you come crawling back so I can reject you so hard your fucking pea head explodes.  Fuck you.  Fuck off.  Fuck you and all of your friends.  FUCK. 

[UPDATE] I'm pretty early on in this process (day 5), and I am still going through cycles of anger-depression-rage-sadness-etc. BUT I will say that I just did something for myself (finally making that career move I've wanted to make but have been too busy worried about this relationship to actually do) and it feels really great.  It made me not think about him for just a few minutes at least, and gave me a much needed ego boost.  If you can, take a few minutes today to do something you've been wanting to do (starting a diet/workout regimen, applying for that dream job, etc.). I hope that all of you are feeling better by the day, thank you all for the words of encouragement, or simply commiserating with me! &lt;/3 ---&gt; &lt;;3 ---&gt; &lt;3 ",,False,,t5_2ra79,1366239290.0,,,True,t3_1cfqio,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cfqio/after_35_years_this_is_how_you_handle_things_a/,

I just want a stable relationship with someone, where we see each other for who we are and we're okay with that person. Even if our hormones are not going completely crazy, we'll be there for each other and love each other. We'll both try to make it work, even when it gets hard.

Tl;dr Best friends of 8 years, met in high school, she moved away overseas (she's in England, I'm in California), started a long distance relationship in year 8, she broke up with me, I'm still hurting.

So, it's been an extremely strange journey for me. She flew out to see me last summer and it was downright magical. Then, the time apart came back and she was miserable. Then, I flew out to see her. Much to my SHOCK, she broke up with me the first night I was there. Who does that? Why wouldn't she just wait to see how my visit there goes before springing the news on me.

weeks prior to me flying over there, I could tell something was off with her. It was like something was on her mind. I asked her what was wrong. NOPE. nothing. didn't want to talk about it. ""let's just be excited for you flying over here"".

oh okay. cool. let's just not discuss our relationship as a couple. Just make this decision for the both of us. It's not like I've been the optimist the entire time, trying to give you the strength, by conversing with you, to keep the relationship going despite the distance...oh no wait, that's totally what I did THE ENTIRE TIME.

""Is this something we can talk about?"" was the first thing I said after you sprung the news on me. You just shook your head. I ""didn't do anything wrong""...and I ""shouldn't feel like I failed you because you failed me""....but you still love me...a lot...Then you urged me not to talk about it at all during my stay. ""Let's just enjoy this"". No. You broke up with me, and now I have to stay in your parents' house...I have to meet your friends...I have to meet your family...and your pets...and go do things with you...I have to celebrate Christmas..AND New Years with you...and not with my family...6,000 miles awat...no, that's bullshit.

""Not now"" is what you said when I let my emotions creep in and put in a ""mood"" around you. Then when? hmm? when? When would be a good time for you? Let me just wait around until it's a ""good time"" for you to talk, or not talk, about what just happened...

So now I fly back home...and you want NC...because...something...idk...you broke up with me because you couldn't handle the distance...then I get back, and I try to talk to you about it and you tell me that you don't think we ""belong together""...and then I hear from your sister that you're ""not in love with me anymore""...oh okay so those 2 months of you struggling to decide whether or not you passed ""loving me"" into ""being in love with me"", until you decided that yes...you did pass it....you can just erase all that? you can just ""undo"" that emotional progress?

Oh no but you don't want to talk about it. You don't want to talk AT ALL. You don't want me to talk until I'm ""feeling 100% about everything again"" because you want to continue to be friends.

No. Do you have any fucking idea how much of myself I devoted to you? How much of my life I shared with you? You stayed in my fucking house for 3 fucking months. You became great friends with my little sister...my mom fell in love with you...you became her ""daughter in law""...

SO many things in my life are tainted now, because of this break up. I can't eat/look at/think about steak anymore because it'll just remind me of that one date.

Certain animals you taught me about? Nope

Certain animals I taught you about? Nope

Certain foods you introduced me to? Nope

Certain foods I introduced you to? Nope

Certain shows you introduced me to? shows I introduced you to? movies? bands? songs? ideas? knowledge?  Nope. They're all ruined.

Neither one of us is doing this correctly. Neither one of us is doing the right thing. Somewhere between my desire to hold to every thought, every memory, and every idea forever..and your complete lack of Give-A-Fuck is the right way to go about this...

Do I still love you? Yes

Am I still in love with you? Yes

Do I want you back? Yes but it'd be different.

Am I going to sit around and wait until you come back? I can't. 

Should you sit around and wait for me to be 100%? I want you to...but I have no idea how long that'll be.

We have that joke..You're the kitten to my puppy...you've lost interest...and you want nothing to do with me anymore...but I'm still sitting at the door, waiting anxiously and whining for you to come back and clawing at the door...

I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. I WILL NEVER REJECT YOU. I WILL NEVER ABANDON YOU. I WILL ALWAYS COME BACK...

...just text me and tell me you made a mistake...please..just...drop the pride for one second...just tell me you made a mistake...I told you from the start...I'll never agree with this decision...we didn't have to break up...

Once we hit 18 we moved into the city together to study, and have been living in a small 1 bedroom apartment together for two years. Things had been tough this year given that we were unable to be there for each other as much as before due to studies. She had taken the habit of studying at the library from 8AM to 10PM, even on weekends, because had a found someone to study with (we go to different universities) and he basically told her to be there with him or she'd fail her studies. At one point she starts texting with him every night non-stop after getting back home until she went to bed, despite my attempts at getting her to be with me at least when we were together at home.

We weren't going out as much as we did when we got together, but I assumed that was normal as the puppy love phase doesn't last indefinitely. I still tried to go out with her at least once a week, but she was either too tired or had something else planned with her friends. When I went with her to the library so I could spend some time with her, she ignored my presence altogether. At eventually voiced my concern for our relationship, asking her to spend a little less time at the library and some more time with me, despite feeling like a gigantic douche asking her to favor me over her studies, request which she ignored. I feel like I know this is going to end, but I'm in love with her, so I continue to try.

Fast forward two months and it's a saturday. I spent the whole week making sure we'd go out on that day, making sure she had no plans. Saturday evening she tells me she's going to a party hosted by a friend of the guy who she spends all day at the library with. I'm devastated at this point, try to reason with her but she still goes anyway. She doesn't come home that night. Sunday evening she comes home, I confront her about the situation. She tells me she slept with library guy saturday night and tells me it's over. I feel empty inside, destroyed. This was two weeks ago. I still feel completely destroyed.

Financial reasons oblige, we're stuck living together until june, and even sleeping in the same bed. I haven't been sleeping well if at all since it happened, but it hasn't been affecting me emotionally. Last night she spent the night at his place, and had to sleep alone for the first time in ages. I dreamt it was happening again, woke up sweating and feeling terrible.

I don't know what to do or what to think. She keeps on justifying her actions, saying I neglected her, that she tried everything to save us, and doesn't want to stay with me. I've always had strong thoughts on cheating, being completely against it, but I can't help myself and I can't bring myself to hate her, I don't want us to end. Yet I feel hurt in so many ways, she had a choice, she could have ended it before doing anything (had she told me litterally 1 day before), but chose to end it by hurting me. I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to feel, I'm completely lost.

Is her cheating me justified? Is it normal for me to want to continue to the relationship? What's the best way to handle this kind of situation and move on, I really need help..

I don't really know who to talk to so I thought I'd give you a try. My ex boyfriend and I met on Reddit and talked for months while playing games and just generally hanging out online with mutual friends.  
We hit it off and realized that we liked each other a lot, but didn't think things could really go anywhere. A subreddit meetup came up last summer and we decided to both make a trip to it to meet each other as well as friends from the sub. We hung out the the whole weekend, talked about everything, and had a wonderful time, flew back to our respective homes and lives, and continued things as normal for a couple days.  
A few days later we talked about the possibility of a long distant relationship, I was hesitant, but I really liked this guy and wanted to try to make it work. We discussed the situation and would have rather tried it out then live with not knowing.
A plan was made to see each other in person as much as possible and he booked a flight to come stay a week or so before Uni started and so it began...  
  
The time went by and things were rough at times, but we always had each other and were able to pull each other through the rough patches. The visits also helped, we've been able to book flights to each other nearly once a month or every 2 months and have tried to make the trip last a week or 2 depending on the holiday time I could get at work and the time off from Uni that he could get.  
It was hard not being able to give him a hug, or just lie down and cuddle whenever we needed it, but we were getting through and I love him more and more every single day. and the same for him.  
We've talked about moving closer to each other. I've applied to jobs, and would be happy to move to a different city, I've graduated from a uni in this town and just stuck around because of convenience more than anything. Sadly, I haven't received a single job offer and I wouldn't be able to move without securing a job because of student loans, etc. He's also talked about applying to the uni in my town and potentially coming here.
  
Last week though, I found out he had been struggling with not being close and had talked about it with friends. He didn't want to bring it up because he wasn't sure how he felt about things. That Wednesday, he talked to me. He wasn't sure how long he could keep up with it, the distance had been wearing on him. He didn't want to end it, but couldn't keep this up forever. He lost hope. We continued to talk on skype and things like normal, but the conversation was still in both of our minds.  
On Friday, we were both upset. How do you love someone so much, not be able to be at their side? It really does eat at you after a while. After a long long talk and much crying on both sides, he ended it. I was crushed, he was crushed, no one is happy.  
We still wanted to talk, but decided we needed space to get through the worst. I've cried my self to sleep nearly every night. Earlier this week he sent a message ""Am I the only one who thinks this sucks?"" Of course not. We miss each other even more then before and talked about it again. He put in an application to my uni even though it will be nearly double the cost of his current one and I've continued to apply for jobs.  
Relationship limbo, we're not together, but not apart. I don't talk to him everyday, a few quick words once in a while about nothing or an occasional I love you. I'm holding on to hope and it seems like he is too, but I still can't shake the dread of what if these plans don't work out.

Desperate for advice, 24(f) left me, 25(m) after 5 years - in the middle of the day while at work, then my dad starting dying...",16,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1aio4r/my_first_reddit_post_desperate_for_advice_24f/,"Hi all

This is my first post, and something I've struggled to force myself to do since discovering this incredibly useful Subreddit a week ago. I feel it'll be healthy for me to put this out there, and I'd appreciate any advice you're willing to give. 

Background:

Six years ago I met the 100% perfect girl. We hooked up 2 days later and had a very intense relationship for 6 weeks before she left for a gap year. We were both young, and I was struggling with severe depression.

Six months into the long distance she called it off, and I self destructed. A few months later she came back to the country, and I actively won her back through kindness and respect. 

We moved in together shortly afterwards, things weren't great at either of our family homes, and I followed my passion, becoming a cub reporter at a well-regarded broadsheet paper. For two years it was great, although I struggled and swallowed down events and stories I was party to and witnessed on the job (we live in an incredibly violent country, and I covered a lot of crime...)

Two years since getting the job, they were forced to let me go due to declining circulation. I blamed myself, for not being good enough at what I was born to do, and ended up at an advertising agency. A week before starting the job, I started smoking a lot of weed. I didn't realise it for over a year, but I was incredibly depressed and literally smoked myself away from it all. During this time she tried to help me, desperately, and our codependency reached worse levels. It took a physical and mental toll on her, and the effects were there for everyone to see.

In September last year I found a text message from a guy on her phone, and after a very messy, horribly painful weekend she admitted that they had sexted a few times about a year back. She put the blame on me, saying my depression had made her do something she wouldn't have done (but I realise today this was only a few months into it, and not nearly as bad as it became).

Two months ago, she left while I was at work. Taking all her belongings. I got home early as I was sick, and saw the Dear John letter. In shock, I called and begged to see her. She agreed, but said she only really wanted to speak in a week after some time. I saw her, already deciding never to touch the drugs again, arranging a therapy session. I saw her and it was painful, I was in shock. She had said she wasn't happy, and that she was worried, but never addressed the fact that she was considering leaving. I guess she couldn't, I was an emotionally abusing wreck who broke her. 

That Saturday, after seeing her for a week and having a healthy conversation, my father fell incredibly ill and was admitted to ICU. She found out, and told me she wanted to come through to my family's house to be there as a friend, but couldn't talk about us. I was a wreck, faced with having lost her and losing my father, and begged in a way that I never had before.

Over the next three days we had several messy phonecalls where I kept overstepping the line and begging. I then asked for no contact, but we ended up having our first real fight a week later after she emailed me about our landlord needing to fix a door. I then asked for NC for a month, and during this time have actively worked on myself like never before in my life, losing 9kgs, started yoga and a martial art, making new friends and rekindling old ones. I've also tackled my fears and self-doubt, and other intense reasons for not going to see someone despite her begging and my life falling apart over two years. I can process feelings and emotions in a rational, healthy way for the first time in my life.

Last week I met with a very kind, respectful mutual friend and told her that I felt I needed to do the right thing, see her and take account of my actions and ensure that she understands that she could do nothing for me, and that it was wrong yet loving for her to stay for so long. The friend put this to her (the ex had actually said that she wasn't going to see me after the month, and possibly only near a year later...). 

Yesterday was my 25th birthday, and she texted to wish me, saying she knew we were going to talk and if I could do it this Saturday. After a few hours I replied, letting her know that she shouldn't feel obligated, and suggested we meet in a park, possibly grab food afterwards. She replied in a cold manner, saying ""I think that will be fine"" and said she'd rather meet me there than be picked up.

The tone and words upset me greatly, making me feel like she feels she's doing me a favour, instead of both of us getting closure. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for, other than advice on how to go about processing the above. I feel I need to do the right thing and come clean, and leave the country (a plan I'm actively working on) with my head held high. She's told the friend that she'll never give me another chance, and that hurt but at least hit home that it's over. This is a shame, as we're highly compatible and would probably be married in a year if I hadn't fallen apart - it was discussed and on the cards. 

TL;DR

Real love, bad relationship after 3 years, 2 years following was one-sided emotional abuse from me to her, escaping in weed and destructing.
She cheated on me, blamed me. 
For the next 6 months, used it as an emotional club.
2 months ago, she leaves in the middle of the day and I take inventory of my life, improving it drastically. During that time, father hits ICU.
Now, 2 months later she's giving me a chance to talk and account for my actions, but will never get back together with me, and is resentful of me and my actions.

P.S - my father eventually recovered, having an 80% chance of dying. He's getting better, slowly. 

P.P.S - I might have left out details in the rush. Feel free to ask for anything. 

*edit* just noticed I used ""starting"" in the subject line. Argh. Apologies. Cringe.

When I left the Army in 2011, I decided to move down here to be with her, rather than go back home to Chicago.  I was unemployed for about five months, and about another month from being homeless.  I cooked, cleaned, worked my ass off for her to live comfortably.  I got her a gym membership, a new puppy, took her to conventions and on weekly (sometimes twice or three times a week) date nights, etc.  We had been living together for a while, and I thought everything was fine.

I have seen shit that rocked my very moral and religious foundation, but this break up has seriously ripped my heart into shreds.  I'm not about to harm myself over it, but god damn this sucks.  I wish I had my Army buddies around to tell me to suck it up and hand me a beer.

She's in her lower 20's, I'm in my upper. She was my ""the one""...and she consistently let me believe that I was hers. Check my post history if you feel like it...some stuff has happened recently that I'd like to vent out. 

So a while back, I was feeling pretty good and had unblocked her from facebook. I didn't want to seem petty anymore and truly wanted to move on. She had said that she wasn't going to date anymore while getting her masters and that music was now her first and last love. A month ago, Valentine's Day to be exact...I notice that she's blocked me. It's complicated to describe, we have tons of mutual friends...and it was obvious she had blocked me that day. So what goes through my head...she doesn't want to see me anymore...she's over me...it was actually a weight lifted off of me after the sadness wore off a week later.

Until yesterday, when I noticed that she's unblocked me. I foolishly went to her page...and saw a couple of profile picture updates (that's the extent of her openness on facebook publicly)...one on a particular day 3 months after our breakup...a picture with her and another woman (oh we're both women, fyi) and a tag underneath it gushing that they were ""making it facebook official."" Okay so shes been dating someone new...since August? She was still texting me at that point...telling me she missed me...I mean to the DAY...I was on a camping trip and trying to block her out...she's made this new relationship ""official"" on facebook all while texting me that she wants to talk and misses me. I never pegged her for that type of person.

I hate this facebook drama. I'm pathetically still in love with her. I need to let go. I went ahead and blocked her again, and realized that I need to leave it that way for good. I've been working on myself this past year, and hit some pretty great strides. All day today I've been wondering why the hell she'd unblock me if she's so damn happy...I GOTTA LET GO.

I found out she moved out of her parents house, got an apartment with him. Something that really hit me hard, because that's all I wanted was to see each other every day and live together. She got promoted her job. She has everything asked for.

I've been trying to talk to other women and going to gym since New Years to work out to not be as skinny. I knew yesterday was coming, and tried to grit my teeth and make it a normal day. I wondered if she would contact me, and lo' and behold, she does. She texted me ""Happy Valentine's Day... yours is probably going better than mine"" I just shot back that she has everything she asked for, and to go make a fun dinner together (we did that last year) and asked why the hell she was contacting me. I told her ""you can tell yourself and everyone else whatever you want, but you and I both know why you contacted me today.""

Here I am sitting here wondering what the hell, why would she bother contacting me? I don't get why she would bother, knowing I'm most likely still single, which I am. They've apparently been fighting all the time before they got an apartment (I don't know anything after that) so I'm concluding that maybe now she's regretting her decision she made? I'm seriously getting really mixed signals from this crap. Maybe she feels trapped now that she has the apartment with him and is regretting everything because maybe he isn't what she thought he was?

Thanks ahead of time.

I just ended things with my boyfriend of two years and am unsure if I made a mistake. We live an hour apart and see each other most weekends. I like to keep active (hiking, camping, museums, traveling) while he likes to just hang out. He dislikes doing most things with the exception of very few activities, one of which is ultimate frisbee which we play together on several teams. Our different views on weekend activities have resulted with him either doing something he dislikes or me being antsy at home watching tv with him. We had a plan that after I graduate this summer I was going to move to his city in my own apartment and live there for the summer so we could spend more than the weekends with one another which would allow us the weekends to each separately do our preferred activities.  

Then I went on an eye opening short study abroad this winter in which I hung out constantly with people who love doing the things I like to do. It was amazing and made me realize how little I was living my life at home. Then upon starting this semester I was offered a few research positions across the country for the summer which obviously would interfere with my previous plans but would probably be spectacular experiences. 

I broke up with my boyfriend the other day because I know that I no longer want to spend my weekends doing nothing and that I will probably take up one of these research opportunities across the country and not be around for him. I am taking 23 credits this semester and have no time for him during the week. 

I know I probably did what was best for me but I can't help but feel so incredibly heartbroken. He did nothing wrong, he was my best friend and now I have lost him potentially forever. I was just wondering what anyone thought of such a situation. Am I being selfish for wanting to live my life to the fullest? Should I have put off some of these opportunities?

So I've been using every method at my disposal to talk her into an abortion. Mostly by promising her the world in exchange, but she's been adamant its not happening.  I've gotten more then a few reasons not to trust her (lol, I mean, since the last post).

So I told her that I'd changed my mind, that I was willing to play dad like she so desperately wanted. She is over-fucking-joyed, I know how stupid it sounds but it feels so nice to be able to make her that happy and simultaneously nauseating from guilt because I was lying. 

I said that I was worried about her and the child's health and had set up an appointment with a doctor who does pregnancy health. She's distrustful and scared of doctors but I talked her into it, by telling her how much I love her and need her to be healthy. The doctor was not a pregnancy specialist, just a general health guy. I set up the appointment and explained what ""we"" wanted before hand, explaining she was scared and distrustful of doctors, which helped me get what I wanted.

We got there and she didn't say a single word to anyone, which was awesome, if she'd payed attention she'd have understood what was happening. I had the doctor draw blood for a pregnancy test. We waited for hours. She understood we were waiting for tests to come back but did know that one was the only test being run, along with std tests.

when the doctor did the std tests (and I don't know any of the technical terms) it involved interacting with her vagina. She was not ok with this. I held her hand and whispered soothing nothings. I've never seen someone so uncomfortable before, she almost broke my hand squeezing so tight. I'd never felt so bad in my life.

Anyway we wait for hours, test comes back. **Not pregnant.** she freaks the fuck out. I breakup with her on the spot. She's sobbing hysterically. I give her $20 for a cab tell her I never want to hear from her again. She is not in control. I leave.

This was yesterday. I have about 100 missed calls from her, her sister and her mother. I feel like such a fucking scumbag. I can't believe I put her through all of that. I hadn't planned too, I meant do to the breakup at her home, but when she started crying I just didn't want to be near her.

I don't know what to do. She says she doesn't want to be done with me, but wants to see what else it out there...and it kills. Literally kills me. 

There are alot of things with her that I dont like.. she has no feelings, shes is not a very touchy feely person... she has trouble saying ""I love you"",, even to her parents.. she can be rude and crude without warning.., and the sex if every other week. (Long time for me lol)

But I don't know what to do without her. Cant move on.

**tl;dr**: Things were great, now there not. Probably better off without her but I'm heart broken and want her back. Cant move on. ",,False,,t5_2ra79,1373796842.0,,,True,t3_1i9q5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i9q5e/my_28f_gf_broke_up_with_me_21m_heartbroke/,

I have had a few sad moments thinking I'll be forever alone. But other than that I have been thinking about him less. 

Posting here time and again has helped me greatly I think.

Last night I really did a purge/cleaning of stuff. While I was cleaning up my room I gathered all the items he's given me and went through them. The cards I have from holidays I read each and every one  of them one last time and then burned them in my fireplace.

Some clothes his parents got me (I have no intention of wearing) put in a black plastic bag and will send them off to goodwill. Not very many items but no need to hold to them.

I'm giving this toy I received to a friend who lives far away so I don't have to look at it anymore. And I'm planning on selling a piece of jewelry and a few more gizmos I have he gave me that I just don't want anymore.

There are a few items I want to keep. I don't associate them with him even though he gave them to me. So I guess me keeping those things are okay.

I realized some of the items I have he gave me, have more negative memories attached to them and I just don't want them in my presence anymore.

I did have a dream about him the other night. But this time I didn't wake up annoyed or happy or anything. I didn't really care. And I'm okay with that.

I'm going on vacation soon and when I get back I just want to come home and have a fresh state of mind.

1373812725.0,12,self.BreakUps,1i9zd7,16/M (me) and 16/F broke up. I don't know what to feel.,18,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i9zd7/16m_me_and_16f_broke_up_i_dont_know_what_to_feel/,"Hello, if you are reading this, thank you for taking the time to and not disregard it due to my age.

My girlfriend of 8 months and I broke up yesterday. Reasons being she ""wasn't ready for a relationship"". (Please take note of this)

I was pretty unhappy most of the time in that relationship, and only a month recently was thinking about breaking up. 

It wasn't a terrible disaster relationship, she was my first true kiss, she was a gamer, but..I never felt like we clicked.
She never wanted to talk to me. In person she was okay, she would usually get stranded off to talk to a group of friends, and then notice me and walk to me and ask me what's wrong. (Which nothing was)

She was friends with a guy who was always all touchy feely, and i always felt uncomfortable about that, because my mind is a clusterfuck of paranoia sadly.
Luckily nothing happened between them (at least i hope not).

When I say we didn't click, I mean we didn't have much in common. My humor was a little different, and game preferences, and even what i wanted in a relationship i suppose.

Anyways, so we broke up yesterday, and y'know, it kinda sucks but it doesn't. I don't know how to explain it. The part that sucks about it is that now my mind will get all paranoid and think her up with other guys, having more fun than with me. Also that she is probably sighing in relief or something.
The part that doesn't suck is that I am free and can go back out there when time heals me to find a girl that does share my interests. 

She was never quite serious about the relationship, but when i was with her, i was the happiest guy ever. I don't know. 

The thing, the most important thing i got out of all this, is she used the exact same words to break up that all my other 4 exes from before used. ""I'm not sure that I am ready for a relationship"". 
After months of dating, they all say that. I just don't understand. 

But I tend not to worry about this. I just feel numb, and I don't want to miss her. I want to move on already, it is not worth it to cry over her, or be sad and depressed. Yet my mind plays tricks on me. It gives me dreams of us together, then dreams of her cheating on me, then dreams of me going to a psychologist to get help on relationships.

I guess right now my mind is a clusterfuck, i just need to find a way to co-operate with all this. I know it ain't the end of the world. I know i can live without her, but I don't know why my mind is being this way, why I am being held back and thinking up all these stupid thoughts.

Thanks for reading.
Just needed to vent for a little bit.

I tried to avoid him and everyone associated with him...but I couldn't, the event wasn't big enough.  And it hurts so very much.  It's been 10 months since we broke up, that's as long as we were together, and it still hurts *every single day*.  I've seen divorces that were less emotionally-traumatic than our breakup.  It hurts, it aches, and I have given up believing it'll ever stop.  I should be able to get over it, it was all just pretend anyway, right?  Obviously he never loved me, and I was a fool to love him.  I believed in him, I loved him, and I still miss him so much, and he's just gone on, back to the rest of his life, easy as pie.  I'm nobody, nothing.  A ghost of a pretend-gf, crying at home like a loser.

Note: I've been advised that this is ""normal"", that ""asshole ex"" is to be expected...but I'm one of those people who is always friends with my exes.  But not this one.",,False,,t5_2ra79,1373781336.0,,,True,t3_1i9gyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i9gyn/i_39f_saw_him_today/,

There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about you. I've tried convincing myself that I don't want to be with you. I've tried seeing someone else to see if I could have the connection we have wth someone else. I wake up every morning thinking about you. It's just ridiculous how I pretend every day. 

The problem is that I know you aren't good for me. I'm more negative when I'm around you. I hope you're still going to counseling and talking about things. Because I think if you overcome your problems we can be amazing together. I don't know how long that will take and I really wish I did. 

I sincerely hope you're doing okay. It kills me to think how much I pushed you away and tried convincing myself that I felt differently.
