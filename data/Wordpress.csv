[Injected Code](http://pastebin.com/7yPUXDNJ)

Basically the wordpress site is injected with a hyperlink that is positioned top:-999 so that the user never actually sees it but the search engine does. What is most surprising about this is the following:

1. This code is not being generated within wordpress, it's being injected via the Apache server (This was confirmed by completing deleting and whipping the webserver and then setting up a blank wordpress installation, the code is injected still).

2. Not a single line of PHP on the webserver is generating this code, I've downloaded the entire server to confirm and searched all the php,javascript, html files and this code isn't in existence anywhere in the source of any of the files.

3. More Isolation test were conducted, whatever is injecting this code into the wordpress site its doing it on a higher level that the GoDaddy Customer has access to, we believe the code is being injected via the Apache server. Which means that Godaddy servers are being hijacked and Godaddy is keeping a tight lip on it.

1. GoDaddy before was attempting to tell us that they aren't responsible for our sites security and that we are responsible for securing and monitoring our site, which is fine if the problem was something that we had the ability to fix.After calling Technical support at GoDaddy and showing them the evidence that we collected to prove that nothing on our site was producing this injection code for ""car Insurance"" and that the problem was on their end. When we proved to them without a doubt that their apache servers were being hacked, they changed their ton of voice, they said that they would look into it and asked us not to tell anyone about this for ""Security"" issues.

4. After doing a web search of sites displaying ""By INSURANCQUO car insurance"" 99% of the domains that are displaying this information in their meta data are:

* Running Wordpress 
* Running Godaddy hosting
* Have been infected within the last week

After running more test and inspecting more code and getting professional opinion, It was concluded that ""GODADDY, LLC"" has been hacked. So If you are running a wordpress site on Godaddy hosting be warned, your site might be linking to either of the domains bellow,

1st http://loansavior.co.uk/
2nd http://www.insurancequoteuk.co.uk/

We've been monitoring page(s) indexes from search engines since about 15 hours ago, this exploit or whatever it is, is spreading and its spreading fast. So far about 230,000 pages have been infected and its increasing by the hour. I tried searching around for any information about this current exploit but I haven't found anything discussing it. Hoping to give enough warning to individuals before their site is compromised. 

If you google search ""By INSURANCQUO car insurance""  in quotations and then sort by date you'll see how current this threat it and how its targeting only ""Godaddy"" hosted sites. 

Additionally there is a new version of the injected code being spawned as of about 8 hours ago , if you google search ""By EVLNS payday loans and By INSURANCQUO car insurance"" in quotations and then sort by date you'll see another version of the same inserted script.


Note: I remember, last week that ANON was targeting wordpress sites although there is no evidence to suggest that this is connected to ANON yet it might be a good topic to look into.

Thanks y'all.

I think I've figured out a price, and for a project like this (it's literally probably going to just be a theme install and find some images, and walkthrough the basics of Wordpress), shouldn't take too long, and I'll be sure to tell them exactly what they are getting. **But, does anyone have an example of their contracts they use for clients?

Ideally, we could pool our resources to develop a distributed firewall plugin that would allow all of the plugin users to immediately ban IPs identified as botnet attackers.  Just throwing that out there.  

This is a small portion of the WordFence Failed Login/IP Block log for just one of the websites that we host: http://minus.com/lbmCkA6ehLHyot
********************

My company hosts several hundred WordPress sites on collocation servers in a Chicago data center. I have personally watched these attacks unfold on several occasions and I'd like to shed some light on a few details that may not be common knowledge, but may be of some use to WordPress users.

1. These attacks are ongoing. - The first attack occurred in April, but we have observed at least one resurgence per month since the initial attack.
2. The attackers are getting smarter - Although the first attacks focused on users called ""admin"", more recent attacks have also attempted logins with usernames parsed from the domain. For example, failed logins for examplesitename.com might include the users ""example"", ""site"", ""name"", ""examplesite"", etc. It's only a matter of time before attackers begin parsing usernnames from post authors.
3. Your server is effectively getting DDoS'd - Even if user accounts are never compromised, each attempted login sends a query to MySQL. Sustained brute force attacks will cause your server's memory usage to spike, potentially taking the server and your website offline. Because W3TC and CloudFlare allow pass-through access to the wp-login.php page, neither will effectively protect you from this type of attack (although the reduced load from legitimate traffic helps to keep resources free).
4. This is still news to a lot of hosting companies - Many small web hosts and even a few larger ones are not fully aware of the extent and impact of these attacks. Unfortunately, that means the responsibility for securing all of the WordPress sites on any given server, often falls onto the individual users who manage their own sites, many of whom are not technically inclined.

Subsequently, I've created a short outline of methods that we've found are somewhat effective in minimizing the damage these attacks have on our servers.

1. Install WordFence - The following settings in Options have given us the best results: http://minus.com/lbuz3yvB3tyDKV These settings will immediately impose a 30 day ban on any IP that submits a nonexistent username, or three failed logins from a good username within a thirty minute period. Banned IPs are redirected to a static page, thereby reducing the server load. Legitimate users can unlock their IP by sending an email confirmation from that page.
2. Use caching - You want legitimate users and visitors to be able to access the website, but you don't want their traffic to make the problem worse. Caching allows the server to free up memory resources in order to more effectively deal with the incoming botnet traffic.
3. Use CloudFlare - Same reason as above. Also, CloudFlare is better prepared to mitigate distributed attacks like botnets and DDoS attacks.

Good luck everyone!

In order to remedy this we created a new company and I'll be handling all of the interaction with the non-Japanese speaking folk who contact us.

We are planning to build a few services on top of CF7 - mail magazines/mail list management and also some CRM systems.

And while many of the top results for what you are searching for may work, they probably aren't the best way to get the results you are looking for.

WordPress is a platform with tens of millions of users, so filtering through the best way of doing things can be a huge pain. Why not create dialog here, in a community of WP over 3,000 enthusiasts about common issues? From a quick scan of recent posts, it seems there are only about 40 posts to /r/WordPress front page a week. That is hardly a lot to keep up with, and is far from spamming the front page.

Out of the 3,300 readers of /r/WordPress, I can't be the only one who wants to see a community that builds up, rather than tears down. I've been using WordPress since it's inception and I learn something new everyday. Creating dialogue about the best way to solve a problem should be a priority in my opinion.

My Wordpress installation got hacked a while ago and now my domain appears on websites of ill repute... 
 
I get hundreds of hits to *wp-login.php*, from IPs originating all over the world, from Ukraine to Quebec, always different so I can't block any which one. They're probably attempting to brute-force the login. They're also trying malicious */theme-i-dont-really-have/thumb.php* files (which end up 404ing now because I'm not infected anymore).

 
**What's a good way of getting rid of this nuissance?**

 
I could try renaming *wp-login.php* to something like *secret-wp-login.php*, or I could set an .htaccess to prompt for password when coming up to *www.mysite.com/wordpress/wp-login.php*, then if you don't know it: 401 Unauthorized. This last one I tried, but it's inconvenient :( You have to type the .htpasswd user + pass, then you get to the actual Wordpress login form, another user + pass. Meh.

**What could I do (and why), and what are other ways of drawing less attention to myself and avoiding malware, spammers and hackers?**
Thanks!

&gt; * WordPress Core API
* WordPress Features
* WordPress Unit Tests
* WordPress Assets
* Security
* PHP Quality
* HTML/CSS Quality
* JavaScript Quality

This is great news. Now we don't have to be afraid of the quality of the themes and can get away from the conflicts and bullcrap.

I was rooting around in my server, just doing a simple *rename this webspace* (changing it from the old domain to the new), and one misclick and: everything was deleted and moved.

The database was gone, the files were prefixed with .old, nothing was uploading correctly, and everything was broken.  [**Fffffffff....**]

I had been backing up the database on regular basis and exporting posts every week - but it had never occurred to me that I might actually *need* those at some point.  I had always been careful with my site - never to break it, never to need the emergency rations I had so carefully set aside.

Once tragedy struck, I had realized the painfully obvious: my mindset had placed me in a state of complacency and I had never formulated a plan on how I would actually get the backups to work properly for me.  

All of the images for my posts were scattered across my computer in so many places - even if I did import posts, what about the images?  20 pages or so of posts that would I need to go through, by hand, to scour for broken images and resources that were no longer there (to replace).

Now, I know some of you **have** plans, and when that fateful moment happens and you are forced to restore, you'll know exactly what to do, and when to do it - and all of your resources and ducks will be in neat, tidy rows, ready to be placed back in their appropriate places.

However, to those of you like me, who were so careful to keep backups, but never actually thought about how to deploy the backups once they were necessary, start thinking about it. 

I know I'm going to from now on.

It's kind of a complicated issue, so I figured I'd see if I could explain it, and save people some trouble.  The problem has some parallels to timthumb, but a lot of differences too - so the same approach to make sure you were safe from timthumb doesnt work in this case.

Uploadify itself is not inherently insecure.  Timthumb was.  The problem comes when plugin/theme developers don't use/secure uploadify properly.  So:  It's not so easy as it was with timthumb - I can't just say ""You're using timthumb between versions 1.09 and 2.0, so you're vulnerable"".  In this case, we have to say ""You're using x version of x theme, so you're probably vulnerable"".  It's frustrating.

Fortunately, itpixie.com has done the best job I've seen so far of compiling a list of affected plugins and themes, which you can find [here](http://itpixie.com/2012/06/wordpress-exploit-alert-uploadify-php/).

The reality is:  These are *real* vulnerabilities and they're actually being used.  It isn't a theoretical situation anymore - so to keep yourself safe, please have a look at that list, and make sure you're not using anything on it.  As always, the best defense is to make sure you're keeping everything (plugins, themes, and core) up to date.

I have since finished my theme, and tried to get it on WordPress.org but my company's account ""cyberchimps"" was suspended on WordPress.org for trying to compete with another WordPress theme development company.

This other theme company is claiming we violated their copyright, and stole their intellectual property, but we did not. Our account was suspended from the forums before we could even reply, and our theme was disapproved. I 100% understand them wanting to take the time to investigate the issue, but suspending us blinding was uncalled for.

My business partner and I developed our WordPress theme using an e-book we purchased from http://digwp.com/. We used two open source libraries Superfish, and Coin Slider. We used the book mentioned above to layout our code, and used various forums (including Reddit), tutorials, and other free knowledge-based resources to develop our theme.

We worked as support people in the forum with the company in question in the past, but we did not sign anything, or steal any of their intellectual property. They're simply pissed we're competing with them.

We decided we wanted to work for ourselves, spent two weeks developing our WordPress theme working 12-16 hours a day, and at the most we're guilty of ripping off Apple's design. Even so, we created all of our own graphics in Photoshop, and did not use any images from Apple's website, or the company in question.

If you review our code vs. their code it is easy to see we did not ripoff a single line of code.

We have every right to compete with this company, and our design is based off of Apple.com. I'm not sure what to do at this point, we were hoping to get the free version out to the thousands of people who use WordPress.org, and without WordPress.org's support we're pretty much screwed.

Update: http://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3443

Update 2: Was finally able to get ahold of someone at WordPress with help from a fellow Redditor, our accounts still suspended but they reviewed the code and concluded we did not copy PageLines. The burden of proof is now on PageLines! Thank you for your support Reddit. If anyone on Reddit wants a free Pro (the paid version) of my theme PM me and I'll generate a download code for you!

Update 3: Account was unblocked a few days ago, waiting patiently for approval process. Hard at work on version 1.1, and some new designs.

WordPress users/developers produce tons of content, it's very hard to know and read everything. You can subscribe to some lists like http://wproll.com/top. And there was no such thing for BuddyPress, because it's just a niche plugin, although BuddyPress is live for 4 years already.

So I have decided to create a service, where you can subscribe to the latest BuddyPress news and goodies, which I monitor, and hand-pick to include in biweekly newsletters. I do this on this site: http://bpmail.me - and I don't send spam or whatever that is not related to BuddyPress. If you are interested to be updated with such info - please subscribe there, or if you know somebody that might be in need of such newsletter - help to spread the word.

 In the last 12 months I've made exactly one blog out of all my projects, the rest have been for Wordpress as a CMS. In state of the word and other talks Matt, the core team and Automattic all acknowledge that 'wordpress as a CMS' has overtaken 'wordpress as a blog' for wordpress.org installs (probably because most people who don't want more than a blog have no reason to use the .org version) 

And yet, any discussion I see regarding UI/admin etc in Trak, the make groups etc all still discuss the wordpress UX and UI almost solely from a blogging perspective.. Am I the only person that's getting more and more annoyed by this? 

I know it is possible to customise the admin, I do for 95% of my clients, but I'm getting pretty sick of the 'hacks' that I have to use (meta boxes, CSS, Javasccript).. I want to be able to actually create page templates for admin as part of my themes and have the override in the same manner as front-end. Fuck doing it with a plugin, give me admin themes.

Thought I'd share some things I ran into which I consider bad theme development practices. I found these practices after troubleshooting two sites using premium themes from themeforest. Let's get a collection of bad theme development practices started so we don't make these mistakes when developing our themes. If you disagree, please reply and we can get a debate going.  
  
**Forcing users to work with a permalink structure**  
A premium theme's documentation told the user to change its permalink structure to /%category%/%postname%/.  
- changing URLs might throw 404s to existing urls  
- SEO issue: user should define how the URL is displayed  
  
**Using custom fields for thumbnails**  
A premium theme was tested on Wordpress 3.x but still used custom fields for thumbnail posts. While it's true that not all users update their Wordpress install for whatever reason (for example, bad plugin coding which is another thing), users who do have Wordpress 3.x installed should have the option to use the featured image introduced in Wordpress 2.9.  
  
**Forcing Users to use a Category for animated sliders/carousells**  
This one's debatable. Plenty of themes ask the user to create a category to pull posts from for an animated slider. Some go so far to define one FOR the user. My stance on this is that you should never touch a user's content. Content should be classified in the way the user wants. If they need to create a Category for a feature like an animation, they might need to exclude that category from an archives page or a category listing.

I've been building a few websites on Joomla, before switching to Wordpress a few years ago. I have a new project that could -potentially- go viral. No need to comment on that sentence, I know that no one can predict if something will go viral or not, and I know that there's 99% chance that it won't. 

However, in this case, the website either goes viral or I close it down, so before building it I'd like to make sure WP handles well high traffic (let's say 50 or 100k unique visitors per day), on a **user-generated content** website, with gifs and images uploaded by the users. I would use a shared hosting at the beginning... 

If WP can handle high traffic well, what shall i think about when building the website, what kind of technical setups shall i implement from the beginning? Shall i use a CDN immediately? shall I use the simplest, lightest theme there is? I'm open to fast responsive themes recommendations.  

And last question, to those of you who enjoyed a sudden, big rise in traffic on one of your website, how did you manage it?

My quick fix. ,24,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/15kqvf/wordpress_site_hacked_recentlyby_crows_crew_my/,"It seems this is a huge problem, possibly with old / outdated WP sites (automated hack?). I don't want to give the group more publicity, but for people to be able to find this I included the groups name in the title.

I am not sure of the vulnerability, but I've developed a 'routine' by fixing so many that I thought I would share.

With what little expertise I have, it seems to be an old WordPress + character encoding vulnerability that adds encoded javascript to a custom text widget (and removes all your sidebars). Luckily this doesn't seem very destructive of a hack. Of that I'm thankful for, lol.

Fix it:

1) Log in to your admin panel (you should be able to).
2) Go to Settings -&gt; Reading and change the character encoding to UTF-8 from UTF-7.
3) Go to Settings and change your page title back to normal
4) Go to Appearance -&gt; Widgets and delete their text widget

Get your old text widgets back:

It seems all old sidebar widgets are deleted in place of their own custom text widget. If your site has some custom text widgets with HTML that you really don't feel like redoing, do this.

1) Go to Google and type in your site's URL.
2) Hover the &gt; arrow next to the search result and click on the 'cached version'.
3) View page source and copy the HTML that goes in your custom text widget, and recreate the custom text widget with the copied HTML.

From here you should have your website in the same condition it was before you got hacked.

Backup and update your site:

After this, I would backup your database (cpanel, phpmyadmin), and zip your entire site, should an update break anything in your current site/theme/plugin files.

I'm not sure if being up-to-date will prevent you from being hacked again, but its the best prevention you can do.

I am trying to learn how to develop themes with as much functionality as possible. In other words, I want to become a WordPress expert.

In my quest, I have been taking tutorials and reading the Codex, while trying to develop practice themes. But I realize that there are gaps in my knowledge. There is a progression to any learning experience. I understand all basic functions on the WordPress Admin panels. I have a working knowledge of HTML and CSS (I still struggle with CSS, but I know where to go for help and can understand what they tell me). I understand basically how PHP is structured, and can often figure out what is going on by reading it, but I cannot write it. I am currently using the Thematic theme and building a child theme.

My issue is that there are gaps in my foundation. I need to someone to point me to “First, understand this concept, next learn this, then go here…” I know at some point I will have to learn more about php. Should I work on that now, or can I wait until later? This whole issue came up because I was trying to understand filters and actions.

Right now our (beta) plugin allows you to drop a ""Get Credit"" button at the bottom of your article template which analyzes your article's content and figures out which topics/subjects it's about. When readers click the button we store that newfound ""knowledge"" into a profile for them to keep track of. Right now the system is very naive but we've got some really cool ideas to make credit more tangible.

I'd love for anybody interested to try out our service and/or plugin and let me know what you think about what we are trying to do. Everything is still extremely basic but we are moving forward with new features and functionality every day.

Is my project too over-the-top for WP?",22,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/mwlsv/reddit_lets_talk_about_what_wordpress_is_actually/,"Let's say I create a WP multi-site. What I want to do is to attach a bunch of different plugins (membership, Pro sites, market press, domain mapping) that lets the user create their own privately held projects (i.e. wordpress sites). To illustrate an example, my business would be something like mybiz.com, where a user would pay to have their own project.mybiz.com ""site"".
 
I know everything I've said up to this point is possible. What I'm not 100% sure is this:  
 
1) The sub-domain admin would need a back-end plugin that lets them manage/upload PDF files (which would actually store to a secure cloud rather than the WP server).
 
~~2) These projects are HIGHLY classified. In other words, when someone goes to project.mybiz.com, they would be given a login prompt, and only admins/users of that respective project would get access to view the page content and downloads. Could one restrict visitors of sub-domains to only that sub-domain's registered users? Would a plugin like ""[More Privacy Options](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-privacy-options/)"" do the trick?~~ **EDIT: the [Multisite Privacy plugin](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/sitewide-privacy-options-for-wordpress-mu) seems to be what I need to do the trick here**
 
How would you go about building something like this in WP? Is WP even capable of accomplishing this? I'm not looking for a specific answer. Just wondering if any plugins come to mind and/or if you believe this level of security cannot be obtained in WP multi-site.
 
Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated!
 
TL;DR - Using multi-press, can I make private, securely managed sub-domains?

**EDIT: I've been losing sleep at how exciting this is becoming. I really want to thank all of you for helping me wrap my head around this. It appears the only extreme customization I'll need is a plugin that connects each wildcard sub-domain to its respective cloud (in this case, i'm looking further into google docs, since the project files types are all compatible). Amazon s3 seems to be the answer to static images that make up the site, but that's not really what I'm looking for. In a perfect world, I would need a google doc viewer embedded into the project sites.**",,False,,t5_2qhjq,True,,,True,t3_mwlsv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/mwlsv/reddit_lets_talk_about_what_wordpress_is_actually/,

WordPress 3.1 is currently baking in the oven, unfortunately the gas went out during the final stages, so it's taking a little longer until it's ready to be served. So in the meantime, Reddit, I turn to you for suggestions on an awesome plugin to write for WordPress.

Now, I'm not going to do your homework, and much less am I going to write a plugin that caters to a very very specific niche which your current project requires! ;) But feel free to suggest it anyway, and I might manage something more generic out of it.

Why am I asking this of you?  I've recently managed to end up with a lot more free time on my hands, A lot of this will be spent working on WordPress 3.2, and some into personal development (freelance, personal projects/plugins, etc) - but right now, I need some inspiration and to be motivated to knock something new up and kick it out the door!

Long story short they're going to be on TV to talk about their company and their last developer fucked them over. So I have 7 days to build a site.

I've never used buddypress. Aside from that, though, I'm a very competent developer. I'm experienced with wordpress and very good with PHP in general.

The site I'm going to build will (I'm sure) grow in complexity however these are some of the main features I'm going to look to integrate.

1) Personal profiles. I'm sure this one is easy. Is it easy to modify what sort of personal data someone can enter?

2) Team profiles. Each member has the potential to join a team. Teams will be run by an admin. Is there a teams/groups feature which will facilitate this fairly easily?

3) I want control over user profiles. I.e. whenever a user is created it is subject to admin approval before publishing. I don't expect this to be part of buddypress... so I can build it myself.. but I thought hey what they hell maybe someone knows a built-in way of doing this.

I realize no one has any obligation to help me ... but I'm in a crunch and thought I'd reach out. Thanks regardless and happy developing :)

Shoot your ideas, hosting services, software, server caching, setups and plugins. 

I'll go first. I use a $30 or a $50 VPS from Media Temple 512/1024M respectively. I don't use any caching plugins. Server's boosted with nginx and the php-fpm module running ~ 20 workers simultaneously. No memcache, no object cache. MySQL with a little tuning to query cache and an extra index on the (post_id, meta_key) fields under wp_posts.

As for content, gets served quite okay through nginx although during peaks I start thinking of moving all static to a CDN, preferred is Amazon CloudFront although expensive. 

Memory usage peaks at around 90% constantly (20 active workers) but the good thing about Media Temple is that they give you an extra ""burstable amount"" equal to your base memory, so a 512M VPS is a 1G in theory :)

Flawlessly on the $30 setup &gt; 1.5M hits per month. I know it's not much but it's the highest I had to deal with :) Also, Mark Jaquith is giving a great speech about scaling WordPress on WordCamp San Francisco this weekend, so make sure you don't miss it.

I usually purchase from ThemeForest but a couple of weeks ago the Portfolio theme from The Theme Foundry caught my eye:

http://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress/portfolio/

Theme looked great, client accepted layout, work began.

After purchasing the theme, I watched the introduction video and realized I made a huge mistake. The theme is just hack after hack.

The theme is ""responsive"", but not fluid. All element sizes a hardcoded, so bumping it from 1000 to 1150 pixels took ages, something that would have been done with one row of CSS had it been well-made.

Although being a Portfolio theme, it doesn't register any post types but rather it lets you set custom fields on existing posts.

It also does not utilize post formats at all, so if you want a 2 column layout like they advertise on their theme demo
(Link: http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/portfolio-theme/2011/12/14/skulls-in-spring/ )

...you have to type the content of the right column in the **post excerpt** and type HTML by hand to get the button.

There's no way to get an overview of portfolio items, as they are merged in with the rest of your news posts. The theme uses a hack to override the Wordpress default start page.

I've come across multiple well-known plugins that simply don't work with this theme. Theme Foundry refuse to fix it as they ""don't support plugins"".

Has anyone had similar experience with their themes?

All and all I think I would never purchase a theme from The Theme Foundry again. Thanks for listening.

I'm tired of using these frameworks, and would like to start developing and selling my own themes, and would like to advance my PHP and jQuery knowledge in the process. 

Building the front-end design / CSS will take me mere days as I can convert a lot of my CSS from the childthemes I've developed to my own framework, but building out the backend I'm not sure where to even really start.

My plan is to use some open source libraries such as Jquery plugins, menus (Superfish), etc. I know there is a lot of documentation on the WordPress.org Codex but again I'm not sure what specifically I'm looking for. If I had some basic documentation on how to build a backend to provide users various theme options then I could probably figure it out.

Should all help requests be banned? Or ones that want people to do the work for them?

I just released the first version of my first plugin to the world, and I wanted to share it with the Reddit community to get some feedback/suggestions.

My wife and I own a home blog over at www.7thhouseontheleft.com, and we really wanted to put Pinterest out in front as our go-to social sharing option. Whilst on her travels through the blogosphere, my wife found a site that showed a ""Pin It!"" button on each image when you hovered over the image with your mouse, and she had to have it.

At first, I wrote a jQuery solution that worked great for our theme, but was incompatible with pretty much everyone else's blog. That was fine, but a lot of our readers are bloggers, too and wanted the same thing for their site. Rather than giving them a bunch of complicated jQuery that they would have to change for their own theme, I decided to write something that anyone on WordPress could use.

If you're interested in checking it out, I have the functionality enabled on our site at the link above, and the link to the file is in this post: 
http://7thhouseontheleft.com/2012/10/gregs-pinterest-button-overlay/

Now to the reason I'm posting this! I have several additional future features planned for this plugin:

1. An option allowing the user to use their own Pinterest icon/button.
1. Options to allow for positioning the icon.
1. Ability to add a class of ""nopin"" to an image so that it doesn't get the Pinterest button treatment.
1. Put the Plugin on the plugin directory so it's more easily updated.

Am I missing anything? If you look at the code, am I doing anything horribly wrong? What other features should I try to include later on down the road?

I'm looking to start a porn site that will be powered by Wordpress.  While I do realize there are CMSs dedicated to this exact use-case, I prefer to use Wordpress.

My ideal requirements for the site are:

* Each post will be an image gallery
* Some posts are free/public.  Other posts are pay/""members only""
* Posts that are flagged as ""members only"" will be visible by the public but the full size images within the post's image gallery will require a login/membership to view
* Obviously, full size images cannot be publicly viewable.  i.e. I suppose they need to be protected via htpasswd/htaccess OR streamed through PHP and located out of the public directory structure.
* Memberships are for-pay so there will need to be a way to bill a user for access + an account created

**Do you guys have any suggestions for plugins, resources, etc that might help?**  

I don't mind paying for products, especially if the money goes to support an individual or small team of developers. (as with most pay plugins/themes)

So far the best i can come up with is using the pay version of the s2member plugin + NextGEN gallery but as far as i can tell it's going to require me hacking nextgen.

update: the reason that this post exists is that i am using a 'free' hosted wordpress account. It is perfect for what I need it to do. If I had my site hosted on a full blown server, I'd probably write some fancy server-side script for doing all of this. But then I'd also spend more time coding than writing. This script allows me to have full control over my images easily and upload them all at the same time without needing to individually add them to the post. I've also taken the time to add centering tags and a link back to the full size image which would be more clicks.

To run the program on a directory full of images, do this:
    &gt; python view.py directory/*.jpg

Each image will be shown individually along with an input box asking for the name you'd like to use for the image. Enter the name, press enter, and the image is converted and renamed and the next image is shown. If i put in ""sunrise"", it copies the picture and does all the stuff, and renames it ""XX_NN_sunrise.jpg"" where XX is the day of the year (0-364) and NN is what number the picture is in a series. That way when i have several days where ""sunrise"" is the first picture, they won't be clobbered on the server.",,False,,t5_2qhjq,True,,,True,t3_mft7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/mft7p/maybe_someone_is_interested_in_my_workflow_script/,

My boss **loves** Joomla, but has let me start most our new projects in WordPress. He still makes jabs at how much better Joomla is and it just gets to me some time. His preference doesn't come from any technical stand-point either. He thinks it performs better, the SEO is better, it has more features, and the interface is great.

I know I'm not going to convert him. I know I really shouldn't press the issue because he has allowed me to use WordPress on anything I want. It would be nice if I had some information to fire back at him when he makes his comments.

Are there any studies or articles that are very specific as to the benefits of WordPress? Any topic would be great.

**EDIT**

After reading some replies I realize I did not give enough details.

We are a small shop that uses out-of-the-box tools (WordPress + themes) for a low-cost and quick launch for small to medium sized companies. A majority of our sites are &lt; 20 pages and what would be called brochure sites. Very little functionality and some mild customization on any theme we use.

Personally, I've been doing web development of some form professionally for over a decade. Included in there was being a Joomla admin.

You are all right as the requirements drive the technology. Great in theory, but when we run on a slim margin and I'm the only person of any real technical knowledge. So our tools need to be fast and uncomplicated.

That is what bothers me the most. Yes, I am fully aware that Joomla can do all the things we use WP for. That doesn't mean it's the best tool for our situation.

I'm going to stop with the edit. What I'm reading is that it all comes down to preference. I prefer creating in WP and my boss prefers developing in Joomla.

Thanks for all the input just the same.

 It seems the debate here is that sites with any significant amount of traffic should avoid using /category/ in their permanlinks.

There are a number of problems that I have, though:
1) The biggest thing is: I don't know how to program and my technical computer knowledge is limited to hardware, setting up systems, and troubleshooting existing problems.
I'm willing to learn how to program a little bit, but I don't really know what to learn or how to go about doing it. 

2) We don't have someone on staff that is in charge of our online content (for now). 
How easy would it be for me to learn how to do this?

3) I am concerned that it might be difficult for the editors, writers, and photographers at my paper to post articles and ""figure out"" Wordpress. 
In your experience is it simple for non-techy people to use Wordpress?

4) I am also wondering what other problems might arise, as I have never dealt with a program like this ever before.
Can someone detail how this program is really used so that I might be able to figure out some of the other problems that may arise from using or switching to Wordpress?

As I have not made any revisions in some time and am looking to reduce my expenses, I would like to discontinue this ""website as a service"" plan with them and host my own site.

I do not have FTP or DB access. I simply have access to my wp-admin dashboard.

How hard would it be to replicate the site with my own webhost? Does having access to the dashboard give me any advantage or will the site pretty much have to be built from scratch?

(question plus rant, sorry about that)",15,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/12uunf/would_you_trust_woocommerce_question_plus_rant/,"I need a site that is part blog and part store. Based on good things said about woocommerce, I'd like to make the decision to use one of their templates. But then I go to their site to choose one and immediately lose all confidence in this company. Every time. 

When searching templates, if the result you want isn't on the first page, you just don't get to see it.  For example, check responsive and ecommerce. There are two pages of results but when you click the arrow to see what is on the second page, the search criteria is lost and you now see the second page of four pages of everything they have. 

It also bothers me that choosing two criteria give me all the templates that meet either criteria instead of the criteria I require. Why have a search at all if it doesn't help the user find what they want? It is an OR search instead of an AND search. 

If you just search for woocommerce and then look at the descriptions of those templates that are returned, nothing is said about woocommerce in information given about them. So is woocommerce included with a plugin or is it a second purchase. Basic information is probably somewhere but I think they have an incredibly crappy website for selling and informing users about their own products. 

If they can't do a simple search of their own products that actually helps users instead of just looking pretty, how can I trust that they will do a better job with my products on my site? Or maybe the woocommerce has no search at all. (Is a store a real store or a play store if you can't search the products?) They do allow you to download the program and install it, but it really seems like I shouldn't have to go to that much trouble for overview info like screenshots. 

I think they assume the user already knows their products and does a really poor job of answering basic high level questions. When you go to the woocommerce page, they should tell you immediately if you are adding a plugin to your exisiting site, replacing your site with this standalone program or if you need to purchase one of their themes. 

So what is the deal with this company? Do they make good products and do a poor job of marketing? Or are they really good potentially but just not quite 'soup' yet. Thanks for any feedback.

This is a temporary job beetween year 2 and 3 of my CS degree. The idea is I learn a commercial skill for a cut of the profits on the work I deliver - 15%. My estimations and knowledge of the billing structure would suggest I will pull in £150 to £300 per basic WordPress site, probably less than minimum wage, but I don't care plenty of people do unpaid internships.

Today was my first day, I have been cramming tutorials in, brushing up on best practices, I've also been doing the HTML/CSS/WP tutorials on teamtreehouse.com which have been pretty fantastic.

This place seems to be stuck in the past and pretty confused, here are some things I have been learning on my first day:

I have to build remotely because tools like XAMMP cannot be trusted.
I am a fool to use anything other than Dreamweaver.
Whats the point in HTML5.
We aren't paid to build a website that looks good on a mobile device.
We have to build the flat layout which was designed by a print designer who openly dislikes web design.

quotes:
""I code for monitors that use pixels, I have not done responsive, how many people do you know with a retina display?""
""I'm an expert in CSS, I've never heard of SASS or LESS""
""Source control is a nighmare to setup so I have never learned github""

A lot of this is down to the fact that the ""senior"" developer has never worked in a development team and is self taught, and about 15 years older than me - an enthusiastic, engaged undergraduate. We are chalk and cheese, lamb and tuna fish, how do I deal with this guy?

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: upon inspection his code is pretty awful too.

Over the past few years my wordpress site (www.shiftedmatrix.com) has been hacked a few times. Every time it's almost the same thing, that good old base64_decode injection hack that spreads to almost every index.php file on your server. Since I run a few sites off a single web hosting account, this is really really annoying.

The first time it was because I wasn't keeping my wordpress up to date, but after a full reinstall I was clean (for a while.)

Then about a year later it happened again. After a few infections over the course of a few months I eventually tracked it down to an outdated tim-thumb.php file included with my theme. Updating that, cleaning out all extra themes and plugins I wasn't using, I thought I was good.

This summer it's been happening again. Thanks to WordPress Firewall at least I get some warnings now. It first happened in July, then in August, and then again this morning. Each time, WordPress Firewall lets me know that during the night someone is trying to overwrite certian common plugins with a hacked files through plugin-editor.php. It generally lets me know it blocked 4 or 5 attempts, but when actually check the site I've usually been infected. 

I have cracked down with as much security as I could, full .htaccess protection from the WebsiteDefender plugin, folder permissions, security plugins (exploit scanner, Timthumb Vulnerability Scanner), etc, did all I could to prevent it from happening again but with no luck.

After every infection I've been very thorough with my cleanse. If I catch it quick enough it generally only gets into the main index.php file, my theme index.php file, and maybe one more index file in a random wp-admin or wp-includes folder. I know from the first few times if I don't catch it early it can spread into a lot more files. But between a few different exploit scanners, Dreamweaver find/replaces and manual checks, and overwriting system files with a fresh download, I'm sure I get everything when I clean it out.

I'm almost positive it's always coming through my main site, despite having a 4 different sites hosted on the same server. Reason being that 2 of those sites are non-wordpress (one mediawiki and one custom php) and the other site is wordpress but gets no notifications from the firewall. Also, the infections seem to happen after I get a bump in traffic to the main site from posting a link to reddit or something. These other sites do get infected as well, but I'm sure the source of the infection is through my main site.

So, short of making all the system, theme and plugin files read only, what can I do to stop this? It's really fucking annoying to have to waste a couple hours every month cleaning my websites. And as web developer it's rather embarrassing to have this problem and not be able to permanently fix it.

I published a Wordpress security plugin recently that I think is kind of nifty, so I'm posting it here. I hope that's alright. (I'm new to Reddit.)

I call the plugin *Foresight*. It's designed to make it easier to keep track of known exploits that have been found for Wordpress and Wordpress plugins.

From a technical perspective, the plugin is pretty damned unimpressive - it just loads (under its own submenu under ""Tools"", when logged in as an admin) a tabbed display of the Wordpress exploits found in different exploit trackers. (Specifically, it's just loading in the ""Wordpress"" search results for each tracker into its own iframe.)

From a functional perspective, though, I think this is pretty handy, because - provided you keep an eye on the trackers - you can gain foresight (Get it? Get it?) into what exploits might be tried against your blog in the near-term.

If you're interested in this thing, it's available for free download from the official Wordpress Plugin Directory:
[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/foresight/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/foresight/)

If you're a githubber, I've got it mirrored there too:
[https://github.com/chrisallenlane/foresight(]https://github.com/chrisallenlane/foresight)

If this sounds like something you might use, I welcome you to download it. I enjoy seeing my code being used.

Also: if you've got any feature requests, bug reports, etc, etc, please let me know. Doubly let me know if you think there are any other exploit trackers that should be added.",,False,,t5_2qhjq,False,,,True,t3_t42wd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/t42wd/i_wrote_a_wordpress_security_plugin/,

I started out just hacking at child themes, but the site I'm building now is much more ""from scratch"" than anything I've attempted before.

That being said, it's still not fully from scratch.  I used Twitter Bootstrap for some elements, and I used the _s theme to start out.  Much of the site's functionality also comes from the WP eCommerce plugin.

Having those three elements on my site has made it really ugly in terms of the CSS that I use to style everything.  Bootsrap has its own set of styling info, and then the _S theme resets some of that and throws its own overrides into the mix, and then the eCommerce plugin throws *its* css into the mix.  It's getting to the point where I change something in one CSS file only to find out its being overridden  in a different file. 

So far I've been able to keep on top of it and it hasn't been a huge deal.  But still....the backend code is messy, and I fear that I'm starting to suffer from div-itis.  

I've already learned a lot from this project as far as what not to do.  For example, bootsrap is excellent for creating mock up quickly, but porting that mockup over to a live WP site makes things messy.  Also, for my next project I think I will build my own theme from scratch, just to have as much control as possible over the finished product.

================

Hello Everyone,

A while back I was developing a ton of freelance sites on top of WordPress. To help the development process I made a very simple script that allowed me to move the code and database from one domain/server to another (dev, preview, production).

Later I developed that simple script into a solution that can be downloaded and ran by anyone looking to change their main site's domain name. I have a write up on the current release here: http://dan.doezema.com/2010/04/wordpress-domain-change

Recently I've started working on a new branch aimed at providing migration for Multi-Site WordPress installs.

I'd like to make a request to anyone who has a multi-site (or standard) WordPress install to test this new branch and give any feedback on possible issues, improvements, or extra options.

I've tested this script out on a fresh WordPress 3.0.1 install with multisite enabled and 3 separate sites -- It seems to be working properly. However, that is the limit of my multi-site experience and I don't really have a good idea of what the multi-site community needs and/or wants.

This is an open source project hosted on GitHub here: https://github.com/veloper/WordPress-Domain-Changer

Please switch to the ""wordpress_mu_support"" branch and give it a shot (after backing up your database).

I might suggest that you try making a copy of your database and files, setting up a new virtual host, then giving this script a go on it.

If you don't feel like forking the project on GitHub.com, making the changes, and then sending a pull request please just post here or contact be via http://dan.doezema.com

Thank for your time and/or interest.

I’m happy with code as I have been writing PHP, JS and .Net  as well as HTML and CSS for years as well as dealing with most types of DB’s but feel as though I have missed out somewhat in learning WP from a developers point of view as off the shelf CMS.  Before I get started on the learning curve I have a few questions that aren’t anywhere near the level of stack exchange yet…

1/ Can anyone recommend good sites for tutorials / or a book that will explain how WP hangs together.  I had a look at the backend files recently on a site and my first thought was “My god what is all this stuff?” quickly followed when I looked at the code with “What the hell is this, what does it do and why does it do it like that?”

2/ I want to start developing locally so that I can really get to grips with WP.  I’m happiest in a windows environment and at the moment I develop and run sites on a Win 7 machine (which I develop on) via IIS which connect to db’s on Win 2003 server running MS-SQL 2008 and My-SQL 5.  Can I still keep the same environment using XAMPP?  Or would it be better to install WP on the server with XAMMP. How would this affect my current install of My-SQL which I need for work?  Is it possible to have multiple instances of WP running (ie different projects) at the same time?

I have a spare box that with a bit of work I could install a flavour of Linux on as well if it would be better to go down a proper LAMP stack route (or is this unnecessary?)

I develop all my projects locally.  All of those projects are also live on production servers.  I want to add git to all of them so that I can make changes locally, push commits or branches to bitbucket, and then pull down from bitbucket to my production server.

I've already set up a bitbucket.com account and have a copy of my local repo's on bitbucket.  I'm able to make commits locally and push them to bitbuckets flawlessly.

I'm having trouble with how to handle this on my production server where all my projects are already established there.  What is the best way to set up git and pull in changes from bitbucket in order to avoid conflicts?

**What I've tried:**

I SSH into my production server, `git init` , `git commit -a` to add all the untracked files, then I do a `git pull &lt;bitbucket url repo&gt;` in order to sync things up.  To test this, I'll make a change locally, make the commit and push it to bitbucket, attempt a `git pull &lt;bitbucket url repo&gt;` from my production server... but I often get merge conflicts.  Honestly, I have no idea if that's the right method.

Hoping someone will be willing to have a conversation with me here on reddit to help iron out where I'm confused.  Thanks!

**UPDATE**
I decided to use maciakl's advice and create a new repo on the production server... commit all the files.  push the repo to my remote bitbucket repo.  then I can clone it onto my local machine.  This helps solve the problem for all my projects that are currently live.

This works well for ME because when I start a project... I'll begin it on my local machine with a fresh new repo.  When I'm ready to deploy the project... I use the ""Duplicator"" plugin to move all the files and database.  This deploy will include my git repo in it.  Once it's live on the prod server with the repo and history that I've been making on my local machine... I'll push it to bitbucket.  This way.. I can clone it back down if I need to modify the project on my laptop if i'm not home.

I know I could use capistrano... and I've looked into it.  To be honest, I spent an entire day on it and I'm confused about how it handles the database with search and replace.  I'm sure it's a better solution, but I'll spend more time on it another day.

There's also the post-hook solution that looks interesting, but again.. I'll spend time on that another day.

The old site I eventually just took down and replaced. It was exceptionally slow, prone to crashing, and IMHO unattractive. I replaced it with a modified theme I purchased from Themeforest, which generally works a lot better. 

As a tester, I put it on my SO's server hosted at asmallorange.com. It worked beautifully, was lightning fast and did exactly what I needed it to do. The problem was when I transferred the site over to my bosses server, which is hosted at GoDaddy. Now, my site is slow. We've used a tester at tools.pingdom.com, and it says that the site is 95% slower than most of the sites tested. That's obviously not acceptable. When I test the site again on my SO's hosting, it goes down to 50%. 

I've talked to GoDaddy about this and it says that the problem is with the server being Windows based rather than Linux. I'm fine changing the server, except that the Linux based one appears to cost more money. I don't want to have my boss move it, just for GoDaddy to be wrong. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but does anyone have experienced with hosting WP on GoDaddy? Do I need to use the Linux upgrade? I personally would never use GoDaddy anyway, but it was already being paid for. 

**TL:DR**: Boss uses GoDaddy for server, slowing down site to the point where it's functionally horrible to use.

I don't know if anyone here uses it to block spam, but it's a sham.

It basically adds a password field to comments and asks users to copy and paste that password into another field.  The author claims that it's more secure than captcha, yet any simple script could copy the machine-readable password and submit it.

The only reason it appears to work is that spambots expect WP comment forms to all be the same, and this added field is ignored.  The same security would be achieved with a simple checkbox that says ""I swear I'm not a spambot"".  Making it a ""password"" field only serves to make potential clients feel more secure.

I attempted to discuss this flaw with the author, but he repeatedly censored me, saying ""no script has ever cracked [it]"".

So to show him and to warn potential future victims, I quickly threw together a python proof-of-concept and posted three automated comments to his page.  His only response was to (understandably) remove the automated comments and then to censor our final conversation.

* Content 

* Content

* Content... Content is king. No matter how good, clean and tweaked out your website is.  It will NEVER amount to what ""good"" content can.  Remember this, and live by it.  

Good original content will not only sastify your visitor and encourage them to return but it does amazing things for SEO.  Search Engine's aren't dumb, they are smart about their business now.  So in return you need to be smart about your website/blog.  Yes, there are methods known as black hatting that can get you sudden bursts of traffic.  But they will almost undoubtedly get you a sudden and certain drop in traffic.  Don't do it, it's not worth it.

* Cache.  If you are running a Wordpress blog without any caching utilities you are losing traffic. Period.  A slow loading site is a sad website.  User's on the internet are impatient, if the site loads slow they are gone.  

Search Engine's have already begun their smackdown on slow loading sites.  Meaning if you have a slow loading site, you are getting less traffic than you could be all because you didn't ""turn"" it on.  It's literally that easy.  There are tons of different choices out there, some are even built into Wordpress.  But not enabled by default.  

Go do a Google Search on ""Wordpress cache"".  I personally like W3 Total Cache, some like WP Super Cache, others swear by HyperCache. It all comes down to what fit's your setup the best.  Some are easier than others, some aren't.  And yes, some are almost pointless to use in certain situations.  It's just something you NEED to learn about.  Not to mention it will save your ass if you manage to make a front page on reddit, digg, or any other popular sites.

Things to research. W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, HyperCache, DBcache reloaded, PHPspeedy, Xcache, memcache, BatCache, APC cache, Eaccelerator... I may write more on this some other time. But as you can see there are numerous options. (*See Below for links)

* VPS hosting.  If you are in the least bit interested or pondering the thought of having a decent blog/site.  Ditch the shared hosting, VPS hosting is dirt cheap.  Spend the little bit more monthly payment and get alot more.  There are thousands of different VPS hosts out there.  For starter sites, don't spend more than 30 dollars in my opinion.  But make sure you have easy paths to upgrade when you are ready for it.

* Social Networking.  Social Networking is a great tool, but don't f*ck it up.  It is extremely easy to get carried away with it, and in return hurt your reputation and piss off your fans/users/cult following.  Giant twitter icon's and overpowering social networking icon's are annoying.  If they like you, they'll find the smaller, less annoying icon.  This plays into the Content is king philosophy. 

* Organize.  Properly organized content plays almost as good of a role as good content.  It's commonly said, if a user/visitor can't find what they are looking for in 2-3 clicks.  Poof!  They are gone.  Good organization will also help you in the long run when expanding your site.  Use Permalinks.  Search engine's love them, users love them, so you too should love them.

* XML Sitemaps.  Google LOVES a good sitemap, Google also HATES a bad one.  When search engine's eventually do visit your website they use the sitemap almost exclusively to index your content.  It will help you get indexed sooner and more accurately.  There are limits, be weary of building your sitemap and allowing it to get too large, unorganized or submitting it too often.  

* Sounds.  Don't do it.  Just don't.  No!  ... stop it.  I think this is absolutely the number 1 way to screw yourself over.  It's useless, just no.  And if you do it anyways, don't say I didn't warn you.  When it comes to videos however, it is obviously neccessary.  Just don't automatically play video upon loading a page, that'll make them hate you too.

* Video.  It is a great feature and just about everyone has a love/hate relationship with it.  It can do wonders for SEO when used properly.  But like I said above in #9, there are some gotcha's.  Don't auto play video, keep a watchful eye for broken links/removed content.  

* Tools of the Trade.  Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, and most important of all Google.  Just about every major and minor search engine has some sort of portal for webmasters to assist, control and monitor your presence with them.  Some are better than others, but make sure you have accounts with them all and check them on at least a weekly basis.  It can help you proactively stop problems before they cause any real damage to your ranking and tell you vital information about how your site ranks with them.

* RSS.  Another method search engine's use quite a bit are RSS and ATOM feeds.  Not to mention your user's will use them constantly!  It gives them a method to know when something new has been posted without having to visit the site guessing/hoping there is new content.  

* I'll end with this for now,  Adsense and Adwords.  Everyone dreams of getting some sort of monitary return from their site.  Adsense is a great way to begin this process.  Adwords can help you gain an introduction to the opposite end by buying ads to help gain more traffic.  But I will also say, beware.  Ad's tend to put off some of your visitors.  Especially if you are evil and utilize pop up's and pop under ad's.  Flash ad's with sound.... see #9 above.  But done properly you can achieve an equilibrium where you benefit some and your users/visitors don't hate you for it.

Now before you go do/try any of this.  Running a site is a job, it requires time, effort, patience, knowledge etc.  Think before you do, just like crossing the street.  Understand what you are doing, read about it, learn it.  Because there is no one single way to do it.  These are just my keys to being a better blogger.  

**Tips**

* For all the fresh starters who struggle to stick with it or even get started.  Think of a blog as something you work and build day by day.  And not as something you have to build all at once.  If you try to do it all at once, you are likely to grow tired of it FAST.  Chip away at it and let it grow organically.  Swinging for the fences and succeeding rarely works.

Thoughts?

             $blog_feed-&gt;query('showposts=1&amp;cat=-3,-4&amp;offset=0'); // what to get

While trying to learn more about how wp_query actually works (and trying to display two instances of the above), I saw the version in the codex is structured a bit differently than mine:

                
    &lt;?php
                        
     // The Query
     $query = new WP_Query( $args );
                        
      // The Loop
     if ( $query-&gt;have_posts() ) {
     while ( $query-&gt;have_posts() ) {
           $query-&gt;the_post();
            echo '&lt;li&gt;' . get_the_title() . '&lt;/li&gt;';
                    }
            } else {
       // no posts found
           }
       /* Restore original Post Data */
       wp_reset_postdata(); ?&gt;

I set up Woocommerce and purchased two shipping plugins: USPS and FedEx. I've gone in and setup my rates and connected my accounts to the API.

Both shipping plugins are working, however the issue that I'm running into is causing me some headaches, and Wootheme support isn't exactly quick to respond.

I'm selling clothing, and when a customer purchases 1 shirt, they are charged $5.00 shipping (from the API rates). That's fine; however, If they choose two of the same shirt, then they're charged $10.00 (2 x $5 of shipping). The plugin keeps increasing the base shipping rate for each new item.

This doesn't seem... normal. When I purchase multiple items from Amazon, my shipping isn't increased double by each new item I choose. One customer tried to order 4 shirts and shipping was going to come out $20.00. I don't know what settings I am supposed to be using to keep the shipping low.

I recently got a free VPS from a host I won't name (so far awful - don't want to advertise from them) and I moved a wordpress site there.  I thought I'd share a bit of my experience.  The free VPS has merely 128 MB of RAM and limited disk space as well so I had to learn some new techniques to optimize the system and I thought I'd share.  

First of all I used [XCloner](http://www.xcloner.com/). This plugin allows you to create a single .tar file with a backup of your database and all core files and gives two small PHP pages which facilitate the restore procedure.  This plugin seems pretty good but one caveat that I'll mention after struggling with it:  make sure your new database name and credentials are identical to the old.  This will save you a boatload of trouble.

Restoring the site was easy.  Getting it to *work* on the other hand was a chore.  Some of the modifications I made which seemed to help in the long run:

1. Switch from OpenSSH to [dropbear](https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html).  Dropbear is an ssh daemon which uses much less RAM than OpenSSH.  The only slight issue I ran into was that dropbear doesn't include sftp.  Some blogs I read suggested using sftp from the OpenSSH package.  But since I was limited in disk space as well as RAM I didn't want to install OpenSSH.  The way I worked around this was to switch to SCP.  SCP moves files directly over SSH.  You could even use SCP with OpenSSH if you like.  Actually - I'm not sure what the point of using SFTP is... except it's not necessarily supported by the same clients as scp.  [WinSCP](http://winscp.net) seems great and supports both.

2. Switch from Apache to [Lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/).   I've used Apache for years, but in the limited RAM apache is simply too bloated.  I understand [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) is also very lightweight.  Both have a learning curve as the configuration files are a bit trickier than apache, but both use far less RAM.

3. SWAP!  My VPS host didn't enable any swap space by default.  By creating a 256 MB swap space on disk I could trade a bit of disk for some virtual memory.  This alleviated some of the PHP errors I was receiving due to running out of memory.

4. Disable InnoDB.  InnoDB is a MySQL storage engine which greatly increases the RAM usage.  It's not needed for WordPress and disabling it makes more memory available for the rest of the system.  

5. And finally I enabled page caching with the help of the [W3 Total Cache plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) for wordpress. This allows wordpress to cache infrequently changed pages and serve them as static content rather than regenerating a dynamic page on every load.  

Well, that's my story.  It's still a work in progress but I've gone from an essentially unusable site to one which loads quickly with memory to spare.  I'm sure other users have tips and tricks for server optimization and I'd love to hear them as I'm sure I can do even better.

You see, I want to have a blog section of the website using Wordpress, but with the same design as the home page (the header, navigation, corkboard BG, etc.) . I'm confused though on how to code a Wordpress website using the 960 grid and using that same design.

Is it just a matter of plugging in the classes and linking to the 960 grid system? I've never coded a Wordpress website before so it's a little confusing to me. Perhaps there's an easier blogging solution without using Wordpress?

I also plan to use the snippet from [here](http://www.corvidworks.com/articles/wordpress-content-on-other-pages) to display the most recent two posts on the front page where those two dummy articles currently are.

Does this plan sound do-able? Is there an easier solution? My biggest requirement is just keeping that same look from the current homepage (minus the slider and sidebar of course).

Here's my list - what would you consider if you were me?

1) The main content area to be wide enough for the content, so narrow centered column themes probably aren't going to cut it.
2) Semi-translucent backgrounds are ok in the main content area, so long as they aren't translucent enough to harm readability (this is one of my pet peeves with some tech blogs). The choice of background image also plays a role in this.
3) I would really avoid blue on the design. It's overused and has been on tech blogs for too long.

Any suggestions on some themes that you personally like that might be a good source of inspiration? I have no design talent, but I have friends who do. I really like the Adventure theme that is available with the latest wordpress. I'd want to change the background image and probably some of the colors, but I like the translucent look that it has.

The email is below -

&gt;Hi!
&gt;Thanks for reply to our proposal!
&gt;
&gt;To pass to the banner control system follow the link http://webmaster(dot)derpherpmedia.com To enter use the following data:
&gt;login: www(dot)mywebsite.com password: derp
&gt;
&gt;You should install and activate the plugin in order to display advertisement. Before making payment, advertiser must approve location of the banner. 
&gt;
&gt;The banner will be shown on your site when you add special code to your web- address (for example: http://www(dot)herpderp.com/?adv_test=1). It means, that visitors will see the banner only if it is approved and payment made.
&gt;
&gt;To get installation instruction for your site type pass to: http://derpherpmedia(dot)com/wp_install To activate your site you have to enter the code: herpderp
&gt;
&gt;What way of payment is suitable for you?


What you guys think? They had asked me for a price quote in an email before and I gave them a reasonable figure.

I have never sold banner space before. Is this how media companies do it? Is there any risk? I am concerned about them asking me to install a plugin on my wordpress site.

p.s. - I have intentionally herped and derped any personal information (obviously)

1322584902.0,9,self.Wordpress,mth08,What are you looking for in a WordPress meetup community?,13,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/mth08/what_are_you_looking_for_in_a_wordpress_meetup/,"As an organizer of the [Boston WordPress Meetup](http://meetup.bostonwp.org), we constantly have issues trying to find speakers and topics to talk about.  I've decided to ask /r/WordPress for some feedback as we close this year's meetups.


Some history before we go into the details... This meetup group has been around for over 2 years and we are approaching our 3rd come January.  We have an active website that is being worked on as we speak ([bostonwp.org](http://bostonwp.org))  We have job boards, links to videos and slides of past meetups and we'll soon relaunch our forums.  We have roughly 1060 members and I am one of the 2 organizers.  We meet monthly and we try and have 2 topics each month, one aimed more for the developer/designer with code and the other aimed more for beginners/intermediates without code.  We have a venue booked for the next couple of months so dates and venues are not an issue.


What is an issue though is finding fresh new topics and speakers.  If you've attended any of the WordCamps, you are likely to see the same cycle of talks if you go to the major camps.  We routinely talk about plugins, themes, widgets, theories, content and many other basic topics but what topics would you like to see?  Please provide details and why you'd like to see it (mainly out of my curiosity).


We are also looking for sponsorships.  I think many on here are looking for help but if you are a developer or designer, check us out!  And if you like what we've done and want to see more, feel free to help us out too!
 

We plan on going through some of these topics to prepare for 2012 and if they are chosen, we'll either look for a speaker or do it ourselves.  We'll be sure to thank you in the video and we hope to answer your questions as best as we can.

My blog - [CrossFit eXlated](http://www.crossfitexalted.com)

I clearly own a gym and the site is primarily used by members to check the WoD (workout of the day) as well as use the site for insight related to nutrition and other fitness concepts by way of videos and articles. Additionally the site is used as a point of interaction and record keeping for the members. With each daily blog post we encourage members to post their scores/times. This allows members to refer back to this date to monitor fitness progress down the line.

A few key points:

***1)*** Currently the site is hosted on FatCow. Due to the inordinate amount of connection issues over the past 3 months and overall site speed I am in the process of migrating the blog to HostGator.

***2)*** I am presently using Woodbooker to mirror my daily blog posts to Facebook to increase member interaction and awareness. It seems to work ""OK"" but it is a bit buggy. I tried Social RSS and I have looked into Facepress...any other suggestions or just stick it out with Woodbooker?

***3)*** Currently using Disqus for comments, it works alright. Anyone use IntenseDebate? I have been reading up on it some and I like what I have read thus far. I want the simplest, yet most robust, option available for my members. I don't want to drive members away from posting due to convoluted comment systems.

additional question on this front. Are there no systems which allow transposition of comments from Facebook to blog and vice-versa? Say if I have the blog post sent to Facebook via Woodbooker or other, if someone comments on this post on Facebook is there a way to have it added to the blog post as well? I ask this because I am really looking to increase the interaction with members and something like that would help.

***4)*** Presently using Walleria to post Facebook image galleries to site. This seemed like a great idea to avoid having to host images locally but we take a lot of pics and the 200 image limit on Facebook is a bit of a headache. Any suggestions here? I was doing some reading up on Picasa and Flickr based options but wasn't sure of their ease of use. I do additionally have two 'Editors' who help with the hosting/posting of images.

I'm exploring the whole idea of using wordpress for my company's CMS. We're not happy with what we're on and want to migrate to something better and easier to use. However, our site is pretty image heavy and we need a good way to organize all our images. The default gallery has absolutely no organizational ability, so NextGen seems to be the most popular alternative, but....it still seems pretty lacking to me.

For example, even just adding an image to a post is inherently a 2 screen process with NextGen. It hooks into the post uploader, but then...it doesn't actually let you upload an image, just select one you've already uploaded. Something seems amiss here! Furthermore, the screen it does provide isn't really much better than the default media library.

So I go to check out the completely non-intuitively placed NextGen gallery button, and it similarly sucks.

And while its organizational structure is better than the mess that WP throws at you, only 2 layers (galleries and albums) isn't really enough.

When I upgraded from a previous version I ended up shooting myself in the foot because I didn't properly prepare for the upgrade.

Long story short, Last time I did an upgrade I had to go back through the entire site and put all my modified scripts back into place.  Luckily it didn't take me nearly as long as the first time.  But it's a situation I'd like to avoid this time before I upgrade the site to 3.0

So my question(s) to reddit,,,

1 - What methods do you use to backup and leave the easiest trail of bread crumbs in case all hell breaks loose to revert back to the previous state.

2 - Are there any methods or setup's I should look into for having an isolated replica site ( on a sub domain, non public ) for testing and toying with code so I don't have to make the changes to the live site hoping all will go well.  Something along the lines of SVN, CVS or GIT?  

I've heard bits of talk about child themes and it's one thing I'm already looking into.  But have not implemented any practice at all at this point.

3 - Anyone care to comment on their transition process of a moderately customized wordpress site, things to watch out for?

For reference I rely heavily upon the following plugin's.  

-w3 Total Cache (xcache)
-FeedWordPress 
-Angsuman's Translator Plugin Pro

I have made the decision to go into business as a freelance developer and of course have to finally tackle the inevitable wordpress platform that is ever so popular to the 'common folk'. I just got done working on my first site and I must say…. I am quite turned off with some things, but I am also feeling that I am missing a few key things about wordpress.

The client I was doing work for purchased a theme off of Theme Forest which looked quite beautiful in the demo, but once I got it loaded and got to work, much frustration quickly followed.

First off, many of the 'built in' sections did not scale properly as to how the demo displayed. Sections where images were suppose to be counted, measured and given the proper width value did not happen, which forced me to basically hack the crap out of the page with jQuery to things to work the way they are were supposed to. The 'responsive' theme also was not very responsive to the main_content. Header and footer were fine, but I basically had to code all the responsive for mobile.

Another thing I noticed is that this theme file is LOADED with several resources that I'm pretty sure aren't being used, but are still being loaded into the page. My ySlow came back with 20+ javascript files and 20 + css files per PAGE! 

Maybe I'm just a naive with how the wordpress works, but is this sort of the norm for theme files that you purchase off such sites as theme forest? 

Last few questions I have:
- What are some of the more popular resources for reading up on how to optimize my wordpress site? Of course a google search will return about 100,000 results, but I'm hoping someone can just point me to some of the more creditable ones to help filter.

- Is there anyway around coding jQuery('element') so I can code my jQuery with normal syntax? I've read up on why you have to use that syntax, but haven't been able to find a good resource for a work around so I can go back to coding my normal $ syntax for jQuery.

Now I know I have to make this a higher priority, but at this point I'm still saving money for more necessary video gear and not getting anywhere on a site.

I need a great commercial theme (free-$50) that will be appealing for a video based site.  I'll have aprox 7 pages, and want to integrate my twtter, FB, instagram, etc via plugins.  My videos will be hosted on vimeo and so integration of vimeo links is key.

Also, I have NO experience with WP or web design.  However, I'm pretty computer (mac) savvy and work in aperture, PS 5.5 and Final Cut.  In my world of video, photography and remote controls I love helping people learn the craft and so I've come here to get help to learn the WP craft.

Please point me in the right direction for an amazing theme or a few sites that you recommend for great themes (google search provided so many sites to peruse that finding a good one would take days).

Also, if you can point me in the right direction for installation, tutorials, etc. that could help too.  I've dl'd WP and MAMP and getting the database to my site looks pretty straight forward, but if there is a better way, I'm all ears!

* All 'static' content must be moved over as pages
* All 'blog' content must be moved over as posts

I understand that the opinion on this would differ depending on the size and complexity. For this the assumption is that the plugin is of a greater complexity and there is a need for multiple classes broken down into distinct logical bits.

Ok long one here so bare with me. so I am the developer for a very large multi-server wordpress deployment. I have been experimenting with novel ways to improve the site's performance. Currently I am focusing on reducing time spent running sql queries and i have my cross hairs set on the main loop query which accounts for majority of time in the database.

I already have full page and asset caching in place using a loadbalancer in front of my web servers. I am using the memcached object caching plugin. I am also using hyperdb in a master/slave db setup. So with that out of the way, I would like to reduce the main loop overhead when the cache expires on when page caching is not possible for whatever reason.

So ideally what i would like to do is hook into WP_Query-&gt;get_posts method and cache the results for specific queries, returning those cached results when possible instead of making a call to the database. This is something that is very easy to do when creating custom loops with WP_Query or get_posts but after much digging through core there is really no opportunity to do this with the main loop. From what i've found i can use 'pre_get_posts' to alter the query, and 'posts_request' or 'post_request_ids' for manipulating the sql but nothing to actually interrupt the call to fetch results and return different results. I have explored the possibility of wrapping wpdb similar to how most caching plugins cache database queries but in my case i would have to wrap hyperdb which makes me nervous, plus would involve copious use of global variables to track which queries would need to be interrupted since the wpdb object has no concept of what WP_Query is doing.

So I am left to wonder how would I accomplish my goal 'without' hacking core. I have seen some examples of people hijacking the whole bootstrap process by hooking into 'parse_request' but that involves a lot of manual calls to what WordPress normally handles automatically which sounds like a brittle solution. If this cannot be done it will not break my heart but I see the potential for huge performance gains and maybe even a very helpful patch contribution back to core if hacking core is the only good solution.

With this increase we can use your help with the following:

1. Submitting interesting content. The sub is only as good as you make it, there is a lot of cool WordPress stuff going on out there so feel free to click the link over there →
2. Reporting submissions/comments that do not fit in with the community. This really helps us to get a barometer of how people feel with the content and cleans up the sub.  

**New submission Rules**

The following criteria will be removed if submitted to r/Wordpress.

*   **Theme/Plugin promotion** advertising themes and plugins are not allowed, discussion of themes and plugins is allowed.
* **Hosting questions** - Not specific to WordPress, never useful, attracts affiliate links.
* **Affiliate links** in comments. We used to let this slide but lately there have been to many so they won't be allowed at all.
* **What.. theme questions** Posts to non WordPress sites asking if there are any themes that ""look like it"". Posts asking for ""good"" themes without actually listing features. These are really ""do my work for me"" posts and provide no discussion.
* **CSS/HTML question** The questions usually have nothing to do with WordPress
* **Top 10 lists**  90% of top ten lists are seo junk, we will remove the bad ones so please report top ten submissions for removal if they are crappy.

Firstly, I'm going to say sorry right now for my general lack of technical knowledge in this department. I will do my level best to explain things as clearly as I can and would honestly and sincerely appreciate any and all help in this respect. 


I signed up for a wordpress.com blog a few years ago, www.iainthomas.wordpress.com 


Then, through wordpress, I purchased the domain www.iainthomas.com 
I recieved a reminder to renew the domain from wordpress.com in 2012, which I did. 


Currently, I cannot get iainthomas.com to point to iainthomas.wordpress.com in the domain management tab. 

If I select the radio button next to iainthomas.com in the domain management tab and then update the DNS, it just points to a parked page.


It keeps telling me to access and change the name servers and to action some changes there. I've struggled to find where the wordpress name servers are but after doing a whois on the domain, it points me to above.com - I do not have any login details for this site and have never even received an email from them.


Here is the url to that information 


http://whois.domaintools.com/iainthomas.com 


It's been bothering me for a while but recently, managing iainthomas.com as my personal/professional blogsite has become quite important and urgent. 


I've gone through all the support pages and unfortunately I've found myself at a dead end. 


Again, any and all help would be honestly and sincerely appreciated. 


Thanks,

Point iainthomas.com’s nameservers to your site
Almost there! Whats all this?
We just need to setup iainthomas.com with WordPress.com
We’ve completed the technical setup on our servers to successfully map your domain iainthomas.com to your WordPress.com blog. Now you have to edit the name servers at your registrar to point to us.

How to Change Your Name Servers

You can usually change your name servers at your domain registrar’s website, but the process is different for each registrar.

Please visit your registrar’s website or contact their support team for instructions on how to update your name servers.

Currently the nameservers for this domain are:

NS3.ABOVE.COM
NS4.ABOVE.COM
Using the DNS tools provided by your domain registrar, remove any existing nameservers and add the following:

NS1.WORDPRESS.COM
NS2.WORDPRESS.COM
NS3.WORDPRESS.COM
Then come back here and try again. It may take several hours for our system to recognize the changes.

this submission is an act of desperation on my side. I've Googled, read blog posts, created excel spreadsheets comparing services, etc., but I can't find the right hosting company for my site.

I currently run a WP site that is getting 150-180k pageviews a month, and continues to grow 10-20% on a monthly basis (I only started the blog 10 months ago).

I started out on MediaTemple's (GS) Grid Server (shared server, managed by MT, $20/month), that was great, until I started maxing out the GPU levels. I then got advised by MediaTemple to move the site to MediaTemple's next service, their Dedicated-Virtual (DV) server (512mb, self-managed, $50/month). This, to-date, has been a total nightmare.

I've been charged $150 by MediaTemple for simply migrating the site within their servers, but the server, database, users access, modules, etc. configuration was all over the place - a total mess. The DV server crashes every day, even if the visits are a fraction of those seen while hosted in the GS server.

After contacting MediaTemple regarding CPU and memory resources constantly maxing out, server misconfiguration, I get told that this is my problem as it is a self-managed server. Although I've been treated like a dog by MediaTemple, truth is I can't handle/understand ALL aspects of a server while still blogging. I'm waking up at random times at night just to check that the server is running OK, and most of the time it isn't. There I am, at 3.30am rebooting my server...

That is why I am looking for a managed Wordpress hosting company. I've checked WP Engine + Synthesis (but I fall on rather expensive price tiers on both), Page.ly + KahunaHost (very little storage, I currently have 13GB and growing), etc. All services I see have these ""issues"".
