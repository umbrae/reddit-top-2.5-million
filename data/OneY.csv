Recently, a good friend of my roommate had been hanging around the house, and I quickly became attracted to him. My roommate told me he's been single for a long time, and is kind of shy around girls, so this last week I worked up some balls and asked him out for a drink. He agreed. I was really excited about the notion of hanging out with him alone, and I had a pretty good feeling that he was interested, too. I tried to kiss him at the end of the night, and he dodged it, telling me that he's not interested in getting involved with anyone right now. 

Fuck. It felt like shit. I went to bed that night feeling pissed off, horny and lonely. 

I just wanted to say, before now I haven't been able to empathize with what you guys go through when trying to date women, constantly having to make yourselves vulnerable, and much of the time getting turned down. It really fucking blows.

I'm writing this because I want to talk about male bulimia. I'd like to discuss it as well. In the male community bulimia or most disorders even don't get much attention. It's thought that bulimia is simply something that girls deal with. If you're struggling with bulimia, an eating disorder, anorexia, or body image issues; you're not alone. I myself, am bulimic and currently in recovery. I'm in my early twenties, pretty athletic and have an active social life. I still struggle with it. So guys of all shapes and sizes let's just have a talk. Share your story and maybe we can not feel so alone about this issue anymore.

But I've been thinking recently, about what this or that guy looks like, and do I find him attractive. And I do. I realised that I can find male bodies attractive, just like a lot of women find female bodies attractive.

This shouldn't be a shock for me, but I guess I was never able to freely comment on a man's looks (e.g. 'Holy shit, that guy is handsome!') without it being a joke.

I also can imagine myself having sex with an attractive guy. Without *feelings*, just the affair kind of sex. Much like a lot of females could experiment and try having sex with another girl.

I guess I'm just attracted to a thing that looks good, no matter the gender/sex, but I've never been able to admit that, and I just wanted to share.

That is all.

This does not invalidate the reverse - that women also face a great deal of things that men do not. We've all got our issues. Feminism simply deals with women's lot. Not a bad thing in and of itself.

There are good feminists and bad feminists. Good atheists and bad atheists. Good civil rights leaders, and bad civil rights leaders. Get the drift? It's unwise to tar a whole movement based on its worst members.

Feminism has done some wonderful things! Who among us wants to go back 100 years? To a time when our mothers, sisters, girlfriends, wives, aunts, nieces, female friends, etc. did not have the right to vote? To open their own bank accounts? To divorce? To live an independent life? To have sex with whomever they felt like without having to *marry* them first?? I certainly don't want to go back, yikes!

And here's the good part: **In the struggle for men's liberation, positive feminism is actually our greatest ally. Cause we're fighting the same shit in different clothing.**

For every woman who hates being sexualized by men on the street... there's a man who hates it when people automatically assume he is going to be a pervert and sexualize everything. For every woman who hates how society judges her femininity by her looks, her weight, and her boob size... there's a man who hates how society judges his masculinity by his ""alphaness,"" his penis size, or the amount of money in his wallet.

Male frustration with women's problems getting far more attention than men's is understandable. But the solution is not to beat down the women's movement, but to build up the men's movement alongside it. And - very important - to avoid destructive comparisons about ""who is more oppressed.""

Men of OneY: *Learn* about why our sisters feel the need to be ""feminists."" I have learned a lot by listening - and it doesn't diminish my conviction that men's issues are truly getting passed over. I have also found that I get a better hearing [among those who don't yet agree] when I speak out about male issues *without* resorting to bashing women or feminism.

I don't know where else to post this.

I'm a white guy, and I just started dating a black gal. She's great: smart, sexy, affectionate, and really really fine. She's hot.

We were at a bar yesterday with some of her co-workers. It was really divey, and when I got there I scoped out the place. We were there with a mixed group of coworkers, a variety of different races. But the rest of the bar was only black people, with more men than women. Hmm, noted.

So we get to having fun and getting drinks. Eventually, everyone else leaves, leaving me and my girl alone. At that point, she snuggled up to me in the booth, I put my arm around her, and we started having some quality alone time.

That's when things started getting a little iffy.

Now, I *know* how we guys can get. To see a beautiful young black girl, the most beautiful in the venue, with a white guy could piss some black dudes off.

After a few minutes, I looked away from my girl to scan the other patrons. A big black dude caught my eye contact and held it. Hmm.

A few minutes later, I sent her to bar to grab another round. While there, another dude hits on her. Not a big deal.

Then after a little while I went to the bathroom. When I came back, the guy sitting in the adjacent booth (big black guy in his 40's) started talking to me aggressively.

(There was a charity chili dog cookoff going in the bar that evening)
""Yo, man, you gonna buy a chili dog?""
""I might, man, I might.""
""You sound like you all corporate n shit, all 'I might.' You hungry or not?""
""I am hungry, they look good, I haven't decided yet.""

Then he said something else I didn't hear over the loud bar music, and I kinda smiled at him and then went back to talking to my gal.

I've had a few verbal arguments with black guys before, and they'll do this thing where they're friendly on the surface, but it masks an inner hostility. Like they're testing you. I was pretty sure he was doing that to me; that's the sense I got.

I caught myself thinking about my self-defense training. Random dude #1 was probing me for strength; could I take him? Could I take two of them? I didn't want to find out.

Two minutes later, we left without issues.

I talked to my girl later, and apparently when I was in the bathroom, the guy next to us started talking to her. He asked her like, ""Why are you doin' this?"" meaning, why are you dating this white guy? He grilled her about it for a minute, and then tried to give her his card. She refused it.

Have any of you guys ever dealt with this sort of thing?

edit: A lot of people are reading racism against blacks into my post. The only thing I generalized about black people was the way they test for strength.

This post is NOT a comment about black people, it's moreso about being a man, dating a woman of a different race, and dealing with the reactions of the men from her race.

Now, don't get me wrong; I found many of the stories to be hilarious, and I get that in several cases, the guys responding were drunk and therefore not necessarily ""in their right mind.""

But I also noticed what struck me as a disturbing trend of men feeling unable or unwilling to directly decline an aggressive yet misguided woman's sexual advances. Instead of just outright saying ""no, this makes me uncomfortable"" or something to that effect, a lot of guys seemed to feel compelled to figure out an ""escape plan"" or otherwise protect themselves (and their genitalia) from said women. For several of the anecdotes posted, I switched the genders around in my head and reread them and they suddenly seemed less funny to me. At the risk of sounding like a buzzkill, the whole thread left me with a worrying impression that at least some straight men feel like they couldn't ""just say no"" to unwanted sexual advances from women.

So, straight guys: would you feel uncomfortable (for whatever reason) with explicitly declining sex in such a situation? When discussing rape (usually with women as the presumed victims) we often say that ""no means no,"" and this is certainly true. But several of the women in that thread's stories didn't seem to want to take no for an answer. Is the fear that by rebuking the woman's advances, you might inadvertently ""hurt"" her (physically) and thus risk being seen as a perpetrator of violence (e.g. If you literally have to shove a woman to get her away from you so she turns around and, I dunno, tells her friends you assaulted her)? Or is it more a matter of simply not wanting to hurt the woman's feelings? 

I guess I just feel like we (rightly) encourage women to be clear about what they are and aren't comfortable with in terms of unwanted sex with men, but it seems to me like some straight dudes might not feel as comfortable being equally clear in terms of unwanted sex with women. Am I totally off the mark here? Did I just read too much into these humorous anecdotes?

&gt;""*Comment maligning white/straight/cis/male*""

&gt;""*Objection*""

&gt;""Oh yeah, I forgot, they're the *real* victims in our society.""

This thinking is harmful because it implies that racism, sexism, and prejudice are only contextually bad- not inherently immoral. If there are acceptable targets for such treatment that depend on one's situation, then that means that we're all potentially subjected to it.

Picture a society with more economic fairness than ours currently has, in which wealth distribution is proportional by race, that is, the median and average black incomes are equal to the median and average whites. Would that make bigotry acceptable? If you hold true the axiom that ""privileged = acceptable target"", than it would be impossible to make a case otherwise. 

On the White/Straight/Male checklist, I can only check one. I have no problem admitting that being a male does mean I have privilege. It's just very strange that if someone were to make a remark about all bisexuals or Hispanics being all the same, it would probably be the subject of a post on shitredditsays, but if someone were to make a remark about all men being the same, it might be upvoted heavily in the comments. 

It's just that those who try to rationalize prejudice against some completely miss the point of why we don't accept prejudice against others.

As a woman, I was startled and angry with the ""What Women Want"" commercial I saw, Gillete's new ad campaign targeted at men everywhere to switch up their styles and get rid of that body hair to please the ladies. Instead of reducing harmful body messages to women, advertisers seem to have picked up on the influence they have and are now trying to send the message out to men as well, telling men to be ashamed of their back hair, to even go hairless to please a woman. Except, besides the terrible ""change yourself"" message redirected at male audiences (and the campaign title's assumption that all men watching are straight) there's the tone that is also troubling. It's very forward, not the usual wink-and-nudge signals consumers get to change their bodies for others.

Shouldn't a person you are interested in just like you just the way you are? Does the portrayal of women in this video upset you? Doesn't its message to men bother you?

So I started a relationship with a girl in college about a year ago. We got along well, had similar interests, and just felt amazingly connected with one another. However during the course of the relationship she would mention many many times that I did not respect her emotional or physical boundaries. And on one occasion when we where out partying we got into a huge fight that ended with me punching walls in the stair well of her dorm, pushing her up a flight of stairs, and dragging her by her arm to her room. We continued to fight all night until we both fell asleep out of exhaustion. Next morning she had bruises on her arm, and I felt horrible and promised nothing like that would ever happen again (and I have not laid a hand on anyone since then). During sex she would sometimes ask for things to stop. And I would stop but only very upset that she would ""not let me finish"" and I would always complain and make her feel bad for wanting sex to stop. I would get mad at her for wanting sex to stop. And essentially put her in the position of comforting me because she felt uncomfortable during sex.

Now after graduation we decided to break up cause I am abroad for a year on a fellowship. We have kept on talking though, and trying to work through issues we had in the relationship, lots that I think stem from my abusive patterns. And we have this really horrible pattern of fighting and making up. And last night when vid-chatting I tried to get her to do sexual things with me even though she said she was uncomfortable with it. I kept on pushing until she hung up on me, at which point I called her back and apologized. She answered and said we could talk about it in the morning. When we chatted in the morning it lead to me blaming her for what happened. Saying that I pushed sex on her because she was being flirty with me and I told her ""fuck you"" when she said she was done talking with me. Now she certainly does not want to talk to me and is saying that she is noticing their is an abusive patter in our interactions.
I am an abusive boyfriend. And thinking back to a relationship I had in high school there was one time I got angry with my girlfriend at the time for not giving me a blow job. It lead to a huge fight during which I by mistake locked myself and her out of my house with the car keys inside. And cause we where in a secret relationship I had to break a window to get back into the house so no one would know we where together.

People. I need help. Where do I go to seek help about being abusive in my relationships. I like to think of myself as a very intelligent, socially aware, kind, gentle, and loving person. But I think seeing myself in this way has made it harder for me to notice my own pattern of abusive actions. I cannot live as someone who is emotionally, sexually, and on occasions physically abusive towards the people that I claim to love and swear to protect. Do any of you have advice? What should I do? Where can I seek help?

I am scared at the person I have become. And I am especially afraid of that my disregard for my partner during sex could lead to me raping the person I am with. I want to stop this pattern before I hurt more people that I am close to.

Personally, I'm a little bit tired of the buck stops with men attitude of some women. 

Their thinking is essentially this: *women would x, if only men would y.* 

Somewhere along the line, personal responsibility went out the window and it became convenient to blame 'men' whenever a woman felt bad.

Here's the reality, we're all going to be rejected, feel shame, feel regret at some point. The trick isn't for me, as a man; or you, as women, to say 'stop doing that opposite sex'!

My wife told me today she wants to separate - mainly because we violently disagree on how to deal with my extremely entitled, disrespectful son.

Some background: She's my highschool sweetheart, I've been with her since I was 15. I'm now 31. We've got 4 kids together. Our oldest is age 11, and he's the most disrespectful person I've ever met. 

We can never ask him to do anything without a fight. Help around the house, move his laundry to the laundry room, pick up his things, be nice to his siblings, etc. At his best, he rolls his eyes, makes what we call ""wolf eyes"" at us, ignores us, pretends to misunderstand us, or just obstinately grunts. At his worst... this kid has thrown some epic temper tantrums. I'm fixing a hole in my drywall right now that he kicked in it a while back, and there are a couple more around the house. He once slammed our car door open so hard when we pulled into the garage during an argument, that it bent the door and caused $650 worth of damage to the car. He was once mad at my wife and ran upstairs into her jewelry box and tore in half a necklace I bought for my wife for a special occasion a while ago. He was fighting with my daughter once, and she got scared and ran into her room, and he picked up a belt off of the floor and wailed the door with the buckle, and there are now deep gashes in the wood of the door. He threatened to kill his 2 year old brother twice for going into his (open, unlocked) room and playing with his legos.

He is constantly banging, punching, kicking, throwing stuff, stomping around, slamming things when he is angry. He's just generally entitled and doesn't think he should have to do any of the things we ask him to do.

We have taken him to counseling, and the counselor made the observation that his behavior is rather like a drug addict. He never takes responsibility for his own actions, he constantly blames other people around him for any even minor trouble. He shirks responsibility, he doesn't care about his homework, always does the minimum necessary, etc.

Okay, now that you have that picture, the problem with my wife and I is that we violently disagree on how to handle this problem. She usually doesn't want to confront him, just let him do his thing ""because confronting him makes it worse"", and ""makes him angrier"", and ""causes contention"". If I tell him, ""You will *not* speak to your mother that way"", she will usually stop me from correcting him. She says that she thinks that I speak too harshly too him. I never yell, but I sometimes do speak sternly, which I think is perfectly justified if you're being an asshole to my wife.

Anyway... we've been fighting about this since forever. He's been like this since he was about 2 years old. Due to the job I had at the time, I wasn't around very much from the time he was 2 to the time he was 7, so he got to spend all those years around a mom who thought that he shouldn't be confronted about his bad behavior, and if he threw a tantrum about doing something, she would just let him be. That's how we got to this point.

Anyway, it all blew up this morning when I asked him to take a shower. He grunted and gave me the wolf eyes, was backtalking, being disrespectful, etc., etc., and I sat him down on the couch and started sternly telling him that his whole attitude about life was backward, and he needed to adjust his outlook if he was going to be happy, that disrespect would not be tolerated, etc., etc. He of course reacts by being an ever bigger smartass, backtalking more, slamming his fist into the wall, slamming it in again after I took away his electronics for a day, etc. 

After he went upstairs, my wife told me that since we violently disagree on parenting so much, (and we're not really all that in love right now anyway, since the last one was born) we should probably separate. She told me she doesn't want her kids treated like they're in the military, etc, etc. It's completely ridiculous. Again, I wasn't yelling, I was speaking sternly to a kid who was being extremely disrespectful.

Anyway... I don't know what's going to happen. She took the kids off to church, and I'm alone for a few hours. 

Just needed a couple of bro hugs, because this is a ridiculous situation. My son is going to grow up to be an asshole with no work ethic or knowledge of how to treat people around him, and I'm apparently not allowed to do anything about it.

[Here is the thread in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/119fjl/fellow_ladies_do_you_mind_lots_of_body_hair_on_an/)

Every bit of marketing that I've seen since I was a kid has shown me men with hairless bodies, especially when their sexiness or relationship potential is in question.

I've made many google searches only to find hairless men:

* male models - shirtless surprisingly often, and always hairless
* condom ads - rarely including pictures of shirtless men, but when they do, hairless
* beer ads - same as condoms
* razor ads - I was thinking of leaving these out, since this could be the point of the razors, but no commercial seems to acknowledge the existence of chest hair
* fire fighter calendars - stereotypical male soft porn, figured it would be a good gauge
* romance novel covers - I was expecting every image to be filled with hairy men, but I was surprised that I couldn't find a single one out of hundreds!

I would also like to add that I have been ashamed of my body hair ever since puberty, and I have shaved it off, plucked at it, trimmed it, etc.  I would be waxing it now if it wasn't for the price and pain involved.  I have worn shirts with high collars to hide it, thinking everyone would be repulsed by it.

And now, it turns out that the majority of women (or at least, a sizeable portion) prefers their men to have natural hair.  I'm both astounded in the media's completely incorrect portrayal of men's bodies and women's desires.  Furthermore, I am impressed that these constant images have seemingly little effect on women's desires.

But you know, I'm a nerd. I got my first AOL account when I was 8, and have been on the internet constantly since then. When shit in the computer broke and our internet wasn't working, my mom would have me call comcast or tech support to figure out how to fix the problem.

Fast forward ten years, to 2006. Uh oh, something broke. Google it. Figured out how to unfuck up my computer when it was infested with viruses. 

Today, 2012. I have my own car, and it's coughing up blood. I google it and find that it's got a problem called rough idling, and that it's common to my model. The solution is to clean the throttle body. After a bit of searching, I find a tutorial site. The author says it's easy, and I entered an engine for the first time in my life. It wasn't scary, it was a machine like anything else. Cleaned that bitch out. Car runs like a charm.

So I think about guys who used to work on their cars all day, and how, growing up, I thought it was one of the epitomes of manhood. I didn't feel like I was similar to them at all. But then I realized, it's not the act itself, it's the approach. The ""I can fix it or find out how"" mentality. 

All that's changed is the medium. Now, instead of working on a muscle car, we build computers, and the ""manliness"" of it is found in our approach, not in what we're working on. That's a pretty cool feeling.

I'll put in a disclaimer - I'm not trying to put anyone into boxes of manliness, I'm merely describing a trope from our culture. It's totally fine if you don't identify with any of this at all - you're still a man, I'm not trying to take that away from you. And of course, being a man doesn't mean you know how to fix things.

I had read that they help with ED, premature ejaculation and urinary incontinence. I've been into weightlifting for a few years now and when I learned that there's an exercise for your man-parts, I was stoked. 

[WebMD has a great page for how-to and other background info](http://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/kegel-exercises-treating-male-urinary-incontinence). To do them you're basically flexing your gooch/inbetweenus/baunch/grundle/taint/whatever you wanna call it. They're easy to do and the best part is you can do them whenever, wherever. 

So a few weeks ago I started doing them. My routine is 3 sets of 15 reps, 3x a day (the way I remind myself is by doing them when I wake up, before I go to bed and sometime in the afternoon). I really wish I started doing them earlier because holy shit they work.

Since starting kegels, my erections are harder and last even after sex and my orgasms are more intense and I've been able to have multiple orgasms in a night. Usually during foreplay, my boners would come and go, but now when I'm hooking up with my girlfriend, I'm rock hard from jump street. I used to have to sort of concentrate in order to get and maintain an erection, especially when I was distracted by foreplay, but I haven't had that issue anymore. 

Kegels are an easy thing to do that improve your sex life dramatically. I'm in my early 20's and am lucky enough to not have any urinary incontinence or serious ED, but everything I've read says that they help those big time as well. I'm not entirely sure this is the best place to post this, but kegels are a bit of a taboo topic so I hope this is a safe place to talk about stuff like this. I really can't recommend them enough.

This means I work around a lot of nurses, mostly ladies. These ladies seem to have strong opinions about what makes a man a man. Apparently, in their eyes, I don't meet the criteria. 

Now, I have done a lot of stuff that people generally consider ""manly"" in my day. I grew up working on farms, doing construction, worked excavation, worked as a meatcutter, worked for a master electrician, and I even did a little bit of grave digging on the side. I am also an Eagle Scout (don't worry, I don't condemn gay people), and have gotten into some pretty sweet hobbies from that. I am really good at archery, canoeing, wilderness survival, and rock climbing, to name a few things. In short, I think I have done some hardening stuff. 

Now other things I enjoy, that apparently take away your Y chromosome: I love candles and frangrances, sci fi, reading novels and comicbooks, lots of different music, and I admittedly cry during emotional parts of movies (The Lion King when Mufasa dies, T2 when Arnold goes into the molten metal and gives the thumbs up). 

Now one of the big things that the nurses give me low marks on, is the fact that they seem to think that I am non-confrontational. I don't argue much. The thing is, they seem to argue over every little thing. I only argue when I believe it is absolutely necessary. They have never seen me do this, after two years. The plus side to the way I do this, is that when I do stand up and have a strong opinion on something, I am taken very seriously. I would almost go as far as to say that if I do decide to argue, my opponent has almost no chance of winning. But to see me argue or get worked up is a rare thing. They seem to think that I'm a pushover.

I just wondered some of your guys' opinion on these matters.

Many ""Take Back the Night"" marches have specifically excluded men or have insisted that men remain separate from the front of the march. They frequently speak at length about male rape culture while ignoring the fact that men are raped too. And on the rare occasion that male rape *is* discussed, it is male-on-male rape, never female-on-male rape.

On ""Love Your Body Day"" many groups will focus on how media destroy the ability of women to feel secure within their own bodies while ignoring the effect of Calvin Klein ads, to give just one example, on male body image. 

I'll admit up front that being a victim of rape or having an eating disorder is less common among men -- but that doesn't mean that these things don't exist, nor does it mean that these things should not be discussed. In fact, I would argue that discussing these things is of particular importance given the stigma surrounding any expression of weakness in men in our society.

Many men have struggled with their body image and/or eating disorders, but on the rare occasion that they muster the courage to bring it up, they are told that they should ""man up"" and ""deal with it."" This is, sadly, frequently similar to the approach taken when it comes to male rape. Because of the propagation of the idea that men think solely about sex, and that all of our actions are oriented around having sex (an idea propagated not only by mainstream culture, but also by many men and self-described feminists), the idea of a man being raped seems foreign to the vast majority of people: ""You can't *rape* a *man*! Men *always* want sex!"" Or, ""But he had an *erection*! It wasn't rape! He *wanted* it!""

When men (or boys) are met with these responses -- or when they see others met with these responses, or when they see male anorexia or rape treated as nothing more than the butt of a joke -- they are driven further into the proverbial ""closet,"" and become even less willing to discuss the problems that they face, seek treatment or psychological counseling, and move through life as fully functional individuals.

Sure, it makes sense that TwoX exists because society has a history of being skewed against women and that trend has not ended yet.

However, society also has expectations for men. There are roles we're expected to fill and often we're chastised for not fitting into them. There is an overwhelming pressure to be ""manly"" in society, or to ""man up"" when life is hard. Men aren't allowed to act or feel certain ways, and it sucks.

I'm a sensitive guy. I have feelings and sometimes I want to be held. I want to be able to talk about it without being made fun of. I want to talk about the male experience today with other fellow men, and discuss what it means and what needs to change. I want to talk about **real** role models, not macho bullshit.

So I made this subreddit for all the dudes out there. This isn't here to post pictures of your favorite babes, or to talk exclusively about hunting, barbecuing, watching football and drinking beer (while of course all those things are awesome IMO). This subreddit is here for when you have a question about being a man, or a story to share, or some link to contribute.

Disclaimer: I am in no way making this in spite of the awesome female-oriented subreddits we have. I really admire TwoX, and I hope men can have a subreddit that's filled with as much substance as that one. Maybe it isn't in ""male nature"" to talk about these things like they do on TwoX, but hey, what's male nature? Let's talk about it.

Need help.,123,19,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/16wheq/majorly_embarrassing_personal_hygiene_issue_need/,"So I'm coming here because I can't think of any other more open and accepting subreddit. This is majorly humiliating, but I need advice.

So I've been having a lot of issues recently with my... rectum. I use the bathroom for four or five times a day, and each time my stool is liquidy, and it comes with a very powerful odor. And I wipe. I spend maybe five minutes wiping. Sometimes, there's blood.

But no matter how many times I wipe, or how many showers I take during the day, I can't escape the smell. I always end up leaving marks in my underoos, and that scent follows me around. I know others can smell it and I die everytime. The worst part is it happens at work most frequently, where I am at my most vulnerable.

I don't understand. It's like my rectum just... leaks. Simply by virtue of wearing pants, I am guaranteed to accrue a nasty scent by the end of my shift, no matter how long I take making sure there's nothing up there, and no matter how thoroughly I wipe. It's like the simple act of sweating is a guarantee that I'll turn into the most toxic human being to be around. No one has said anything, but... I can tell. It's so bad that I can only wear a pair of jeans once before it needs to be washed (most people tell me jeans can go months without washing), and sometimes they're ruined.

I can't handle it anymore. I had a system of shitting five times a day and wiping with those wet baby wipes to guarantee a clean wipe, but it just doesn't help anymore. I've tried changing my diet, eating less, eating more, and nothing has helped. No matter what, I am guaranteed to leak shit. I've always had issues, ever since I was young, with keeping myself clean. It's an incredible source of pain, humiliation, and shame for me. Like, no matter how hard I tried, I was guaranteed to leak into my pants.

The thing is, I uh... well, if you'll go back through my post history, you'll see me touch on it. When I was a child, I had diarrhea, and was pretty much raped for it. I was told that there was nothing worse I could have done than pooping in my pants and in the toilet as much as I did; my dad pushed my face into the toilet water and shouted 'this was inside of you! all of this disgusting stuff came out of you!', and then he used a toy I had to uh... 'forcefully plug me up' so that nothing would ever come out again.

So, as you can imagine, I have a *lot* of psychological hangups regarding the bathroom and my own personal excrement, so the thought of going to a doctor is absolutely, utterly *paralyzing*. I keep hoping that there's something I can do on my own to avoid that humiliation, but it's getting to the point where there's nothing left for me to do.

If I'm awake, I will slowly be oozing a combination of blood, fecal matter, and sweat into my underpants, no matter what measures I take to stop it.

I...

I don't know what you'll do for me. I just need direction.

&gt;**Edit:** First, a thank you. I am not accustomed to such... support, and I don't want to get too sappy, but you are all wonderful people. 

&gt;Secondly, I have gone with the group consensus; I made a doctor's appointment for Monday, and I am looking for a therapist that my insurance will cover. 

&gt;I was afraid that if I went to the doctor, and it turned out nothing was wrong and I just have poor hygiene habits, there would be an official, medical opinion on the exact state of my depravity, hanging out in my medical records for anyone to see. But the case for 'major health concern' has been successfully made, and my New Year's Resolution is to stop cutting corners.

&gt;Again, thank you. A part of me knew what I needed to do, I just needed hands at my back. I love you all.",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,1358645344.0,,,True,t3_16wheq,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/16wheq/majorly_embarrassing_personal_hygiene_issue_need/,

I've gotten sick of the frequency of the fighting on here. For some reason you can't all be nice to each other. There are a lot of sensitive people on /r/OneY on both sides, and I'm sure I'm offending a great lot of you by just posting this here.

Suck it up. If you can't be nice to each other, you're going to get banned. This is a friendly community, and I will keep it that way.

There are very few ways to get banned on /r/OneY. I don't ban a lot of people. Frankly, I don't take a lot of moderator action at all. I created this subreddit, brought on a few mods, and just let it grow. I prefer to let things sort themselves out, because I have a lot of faith in the reddit architecture. If something *truly* offends you, you report it, and about once a day I'll go through the spam and reported links to make sure everything checks out. Mostly I'm very proud of what's going on here and am astounded that we're almost at 5,000 members.

Now, as for getting banned. I'm not even going to warn you anymore. I'm looking into bringing on more mods, but at the moment I'm just going to ban people who can't play nice with each other. Please spare me the self-righteous outrage.

Remember back at the beginning when I said if I thought the frontpage was beginning to look too political/serious//r/mensrights, I'd take action? That time is now. I'm going to be closely watching this subreddit for a little while and taking mod action with extreme prejudice when I see things aren't right. I'm not going to argue with you about it.

I credit the success of this subreddit to the open-minded nature of the community and the laissez-faire mod policy. But with growth, of course there are going to be more people who want to stir shit up. That is the *last* thing I want.

So no more of this artificial conflict with /r/mensrights and their users. This isn't the great battleship /r/OneY. You can talk to each other like civilized adults, and not the haven for children reddit is becoming (is anyone else sick of my generation posting all this ""remember the 90s!?"" stuff?).

Anyway, that's it. The old man had to come down from the mountain to yell a little bit, and now I'm going back up. Play nice and you won't get banned. Treat each other like human beings and not like sociopaths if you can.

* Misogyny, misandry, homophobia, transphobia, racism, or any other sort of hate-speech. I'll kick your ass right out.
* Petty bullshit. Just don't be an asshole.
* Trolls - self-explanatory.

Gay and Trans males, and males of any sexual orientation or gender identity, are allowed and encouraged to post here. Intolerance towards these people will result in a permanent ban, as will intolerance towards anybody. We're here to talk about what it means to be a man, not exclude people because they don't fit one description.

Finally, have fun! Obviously in a post about the rules I'm going to sound super serious, but I encourage everybody here to post a wide variety of things that have to do with being a man.

It does deal with pretty man specific issues, though. I might add that I'm only 22.
So on Tuesday, I got home from a stressful day and sat down with my dinner and checked facebook before putting on netflix. I had a message from an ex from two years ago and from a mutual friend, essentially saying that I was the father of her 18 month old son. After we broke up 2 years ago, I had heard she was pregnant. She never contacted me so I just assumed it was from someone she met right after me. Apparently there was one other guy, a possible father, but he's since taken a paternity test and he was not the father. Our relationship was pretty bad and I guess she wanted to wait until there was no doubt in her mind that I am the father. We've been talking the last few days trying to figure out a course of action, tomorrow we're going to do a paternity test and whatnot. 
I met him today, he looks a lot like her but I see myself in his face. His nose, his body. He's so tall for his age. We played at the park by his mother's apartment, she and I talked. I respect the way she's been parenting him which is really good. I'm in shock still. Of course we haven't done the paternity test yet but I am 99.9999% sure he's mine. The timing adds up, placing time of conception the month we broke up. There was just this instinctual feeling of fatherhood I felt while holding him. If we prove he's my son I am choosing to be in his life and I want to work towards joint custody. I keep thinking about how I didn't see his first steps or hear his first word, I've missed so much already but at the same time I know he won't even remember anything from this age later on. 
I don't know, I just needed to share this with somebody, it all feels so surreal. 

Edit: I'd also like to add what our mutual friend sent to me.

Woman here with a question (: ,155,52,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/j7xjf/hey_oney_woman_here_with_a_question/,"Hey, this is a throwaway account, mostly because I'm not sure what kind of reaction I'm going to get from this. I love OneY, and I lurk it daily. I love 2X as well, because personally, both genders are facing some definite inequalities, just in different aspects. But that's just my personal opinion (: 

Anyways, that's not why I'm here. I'm here because I have some serious questions and I've been noticing a lot of things that I haven't before. I know what I see on reddit isn't how real life is, but I wouldn't exactly know, since I'm not a guy. 

Recently I read an article written by a sociology college professor. She said she had been teaching the course for many years, and during the gender section it was always the same. She would ask the class what made a ""man"". Their response would always be ""strong, brave, provider..."" etc... The teacher would go on and ask the class whether a woman could be any of these things. Usually, they would unanimously agree that this day in age, a woman could be strong, brave and a provider. The teacher would then ask only the male students what characteristics would make them a man around their peers. It would take the guys a little bit before comfortably answering, but the answers were always around ""being a 'player', not being afraid of anything regardless of how stupid, not allowed to cry..."" and a series, of what I believe, are some pretty negative things. 

Here on reddit, I get the same vibe... That what is expected of a ""man"" around his peers, are kind of negative... The recent post stating, ""If you're a guy, and you find this attractive, fuck you"", the top comment was ""There's a difference from what I find attractive and what I would fuck..."" And many males commented back saying ""I would not fuck her, I don't find her attractive at all."" They were attacked by other males, with pictures of the meme fat WoW guy, basically saying, ""Hey! If you don't want to fuck these chicks then you are obviously a fat foreveralone!"" What the hell is up with that? I get that it's reddit and you're not suppose to disagree with the hivemind, but if a guy doesn't want to fuck a chick, he's berated for it? 

Another recent post about a guy who was doing a lot of googling for a perfect engagement ring for his girlfriend. He said that google ads were starting to show a lot of diamond ring ads, which he needed to get rid of immediately. Some guys made the joke that he didn't use incognito mode on google chrome. ""Wow, when someone could actually use it for gifts instead of porn and he doesn't use it?"" The OP then response with ""Don't need porn with a girl like this..."" and is then attacked by responses like ""YOU NEED PORN!"" etc... 

So, I guess my question is, are these negative reinforcements for males in society? I mean, as a female, I'm not exactly affected by it, but as males are you pressured by these ideas? Does it make it harder to be who you'd really like to be as a person? Am I just absolutely thinking way too much into these trolls? Do these kind of interactions happen outside of reddit between males? Enlighten me (: 

EDIT: Wow. Thank you everyone for the responses. I feel like I learned a lot. I've never really thought too much about the stereotypes a man has to go through, and the effects it has on them. There were some incredibly interesting views that took on all different view points. I'm sure that these ideas all mean something different for all of you, but I appreciate all of your responses (: Thank you so much.

I got a lot of attention  
There was very little aggression or competitiveness directed at me  
I learned some new ways of interacting with people that I hadn't experienced, previously being in very male-dominated environments  
.  
The cons for me:  
Being given more of the manual jobs and 'fixing things' jobs than might have been expected  
Being excluded from decision-making and policy  
Being in the non-pregnant, non-mother minority (this was a constant topic of break-room conversation that I found it hard to join in with)

It's just that right now we are arguing and I don't know what to do.

I don't really know what started it in truth, but I think it has a lot to do with me wanting to go to sleep to early for her liking. We have two kids, I work, she stays at home. Usually she sleeps in with our youngest until between 9 and 10. I get up at 5:30. I would like to go to sleep, or at least get headed that direction around 10. If I'm still trying to get to bed at 11 I start to get stressed out, knowing I'll be tired the next day. 

She doesn't like going to bed that early for the most part. She says that's the only time we get to connect. She says lately we are just coexisting and that I don't really connect with our one-year-old.

I play games with my daughter, take her for walks, talk to her, teach her things, dance to music with her. My wife usually takes that time to get things done. I don't think she really sees what we do for the most part. Last night it escalated. I told her I wanted to get to bed, she sulked and didn't want to talk. I forced the issue and it boiled over into an argument with her essentially telling me it's all mine and my mom's fault. (Lots of context here I'll have to leave out. They struggle in their relationship, as I do with my mom. She's nosy and opinionated but has been trying lately to improve.)

We went to bed without talking after that, she sat in the front room until our daughter was asleep and came to bed without talking to me. I laid there for hours, upset, not able to sleep anyway. This morning she was cold. That makes me mad, I guess. I didn't say anything but I don't know what to do. I feel like it is always me who acquiesces and makes up with an apology. She rarely apologizes. I feel like as a father and a dad I should bear the brunt so we can move on. I feel like the more I type this out, the more I'll do that again and just apologize and try to think of something to make us connect and make her feel like I'm paying attention and give her some special care.

Now, 21 years old, my family depends on me and every now and then certain moments just make me feel really weak and helpless...",109,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1b7w82/lost_my_father_3_years_ago_to_cancer_now_21_years/,"It's been 3 years since I lost my father to cancer. We had a good father-and-son relationship, I looked up to him and he always was the one giving me motivation in many ways. I have a little 10 year old sister, and we live with my mother now. Along with his long-time employees, we continued to run his company (computer software and IT support), our only source of income right now.

Only now do I admire the fact that he accomplished so much by himself, that even after his death he made the right decisions and arrangements in the past so that until today we are still living respectfully.

But since the time he was really sick and hospitalized, I came across many really rough situations where if I had him next to me, I just know that everything would be much easier.

Three months before he died, me and my girlfriend got mugged by two drug addicts. I gave them money and my cell-phone and they left us alone. The next night I stumbled upon them while returning home, they started following me around the neighborhood, I was lucky though and found some patrolling police-officers and they arrested them. We went to the police department, and damn, right then it just hit me... I have no idea what I'm doing or what I am supposed to do... I may be getting myself into deeper trouble right now, who knows if these guys are part of a gang or whatever, and maybe someone will follow me to my house when I leave the station later. I didn't know if I was supposed to press charges or just leave without doing anything. I just froze for a moment. A police officer helped me at the end and told me that I had to testify, if I wanted these guys to face court some day, and so did I. All the time I was thinking how much better things would be, if my father was there.

Later, one year after my father's death, at work I got a call from one of our clients, asking for tech-support. I had to go over to his place and fix a hell of a mess that was going on at the client's PCs. That client was a long-time friend of my father, they had been working together from the time my father had initially started his whole business. Everything was going well, until some point where the guy just snapped and started going psycho about the mess that was going on. Long-story-short he treated me like shit, and I just felt helpless about this whole situation. I left just thinking how different things would be if my father was alive. I could turn to him and ask at least what I could have done to respond to this madness that took place earlier.

Many events like this one took place thgoughout the later years. With some situations I just learnt how to cope with. With others I still struggle to find a way to respond properly.

But yesterday night I just lost my shit completely. I went back to zero. While driving through an unknown neighborhood, I missed a STOP-sign that was hidden by a tree at an instersection and a guy coming from the other way rammed my car. Nobody got hurt, my car was totaled, the other guy's car had some minor damage... But damn, out of the other guy's car steps out the guy's 10-12 year old daughter, just like my sister, scared, shaken and crying. She wasn't hurt or anything but damn that picture just fucked me up really bad. I could have killed her, if things went different. I asked about a thousand times sorry to the guy for everything. Random passengers went near to the him and started comforting him and telling him that it's my fault (which it was and I already knew), and that I was probably drunk or whatever. At this point, I, a 21-year-old guy, just couldn't handle all this. It was just too much. I froze again, and started following directions everybody gave me. ""Call your insurance company to inspect the accident and fill out paperwork"", ""For how long have you been driving?"", ""Did you drink anything?"", ""I think maybe we should call the police""...

God... I didn't know what to do. I had no one to call. Nobody. I didn't want to call anybody. No friend could help me, no relatives lived close. 
I was the one supposed to be a man at this point and know what to do, how to handle this situation, how to protect myself from all this and sort it out...

I'm still terribly shaken after all this. Everything worked out all right at the end with the accident, the insurance companies took the matter at hands. But that moment of stress is just impossible to handle. If something more serious happens how will I respond? What if my sister is in trouble and I have to do something about it? I'm certain that this will happen someday. I greatly fear that day.

I just needed to let this all out and know if any of you have felt this way or similar, and how did you deal with it.

I have been trawling through this subreddit all day and you all seem like decent guys. So I would like to ask you for help about a sensitive issue! Wall of text ahead, sorry, but this is something that really upsets me.

My boyfriend was sexually abused as a young child by men. He revealed this to me several months into our relationship. I highly suspect that I may be the only person he has told about this.

It is still, however, very hard for him to talk about, and it has impacted how he views masculinity. There's a huge amount of self-hatred. He really sees male sexual behaviour as being aggressive, demeaning, etc. He's uncomfortable initiating sex in case he is ""forcing me"" into things, and he feels like he would be ""talking me into it"". He is extremely hesitant and requires an awful lot of coaxing to express even the most basic desires because he is so worried about being the aggressive man. For the record, he is an extremely placid person. 

Outside the bedroom he enjoys traditionally masculine pursuits, works in a male-dominated field, and has plenty of male friends with whom he is very close. But sexually speaking, he is very uncomfortable with his masculinity. He worries a lot about hurting or coercing me, and finds it very difficult to understand why I would be attracted to him as a man. He is uncomfortable with his body.

As we are all aware, there are very, very few resources for male victims of sexual abuse. It breaks my heart that his only way to cope is endless worry that he may himself be abusive, because our culture refuses to accept men as victims. He has really internalised this idea that male sexuality is predatory and creepy. Furthermore, he thinks that he does not deserve the same recognition that female victims would get BECAUSE he is male. Does anyone have any advice for me? How do I help him? Are there any victims here who feel comfortable sharing with me?

Not all the time, but often when I look in the mirror I don't like how I look. I exercise from time to time, and my body is okay, if not a bit underweight. I'm tall and skinny, I've got bad posture and am having a bad hair life. I'd like to think I dress well.

When I look at women I am attracted to, I've never thought of fucking them. Instead, I'll perhaps admire them a bit but there is never some instant sex thought. This often makes me feel like I have low testosterone or something.

I'm on the minimum effective dose of an antidepressant called Celexa.  Before I was taking it I was indeed hornier, jacking off one or twice a day perhaps. These days I'll go a few days without even thinking about it.

I'm mostly straight, but I sometimes go to gay clubs just to feel like I can be attractive to people. I've very rarely felt attractive to women, even if I was dating them and they said so.

I'd always imagine they were just throwing out some platitudes.

I haven't had a SO in a few years. Every day I get a little further away from really giving a shit about that: I have a lot of other cool stuff going on in my life, and honestly spending time with someone I don't completely adore would be less worthwhile to me than doing cool stuff that I am good at and enjoy doing.

I drink a lot. I have for a while. I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.

I make decent money. I'm very good at my job. I smoke cigarettes but I bike a lot. My house is a shithole but I recently bought a power drill.

I don't ask women I am attracted to for their number or whatever. That act seems foolish to me for two reasons: A. I am more attracted to a person the more I get to know them. B. I am not attractive enough for them to want to get to know me.

I'd been raped a few times when I was a kid. My therapist asserts this has something to do with my low self-esteem.

In short, I've been jealous of twoX for their ability to simply say some shit and have a few people read it, and I am attempting same.

I've always stood up for the subreddit in general, despite it's pretty poor reputation because I've always felt that genuine misogyny is downvoted to hell and that they do address issues that are under-represented by the media. Yet I find myself thoroughly disappointed by the reception I've received despite the overall message being one of unity, love and equal rights. I've apparently ""drunk the feminist kool-aid"" to quote one commenter. 

I thought I'd post it here and guage this subreddit's response both to my actual idea, and their responses. I'd love to hear your guy's thoughts. 

Also, if there happen to be any young ladies that frequent this subreddit, especially if you consider yourself a feminist, I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

-------------------------------------------------------------- 

This is something I've been thinking over for the past few weeks and I'd like to guage you guys and girls thoughts. 

I'm still keenly interested in men's rights and do still feel that men are disadvantaged in many areas both socially and in legislation. I enjoy discussing the subject, and indeed talk about it openly with male and female friends alike. Some agree with me, others don't. 

What I dislike about the MR movement at the moment is the aggressive anti-feminism rhetoric. Personally, I think a large portion of modern feminism in the first, western world is farcical and even causes damage to a certain extent. That said, the attitude of ""fuck feminism"" only serves to further entrench members of both social movements. The fact is that there are many places where women are still disadvantaged and we should offer our support to them in these causes.

I hate that the ""Us vs Them"" mentality even exists, when in reality it should just be ""us"", as in... people. I think we're all guilty of perpetuating this to a certain extent and regardless of which social movement you're more engaged in whether that is feminism or men's rights activism. 

Over the past century we have come leaps and bounds, and I like to think that men and women are closer to equality than ever before, but there is still work to be done for both genders to achieve this, and this requires co-operation and not hostility. 

For this reason I do not call myself a Men's Rights Activist, and do not like the idea of someone calling themself a feminist.

I mean, I totally understand it when they take home an acquaintance or someone they used to work with and whatnot...but it just baffles me how guys can meet a woman for the first time AND see her naked in less than 24 hrs.

I came SO close to having sex with a woman that I didn't know at all. SO close. I played a show with my band a while back and this waitress thought I was cute, so she told one my bandmates to give her number to me.

So I did. We went out for drinks with her friends and I seemed to be doing well (making her laugh, smile, telling interesting anecdotes, etc.) I took her back to my place and she was like ""let's watch a movie!"" So we start making out and next thing I know she's in my bed. As I begin to carefully remove my pants and her skirt, she slaps me. 

""No!""

""Huh?""

""No""

""O...kay.""

So we kept making out and engaging in some second base fun, but she kept blocking my advances. So I generally took that as 'no means no.'

So we didn't have sex and I ended up driving her home. The next day, she was all like ""oh but I DID want to have sex, you just didn't pick up on my cues.""

I'm sure many of you have encountered this before. This guy sure seems to:

1344999287.0,92,self.OneY,y8osf,Man to man: Do you ever reflect on the way your father was brought up and weigh it against your own childhood? (X-Post from /r/askmen),98,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/y8osf/man_to_man_do_you_ever_reflect_on_the_way_your/,"Gentlemen:

I'm sitting here drinking a beer and watching Mad Men, soaking in the raw masculinity of the men on that show and it dawned on me that my parents were both born only a few years after the time frame of the show. My parents were born in '65 (I'm 22 and my brother is 25).

My father was the youngest of 8 in a very Catholic family in a reasonable Midwestern town. He never really talked about his childhood that much, though I've kind of pieced together how my grandfather was as a dad. He was always smoking with beer in-hand. I've never heard my dad mention being beaten but I'm sure that it has more to do with my grandfather not being present than considering it bad form. Anyway, he died when my dad was 11 and the age of 50. My dad was then raised in large part by his siblings, mostly his older sisters.

After watching Mad Men and reading up on some other era history, I'm realizing that this was very common for young men of that time; they grew up in homes without a whole lot of support from their fathers. I'd like to know more about my grandfather but always felt that it wasn't a topic of discussion around my dad. I didn't even know his name until the end of college.

As for my childhood, my father was always very supportive of me and my endeavors and we have a great relationship. My brother and I, though, were never really taught how to be men. My father tried to teach us in his own way but it never really seemed like he knew what to do with us. My brother and I turned out alright. We're both successful in our own rights and have never been disrespectful to women or elders or the like. But I can't help but think that since my dad had such a shotty father he had to figure out how to be a man on his own, and that kind of passed down to my brother and I.

Now that I'm out of college, living solely on my own dime, and trying to figure out what kind of man I want to be in my professional and personal like, I can't help but have these musings and wonder about who my grandfather was, who my greatgrandfather was, and how my uncles were raised.

So, I was just wondering what kind of thoughts other men have on this subject; whether they have ever considered how their dad's upbringing changed how they were brought up and what they thought about it.
As a question: How was your father and/or grandfather raised? How does that compare to how you were raised? How does that make you reflect on your childhood and does it offer any insight into who you are and/or how you want to (or do) raise your kids?

p.s. I realize that the beer might have something to do with the length of this post. A few beers + musings + reddit = long post.

**TL;DR : Grandfather died when my father was young and my father and I weren't really taught how to be a man. Have you ever considered how your father's upbringing has affected your own?**

Edit: I really appreciate how much everyone shared about this topic. A lot of what's been said has made me try to view my father's childhood in a different way.

""That is probably the part I hated the most. As a guy you get about a three-note emotional range. That's it, at least as far as the outside world is concerned. Women get octaves, chromatic scales of tears and joys and anxieties and despairs and erotic flamboyance, and now after black bra feminism, we even get vitriol, too. We get to be bitches, at least some of the time, and people write proud books about it. But guys get little more than bravado and rage. Forget doubt. Forget hurt. They take punches. They take care of business. And their intestines liquefy under the stress.""

A recent relationship, along with some past ones, has left me wondering a lot of things. When she was in a bad mood, she would pick fights about anything. I tried to be patient, but part of me feels like I should've stood my ground every time and not let things fly. There are a lot of times I kept my mouth shut that I wish I hadn't, and a lot of times what I should have said was nothing.

This experience also makes me want to never tell anyone anything ever again. What I thought was just me talking, she took as incessant whining. A lot of things in my life are unspoken, and generally that is ok (especially when I'm feeling strong), but for some reason I have this conception of that being less so in a romantic relationship. No secrets, as straightforward as possible. But the past says otherwise to me. I feel like you're only allowed to be vulnerable up to a small point if you want to be with a women, and that vulnerability is preferably expressed via anger. I'm hoping someone has a jewel of wisdom here.

No. She doesn't want to kiss more than once in her apartment either.

Do I have any right to feel a bit angry?,110,25,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/wbvdo/best_friend_sleeping_with_ex_do_i_have_any_right/,"So I just found out my best friend has been sleeping with my ex gf.  We broke up a while ago when she went travelling, and although we hooked up briefly when she got back (about 4 months ago) it has technically been two years since we were actually together.

She once asked me (while she was away travelling) about how I would feel about the two of them hooking up and I didn't take it very well.  I suppose I was just jealous.  I spoke to him about it and he denied that there was a possibility of anything happening.  However as it turns out, they had been having kinda sexy skype conversations during this period.

She told me about it last night over a skype conversation, and he doesn't know that I know.

I am really torn between feeling slightly angry that he did it despite me talking to him about how it would upset me, and knowing that I have absolutely no right to have any say over who my ex or my friends see and sleep with.  I don't even live in the same city as them any more.

I'm not sure what sort of response I am expecting from this, I guess I just needed to vent.  Thanks for reading/listening. 

(and some of my close friends are redditors I have opted for a throwaway)

*tl;dr: Feel a bit upset even though I know I shouldn't that my best friend has been sleeping with my ex gf.*

EDIT:  Thank you for all your words of wisdom.  I can only begin to tell you how helpful this has been, and how glad I am that there is a community like this to talk to when we need to.  

I think the general consensus is that I need to let go of my feelings for her so as not to give a damn any more.  As for him... I know it wasn't a personal attack on me, they were both just horny and clearly attracted to each other, as well as being good friends... so of course something was going to happen at *some* point.  I don't think there is any point letting it upset me.  

Maybe one day he will admit it to me in some moment of sincerity and I will say the same thing to him then that I will say now.  They are both adults, they are both single, and it is not something that is worth my time to care about.  

EDIT 2: I want to say thank you for all the great advice that I have recieved.  The fact is this is simply the reality of the situation, and getting angry about it just won't solve anything.  These are two of my closest friends and I want nothing more than for them to be happy.  It is only natural for me to be hurt by dishonesty, but I can appreciate the reasons he wouldn't want to tell me, and if you don't show a little understanding to your friends, then who are you going to show it to?

So yeah, thank you again for all the comments.  I'm not going to delete the post, as I think there is really useful stuff for anyone who is ever in this situation, but I'm gonna switch back to my regular account so I probably won't see more messages.

I work as a tradesman at a large truck repair shop, our company hired its first female tradeswoman to work with us. She came to the company with little training in her field (apprenticeship level) and has been working here for maybe a month. The only woman among about 100 guys..

Initially she sat alone at coffees and you could tell she was intimidated. As the days have went on, she seems to be getting more and more comfortable around everyone, and since day one guys have been lining up to introduce themselves lol.

So anyway,
She came late for coffee today and sat down next to us with a sigh. One of us asked how it was going as a usual convo starter and she decided to spill the beans. 

One of the guys she is working with has been giving her a hard time because she doesn't know everything yet and that she will never figure it out because she is just a girl and on it went according to her blah blah blah.
Having known that guy for several years, frankly I seen that coming.

What I was shocked to see was the reaction of the group to her revelation. 
Several guys moved in and sat closer to her and began reassuring her that she was valued, others expressed anger at the other guy for being such a jerk, others insisted that she was more than capable of doing her job, being a girl had nothing to do with it. 

I was touched at how quickly and decisively the whole group got behind her and tried to make her feel included and valued. Initially when she started complaining about her coworker I was getting ready to be the only one to speak up and try my best to make her feel better. But as it turns out I didn't have to say a word. The entire group was there to support her. 

It cant be that fun to be the only one out of almost a hundred people thats different, but I hope eventually with continued support like they showed her today, she might feel like she belongs one day.

To give you an idea of what my situation is like: A lot of my male friends' lives seem to revolve around only video games and girls. Which is fine, but that's basically it. Even when our conversations turn ""deep"" it's still fundamentally the same. It's so one-dimentional and I am beginning to see my guy friends as a bit....superficial? Not sure if that's the right word. I used to think I could go to them about anything, that they would be there for me. But this psychological barrier is killing me. Clearly not all men are like this, but I, a college-aged American male, am in a situation where pretty much all guys I meet are like this. 

Anyway, back to my main point: Girls seem less likely to judge you for ever wanting to talk about your feelings. They are more sensitive. They just seem nicer. And because of this I seriously feel ostracized from the male populace. Yes, seriously. I made a total of 4 good friends so far in college and all have been female. It's so bad that I've even questioned my sexuality, even though all evidence says that I'm straight. I just don't get it. Does anyone have any words of advice? Is this normal? Help?

EDIT: Just wanted to add that another reason I feel so bothered by my inability to make friends with guys is that I *want* some masculinity in my life, if that makes sense. Making friends with girls is a lot easier, but I feel like I'm missing out on the world of manliness. I feel so stupid saying that, but it's true. Anyway, thanks for reading.

I think I've been suffering from fairly severe body image issues. I'll try and keep it short but here's my story:

Spent most of my school years as bit overweight, but not obese. More then chubby, but not ""fat"" by most standards. I have a fairly large frame which didn't help.

After high school I started being less active and started eating out more. At my heaviest I was 235 lbs, and definitely in fat territory.

So I started working out and eating less. I started getting compliments on my weight loss. With that motivation, I decided I wanted to go all the way to having a six pack. More weight loss. More calorie deficits. Some days eating less than 1000 calories. I got down to 165. Friends, family, and coworkers stopped complimenting me and started telling me I was losing too much weight. A close friend of mine finally told me that I wasn't allowed to lose any more.

So I read up on how apparently the most effective way to burn fat is to build muscle. I start a weight-training program and loosely follow a bodybuilder diet. I'm looking for signs of being ""toned"", like striations in the forearm and that line down the middle of your back. Things I typically saw on naturally skinny guys. Didn't realize that I was gaining a lot of weight - I'm currently at 202 lbs and probably the leanest I've been in my entire life. I'm not *cut*, no six pack or anything, but I'm a far cry from what I once was. I was never trying to get big or muscular, just wanted to tone up a bit.

Anyways, I've noticed from the comments I'm getting that apparently I'm now considered muscular, like possibly even ~~meathead~~ bodybuilder territory. But I still look in the mirror and see myself as a fat guy, I'm still unhappy with the fat I have on my body.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? And if I *do* have some sort of body image issue, what can I do to move past it?

So, I talked to both by wife and my ex. First my wife, everything went fine. We got a sitter and went out for some beers and garlic fries. I told her about the book, and her response was essentially ""That's weird"" and that was that. In retrospect, I'm not sure why I was so nervous. She has no interest in reading it, and everything is fine. 

Now the ex. She called and we talked for over an hour. She had called all her exes who are in the book but left me for last. My name and description are changed, so no issues there. I feature in two chapters, one as a background character and another as the primary subject. The stories are funny but also sad and not particularly flattering at some points. This is understandable, as they take place a decade ago and I wasn't a great boyfriend at 19-20. She explained that I was the first person to break her heart, something I knew deep down but never really thought about. She also flattered me, writing that I was the most gorgeous man she had ever seen (at that time, I have a beer belly now) and telling me that she still has a piece of jewelry that I gave to her back then.

All in all, I'm ok with it and everything is fine. I've spent some time thinking about those years after we talked, and with her comments as context I know how poorly I treated her. In my defense (and as she herself pointed out), she was pretty psycho to deal with, so it's not all one sided. And the book is humorous, so as much as she digs at me she digs at herself equally so.

I have not read it, but probably will. If any of you want to read it, PM me and I will send you the title. I know it's on iBooks, not sure about Amazon kindle. Preorder is about $10 and the release is early July.

We started early in high school, and are currently in college.  Our colleges are in the same city (happy coincidence) so we have had an easy time continuing the relationship.  We were each others' first, for pretty much everything, and neither of us has had any sexual experience outside this relationship.  She mentioned at one point that she felt like she had skipped a step somewhere along the way, and hadn't ever had sex with anyone else, and I think I know what she means, but I never felt particularly strongly about it.  I told her that if she ever felt the need to go have sex with someone else to resolve the issue in her mind, she could, as long as she was safe about it.   Initially she didn't think much of it, and wasn't particularly interested, but today she proposed that we pick a month to both have a free pass to have sex with anyone else, after which we would go back to each other and have had the experience.  

I'm not against the idea overall, but there is a problem with it.  She is very socially active, and goes to parties and drinks, etc, while I hang out with a tight group of friends and am not a fan of most parties.  Too crowded and overstimulating.  I know she would have an easy time of finding someone mess around with in one night at a party.  I am not so socially blessed.  Overall, hookup culture just isn't attractive to me, and I'm not interested in starting now.  I told her she could just go ahead and have her month, and that I wasn't all that interested in going to the effort of trying to start anything with another girl, but she felt like it would just be cheating on me if she was the only one doing it.  She has posed the whole thing to me as an option, it is at my discretion anyway

Does anyone have thoughts to give here? I don't really know what I'm looking for here, but I'm trying to decide how I feel.  I'm cool with the idea, but I don't feel like jumping into my school's party scene at this point, it just isn't my thing, and I don't know anyone who is interested in a friends-with-benefits relationship.

We've been married for 4 years, together for 7 and this past month has been one of the worst I've encountered since I confused love and infatuation at the age of 18, 19 and of course 20. In other words, I feel like all the confidence and self-esteem I've built over the years is gone.

I feel like I've lost my mind.

I'll start from the beginning. 

My wife is a lovely women, she's very attractive - not done up. Naturally fit and a body no one would complain or argue against. This is not all, she is a kind, truly kind and loving individual. She loves to cook, is an artist, collects simple beautiful things and we've traveled extensively together.

I come from a very sexually active background. I've fought with low self-esteem all throughout my formative years yet still ended up in the bed of 42 women. By all accounts, I should not complain. After all this, I found what I needed in myself to find the women I wanted to be with and lo and behold, I came across this girl. Wasting no time in locking that down.

I've learned so much in the years we've been together. I look back now and realize that I was a wreck in need of positive influence and good old fashioned love. (I come from your quintessential broken home/ alcoholic driven after school specials). I've always taken pride in my ability to articulate and present myself with dignity and respect. After all, it was the only way to differentiate myself from what could have been my fate. I educated myself from the schools of street and academia, respectively.

I under no circumstances take my position in life, that of a good job, a beautiful wife, a clean, nice humble home, and a well stocked fridge for granted. By all accounts, many would call this a first world problem but please understand, I am aware of all this yet still am confused and in need of other men to help me through this.

We have sex on what seems like a 6 week rotation. I take care of 'business' everyday 5 times a week. I am near insatiable. Porn has only desensitized me and now I need penguins fucking midgets to really get the juices flowing. In all seriousness, I just look for naturally beautiful girls who moan. I tell you this because this is what I lack.

That fundamental passion, that underlying tone of voice when in coitus, when she grabs the back of your head and tilts hers back while a moan finds its way to your ear. How she pulls you in with her legs yet simultaneously spreads them enough to tell you, in no uncertain terms are you desired even more than this one, perfect moment.

The way her eyes draw you into that state of disassembled fury and lust, that your animal instincts can be satiated by her and you should trust no other in this task. That unbelievable trust that happens in that embrace. 

Looking back, I don't think I've ever had that with my wife.

Sex is awkward for her. There are two positions. On her stomach and spoon. Everything else hurts her, every other direction 'goes in wrong'. We shift, move, have conversations trying to align and the mood gets buried under the act of push, pull, push, pull. There is no passion.

This choreography is constant. I have not lain between a womans thighs only to slide into her want without a small fight. The lack of lust and instant take and fuck and drive is listless and I've had a bit of a breakdown over it.

I work in a very public place, I see women, nay girls often. 20 year old girls who place their sexuality on display and my stomach begins to curl. It's no longer a quick glance, quick vision of me driving from behind, it's her caressing me, pulling me in, whispering in my ear. It's us driving to the mountains, laughing and fucking all the way, swimming in secluded rivers and catching the darted looks across a shop in anticipation for our next moments alone.

I've fought these ideas in the face of absolute possibility, phone numbers, invites, blatant demands (the third does not attract me in the slightest - I enjoy subtlety) and this last one, the subtlety is what gets me.. am I after the chase again? Because honestly, at this junction in my 4 weeks of discombobulation, I haven't the heart nor the absence of anxiety to fight my own obsessions let alone the games that come with this territory.

I know many of you will cast this aside as just another lust scenario and you know what, maybe it is, maybe it'll pass but please give me an understanding, your perspective. I'm NOT just thinking about other women, I'm having a need fulfilled in a very intimate way with these desires that I no longer, if ever, got from my wife and tonight, I told her.

I told her all the above and she interrupted to defend her position without me finishing what the problem was. I told her there was a lack of passion and her response was, 'I'll be more passionate.' Not once did she mention 'we' or 'us'. She can be very literal for an artist.

I made it very clear how she dwarves these other women in her love, intelligence, ambition, character and devotion to our marriage and that this is only one aspect of our marriage that I am having trouble with. That I am becoming an unused stock horse at 30. 

I feel undesired by my spouse. Completely, utterly. It makes me tear up. There's no passion but a lot of love. I feel like I'm in friend mode but I know that if I ever went the route of infidelity, the guilt would eat me alive. I haven't the stomach for it but when my female friends slide their arms around my waist to hug me, I melt in a a way I haven't in years.

--

**EDIT**: Clarity

**EDIT 2**: I should note that after telling her this, she asked if I wanted to leave the marriage. I just felt like she had missed the point entirely.

**EDIT 3**: Thank you all for the responses. The camps may be divided between counselling and medical help but I'm thinking both have merit. I truly am appreciative of this. Cheers

**EDIT 4** Currently at work but I will respond to everyone when I get home. Thanks again.

**EDIT 5** I'm back. This support has been wonderful. I am grateful.

Girlfriend wants to wait until marriage for sex.,107,29,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/qij3k/need_advice_girlfriend_wants_to_wait_until/,"Some background info:  So my girlfriend and I have been together for only three months but in that time we've become very close and this relationship really seems to be going places.  I'm 25 and she's 26. I have a lot of relationship experience and she's only dated two guys before and neither was serious.  She's a gorgeous girl who attracts a lot of male attention, she just hasn't had much interest in dating before she met me.  She's a very happy, fun-loving person which perfectly meshes with me.

We're absolutely crazy about eachother and can never seem to keep our hands off eachother but here's the kicker; she wants to wait until marriage for sex (or anything sexual besides a good ol' hot makeout session).  Now this isn't a dealbreaker for me at all.  Although it's really different for me since the longest I've waited for sex in the past was a month.  Her reasons for wanting to do this are not religious and leans towards the romantic.  She has a really fun-loving attitude towards sex and, like me, thinks lots of sex makes for a great relationship. 

So I was wondering if anyone has been in this situation before?  How do you deal with the burning desire?  This whole “wait until marriage” thing is very important to her and I want to respect that.

Any tips guys?

**Edit:** I appreciate all the feedback guys, but apparently I was not clear on what I was asking.  I was not asking for advice on the situation.  Many of you are warning me on the dangers of not being sexually compatible and other things.  There's no way I can fully explain the dynamics of the relationship on reddit but I assure you that sexual compatibility with this girl is not a worry.  I'm more looking for advice on how to deal with not having sex.


**Edit2:** This is the most disappointing thread I've every started.  I came to OneY because I've always respected this subreddit.  I came here looking for advice on a dealing with not having sex in a relationship, What I got was a load of people making harsh judgements about me and my girlfriend and why we should break up.  I'm sure you all meant well and maybe I wasn't clear enough in my original post, but I am **happy** in this relationship.  Happier than I've ever been in any relationship.  I was **not** looking for relationship advice.  I've had enough experience and I am mature enough to gauge situations on my own.

1364405827.0,80,self.OneY,1b4dv6,How do you folks feel about pornography and the porn industry?,106,26,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1b4dv6/how_do_you_folks_feel_about_pornography_and_the/,"I've managed a porn store now for about a year, and that's given me ample time and material to form several (sometimes contradictory) opinions on porn, prostitution, and promiscuity. But I rarely discuss my work with people (""I sell rubber dicks"" isn't the kind of thing that comes up often in casual conversation), so these opinions mostly go unshaped and unchallenged. 

Do you feel that porn (we're talking production-value Brazzers kind of stuff, not /r/gonewild) as a whole is empowering to women, or oppressive? Do you believe it does damage to the fight for gender equality? Is it inherently racist? 

What sort of role do you see it playing in relationships? Do you think it is damaging to how relationships form? 

Do you think the monetization and commodification of something as intimate as sex is ultimately a moral failing? 

Does it have an effect on how we view sexual orientation and promiscuity?

I realize this is a bit of an open-ended question, but please feel free to chime in with whatever input you have.

I'll share my opinions in a bit.

**edit for some input, in unrelated order:**

I have found that the battle over pornography and its place in society is ultimately much more damaging to our view and understanding of sexuality than even the most debasing porn could ever possibly be. It reveals the anxiety that we experience socially in regards to sexual activity in its most stark terms, and it cements in the minds of the impressionable (i.e. the people the whole battle is there to protect) that sex is something to be ashamed of, or that anything more than the puritanical understanding is heathen or debasing.

I have discovered a masturbation double-standard. Women who buy vibrators are seen as adventurous, sexy, and taking control of their sexuality. Men who buy masturbation sleeves are seen as sad, lonely, and incapable of finding a mate. I have seen couples enter the store with the intent of purchasing a vibrator for the girl, and when her boyfriend jokingly suggests a stroker, it is almost invariably met with the response ""I should be enough for you"". Perhaps it is a reflection of the typical view of The Elusive Female Orgasm and The Undiscerning Male Erection. Perhaps it's an entrenched anxiety about masculinity. This manifests in attitudes about porn in that pornography is the last vestige of the Sad and the Desperate. I think this view is inherently harmful; as people hit puberty and their hormones go nuts, a social anxiety about pornography will lead him to take increasingly risky and potentially harmful behavior as a means of venting that pent up sexuality (which leads hand-in-hand into the abstinence and abortion debates, which I'll leave for another day).

A common critique of pornography is that it objectifies women in a harmful way. I will not argue that this is the case (after all, it's the *entire goddamn point* of porn), but I *will* argue that this is only half a statement. Pornography objectifies both genders to equal extremes; where women might be presented as nothing more than the sum of her physical assets and her identity boiled down to a single note (""I like to get *fucked*""), men are often denied even a face. In porn, they are nothing more than a dick and maybe a pair of hands. Some might argue that this is also the point, that men in male-targetted porn are little more than avatars, for the viewer to project himself into it. I understand the argument, but I reject it on the grounds that I still believe that dehumanization is harmful to both genders.

Another common critique is how pornography damages an individuals view of intimacy and romance. ""Our children will grow up with unrealistic expectations of sex!"" This, I think, is another reflection of our own attitudes about sex, and reveals an inability for us to have a conversation. Your kid will only grow up with unrealistic expectations of sex and relationships if you *don't try to counter what they're seeing in porn*. As long as you continue to avoid having an honest discussion and insist on pushing that duty off on your schools and pro-abstinence special interest groups, your kid is going to grow up with an unrealistic expectation of sex. And that is not a failing of porn, that is a failing of parenting. It'd be like lamenting that your kid only speaks in lolspeak, but have never enrolled them in an English class. 

There is a concept in porn called 'Gay for Pay', which describes typically-straight actors taking on gay porn roles for the increased pay (anal/gay nets an actor a larger paycheck). I am uncomfortable with someone's sexuality coming with a price tag. I have nothing else to say, just an observation.

There was a photo that hit the front page a few weeks ago of a guy in Australia watching porn at work. Someone felt the need to take a photo of it, post it to the internet, and then that shit spread to news networks. That is really fucked up. We ridiculed and humiliated a man for engaging in a behavior we all do (""HAHA he's looking at naked people! HOW LUDICROUS!""). That kind of shaming behavior is just eight kinds of unwelcome.

I believe the best kind of porn is the porn made for free. People who film themselves fucking on their cell phone and upload it to the internet; these are the people who are into it, are excited by the thought, and are doing it because they want to. It's hard to take professional porn seriously when you know the actors and actresses on stage are just doing their job, and very few are actually enjoying what they're doing. I think that attitude in itself is also fairly damaging.

**tl;dr**: Porn itself isn't inherently harmful, but it becomes *very* harmful when the society that produces it is still unable to approach sex maturely or honestly. The kind of sexual proclivities that anxiety breeds makes its way into the porn industry, where it becomes codified and repeated, resulting in a feedback loop that drags us all down with it. 

It pleases me to see that this sentiment seems to be the general consensus.

Now, for the big question:

I'm not even of average height. Apparently my body decided to stop growing in the eighth grade. I didn't really pay a lot of attention to my height until after high school, actually until after college. But over the past two years, being so short has played a huge role in my growing insecurities and unhappiness.

Once I started paying attention to it, it became so apparent to me how I'm literally and figuratively looked down upon, solely because of my height. I will never be perceived as tough, as strong, and I've noticed that I'm not even perceived as being ""manly"" whatsoever, whether I'm actively trying to be or not. And half the time, I get comments like, ""Oh that's just your short man rage,"" or something similar.

I have little to no luck with women anymore (not that I ever had a lot), and this is part of the reason why I'm finding it ever more difficult to believe that this would ever change. None of the other advice/support I sought and received has helped in the least, I usually just get trite stuff like, ""Just be confident, that's all you need,"" or ""don't let it be an issue."" Well it's a goddamn issue.

I'm so tired of being so short and even more exasperated with this being seen as a non-issue. I cannot stand the dismissal of it and I honestly feel like nobody understands what it's like for a single short man of ethnic background. I don't even know what to do anymore.

Any thoughts?",103,27,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1bt38u/so_a_girl_once_told_me_that_me_fist_bumping_guys/,"So at some point last year, I sit down at a lunch table where my buddy Jeff and our friend Danielle (fake names) are eating. He said something like ""what's up brah"" and fist bumped me. He's a real masculine, well built and friendly guy, kind of has the stereotypical frat bro look and personality, without the arrogant douchebag part of the stereotype.

Danielle got annoyed. She asks why we're doing that, and says it degrades us. I just say, ""huh?"" She says again, ""don't you think it degrades you?"" She seemed to mostly direct the question at me.

**Backstory:** So I'm gay, and have been pretty immersed in the gay community since I was 18. I've had few straight friends, and my groups of friends were rarely traditionally masculine. I then moved away and started law school  about a year and a half ago. Made all new friends, nearly all straight, traditionally masculine, not homophobic at all. I like it because I can be myself, yet at the same time, in some ways I feel I fit in better than I did around the gay community. 

By which I mean, after a while it seemed like too many of my gay friends were simply acting feminine as a way of showing off, instead of actually expressing themselves. Constant trying to stay catty almost like a contest. do or say anything that fits a masculine gender role, and you're categorized, not in a degrading way but just in this boxing in kind of way. It's fun, but it got old. I eventually felt like I was restraining my masculine side, like I had no outlet to express it. It was almost like being back in the closet in high school, when I'd worry about what people will think if I admit I like techno more than metal and if I wear tighter than average pants or if I'm walking right, etc.

**Fast forward to now:** So I like my straight, masculine yet accepting friends. I really feel like I'm able to ""let my hair up"" around them so to speak, and be more expressive of my masculine aspects. And one of the things me and few of these friends do is fist bump, and call each other ""bro"" and even ""brah."" I love it. It's not some act for me, I really feel just like ""one of the guys"" when we do that, not just a counterculture, tongue-in-cheek act. I love being able to express my traditional masculine aspects; it's something people take for granted sometimes.

So, what do you all think of her statement? does anyone here feel like it somehow degrades men? I've seen it made fun of before, but I don't care, I love being one of the guys. None of us are ignorant or the type to crush beer cans on our forehead, so idk what she was talking about other than maybe us fitting a stereotype.

**tl,dr:** I got tired of gender obsession in the gay community, moved for school, made straight bro friends, love feeling like one of the guys, but soem girl told me that fist bumping degrades me. Thoughts?

**EDIT** wow. To clarify, I'm really not upset at her, like some people seem to be here. the reason I came on here to ask for people's thought on why someone would feel that way instead of asking her, is it's been so long since the exchange, that I don't think she would even remember.

There's so much more I could add.

The story thus far:

3 years ago I was informed that I am a father. My ex had decided that I was too young and never informed me that I had a daughter. She also didn't want my daughter so she gave my daughter to her aunt to raise and that is where my daughter now resides. My daughter was 10 at the time of me finding out. 

I spent the next 2 years gradually getting to know my daughter and building a relationship. She used to glow talking about me. My daughter would call every Sunday morning asking when I was coming to pick her up. We started having the occasional overnight and all was going awesome. 

1 year ago is when all the shit started. I gave my daughter the choice of spending the night. She chose to stay with me. The aunt who has guardianship was hurt by this. I saw my daughter once after that. The next time I saw my daughter there was controversy over which movie I took her to see. By choosing a different movie than what I was told to take her to see by the aunt I was ""going against her families morals and values"". 

After that ALL my access was cut off. When I tried to call I was told ""if you keep calling I'll get a restraining order against you"". Even though that was the 4th time I tried to call in 3 weeks. My entire family and I were blocked on all online communications from my daughter. I couldn't even send a ""Happy Birthday"" on facebook. 

I of course got a lawyer and started into the court system. It took until October for me to even have an afternoon with my daughter again. I requested the office of the children's lawyer to get involved because of the blatant alienation. My daughter went from leaving my ex gf's husband at the door (when returning from a weekend there) to rush to the phone to call me ASAP, to this child that is distant and doesn't even text on a weekly basis. 

The children's lawyer found that it's my fault! I'm pushing too hard despite always waiting on my daughter's calls and not initiating visits. My ex who gave up all her rights signing over guardianship has more access than I do. I've done everything I possibly can right. They're trying so hard to demonize me that they're reaching into ""third hand smoke"".

What I'm left with is being relegated to being nothing more than an extended family member. I get 1 Saturday afternoon per month. I have to restart the entire bonding process again and get to miss even more of my child's life. 

What it all boils down to is that I'm at the point of being ready to give up completely. Accept my role as nothing more than an extended family member seeing my daughter occasionally. I have no idea how someone is to form a parental bond with only 8 hours a month of time or how they expect that to happen. The problem is I just can't let go. This is my daughter after all. I can fully understand why there's so many dead beat dads now thanks to this system. 

I'm being torn to shreds inside. I'm hitting low dark places that I'm not even comfortable with. The idea of where to hide the bodies does cross my mind quite frequently now as there's just pure rage being buried and that's not who I am.

Any attempt to link them is marketing.  It is marketing based on fear of not fitting in or the fear of not being masculine; it is marketing based on wanting to be like the protagonists that interested parties sponsor in movies to drink their brand of alcohol, or marketing based on the idea that ""real men"" can hold their liquor, or drink to manage emotional pain.  If you drink beer but want a cosmopolitan you’ve succumbed to social pressure installed by breweries to control you with fear.  If you drink when you don’t want to, you’ve succumbed to firestorm of insecurity that the alcohol industry furiously fuels with advertisements to keep you boxed into a simple definition of masculinity.

Bottom Line:  Drinking habits have nothing to do with manliness.  Drink what you want to drink, when you want to drink it and don’t let anyone give you any shit about it.

Mostly fruit, ramen, tea, sandwiches, vegieburgers, granola bars, lot's of water. I normally run three days a week when it's not winter. I have to stay up late a lot to do homework.





All day every day I feel zombie-like. Even when I do get a full nights sleep I fade in and out of sleep during my morning classes. I feel like I have zero emotions unless being frustrated with math problems counts as an emotion. I have almost zero sex drive, when I do have to masturbate it's really more of a ""have-to"" thing than a ""want-to"" thing. And I get zero pleasure from it, it's just as much a chore as going to the bathroom. The skin on my face is unhealthy as fuck. Constant painful acne, it's very oily and just plain gross.

I'm always farting ALL DAMN DAY and I recently got a hemorrhoid, but thankfully it seems to be going away. I have no emotional energy or motivation to do good on my work or do anything at all. Especially after noon time. After that the only thing I have any desire for is to go back to sleep. 96 percent of the time I don't even want to have any sort of interaction with my friends. Even my personal hobbies don't hold my interest anymore. There's a stack of books in my room I genuinely like and want to finish, but I feel no motivation to even pick them up. The same goes for my guitar and video games.




I have no idea what to make of all this. It's just such a wide range of things and they don't even seem related to each other. And I don't have a doctor or insurance so I can't go to them.

I'm not sure if this is the place to post this but I figured I'd give it a shot. Feel free to direct me elsewhere if this isn't the case.

Background info:
So my girlfriend (22) and I (23) have been dating for three years and have agreed to have sex for the first time. For those of you not laughing your butts off right now (it's cool, I think it's hilarious too) I would like to add that we were both raised super religiously and have never even gone to first base before one another. (If this caused you to laugh as well it's cool, I still think it's pretty funny.)

So we do all the usual couple stuff: go on a date, drive around town, watch James Bond, etc. On the way back to my apartment we pick up some condoms at the local drugstore. Not knowing what kind to get we pulled the most interesting looking one off the shelf and headed back asap.

Cut to intimate time and I slip one on. Within seconds I was no longer hard and no matter what we did afterwards I couldn't get it up. We figured it must have been first time jitters so we resolved to try again in the morning. Within seconds of our next attempt I was soft once again. After a third attempt we bought a different pack of condoms and got the same result. 

My questions:
Am I doing something wrong here? I figured wearing a condom shouldn't be too difficult but apparently i'm not very good at it. Any advice on my situation?

**UPDATE**

Wow thanks for all the advice everyone, this is great stuff.

I seriously didn't think this would get all the attention it did, but I'm glad because every single one of your comments helped me better understand the situation. Now that I have an idea of what I'm doing I think everything is going to be okay. Hopefully when I see my lady again (we're currently doing a long distance thing right now, I should see her in about a month) things will be different.

I agree that if you're in the top 5% of looks it's probably a lot easier to pick up and if you're in the bottom 5% it's probably a lot harder, but for the vast majority of people who exist in the middle I feel like this attitude is a real cop out. To me, it's a defense mechanism that allows you to rationalize rejection as something you have no control over (oh, I guess it's because I'm just not attractive) instead of stepping up to the far harder job of being honestly self critical and figuring out what went wrong. Being criticized for something you have no control over is less threatening to your ego than criticism for who you actually are or how you choose to behave. 

Even if you define attractive as more than just physical attractiveness (confidence, humour, body language, compassion, material wealth), I still don't think this improves the advice. It allows uncritical acceptance of the idea that attractiveness is like a natural talent - some people Have It, and others Don't. I feel the reality is more like most other endeavours - some lucky people might just Have It, but most people have to self reflect and work to overcome their weaknesses, whatever they might be.

She left under the pretenses of seeing each other again soon.

Monday evening I get the ""I don't think we're a good match"" email out of the blue. ಠ_ಠ Ouch. After pondering on it, I realized she was probably right and I almost certainly built her up too much in my mind.

After feeling low about it for a while, I chalked it up to experience, was thankful she let me know now rather than 3 or 4 dates in, let the wind fill my sails again, and had a great night's sleep.

Why do I experience this at 25 ?,99,21,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1d2lyv/what_is_this_all_about_why_do_i_experience_this/,"So, I have no idea if this is gonna be a long one, a short one, but I really want to share my experience with someone and ask for advice, as I am in  dire need of advice right now.

Some things about me : I am 25, I run every day, am in grad school and work part time to keep food on the table and stuff. I mostly enjoy digital culture and art, video games. But my focus in my studies lies in biodiversity, conservation, development, the like. Moved here, into another country, 3 years ago today. It was a LONG road, with many hardships and sacrifices, but somehow I managed to get this far.

I didn't think much of relationships for the last three years. I never actively searched for a girlfriend, I focused mainly on improving my life, finding employment, studying, the like. I wasn't self centered or anything, I enjoyed the company of women but did not find anyone who made me feel like I want to pursue anything further than a physical relationship.

Almos three months ago (sorry for maybe sounding chaotic but I am not well) I met the most beautiful, awesome and kind woman I have ever layed my eyes upon. We hit it off right off the bat, we love each other deeply and I am very positive about some sort of relationship together. You might say she is the right one for me.

Two weeks ago, something happened. We discussed one evening our relationship via skype, as it was late and we wanted to talk. We did fine, agreed on some stuff, disagreed on others, but we discussed it very nicely and we managed to end the conversation in a very positive and healthy way.

That morning, I started crying for the first time in so many years. I felt devoid of feelings, I couldn't eat. I stopped running, meditating, taking long walks, what have you. I didn't want to see anyone, not even her. I put off school work and took time off of work. Went to a psychologist who after that referred me to a psychiatrist who prescribed me Sertralin and Xanax. Took the for four days, stopped it as they were turning me into a zombie. 

Through all of this, my girlfriend is lovingly by my side, even though I am obsessing about whether I should leave her or not, if I truly love her or not, I question everything about our relationship basically. And I have no god damn idea why. I love her so much, I want our relationship to work, I do not want to break up with her for this, it is not healthy nor wise. Breaking up with her would only make me feel worse, as I am positive that such a fit would be hard to be found again and basically, the near future is at least unbearable without her.

So, anyone else experience this? What course of action do you suggest taking? I am feeling deeply deeply lost and would love to speak to someone, even if online, just to know that everything will be alright and that I will leave this crysis behind me someday. I would be more than happy to provide additional info, about anything, may it be PM or anything. Please, help me out, friends!

I asked him if I could post and here it is! Enjoy. :)** 

""Why are straight men often ridiculed and made fun of by gay men and straight women alike? I understand the whole ""male privilege"" thing, and I can think of more than a few examples of public figures who I'd have a few choice words to say if I ever met them. However, in my life I've met some pretty amazing guys who break the whole ""stupid, horny, sexist pig"" stereotype that is so quickly assigned them.
 
Straight men and I didn't start off on the right foot, mind you. Going to a Christian school as a gay man for nearly 12 years really puts things into perspective. Not once in my entire middle or high school experience did I ever feel comfortable around nor accepted by my male classmates. I was made fun of in gym class, shunned at lunch time, and laughed at when I spoke my mind in class. So it's no surprise that when I made the switch to public school I quickly discovered that not all men are jerks: a lesson I think society needs to realize. Yes, I was still made fun of and bullied by guys at school, but I also began making guy friends. The fact that a straight guy was willing to be seen in public with a known homosexual was mind-boggling at first, but soon began to feel normal.
 
Maybe it's because my closest girl friends had best guy friends that I began to know through my circle of people, but I soon began finding myself striking up conversation with those of the male persuation without hesitation or intimidation. Guys were willing to give me their numbers to keep in touch without assuming I wanted to convert them to my team. My roommates were not only willing, but excited to meet my first serious boyfriend. My brothers have consistently proven to always have my back.
 
So that begs the question: why do guys get such a bad rep? Of course there are statistics of rape, and our society will always be plagued with frat boys and uneducated male politicians whose feet spend more time in their mouth than their shoes, but I have so much hope for the future of men. Our generation is proving to become more and more open-minded and supportive of all minorities, the LGBT population included. I've volunteered for marriage equality with straight guys. I've been to the club with a group of friends and my boys are always willing to be my wingmen. So the next time you make an assumption that a guy is automatically a douche because of his genitalia, think instead of your brothers, and friends, and loved ones that have been by your side and stood up for you when you needed them most.
 
So I say thank you to straight men. Thank you for proving me wrong. Thank you for the support you've shown me and my friends. And thank you for giving me and best friends material to talk about for hours on end.""

Rally happening tomorrow (07/31) in solidarity with prisoner hunger strike.,92,21,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1jd47p/issue_facing_men_in_california_torture_of/,"50% of all prisoner suicides come from just 5-8% of the prison population: those in solitary confinement. The United Nations states that solitary confinement for over 15 days is torture, a human rights violation. Yet in California, we have over 12,000 prisoners in indefinite solitary confinement - the most of any state in the nation - and some of those prisoners have been in solitary confinement for decades, the longest for 42 years.

Solitary confinement is literally torture, and creates mental disorders in those subjected to it. Many of these prisoners haven't even committed a violent crime, as 75% of U.S. prisoners are incarcerated for non-violent offenses (related: end the war on drugs that causes that!). They're put into solitary confinement not for causing trouble in the prison, but as gang prevention. If prisoners so much as speak to anybody known to be in a gang, they're labeled as gang members themselves by guards and thrown in solitary confinement so that they don't 'conspire' with other prisoners. (And let's be honest - if you grow up in the ghetto, your going to know a few gang members. If a person gets thrown in jail for a non-violent crime and sees another person he grew up with (a gang member), then he's going to say hello to that person. Guards see that and they now considere that person a gang member too and throw him in solitary confinement.)

30,000 California prisoners started a hunger strike 23 days ago to bring awareness to this issue, and tomorrow all Californians are called to fast in solidarity with the prisoners. Some celebrities have signed onto the cause and will attend the rally in Los Angeles tomorrow, hopefully bringing further awareness to the torture happening in our own backyard.

Prisoners are being subjected to this torture for decades right here in California. The responsibility to stop this lays with all of us as a self-governing nation and state. Just 10 hours from where most Californians sit, men are being torture and made to go insane, and we have the power and responsibility to stop that.

Like bad science foundations. Or we're just having a friendly discussion. 

This being said, I notice a fair number of comments or blog posts with statements that I would perceive as being sexist. One comment I just read referred to a certain community as a 
&gt; gross, pale, sausage-fest.

Now, just to point out a few problems; we've equated maleness with ""gross"", white people with ""pale"" (a world that has definite negative connotations), and ""sausage-fest"" reducing males to their genitalia (pig association ignored for now).

I didn't reply because I wasn't a member of the forum that I found it on, (plus it takes a fair amount before I write an angry critique)  but I realize that in many instances within circles that promote equality and anti-hate there is a great deal of hate. Specifically, hate directed at not-historically hated groups. 

Now, personally I don't yet have a definitive stance on the wrongness of this, however many arguments that promote anti-hate ideas involve staples such as 

* it discourages people from being part of a community.

* hate-speech creates unhealthy self-perception.

* it's inherently wrong.

* it reinforces a cultural narrative that makes it acceptable to discriminate against someone.

* it represents a much larger, institutionalized system of discrimination towards a group.

Now discriminating speech towards a historically privileged group still fits the bill for all but the last two. With that in mind, I argue that hate-speech towards historically privileged groups is still wrong *because* of those last two reasons. 

Cultural narratives have to start somewhere, and normalizing hatred towards any group produces those narratives (that are later institutionalized) that are passed on and reinforced in the next generation. Context is important and the outrage that comes from being a historically and currently under-represented group is profound and not to be dismissed. But hatred to respond to hatred, from my perspective, doesn't make meaningful changes in society. It only creates more bickering and hatred.

I also want to make clear that this is not meant to be used as ammunition to silence criticism and meaningful insight. There is a huge distinction between hatred and criticism. 

**edit**: I should probably give more context as the statement could understandably be misunderstood without proper context. It was specifically in reference to the over-representation of white-males in atheist communities as a whole as role models.

I talked about this a little in [The Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/dvq0r/the_rules/), but it's become enough of an issue to need it's own topic. I'll be adjusting The Rules after this post to prevent redundancy.

Here's the deal: /r/Mensrights is full of *men*. I'd like OneY to be a place for *all* men to get together and talk about issues that pertain to men. I've already said that hate-speech will result in a permaban - It's right there after the welcome mat on the sidebar. If men from /r/Mensrights can come in here and engage in malice-free discussion, that's perfect. If somebody has a position you disagree with, you can talk about it with them. That's why OneY is here.

I said it in The Rules, and I'll say it here - I'll ban anybody who engages in hate-speech. If you start a topic that says ""Fuck feminists, them cunts,"" I'll ban you! If you start a topic that says ""I have a problem with feminism"" and then attempt to start an intellectual conversation, good on ya. I encourage you to do that if that's how you feel (though keep in mind that if you're going to talk about feminism, you will need to be focusing on how it pertains to men, else why post it here?).

Here's something else I said in The Rules though: ""this Reddit is **not** /r/Mensrights. If I see that it's starting to take a very political slant, I will take action to prevent that from being the case. This is a subreddit about *everything* in the male experience, not just the unfair or lame things. You're allowed to celebrate manhood here. You're allowed to say 'fuck society and the way they think I should act as a man.' You're allowed to express yourself, as a man, to other men."" 

[This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/dvswm/were_the_frog_mens_rights_is_the_scorpion_get/c13bsow) has the right idea. While I have said, and I do believe, that much of the content in /r/Mensrights is just distasteful, I think it *does* serve an important purpose. I don't subscribe to it. That doesn't mean some of the men in here may not find it useful.

I don't *need* to include them in our sidebar, because they have about 14 times more readers than we do. But we can get along, together as men.

The only type of reader I'd like this Subreddit to have is the open-minded and intelligent one. Everybody but the hateful are welcome.

**EDIT**: And if it becomes a problem, I'll do something about it. Have faith.

My entire quality of life has seen exponential improvement over the last few weeks. Do I love her? Let's not go there right now.

I've also had a pretty regrettable shallow history when it comes to women. I've said many things about my preferences for women that my girlfriend is aware of. Usually about size preference or nit-picky personality preferences, both of which are inaccurate for who my girlfriend is. Though I've probably grown up since I said those thing, it's probably not as much as I think.

Anyway, she's not my ""type"" at all. Don't get me wrong, I cannot now remember ever having met a more beautiful woman in my life. I enjoy all of her imperfections; but that's what I'm saying, **I never thought that those would be the imperfections that I would enjoy.**

So, gentlemen, I guess I'm just looking for some solace. I know that I was a shallow asshole for judging partners based on their physical characteristics or my unreasonable personality preferences. I just want to know if this is the case with other guys... I just feel guilty about the things I've said before I met this amazing and beautiful woman.

She was also pass out drunk, and we'd fooled around a couple times before then when we were smashed, and it all lead up to this one night when we were more drunk than ever and neither of us quite remembered what happened, we talked about it afterwards and there was no anger of any sort. A month later she starts a pretty serious relationship with a guy I was quite good friends with, me and him even joked around about me being her first (you know how it is as a teenager, stupid shit said doesn't seem quite so weird). The week they started this relationship she starts going a bit crazy and, oblivious to the seriousness of the word said it was rape. 

Being in quite a small circle it created a rift between me and my friends, some stuck with me thinking as a nice guy I couldn't do something like that, 6 months later she goes completely insane and starts saying everything she'd ever done in the past was 'rape', using the word as though it was justifiable to call absolutely anything from a peck on the cheek when she was 12 with one of my best friends to some genuinely questionable rumours about a 21 year old guy who according to some people didn't exist being forced, this girl was insane and everyone saw it, my mates were my mates again, all good.

Now I've got a lot more attractive since then, like a lot, I go to a bar and girls stare, I'm 6""2 and have modelled for a couple of photographers and often get people commenting on my looks, I have a friend whose place I've been round to a couple of times and his housemates (all female) don't leave me alone for a second, constantly giving me free beer and food. I've also had sex since then, but only when I've been super fucked at festivals and been dragged back to a tent, and, not that I mind being used it's not what I want.

I can't flirt anymore, despite being confident around the opposite sex I never ever show my cards to a girl, I also haven't felt any intense feelings for anyone since then. I have friends who are girls and most people I meet think I'm in a relationship already because of how I don't look for anything. I'm not asexual, I want sex, one night stand or not I just want to have a little bit of control over the situation, I want to approach a girl in a bar and be all cool but I just can't because I'm afraid of another situation like that. I've only recently joined the dots that this whole inability to talk to women stems from that one night.

tl;dr I was accused of rape by a sociopath and now, 2 years later, I can't bring myself to flirt or approach women

Has anyone else ever had a similar problem? How can I overcome it?

EDIT: I feel like I should add, I've been on dates with girls, sober, I've done a nude modelling shoot with a girl sober, she and I had feelings for eachother, she split up from her boyfriend at the time (without me fully knowing that she was in a relationship (yup, there's some more trust issues), however I did know that I was going to be modelling nude for her so I guess the implications were there, and for that I have apologised to the guy but he's even told me the relationship was on it's way out), but despite all the opportunities I've had I just feel like I can't trust a girl and whenever I get towards sealing the deal I can't bring myself to it.

I keep hearing from men and women alike that guys like it when women ignore them or act unpredictably to keep them on their toes. That seems silly to me, but if there is something about being overt in my interest that makes men uncomfortable, I'll knock it off until I'm actually dating someone.

I put this to you, OneY--would any or all of the following make you uncomfortable or disinterested in a woman?

* Baking cookies for you around the holidays
* Giving you a sincere compliment on your personality, e.g., ""You're a dedicated person and I think you deserve more leadership in your job.""
* Asking you out for a drink or to dinner
* Asking you to come over and see my new place
* Telling you good morning and asking how your weekend was when seeing you on a Monday
* Asking if you are seeing someone

Assume the woman here is of average attractiveness on an objective scale--you may or may not be attracted to her personally (and does that influence your reaction here?) but you know her at least casually--I don't approach strangers this way, or really at all, since personality is what gets my motor running and I never know what a stranger's personality is like.

Thanks in advance!

So, I have no idea how to handle initiate dating now that I'm out of college. I had a few LTRs when I was in high school and college, but now... Now I'm dead in the water. 

I'm asking OneY because all I get on /r/dating_advice is, ""Don't worry about finding someone, they'll find you."" Or, ""You'll scare off women if you're looking."" This advice comes almost exclusively from women. The sex that has people approaching them for dating. 

I went through a really shitty break up in March, lost my friends because of it too. What did I expect from year and a half relationship and a really good friend of three years. Silly me. 

My problem is two fold. 

I have no idea how to approach women, and I have no idea how to casually date.

I'm terrified of approaching women in public. Spend time on /r/askwomen and you'll see how much most women hate being approached in public. I can hold a conversation just fine. I just have no idea how to initiate without being blatantly obvious that the reason why I approached her is because I find her physically attractive and I hope she'll be attracted to someone like me. (Being short really limits your playing field. I have no issue with dating taller women, most just have an issue dating a short guy.) 

The other being casual dating. I don't know how to do it. Of the past 5 or so dates I've been on in the past few years (only one of which was after  my break up, I haven't been on a 2nd date save the one girl I started dating. All of the other women I just knew I didn't see anything long term. Am I supposed to keep seeing them even if I'm not that attracted to them either physically or personality-based? 

Perhaps I'm jaded because a lot of the female friends I have usually have two or three dates lined up each week, while I have jack shit. 

Everything else in my life is great. I have a decent job, a nice place, hobbies, I'm healthy, I have cool shit, and I have a nice car.

It took me a few relationships to (in a way) make me realize that women are just humans with vaginas. This may be a long shot, but I've always (pretty sexist-ly) viewed females as unempowered and vulnerable.  

Caveat: This isn't in any remotely conceivable way meant to be misogynistic, but merely cognizant of the way that lots of males are brought up. THIS IS NOT A THREAD FOR FEMALE-BASHING. I just want to know if any other males empathize with me in this regard.

EDIT:

I hate to do this, but I have to state that this conversation and this thread (hopefully not this entire subreddit) has been seized by mensrights misogyny.

I wanted to get a conversation going about males growing up in the overblown backlash to a legitimate threat, but it's turned into what I expressly called against in the thread description.

I view our difference in being birthed with different organs as a temporary setback in the pursuit of true egalitarianism, whereas some here see it as a battle line.

I'm male. I was born with and still posses a penis. I like to put the aforementioned penis into women.

In this subject I created I wanted to know if there were any other grown boys who could relate with me.

I am depressed to see that it had become a generic backlash against misandry.

Don't hate humans with vaginas for having vaginas just as humans should not hate humans for having penises.

I'm forced to say that if OneY becomes /r/mensrights/ over this seed of attempted brotherhood that (in as much power is afforded me) I have to delete this thread.

I started dating a girl, which I previously had been acquainted with for some time, a few weeks ago. At first, when I wasn't sure about her level of interest, my feelings for her were very intense and all I could think about was her and how to get to meet her soon again.

Soon it becomes apparent that interest is mutual, and right when things are going my way, something unexpected happens: **my sexual drive goes out the window**. Formerly at least averagely sexual, masturbating twice a day or so, I don't get the faintest erection in weeks. My overall emotions got numbed as well -- my mind is just blank, I don't get particularly excited about anything, I lose appetite and forget to eat, etc.

This is of course potentially devastating to my progress with said girl. She's an absolutely amazing person and there's nothing I want more than to continue seeing her, but I just can't bring myself to the sexual and emotional enthusiasm that the situation requires, and this is absolutely killing me. I feel like a robot devoid of feelings ruining my best opportunity for happiness so far in my life. My self-confidence is at 0 right now.

The most frightening thing is that this has happened once before, although with something that started out as a one night stand but could've developed into something more. Same sexual shut-down. This makes me terribly scared that this might happen every time I meet somebody new, effectively killing any possibility for me to be with someone.

Is there anyone here who can relate in any way? I would be so immensely thankful for any kind of response, I can't handle being alone with this.

It might be of relevance that I've never been in an amorous relationship before. This is as close as I've ever got.

the past couple months for me have been camping non-stop (in tents, intense, get it? anyway...). Last year I left university early so I could come back and start a new course, well a month before starting my dad died, he'd been in and out of hospital for 4 years, so if anything it seemed routine, well it wasn't and there isn't much to say other than he's gone.

Then my girlfriend of almost 2 years ended it with me the other night, never been through a breakup before, so I'm feeling incredibly lost.

I've just become stuck in a rut, I know things are wrong, I know I need to get my act together, but it's like any motivation I had has just been sucked from me. I've barely been to any lectures or classes, I see my room has become a mess but every time I look at it I *want* to clean it, but then I just don't care any more. I'm living in a tip, so much so that I have my door locked constantly because I'd be so embarrassed if any of my room mates saw the state of my room.

On top of that I will just be sitting there, doing nothing and then just start crying, even though I have nothing on my mind. It's like an empty cry, too. I don't feel like I'm crying over anything in particular, just at everything.

I haven't got much money and I won't ask my mum for more since it's hard enough for her now that she's alone, but I keep spending it even though I know at this rate it won't last me until the end of term.

I've been eating junk food almost exclusively and I just feel disgusting.

Another thing is that I had my first football game of the season on Sunday, but the coach didn't even put me on. I'm second-string running back but when the first string guy got injured he sent on the third string, then the fourth, even though I've been working my ass off and doing extra stuff for the team.

I guess I just wanted to ask for help. I'm feeling so damn low and to be honest I feel pretty pathetic even asking this. I think about ending it, but I know I'd never do it, but it scares me that it's on my mind so much. When I was younger I had depression, but nothing formal was ever done about it as my mum didn't want anyone to think our family was anything but perfect, even though my dad was an alcoholic and I was pretty much a retard.

I feel even more pathetic because my now ex said to me she wasn't going to lie to me about how she felt and string me along, but I said I would have rather she did, because now I have nothing and she was the one person I could talk honestly to in situations like this. I mean I wasn't even aware anything was wrong, she just started university, then bam, suddenly I'm not wanted anymore, even though SHE had previously always said it was forever, that she couldn't imagine life without me, she'd even cry when we had sex for crying out loud.

I'd be especially happy to hear from someone who's been through something similar, but any advice or tips would be brilliant.

I'm currently dating this really fantastic woman. She's intelligent, hot and friendly. Thing is, she gets hit on most of the time I'm more than 5 feet from her when we're out; sometimes even if I'm right next to her!

I know she's not going to flirt back, and shut them down the moment they make their intentions clear. We're so madly in love with each other that I'm not worried about it. But, she's a friendly person and enjoys talking to and meeting new people. Let me explain about the last time it happened:

* 
We were out at a pretty nice restaurant. The entire time, the waiter completely ignored me and only looked/spoke to her. He checked her out every time she got up from the table. It seemed like such an insult to ignore me like that.

* 
A few weeks before that, she was hit on during the few minutes she went to grab us a round of beers at a nice bar we went to for my birthday by these two guys that tagged along with an acquaintance that stopped by. They chatted with her while she waited for a bartender, and then repeatedly attempted to pay for her drinks. After she declined and bought our round herself, all three of them returned to our table and she and I continued to be very cozy together. I received nasty looks from the two guys until my acquaintance they came with finally left.

My question is: other than just sitting by and letting all this happen, is there anything else I could do? Would it be wrong of me to say something to the guys? 

I'm sure I'm going to get bashed for being ""jealous/paranoid/whatever"", but it's just insulting to be ignored or scowled by guys who get shot down by my girlfriend! Thanks in advance!

I just popped in here from the huge thread in TwoXChromosomes about ""Nice Guys"" which seems to be commented mainly from disgruntled men.  Somehow, I think it's weird when threads over there get dominated by men, so I thought I'd bring some of the discussion over here.

I actually looked up this old blog post because is contradicted my hypothesis.  I thought maybe there's this sense of desperation because attractive men are becoming less common in the population than attractive women.

But if you actually correlated every man and woman in the United States (or wherever you are) according to physical attraction, I think you'll find that it will be mostly the men grumbling about their partner.  A nice guy is someone, from no fault of his own, who was outclassed by a more attractive man.

Yeah, it sucks for ""nice guys"" everywhere, but it's stupid to make ""nice guy"" into some bizzaro psychological theory.  There is some truth to the ""don't be unattractive stuff"".

As someone whose majoring in Criminal Justice, I hear comments when the topic of women being raped that it's ""fucked up shit"", yet when the subject turns to prison rape, it's a massive joke... from derogatory comments regarding sexual preference to ""don't drop the soap"". Between 43,000-140,000+ are raped each year ffs, with men (especially homosexuals) as the largest targeted group...

Later into the night, a girl sits next to me in a quiet room where some of us were relaxing and smoking. We speak for a bit, she falls asleep on my shoulder.

About 10 minutes later, she wakes up, we talk some more and begin making out. The other occupants leave, things get a little heated so I suggest we go to my room. However, at that moment I realized how drunk she was, told her we need to stop. I get her number and take care of her the rest of the night, despite her making weak advancements at me (we did some mouth bumpin but nothing like before). I ended up taking her home (with a DD driving). 

The caveat, I'm, at 20 years old, a virgin. Definitely could've gone all the way that night. Did I do the right thing? I feel I did the most gentlemanly thing I could've done, but on a baser level I'm really pissed off at myself for not taking advantage of a situation that doesn't occur to me often.

also, if it makes any difference, she is 18.

TL;DR: drunk girl comes at me, take care of her instead, am I an idiot or did I do the right thing by not sleeping with her?

Edit: So, it seems like this came off as me thinking, at the time, ""I could rape her or not."" It wasn't like that, at all. I guess what Im asking is more along the lines of if I'm being too much a ""white knight"" and where the line is drawn in hook-up situations.

What I'm starting to realize now is a large part of *why* I had such low confidence in the first place.

Mind if I ramble on a bit?",71,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/euqyn/oney_my_mom_just_died_at_56_mind_if_i_ramble_on_a/,"Why am I posting about it here? I suppose it's because I think of reddit as a community, but I don't feel like blathering on the frontpage reddits. Somehow I'd rather talk to a bunch of sympatico guys than a general audience. Plus, some of what I'm feeling is related to masculinity one way or another, though I'm not sure how.

So my mom was diagnosed with colon cancer a couple years ago, and just this fall, after surgery and a year of chemo, she got a PET scan saying she was cancer-free. But then, during a fairly routine surgery involving taking out her chemo port, her liver started failing, and she spent almost a month in the ICU recovering from that and related complications. 

Around Thanksgiving, she finally left the ICU for a rehab center, and us kids (I have three sisters) all thought that maybe she'd be able to return to some kind of normal life. But her liver kept deteriorating, and within days she was back in the ICU. 

And then 10 days ago, they said she had days or weeks to live, and we all flew out to Phoenix the next morning to see her one last time. 

She was 56, and we're all in our 20s. Our dad is a religious nut who left the family several years ago to join a cult, so it was just the four of us and mom.

Given the circumstances, things went about as well as they could have. For the first couple days she was too drugged up to talk, but she knew we were there. On Christmas, we thought she was going to die, but instead she started being able to talk, and to my amazement she was her old self, totally lucid and cracking jokes, just in a really slow, feeble voice. One of the many funny things she said:

&gt;Mom: Do you remember the brown ..are in Patten?

&gt;Sis 1: What? The brown mare?

&gt;Mom: No, the brown ..are...

&gt;Sis 1: A mare? A female horse?

&gt;Mom: NO.

&gt;Mom: The brown bear in Patten, they kept it in a cage in the woods

(There's this caged bear near the Lumberman's Museum in Patten, ME where we lived once)

&gt;Us: Oh, yeah! Blah blah blah

&gt;Mom: PETA would have a field day with that.

&gt;Sis 1: Mom, that's a funny thing for you to be thinking about right now...

&gt;Mom: Well, I gotta think of something...

After a couple days of talking to her, we were able to transfer her to a really nice hospice house without her dying en route, and she was lucid for another day or two before she started to shut down. At least one of us were in her room pretty much 24/7 the whole time. She died on the morning of the 30th, with me and my little sister nearby.

I still can't totally believe it.

I guess one of the major things I'm feeling is sadness/powerlessness that she died before I was able to help her have a better life. Her life was awesome until dad left, and then suddenly she had to reenter the workforce and fend for herself, and that's really, really hard to do as an older woman who's been a housewife all her adult life. I wanted to be able to buy her a house, help her start a catering business, etc. one day. But instead, she died at 56, at a time when I've been too broke to even send her flowers in the hospital (not that they allow them in the ICU anyway) :( Not to mention the fact that the two of my sisters with stable jobs were fronting the money for all these expenses.

(I'm not trying to be FML here – I actually just got my check for an awesome temp job I did recently, and have several good job prospects for 2011, but that doesn't change the fact that I felt totally powerless this past week, and still somewhat even now)

Beyond that, I guess I'm still just in existential shock mode. Knowing I could die at any time, that anyone I know could die at any time, is making me really pensive about my direction(s) and priorities in life, and it's perhaps especially overwhelming due to not having a normal job to give my days an anchoring sense of routine. Yesterday I got back to Boston and had a huge house party for NYE, which was really nice, but now I'm just drinking the leftover beer and browsing reddit not knowing what to do with myself.

Last year, over $127 million was donated to LiveStrong and the Prostate Cancer Foundation. This was on an international level. 

The odds of getting breast cancer in women is the same as men getting prostate cancer. But, men are more likely to die because they are not as informed as they should be. 

My father died two years ago, very young, from prostate cancer. It was discovered in the 4th stage which is pretty common. It could have been caught and he could have been alive today had he known the risks and symptoms. So, lets do this to make sure every man knows his risks and the symptoms.

Thanks guys, and have fun!

EDIT: how foolish of me to not mention the risks and symptoms. I'm not doing my job properly. 

PROSTATE CANCER 

•Symptoms include Trouble urinating, Decreased force in the stream of urine, Blood in the urine, Blood in the semen, Swelling in the legs, Discomfort in the pelvic area, Bone pain. 

•Every man is at risk of developing prostate cancer. Based on the rates from 07-09, 1 in 6 men in America will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Age, and a family history of prostate cancer increases your risk. Also, blacks are more at risk in developing prostate cancer. 

More men die from prostate cancer than so women from breast cancer. 

•An Australian study has shown that men who masturbate 5 or more times a week are 34% less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Sex works the same, but before you go unprotected with your partner, make sure she's been tested for cytomegalovirus, which is a type of herpes that has been found in cancerous prostate tissue. 

Another study has shown that red wine also reduces your risk, now don't use that as an excuse to get drunk. A little is good enough. 

A little known study has shown that walnuts not only reduced the risk in developing prostate cancer but also assisted in treatment. 

TESTICULAR CANCER 

•Symptoms include A swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, Pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present, A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, A dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back.

•Some men may not know they have it until it spreads and those signs include Dull pain in the lower back and abdomen, Lack of energy, sweating for no apparent reason, fever, or a general feeling of illness (malaise), Shortness of breath, coughing, or chest pain, Headache, confusion, or dementia.

•it's wise to check yourself for lumps in the shower almost the same way a women would her breasts. 

•Testicular cancer is very rare, your odds of being a victim is 1 in 250 or 0.4% it is most commonly found in men between the ages of 20-39

•Some studies have shown that men who smoked marijuana regularly when younger are more at risk. 

•the cure rate is one of the highest at 90%, just make sure you see a doctor if you ever find a lump.

But when I asked him to explain how that wasn't the only logical conclusion he wasn't able to give me a response that made sense to me.

My own view is that violence should be used only when absolutely necessary and only when non-violent options have been exhausted.   And even then, only the minimal force necessary should be used to restrain the threat. Whether the aggressor is male or female is of no consequence to me.

I told him his beliefs are offensive and harmful and that most people wouldn't agree with him. He thinks most people think like him except scumbags and misguided and/or man-hating feminists. He went off on a tangent about how feminists destroyed gender roles and how much harm that has done to society. I tried pointing out that the gender roles that have been diminished since the 60s were not universal roles and that many societies have been much more egalitarian than 1950s American society. He didn't buy this because of the fact that men do most of the hunting and warring in every society.

I asked him if his fiancee agreed with him about all this and he said she did (""and that's why I'm marrying her"") and then I had to stop him from asking a random girl walking down the street (we were outside) whether she agreed with him. Since he thinks most people think like him and I disagree, I decided to make this submission to see what redditors think. I realize that this subreddit might not be a representative sample of the population, but I think it's reasonably representative.

I'm going to be sending the link to this discussion to him and encourage him to sign up for a reddit account (I don't think he has one) to respond to people here if he wants and to clarify any misconceptions I may have made in my argument.

I wanted to post it in r/relationships so there would be responses from both genders, because this absolutely isn't a gender thing. But r/relationships wouldn't let me because it's not a personal question, so I ended up posting it in r/TwoX. Pretty much 100% of respondents disagreed with Savage. But also pretty much 100% of respondents were women. Again, while I don't think this is a gender issue, I still would like to get all genders' responses. So hopefully you'll accept the cross post being posted here.

(Aside, I'm a woman, and I *think* I agree with Savage, but the idea still makes me very uncomfortable.)

------------

Dan Savage released a new book this month (American Savage) and in the second chapter he argues that sometimes it's okay to cheat. Those times are when your long-term committed partner no longer has a libido and is no longer interested in sex. He argues that our society teaches married couples that when this happens, the partner that *is* still interested in sex has to suddenly stop and give up sex, or else both couples have to give up their marriage and the life they built together and hurt the kids by divorcing and etc. And usually these couples are madly in love and want to stay together - they don't want to divorce - but one of the partners really needs to have sex and the other can't or won't offer sex. In that case, Savage suggests cheating.

He lays out some rules for this type of cheating: don't do it in your married home/bed, don't tell your spouse, don't tell ANYONE - not a soul - this is your secret to take to the grave, don't text or email the person, don't know the person socially, be honest with the person, don't continue contact with the person once you two stop having sex together, and absolutely without exception use condoms each and every time you have sex with this person.

He gave an example of a man married 20+ years and deeply in love with his wife but her libido suddenly died. They tried everything; exercise, going to a doctor, romantic dinners, trips, him doing more housework, taking care of the kids, etc - nothing worked, her libido had just simply died. So he had this secret affair using the rules above for four years, while maintaining a wonderful loving but sex-less marriage with his wife, and then suddenly after four years his wife's libido came back and so he stopped the affair. The alternative would have been him divorcing her and feeling like an ass and losing the wife that he loves and his family unit and etc... or him not getting sex and his resentment building up and perhaps the marriage being destroyed that way. Instead he got the sex he needed discreetly from a non-romantic or loving source, while maintaining his marriage, for the period of time in which his wife couldn't offer it. 

Savage lists times when it isn't okay to cheat though: when your partner does have sex with you it's not okay to cheat, when you're simply bored or drunk or want sex *right now* but your partner isn't present *right now* then it's not okay to cheat, if your partner just gave birth to your child and isn't ready for sex yet then it isn't okay to cheat. Really anytime other than your partner being not interested in sex anymore makes it not okay to cheat.

So what do you all think?

1335747230.0,64,self.OneY,syysn,I'm having trouble getting over my first one night stand.,86,22,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/syysn/im_having_trouble_getting_over_my_first_one_night/,"I'm not sure if this type of submission belongs here, there's quite a bit of exposition, but here it goes:

I'm a senior in high school, and I'm going off to college next year. I went on my school's exchange trip to France. Much fun was had, we spent the first week with our exchange students and the second week our group of roughly 20 students ( all girls except for 4 boys including myself) stayed in a hostel in Paris and went sightseeing.

Skipping forward to the last night of the trip. We're in the hostel in Paris, the boys are in one room, and the girls are spread out in three other rooms, the teachers are in a room down the hall. Almost all the students are in their rooms drinking heavily and celebrating the good times had on the trip (I really don't know how we got away with this, I think the teachers knew but figured we weren't getting into any real trouble, I digress, I'm a pretty bad storyteller.) 

Anyways, everyone's getting pretty wasted. The boys in my room, Jack, Tom, Phil, and Brohammad_Ali (the names have been changed on the off chance someone I know reads this, they'll figure out who's who anyway, but changing the names makes me feel better.) Anways, Jack doesn't drink so he's sleeping, Tom, Phil and I are drinking pretty heavily for high school boys and are sharing several bottles of cheap vodka and rum. One girl (Sarah, again name has been changed for my own satisfaction) keeps texting Phil asking if we want to come over to their room to hang out (for those wondering why we were using our cell phones in Europe despite massive roaming fees several of the students purchased international calling plans for the trip, Phil's mom is a worrywart so she got him one.) Phil texts Sarah back saying that we'll probably come over later in the night. About an hour passes, Phil and Tom get tired and fall asleep/pass out (It was about 1 am, we decided to try to stay up all night so we'd be able to sleep on the plane, dumb idea.) I'm the only one awake in the boys' room. 

Phil gets another text from Sarah, asking if we want to come over. I take Phil's phone and text Sarah saying that I'm the only one left who's awake. I asked if I could come over, she said yes. I went over to the Sarah's room. There were four other girls huddled in the room with Sarah. We all chatted for a while, when the girls told me to go back to my room and wake up Tom. Apparently Sarah wanted to make out with him. At this point I realized that I'd left my room key back in my room. I went back out in the hall and pounded on my room's door for several minutes to no avail. Tom wasn't waking up and I wasn't getting back into my room tonight. 

I went back to Sarah's room and informed the girls of the situation. They told me I could sleep in their room, and I began making a nest for myself out of all the clothes and bags they had lying around the room. At this point I drunkenly managed to put the moves on Sarah, putting my hat in the ring as the candidate to replace Tom as her companion for the evening. She let me get into bed with her. 

Almost as soon as the lights were out we began kissing and generally feeling each other up (I should mention at this point that this was the farthest I've ever gone with a girl, I've dated before but it was never really all that serious or intimate, the most I'd ever done up to this point was some minor kissing after a date.) This continued for what seemed like a couple hours (neither of us got much sleep that night because the bed was tiny and we couldn't really get comfortable enough to sleep so we were forced into close proximity with one another.)

I finally got a few hours of sleep and woke up the next day in her bed. I sneaked back into my room (Jack had already woken up so he let me in) changed clothes and went downstairs for breakfast. It was at that point that I realized that the previous night when the lights had gone out in the girls' room, the other girls hadn't gone to sleep, they'd been more or less watching us. By the time I got breakfast everyone on the trip (except the teachers) knew what had happened. I received copious high fives from the other guys (including Tom, Sarah's original planned paramour) and generally I felt pretty awesome about myself.

After breakfast I managed to get some time alone with Sarah and she made it clear to me that the previous night had just been a one time thing. 

That's where my trouble starts. I've become infatuated with Sarah. I barely know her, she and I have very different friend groups (lol highschool cliques are fucking stupid.) I'm a member of a sports team that's very famous in our school for being insular and she's a drama club person (I really don't know what you would call them.) Everyone in the whole school knows what happened because people were in the room with us (and its a small school in a fairly small town, word gets around fast.) One of them even sent a picture of Sarah and I sleeping together to my sister. When I got back everyone kept telling me that I was Mr. Cool because I'd hooked up with a hot girl but frankly I feel fucking terrible. I feel really empty and unhappy because everyone keeps telling me that I've made this big damn accomplishment of hooking up with a pretty girl, and meanwhile I know she really regrets the whole thing ever happening.

It's been about two weeks since I got back from France and this has been eating at me the whole time. I haven't told any of my friends my version of the story because I know none of them have been in this situation and I feel that would just make things worse. I apologize for any (many) grammatical errors, switching tenses, abusing parentheses, run on sentences and the rambling nature of this tale. 

I've wanted to get this off of my chest and I discovered this subreddit pretty recently so I figured I'd vent here and maybe get some good advice from you guys. None of my friends are redditors so I feel pretty safe posting all this here. 

tl;dr I hooked up with a hot classmate on a trip to France. I now realize I have feelings for her. She does not feel the same way about me. Everyone thinks I'm cool for hooking up with this girl. I feel like shit because it's pretty clear she regrets hooking up with me.

Even my tl;dr's are verbose.

1309276571.0,60,self.OneY,ibdy6,Question about masturbation and fantasizing,81,21,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/ibdy6/question_about_masturbation_and_fantasizing/,"So, I took a religion and sexuality class recently, and my professor was adamant about this: everyone should masturbate frequently, but they should not fantasize/utilize pornography while doing so.

Anyhoo, so the ethics of the last statement are not the real issue here. I just realized something about my masturbation habits through time and wanted to see if it resonated with anyone else.

When the prof first raised this issue, I was like 'wow, masturbating w/o fantasizing. That's crazy.' And my gf was like 'who fantasizes when they masturbate? I need to focus on my body!' This kind of stunned me. I was really kind of jealous of how she could be satisfied with just her body and find such joy in it without externalizing the experience.

I recently posted on r/christianity about the awesomeness of masturbation and how its a very Christian thing to do. (Anyways, not here to argue this last point either) In response to this post, all of the guys responded by saying that you couldn't masturbate w/o fantasizing and the only person who commended me for my position was a woman.

Now, when I was having 'alone time with my penis' last night, I suddenly realized something. My earliest memories of masturbating had no concept of fantasizing. No one had told me about masturbation and I just stumbled upon it as young boys are want to do. So the whole experience was this amazing discovery of my own body--and then the holyshitwhatiscomingoutofmypenisbutitfeelsoooooogooooood. It wasn't until I was exposed to pornography through friends (an addiction I am very happy to say I have managed to kick after several years) and I started getting the message that masturbation is just a place holder for sex that I started fantasizing--thus detracting from a very personal ritual by externalizing it and making my sexuality less about my body and more about what I would be doing to someone else's body.

(tldr, i guess?)
SO: Finally, do you guys fantasize when you masturbate, do you see merit in NOT fantasizing (as I do), have you noticed this trend in how little boys are taught sexuality that externalizes their sexual experiences, and do you remember this kind of switch happening in your own experience.

Also, stories about your early memories of masturbation are welcome.",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,False,,,True,t3_ibdy6,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/ibdy6/question_about_masturbation_and_fantasizing/,

Mind you its dark, she throws me a towel and as i clean my self there is a decent amount of blood..... not murder scene, but more then a couple drops (which happens when pregnant) and way more then i'm comfortable with. She has this deer in head lights look on her face as she is putting on her clothes saying ""i'm sorry, i'm going to go."" So i was left alone, disappointed, bloody, and blue balled. I've had better nights, but i'll be honest minus the horror scene, i'm probably going to see if she wants to try again.

I feel like posting on Reddit would help me. I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this but here goes

When I was 11 I was sexually assaulted by my sister's friend at a sleepover.

Between the ages of 13- 17 I was molested by a neighbor many times. At the time I didn't think it was as bad as it was. She was mostly sweet to me but I felt threatened and intimidated by her so I never told anyone. 

If I was a few years older there would be nothing wrong. She was sweet, loving and understanding. She's someone I'd known my whole life and loved. I still do love her. The problem is she fostered a fear and anxiety for women that has troubled me ever since.

I was kept sheltered so other than my sisters I never really got to know any girls and when I went away to college I didn't know how to interact with them. I would get physically hot, nauseous and very uncomfortable if I had to interact with them closely. I had a lot of issues with women. They made me nervous, scared and I would stutter or just blank out talking to them. It wasn't typical nervousness, I'd feel terrible about it and my ego was shot.

I didn't know it then, but I was pretty attractive and would have no problem meeting women otherwise. In fact many of them came up to me and tried to pick me up but I always found an exit without looking too rude. I'm sure most of them thought I was gay because of it.

One woman, the TA for one of my classes, kept trying and eventually I had my first date when I was twenty years old. We dated for several years and, naive as I was (am still, really) I thought I was in love with her. 
She was abusive and manipulative. I didn't notice it until it was over because that's all I've ever known when I was close to a woman but it wasn't healthy and fed into my fear and anxiety. She was physically, emotionally and sexually abusive. I was an emotional wreck but we grew closer. When I finally had a breakdown and ended it I needed therapy. 

I still have a long way to go but I'm trying. I'm constantly frustrated by how this hampers my life. I even have trouble working closely with women and I get a panic attack when one brushes me in public. It really worries me and I have fears for my future because of it. I want to meet someone and I want to fall in love but I really don't see that happening in a healthy way. I still have nightmares about women and sexually I'm a mess. I've only had a couple times I have been sexual as an adult that were were completely healthy. I'm ashamed of this and would never admit it. I don't know what to do.

1308348711.0,58,self.OneY,i2i06,"crosspost from r/equality... I just did a little research into government funding toward men and toward women, and the numbers are pretty interesting (although not that surprising)",64,6,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/i2i06/crosspost_from_requality_i_just_did_a_little/,"I volunteer for a men's resource centre, and one of the things they asked me to do was figure out how much money the province was dedicating to men's resources as opposed to women's resources (I'm in Canada, btw). Looking into it, the numbers are pretty interesting...

In 2009/2010 it was $1,516,460 toward men and $57,562,373 toward women. In 2010/2011 it was $3,740,800 toward men and $48,331,443 toward women.

In 2008/2009 the province dedicated $561,360 toward men's resources and $98,983,236 toward women's resources. The inflated numbers for women's funding for this year are due to more gender-specific funding toward ending domestic violence. Both 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 had funding toward ending domestic violence that was close to on par with the previous year, but the news releases were quite vague and it was impossible to determine to whom that funding actually went. The numbers for the latter two fiscal years are lower for women's resources because of this. Also, in the latter two fiscal years the province started a Provincial Homelessness Initiative. Under this, more funding has gone toward shelters that house both men and women and more funding has been handed out in the form of low-interest mortgages rather than grants.

It's interesting to note that the funding has increased quite substantially year by year for men, and I think this is a good sign. Unfortunately, the numbers are still incredibly lopsided, and men (in my province, at least) seem to be getting the short end of the stick.

Most of the funding for women went to shelters, transition houses, and housing for low-income women and single mothers. For men, the majority of the funding was dedicated toward addiction and recovery centres.
I know as a receptionist at the resource centre I see a great deal of helplessness and desperation. Sometimes there is anger and resentment. I volunteer for the men's resource centre because I was in a horribly abusive relationship for years. My ex husband was raised in a family where this sort of behaviour was typical - commended, even. His upbringing did him a disservice, and I want people like him to have resources available to them (such as counselling) that might help them change their attitudes toward women. I also volunteer because my current partner was in an abusive relationship for many years and he had no resources and no one to talk to about it. He had no viable escape plan. People don't seem to take it seriously when women abuse men, and that's not fair.

I'm not sure what the solution is. Certainly men need more resources available to them. More programs for fathers, more transition houses for men fleeing abusive relationships, and more access to affordable counselling services. That said, the shelters and transition houses and so on that are currently available to women need to continue to have access to funding so that they can remain operational.

I am a 24 year old female who is just getting back into the dating scene after being in a 3 ½ year relationship. I have a few questions about my baggage and when it's appropriate to bring it all out...


questions:
1. Would you even consider dating someone with any of these quirks? 
2. If you were to date someone with any of these “quirks”,  at what point would you want them to inform you about the issues (before you start talking– assuming you met on an online dating site,  after you start talking but before you meet up, after you meet up a couple of times if you seem to hit it off, or after you have been dating for a good while and have an intimate connection)?


My biggest worry is that someone will meet me and when they learn these *fun* facts they will feel like they got more than they bargained for. I wish I could just let people know from the start, but at the same time I don’t want to scare them away, especially since *these “quirks” rarely cause problems in my daily life anymore*. They are still issues I deal with though, I've just gotten awesome at coping.

Now for the list of quirks:
1.	I have a history of **depression** and **Bipolar Disorder**
2.	I take **anti-depressants** and mild **mood stabilizers**
3.	I **cut** for 7 years (I have not self-harmed in over 4 years and have no more visible scars)
4.	I have **dyslexia** (my IQ is 142, so for those of you who don’t really know what dyslexia is, be assured, I’m not an idiot)
5.	I have **ADD** (and I take **Ritalin** for it)
6.	I have ridiculously **low self esteem**, but I hide it pretty well

Other than all of that, I feel like I’m quite the catch and a pretty awesome girlfriend; I am drama-free, I don't lie, I'm upfront about my feelings, I'm always willing to compromise, I put out on a regular basis, I don't get jealous, I don't care if you hang out with ex girlfriends as long as you haven't done anything to loose my trust, and I want nag you to stop playing video games. I just don’t want someone to feel like I railroaded them with a bunch of issues they weren’t prepared for, I want to be fair to anyone I date.

He's a virgin, and has only received a single blowjob from his exgf. Apparently, she told him he was ""larger than average""...I'm not sure why, other than she liked to mess with his mind. She was also a virgin, so maybe it was the first penis she'd sceen?

I normally don't care at all about penis size except his is so small I at first worried he has a medical condition. Flaccid, it resembles the micropenis on wikipedia, basically it doesn't exist at all or is just the tiny head. To make things worse, he has the largest testicles I've ever seen on a guy, I'm afraid it's some sort of androgen issue. Erect, it's too small for me to wrap my hand around, and I have really small hands. I'm going to guess three and a half or four inches?

He also has a really low libido, so this hasn't come up much yet. But I'm not sure what to do. Obviously, he's going to have to be up for doing other things so that sex is satisfying for me or be open to me using toys or whatever, instead of thinking he has a large dick. The only time he mentioned the size was to say it's not as big as Ron Jeremy's but most guys aren't that size either :(

First, should I have him have his hormones tested? Would it help at all at this point?

And second, how do I tell him he has an extremely small penis without killing his self-esteem? Especially if we break up, he should know this is something that he'll have to work around in a future relationship.

He's not overweight, and says in locker rooms he's just thought he was a grow-er not a show-er.

Sorry for the wall of text. tl;dr: my guy has a tiny wang, wat do?

edit: the small penis combined with what seem like really large, swollen testicles concern me the most. is that a potential medical problem? I ve seen a few penises and stuff in my day but nothing like this.

**edit 2: I'm feeling better about telling him and i think it's my only choice at this point. he deserves to know. does anyone have any idea if it maybe a hormonal problem?** I've done a little bit of looking and looked through the ""penis gallery"" someone linked to and I don't see anything like the extremly small penis and very large testicles there.

We met ONLINE. We started ""online dating"" and during that entire time, for an entire year, I didn't care about porn. It was his business. Then we met in person and it became a long distance thing. I would visit him once a month - he would never visit me. Out of my pocket, I paid $300 a month just to be with him. During this time, once again, he looked at porn. That was fine. Then I uprooted my life a year later, and moved out to his city. Now I asked him to stop looking at porn. He now lives in my house with me, he has no job, he does not go to school. I am around 24/7 to keep him satisfied, and while our relationship is not perfect, we are happy. Do you think its reasonable to ask of him this one thing? Probably not. You guys are so far up your own asses you can't even begin to look at another side of the story. And really? I don't care, there's not much I could say to make you hate me more than you all already do. Apparently ASKING (not making) my boyfriend to not look at porn is the worst thing one human being could do to another. I do not hover around him all day asking DID YOU LOOK AT PORN? ARE YOU LOOKING AT PORN? I just trust him because he told me he doesn't. In a relationship, everyone sacrifices something. Ours may not be perfect but we're happy.

Fapping is great, and I guess I should be happy that it's so easy...but at the same time I have to admit a degree of jealousy at the number of female sex toys out there and the fact that the idea of a woman owning a vibrator isn't considered to be weird. There seem to be far fewer male sex toys available, and very little discussion about them in general, both for solo and couples play.

I did find a cyberskin ""male sex sleeve"" (not a Fleshlight, but a similar idea) at an adult toy shop in town, but I felt like a deviant when I bought it -- and overall I wasn't terribly happy with it. As far as I know, I am completely average in size, but this thing was too short (my head stuck out the other side) and too tight (I mean like, I had a hard time getting inside even with plenty of lube and I felt like my circulation was getting cut off).  After a couple of uses, it even started to tear.

So far it's been a solo experiment for me, mostly because one end of the sleeve is molded to look like a vagina, which adds absolutely nothing to the experience for me and makes the whole thing look so ridiculous and pervy that I don't want to show my wife.

The whole product sort of seems like someone's idea of what a male sex toy ""should"" look like, rather than being designed from function. It's like how so many ""naive"" female dildos and vibrators look like cocks, but how some of the ones women swear by as being most effective look more like something out of [science fiction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK4nNwMq024) (NSFW-ish).

That being said, it was still an interesting change from standard fapping so I'm interested in exploring more options. I'm specifically interested in penile stimulators at this time, though some people may be interested in hearing about prostate stimulation too so comments about that are certainly welcome.

In particular, I'm wondering if there are any good male analogues to a vibrator -- something that stimulates beyond any manual motion.

---------------------

EDIT: Wow! Thanks for all the great and informative replies. I would highly recommend that other interested people check out the male section on [BabeLand.com](http://www.babeland.com/mens-toys), as I discovered many intriguing products there. I've decided to order the [Cobra Libre](http://store.babeland.com/men-jack-off/cobra-libre), since that's exactly the sort of product I was curious about. I've also ordered a Tenga Flip Air, which was very highly reviewed.  My actual purchase was through PinkCherry.ca, which I found after googling for a Canadian company selling the same products. The prices were better and they promise delivery with 1-3 days.

I will endeavour to return with reviews.

---------------------

EDIT 2: 4 hours after ordering, I've received confirmation of shipping by Canada Post, which probably makes PinkCherry.ca the best online store I've ever interacted with.  If I could get them to run NewEgg.ca, then my life would be perfect.

1368522450.0,53,self.OneY,1eazg7,Am I really just a sex-craving primitive male?,66,13,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1eazg7/am_i_really_just_a_sexcraving_primitive_male/,"Good morning everyone,

to explain my personal situation: I'm 17 years old and kind of a late bloomer, started masturbating at 14 and generally have been about one year behind in development compared to kids of my age. The thing is, I was never really interested in girls and I thought this was just something that I would discover with time but I couldn't relate to all the drama and effort some of my peers put into pursuing them. 

About a year ago I noticed that masturbation for me was more of a habit than something I enjoyed, it mostly helped me to get sleepy in the evening. But since it wasn't fun for me I decided I would quit for a while just to see if this would change my way of seeing the world (I do not believe in the secret superpowers /r/NoFap seems to propagate rigorously but abstaining from masturbation for a while is said to increase your sex drive).

Over the following two months I noticed a lot of changes in my mindset, especially regarding girls. In contrast to beeing an unemotional and unsympathetic person beforehand, I now suddenly experienced life in a way more intense way. I would get sad and I really felt sad and not just empty and on the opposite side of the spectrum I had a ton of fun over the time. I realized that I cared way more about people in general (not just girls) but of course my sex drive started to go crazy. In addition to the intense desire for sex I also had a profound desire for intimacy and emotional proximity with a girl (I started to cuddle my blanket and for the first time understood the fascination of kissing).

After two months I started questioning if the changes I had gone through were some kind of natural progression/maturing or if all of this was caused by stopped masturbation and just a way of my body trying to get me to ""get some"". Well, there was an easy way to find out: I picked up masturbation and shortly after, the whole process was reversed. I was completely back to zero, no desire for women whatsoever, I didn't give much of a shit about people anymore, I found the thought of craving intimacy ridiculous. I also was less motivated to do something at all (during the two prior months, I was pretty energetic).

This discovery kind of shocked me since my character seems to depend largely on how strong my cravings for sex are at the moment. I prefer the more emotional, more alive side of myself, the one who cares about his surroundings and generally is kinder and more compassionate. I haven't masturbated for 4 months to get back to that state but now I'm facing a different problem: I often catch myself daydreaming about sex/love/imtimacy, to the extent that I have troubles falling asleep at night because I'm constantly aroused. My sleep has become worse, I often wake up during the night and can't get back to sleep because of said arousal. Luckily, physical activity works wonders in that department. 

In the last time, I had this nagging thought that wouldn't stop bothering me: 
* What if my compassionate and kind character lasts only to the next ejaculation, after which I feel nothing?
* Am I unable to love someone when my sexdrive is low at the moment? (For the record, I have never been in love with someone else and I understand that love differs in the short and long term (sounds like a progression from lust to love, but as I said, I can't relate to that).)
* Is sex really the only thing that drives my behaviour?

(By the way, I know there is something in between of not masturbating at all and going at it on a daily basis, but I don't know what I want to do next.)

I would really appreciate your advice on the topic, maybe someone has gone through something similar.

If that works out really well we end up having ""the talk"" and things progress evenly from there. By ""hook up"" in this case I'm referring to good ol' P in the V sex. 

Now, though, I'm in a situation in which I met a girl at school, invited her to a party, and then asked her on a date. A date! Well, we had a first date and it went great. We kissed and cuddled and talked. Then I saw her at school a couple of days later and things were a mite awkward but not terribly. We were supposed to have another date yesterday but she cancelled claiming schoolwork difficulties (which I believe).

I myself am turned on by feet, legs, a nice firm abdomen, and a fetish that I don't feel like getting into here.
To say every man likes the same thing is to ignore all sexual diversity. It's just that I see this prevailing opinion that all men like boobs/ass to ostrasize every man who does not like these things, and even worse to make women (through their own naivety or otherwise) believe that they have to live up to this standard. This is much the same for men that feel they have to be muscular and athletic to produce ladyboners. I'm not sure if women fling insults among themselves as much as men for not having the same sexual interests, but I'm sure it's a problem for them as well. It's fucking ridiculous to me.
In the media, there is some leeway to other interests such as BDSM. On the other hand, most other fetishes or preferences are laughed at and people who have them are ""freaks."" This kind of thing really gets to me, and I think this may be another form of prejudice that doesn't get much attention.

This might be a long post, tl;dr at the bottom.*


I'm a single, 22 year old guy. I live by my self and I have problems.

I've been single for a little bit more than a year, and I've moved on. Since the break-up I've started caring about how I look. I dress better and I work out. I've been looking forward to the summer because I've decided that this will be the best summer ever, but. Now I'm starting to feel down again, I'm not sad or depressed, but I'm not as pumped up and superpositive I was a few months ago.  

I don't feel lonely or feel like a need to chase girls, but I dream about meeting girls and generally flirting every night and when I wake up, I wish it was real, but that feeling quickly fades.

I also have a really hard time motivating myself, this applies to pretty much everything. School, doing the dishes, watching an entire movie in one sitting. I really want to be able to do whatever I set my mind to, but it seems that I'm not able to push beyond my inherit laziness.

My last issue is that I have no genuine intrests or hobbies, which leads to me doing nothing but sitting at home, browsing reddit. I want to try new things, but my friends either don't want to give new stuff a shot, or they do things without me because they think I wouldn't be interrested. Yes, sometimes I've tried something and decided that that wasn't for me and I can understand that they assume I wouldn't be interrested. But I don't know what I can do to find something interresting to do without them. I live in a small town (especially by american standards) with about 30 000 inhabitants.

The dynamics between father and son are complicated, and I'd like the advice of some other men.

**The Background**

My father and mother have been divorced for 12 years  because my dad cheated on my mom. He is remarried now, to the woman he was having the affair with, my stepmom. He lives with my her and my two awesome, adorable half-sisters, who are in elementary school. 

I have known for quite some time that he has continued to cheat, and dates / sleeps with women other than my step-mom. I don't consider it my business to correct or get involved with his behavior, and my dad doesn't make a lot of effort to hide it.

From his offhand comments, browser history, and interactions I've had with his mistresses (we've met many of them for lunch or shopping without my dad telling me beforehand), I know he's not being very smart or discreet about it.

**The Problem**

My dad is a public figure, and has made his career in politics.  He's not very internet-savvy despite using online dating sites, and many of his partners/mistresses have reported him on ReportAffairs.com. He has a pretty unique name and some innocent googling shows some of these reports pretty high up in the search ranks. The public nature of his career means that these reports could be very damaging if someone decided to bring them to light.

**The Question**

From son to father, how do I go about telling him I care about his reputation and let him know these things are being posted? 

How do we go on with our dance, pretending I don't know about this behavior after I bring it to light?

I did date a guy once who was circumcised at 20 years old because he kept getting infections -- even though, yes, he showered just as much and just as well as everyone else -- and while the recovery period was traumatic he said that he definitely like having a circumcised penis better than an uncircumcised one.


Almost everything else that people can do to a baby sounds terrifying and wrong to me -- for example, I strongly believe that intersex people should be left alone and allowed to choose what they want to be when they're older -- or choose to keep the bodies that they were born with. I even think piercing your baby's ears is a little weird. But circumcision -- I just can't seem to think of it as genital mutilation

I hope this doesn't come across as disrespectful. I guess I'm just trying to get some opinions from guys! My mind is open to changing. So... shoot!

**EDIT:** Good suggestion for an additional interesting question from **badaboom** -- Would you get your son circumcised?

**Edit 2:** Thank you everyone for your input. It sounds like most uncut people are happy with it, and opposed to the idea of circumcision. By contrast most cut people are just kind of fine with it, and don't really care. Then there are a few who had complications from being circumcision/not being circumcised. I wish commentstatistics was around...

A couple of you said you would leave it up to your wife. I think at the end of the day if I'm ever presented with this choice I'm going to leave it up to my husband, since he is the one with the most penis experience


**Edit 3:** Redditor **jugglingbuffoon** says that he is finding in the comments that the # of circumcised people who regret it are about equal to the # of circumcised people who are okay with it/don't really care. They may very well be true and I apologize if I came across as sounding dishonest about the number and nature of the replies here. I didn't actually go through and count them, or count upvotes, so thanks for doing that. For what it's worth, that statement just came from me looking at the comments and noticing that ""I was cut at birth and I don't feel like my life was changed in any way by it"" (bigbadbyte) is at the very top. A close second is ""The costs certainly seem to outweigh the benefits. All told, I'd rather not have had it done, and will not do it to any kids I end up having."" (SuperMariofuckfest)

3rd top comment (paraphrase): I'm uncut and it's better (more sensitive)/more natural than being cut

4th top comment (paraphrase): I'm cut and I don't care


and so on.

The poster and I hit it off immediately, and spent the next 3 months exchanging a few emails a week writing collaborative erotic stories. We shared no personal information and both used throwaway email addresses (I used my real first name but she didn't), so we had no clue who the other was. At the end of the last story we both hinted at having interest in knowing more about the other. So I reached out and said that I was enjoying our play, I was interested in learning more about her and sharing myself with her, but that I was also content to leave things as they were. She wrote back, said she too was interested, and gave me her first name.

I knew someone by that name, but figured it was coincidence and joked that unless she was the ex-wife of my good friend we were all good. She replied that it was indeed her.

After we got over our shock and embarrassment, we decided to keep talking and meet in person to see if the sparks from our virtual interaction would die out or not. When we did meet several days later, it was electric. We have connected in a way that neither of us ever could have imagined. We want to try to be together, and so I told my good friend, her ex-husband, the story.

His response: ""I want everybody to be happy, but don't expect me to go on any double dates.""

He is one of my best friends, they have been divorced for about 6 years, and he is happily remarried. He is not a jealous person and they actually had an open marriage where they were allowed to sleep with other people. I know the divorce was hard on him, and he's not thrilled that I connected with his ex-wife, but I believe I can trust him when he says it's ok. However I do worry that it will affect our friendship.

It is also important to note that she and I had no interest in each other in that way prior to connecting anonymously, and I would have never intentionally sought her out or tried to date her.

She and I both feel we have handled this whole situation in the most open, mature way possible. We both feel conflicted and worry about hurting my friend. But we can't deny the intensity of the connection that has developed and feel that we would really regret not giving this a try.

My questions: Am I bad friend for dating my good friend's ex-wife, in spite of him telling me it's ok? Are things mitigated at all by unusual way that she and I connected?


TL;DR: I connected anonymously with a woman, exchanging emails with no personal info for several months, then found out she's my good friend's ex-wife.

I'm currently at college (just about to start my second year), this guy in my halls last year spent most of the year flirting with me (pinching my ass, trying to grab my junk, making sexual remarks, as well as deliberately creating sexual tension), which I told him to stop (atmiddedly not forcefully enough) which he did not do. At first, I was flattered by the attention (I'm a shy guy who's never been in a relationship) and I've never really been hit on by anyone before so it made a nice change. I would class myself as slightly bi-curious (like 1.5 on the kinsey scale) and I did kind of like him because he was an older guy so I looked up to him. But I just didn't want to have a relationship with him. Around Christmas time last year, he came right out and told me he was bi and that he was in love with me, me and my roommates had been out drinking that night so at first I couldn't tell if he was being serious or not. I still kind of liked him at this point but I still felt very uncomfortable so I kept asking if he was being serious or not, he then said he would stop because he was making me feel uncomfortable.

From this point on however, the flirting still continued. I signed up for OkCupid later in the year and on there met a girl, nothing happened but I messaged her on Facebook a lot, he kept asking to see my messages to tell me 'if she liked me or not'. I didn't show him, but again this made me feel uncomfortable. 

Next week I'm moving into the house share, I'm dreading it because I'm going to be sharing with him as well (he requested the room next to mine just so he would be near me and has just posted on Facebook that he is missing me). I really resent him now, for how he has behaved and I really don't know what to do, OneY can you imagine yourself in my situation and tell me what you would do in this complicated situation?

Also, this guy is a redditor, that's why I'm using a throwaway. 

TL;DR college student has a bi guy hit on him for a whole year despite the fact I asked him to stop, he also told me that he is in love with me. This is making me feel angry and uncomfortable. Wat do?

I want to know about your worst relationships.  I figure maybe it'll help me get over my situation if I can commiserate with someone.

So here's my story:
I've been single for many, many years.  Finally meet a girl I get along with.  She moves in.  The fights start.  We argue about housework, money, the usual.  Problems that normal people might be able to work out, but she gets all passive aggressive about things.  Like if I don't have the house just the way she likes it when she gets home from the bar, she throws a fit, storms into our bedroom, and locks me out.

She always has her phone locked.  I never gave it much thought.  I just figured she locked it so people didn't mess with it at work, etc.  Anyhow, I don't know why, but I started to get suspicious after a while.  I pay attention to her password, and she forgets her phone at home one day.  I do some snooping and I find out that she's cheating on me with not one, not two, but THREE of my fucking ""friends.""  And if that's not bad enough, she's been hooking up with one of her ex's, too.  And of course, this is what I know of, based on the combination of text messages/dick pics on her phone at that moment in time.  She gets home, I get pissed, obviously this ends up being a relationship ender.  Of course, she blames ME because I snooped through her phone.  It's a violation of privacy, I get it, but sorrry dear, that was NOT the biggest problem in our relationship.  Your incessant cheating is what destroyed it.

My (M 20) situation is relatively simple: I met a girl this past month and I really like her. The problem is that she has already gone out on a few (2-3) dates with another dude at this point. They aren't ""official"", but they're pretty close I'd have to imagine. 

My whole life, I've given up on situations like this and just let the girl go on with someone else, but this is different. I'm torn - on one hand, I want to get advice as to how to tactfully try to date her, but on the other hand, who am I to break up this other budding relationship that they may have together?

If it matters, we've really hit it off the past few times we've been together (group social setting, nothing personal 1 on 1), and I can pick up that she's at least a bit interested.

Can we please have a little discussion about the mistakes that were made? Without saying anything too hateful? What's your take on the situation?

My understanding:

1. 2 men having a mildly lewd conversation at PyCon; Richards overhears it
2. As someone who's heard a lot of sexist shit at technical conferences, she feels the need to report what she heard, and tweets the conference organizers. In what was probably a mistake, she includes a picture of the guys who were talking.
3. Conference staff talks to each of them; the situation appears to have been resolved amicably.
4. One of the guys in the picture gets fired from his job, ostensibly for appearing in the photo. Nothing else happened to the other guy, but I'm not sure whether they're from the same company.
5. Richards starts receiving death threats and rape threats, and Richards' company SendGrid was hit with a DDOS attack. (This was when I found out about it, because I use SendGrid.)
6. I was getting my news from Twitter during the SendGrid outage, and it was full of misogynistic bullshit.
7. SendGrid publicly posted that they fired Richards, about the same time as all their services came back up.

I want to mention that all the comments posted within the first hour or so were pretty civil, which implies good things about regular OneY subscribers.

Okay, here is my little life story. So both my parents were in the military while I was growing up, but my dad was a bit of a mess the whole time. Alcoholic, got clean when I was six, got addicted to pain pills and anti-depressants when I was 15. 

But he didn't really want to have to do anything with the whole raising a kid thing. He was very easily irritated, and would make sure that I would never do anything that annoyed him in anyway. So if I was being a kid, like any normal kid, doing weird or annoying things that kids do and parents put up with, like reminding him that he shouldn't step on cracks because he'd break Mom's back, or asking random strangers questions in the super market, and he'd flip out. Anytime I would do something he would rather I was not doing he would put his face close up to mine, clenched teeth, grab the collar of my shirt and just start doing the whole do-your-best-to-scare-the-shit-out-of-the-person-you-are-talking-to, full on intimidation thing. And I was a child, like 5 years old. That shit is traumatizing.

There's more! Suicidal depression and general all around craziness led this person to sit me down for a whole childhood of man to mans about how the world sucks, the government is ultimately corrupt, we have no ability to change our lives, and a whole host explanations as to why and how he was going to kill himself. This went on until I was 17, and then his brother came from across the country to intervene on his life and took him away from us. 

He has been in the course of his lifetime a professional driver, professional musician, a hockey coach for the base's men's hockey team, and his bilingualism has been an asset to him in a variety of jobs over his life time. He never taught me to drive (I'm 27, still don't do it), never taught me to play, never taught me to speak french, and never encouraged me to join sports. He didn't really interact with me in any sort of a mentoring capacity, except to curb any behaviour that he found to be annoying (through means of over the top intimidation). And there wasn't really any other adult males in my life, seeing as how we moved away from family all the time and my schools were all full of female teachers. This has left me a mostly broken, meek sort of weirdo, well liked by his friends, but terrible with the ladies and generally thought of by others as an eccentric. 

And now I'm working with special needs kids, some who are very high functioning and require a positive male role model. I want to be involved in early age behaviour intervention, and this job would be great experience. And these kids really do need the help, there are practically no males in the field and they are dying for male interaction. But the more I'm at this job the more I'm not sure I'm cut out for it, and the more I'm realizing how just how fucked up my early life experiences left me.

I'm really just writing all of this to get it off my chest; I'm obsessing and can't fall asleep. But do any of you have any advice? Anyone go through something similar? Any, I dunno.

That musclebound bro who thinks he is better than everyone else because of how much he can benchpress. That sleazebag who sleeps with all the womens by lying and charming his way into their pants. Or, the powerhouse of industry who is a leader among men and is either already married and very private about his love-life, or unmarried and probably just as bad with women as I am already.

Can anyone here illustrate or point to, in popular culture, any good male role-models who are also sex-positive? Honest, open, self-confident men. Calm, collected, satisfied with their lives and don't have to prove themselves. Successful with women, and maybe open enough about that part of their lives that there's something on-lookers can learn about their ways. 

I mean, does this inquiry even make any sense? xD

In store happened to also have a single barber station and sold ""spa like"" straight razor shaving services.  I decided to indulge some and 1 hour later (yes it really was nearly an hour) I had a nice shave, face massage, mask (?) and an appreciation for a straight razor shave.

So I was walking around the store asking about this and that just trying to get more info about old fashion shaving.  Here's some of the stuff that I was told.  Sorry to any shaving enthusiasts, I'm new to all of this so please bare with me and please let me know if any of this is wrong...

* 1) The brush that you use to apply cream is badger fur.  They are used because badger fur is inherently anti-bacterial.  There is also variable densities and types of fur from parts of the badger.  Some brushes will be softer and or denser because of this.

* 2) The brushes they sold at the store were between 2 to 3 times more expensive than what I found online.

* 3) There is a 4 step method to shaving; oiling up, cream up, shave, then after-shave/moisturizer.

* 4) Alcohol is bad for your skin because it dries it out.  I had always thought that if it didn't sting it wasn't working.

* 5) if you moisturize your face you should also moisturize your neck too.  The reason is if you take care of your face and not your neck the discrepancies might be too attention grabbing as you get older.

* 6) You only need a very small amount of the shaving cream they were selling on the brush to get a very rich lather.

* 7) The ""blade wars"" as I called it are a tad bit unnecessary.  1 sharp blade would be more than accurate.

* 8) There are blades so sharp that they would remove more skin than necessary when shaving.

* 9) Every person's face/skin/hair is different and would have different needs.  Beyond the normal/sensitive, curly/straight hair variety that I originally thought.

Anyways, I am not sure if all of this is true or not.  I was in a store and I could have been just sold all of this stuff.  But the guy I talked to did seem knowledgeable and was nice enough to give me a lot of demos on how to do stuff.  In addition to the shave treatment, I also bought a razor and after shave balm and preshave oil.  I figure if I shave for 3 years with the razor the thing I bought would have paid for itself because straight razor blades are so much cheaper than the blades I was using.

Most places ask if you feel like the gender that your body would imply, and sometimes I don't feel like a man, whatever that means. I don't really follow gender stereotypes, but who does? Something that's even more confusing is trying to understand what feeling like a woman on the inside would mean. I've never lived in that role and have no idea if that applies to me either. I'm not exactly really feminine either.

Sometimes I'll see myself in the future or in sexual fantasies as a woman, but I wonder if that's just a fetish. Even when I see myself as a man in sex, it's usually either being coached by a more experienced woman or as a submissive partner. Not to say there aren't sometimes I really want to dominate.

Another part of me wonders if I'm self-loathing because of how crappy a lot of guys are. I do feel like women are better people on the average, and I know that's bad to say about either sex. This may also result from me feeling unworthy of being a man since I get zero romantic/sexual attention from women, whom I'm primarily attracted to. It feels like if I could just find a stable, loving relationship with a woman, these feelings might just go away.

Right now, I feel like I would be happy being either gender, with a body to match it and with no gender dysphoria. The number one reason I think I'm trans is that if there were some way to flip between a male and female body, I'd probably just stay female most to all of the time. There would be advantages and disadvantages to both genders and I realize that no such technology exists.

What does it feel like to be a man when you don't fit in with a lot of macho guys?

Thanks for your help.

As an infant I apparently had a couple of health problems that made my mom overprotective; I guess he blames me for that and has never gotten over feeling like the ""family failure."" Until he moved out at 20, he emotionally and physically abused me weekly. A lot of it was centered around me being a ""girl"" and being a ""wuss.""

I don't really talk to him anymore, but over the past year I have begun to realize how deeply I've internalized what he told me over those years. I have a ton of friends in the military and law enforcement and I've been known to feel almost threatened when my job and life is compared to theirs. I have a habit of idolizing masculine positions and dreamed about being a firefighter for years even though it wasn't realistic. 

Earlier this week a girl I've been working through some issues with said that she never expected to end up with a guy like me, instead imagining herself with a ""strong, silent leader."" It didn't bother me at the time but its begun to. It's not her fault, but it sucks that a comment like that can start me into a cycle of questioning my manliness and masculinity all over again. 

To be honest, I'm bloody tired of this. I want to be comfortable in my choices and feel successful without having to compare myself to other men. Indeed, my chosen occupation--crisis mental health--is pretty bad ass. But I just want to stop second-guessing myself like this and internally struggling with my masculinity.

Buy a freakin safety razor. 

Not that Gillete 5 blade + beard comb and moisture strip shit. I mean what your grandpa used. Single blade. It its the absolute closest shave you will get short of using a straight razor. And while you're at it, buy yourself a brush and a puck of shave soap because you're a man and we like our daily rituals like whipping up a good lather in an old-ass coffee mug. 

Pros- 

* Closest shave you can comfortably get without having to relearn how to shave (straight razor).

* You're classy as fuck with these things.

* Cheaper in the long run. A normal safety razor such as a Merkur can run 50$ but the blades are at most 5. After four refills you've already paid for the expensive cartridges that Gillete Mach 5's and all that stuff use. Need to shave on vacation but cant get a blade in your carry on? Pop the blade out of your razor and buy one at your destination.

Cons-

* There really aren't any. You may cut yourself the first or second time but keep in mind you're running the absolute sharpest thing you've ever held across your face. 

Seriously though, I cannot remember the last time my face was this smooth. Give it a try guys!",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,False,,,True,t3_jjblb,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/jjblb/safety_razors/,

Problem: 23 male; SEVERE performance anxiety or low libido, I don't know which.  How can I make a diagnosis? (Don't just answer, ""relax"", because that doesn't work for me -- I don't know why). I do get morning wood, but not every day. 

Background: First saw porn (magazine) at like 14.  No videos until college and even then was never really into to live porn. I used pictures. (I have tried /r/nofap before and can pretty easily go without porn or fapping for about 1.5 months, then usually I MO). Again, not addicted to porn (at least I don't think).  

 First girlfriend was in high school, oral was fine (no erection problems), but sex did not work for the better part of the relationship (until I guess I finally got over the SEVERE performance anxiety). 

Now, fast forward, new girlfriend, I can't even get an erection. Hand job, oral, dry humping, real humping -- nothing. I am starting to think maybe I am just low libido'd or Asexual? (Not attracted to guys, so I don't think I'm gay. One would know if they are gay, right)?  I know worrying like this doesn't help, but need input.  

What do you think?  Anyone out there got similar tales? How did you overcome? 

Thanks,

Thank you all for the advice/input.  I am overweight and circumcised, for the record. Not obese, but could afford to drop a few.  I will see a doctor based on all the answers and go from there.

Personally I've always taken issue with the idea of asking someone's father for permission before popping the question. It strikes me as pretty mysoginistic and a hang over from the days of marriages being first and foremost a business arangement. As far as I'm concerned the only person's permission I need is my SO's.

The issue is that she comes from a very old fashioned and pretty conservative family. I've no doubt her parents (especially her dad) would expect me to ask their permission. I certainly don't want to get married life off on the wrong foot by pissing off the new in-laws before we've even tied the knot. Another part of me though doesn't want to set the precedent that they somehow get a say in our life decisions. I have some pretty major differences with them on a lot of issues (I'm a left wing LGBT rights campaigner from a family of athiests, her dad is a staunch Catholic and Conservative.) They're likely to have some pretty strong opinions when it comes to the type of wedding service, child rearing etc and I don't want to encourage meddling. Ultimately, if they said no I'd ignore it and ask my SO anyway.

I checked with my SO (subtly, I don't want to ruin the suprise!) and she said she'd like the idea, as it shows the guy wants to be part of your whole family as well as starting your own one. Ultimately I don't think she'd be that bothered if I didn't but I have a strong feeling the family probably would be. How would you guys feel personally about asking someone's father for permission before proposing?

**tl;dr: Should I shelve my personal feelings on the matter and ask her family's permission before proposing, in order to save trouble down the road? Also, how do you guys feel about the whole 'asking permission' tradition?**

Long time lurker, first time throwaway user. I was wondering if there were any younger guys (i.e. in their 20s) who have any experience using ED medications. 

It's a bit embarrassing. I associate ED with older guys, like senior citizens. But sometimes when I'm in bed with a guy (gay btw) in the middle of sex, *especially* when I'm going to top or in the middle of topping, I find it hard to... stay hard. It's not like I'm not horny- **I love topping**. But for some reason I get soft. Sometimes I think it's because I feel pressure to perform well, sometimes I think it has to do with my weight (I'm 5'6"" and around 230lbs), sometimes I feel like I get a bit frustrated trying to get inside a guy and find get to the right sex rhythm. 

So, do any of you have experience asking a doctor for ED meds? I don't see this being a regular solution, but it'd be great to have that little extra bit of help once in a while.

I've noticed recently that he becomes very jealous whenever I am talking to my Mother about something, anything. I would assume that he is feeling left out?

It'll go something like this - pumping along, oh, I better back off for a second - slow and/or pull out for a change of stimulation - continue and feel like I'm at or around plateau, but there is semen present in quantities greater than pre-cum or edging would produce, and I could lose or maintain my erection depending on whether or not I choose to continue (remains in my control, thankfully).

I don't know if that's a clear description or not.  It becomes an issue when A) I wanted something explosive, not just to ride high on a plateau  for a while - and B) I could continue on to another orgasm, but it will take some time when she seems ready to be done (I usually make sure she's taken care of before finishing).  That ""ready to be done"" POV may make some practical sense - she may be getting sore or tired - but if I'm able to keep going, I feel a bit hurt that she doesn't want me to (rationally or irrationally).

End result - compromised personal satisfaction along with some confusion and disappointment.  She also give's a ""you okay?"" as in ""did you cum?"" - and that feels like awkward communication... because while I may have, it wasn't what I expected and isn't easy to describe.


eta: Your feedback is greatly appreciated, even if it is ""how the hell do you not know if you've cum?"", which is probably what I would have said 10 years ago.  Aging is a bitch.

My parents haven't been the most ideal parents. They don't necessarily make the best decisions financially, and it has been like that for years now. It has affected me greatly because it has made me have to have a job since I was 16 and I have learned how to be financially responsible for the most part. We also moved into an apartment during the summer of my senior year of HS. My father was always anti-social, and that always irked me. Maybe I'm just being a little bitch, but my father never taught me the ""basics"" of being a man (sex, being handy, chivalry, etc.) and I had to learn those things on my own. I've always resented him for that but I realized that he didn't have a father at all and I'm assuming that he was never taught those things and therefore didn't teach me. He didn't really know what to say. 
Anyway, I'm a freshman in college and I live on campus about a half hour from my house. Lately I've been thinking a lot about how I don't have a home. I lived in the apartment for a month before I went to college and it will never seem like home. The way my parents act doesn't help the cause.
When I was younger, my mother worked as a Superintendent and Principal of a charter school in my hometown. Essentially, the school didn't like her and attacked her for things she did not do, ultimately resulting in her being fired. She would come home every night crying, saying that things would be better if she were dead. Ever since then I would always imagine my father eating alone in a restaurant being lonely and that made me sick. About a week ago, my friends and I were at Olive Garden and I saw an old man eating alone. I couldn't take my eyes off of him and I eventually had to run to the bathroom and weep. I couldn't stop thinking about my father. 
Another example is:
The have also had to borrow money from me, constantly. ""I need $10 for gas,"" or, ""the paycheck ran out in 5 days, we need you to get dinner."" Keep in mind, though, that my parents do have debt from medical issues, but my father makes ~$100,000/Y and they spend the rest on new furniture and cars which they bought on credit. 
A couple of days ago, I got a call from my dad saying that our dog was sick and needed to borrow $200 for the vet. I swallowed my pride and agreed to let them borrow it. 
Just after I got off of the phone with my dad, I contemplated every moment that they had to rely on me. I sat on my bed in a heap of rage for about 10 minutes, and then I bursted into tears. I couldn't help myself from wanting a father. 
My dad and I agreed to meet in the parking lot of the local Target in my college town and as I pulled up my eyes started welling up. I fought back tears and we casually caught up from the month we hadn't seen each other. It was brief but the closest I've felt to him since I was a child. On my drive back to my dorm, I started crying again. It was in that moment that I regretted every bad feeling I had towards my parents. They had it tough because of their own decisions. 
(I'm sorry if this was all confusing, this is my first post concerning this sort of thing and I'm sort of nervous.)

We came to Canada as a family 12 years ago and I always assumed the dynamic between my parents was ""normal"" and representative of ""love"". Through my own life experiences and especially since moving out of the house 6 years ago it's become clear that this is not the case.

I don't know what's wrong with my mother but I suspect BPD or she is just a shitty human being. In any case, my youngest sister still lives at home and she is subjected to a barrage of verbal/mental/emotional abuse on a daily basis.

My father, away from my mother can be a good, kind, considering human being. However under her influence and manipulation he turns into a monster as well. I can only imagine the shit she's put him through over the last 28 years but he agrees with her to a point of telling us that we are a bunch of ungrateful useless shits and we should be empathizing with her because she had a rough childhood.

Anyway, this is just the tip of the iceberg of course but **what I am looking for is resources and stories from men who have been in my father's situation.** I know we can't change his mind for him but I want to show him that her behaviour is not right and there is more to life that being with a psycho bitch and being put down, heckled, laughed at, dismissed, and manipulated every day of his life.

It's not like I'm the first guy to end up in a relationship, where the sex gets a bit stale after a couple of years. Amirite? (Right?.......... Riiiiight?.... Yes?)

Anyway; my ex-girlfriend and I had a pretty awesome sex-life. We'd do it everywhere, and we'd have all kinds of kinky fun. Power plays, blowjobs in semi-public places, tying up, handcuffs, leather, threeways with chickens (Ok, maybe not that kinky), etc. Anyway, she may have been really fun in bed, but out of bed it just didn't work; so we broke up.

My now SO is another story though. In the beginning we had lots of sex, but she describes herself as asexual. While I'm into all sorts of fantasies, and consider myself a very sexual man, she's, uhhmm..... unimaginative enough, that all she wants is doggystyle from time to time. She's not a prude or anything; in fact I don't think it's even possible to offend her. She's just not that much into sex I guess. Sometimes it gets a bit frustrating, because I don't want to be the kind of guy who initiates everytime (And when I do, it's almost impossible to get her into it). Anyway, she does have this one fantasy that she wants to try, which is kind of..... Yeah. Not going to mention that on the internet. But it kind-of oversteps my boundaries a bit, and I'm still nervous about it. But that's about the only fantasy she has.

Anyway, we've talked a lot about this issue. She says she wished she'd be more interested in sex, but that she simply isn't most of the time. I try to urge her to come up with fantasies asking: ""I know what I like. Surely you know what YOU like too?"", but it's no great success. Anyway, our relationship is awesome except for this issue. We're really good friends, and we have a really great chemistry and connection, but we both agree that we're really missing something in the sex department.

Any ideas, OneY?

I went to the doctor about a month after it started for unrelated issues with sinus headaches and mentioned it to him. He said to abstain from sex for a month as I had desensitized myself to sex. I find this highly unlikely as the drop off was so sudden. Regardless I resisted masturbating or having sex for about two weeks. While it did help me get erections quicker I still had no increase in sensation and would still lose my erection while having sex. I wanted to have sex it was just that I had no feedback to keep it erect. I've been having sex since then but it is much less frequent. I can't even cum everytime although I can still make my gf cum although by the time it is over I'm just frustrated because I'm super sweaty with no reward other than her satisfaction which only goes so far. Basically I'm wondering has anyone else ever had a similar issue and if so is my doctor right or could this be something else? Also, if you have had this how long did it last?

I think this may be because I'm getting tonsil surgery soon and I'm also going to an allergist so my insurance probably isn't stoked about me costing them so much money.  
**TL;DR:**  
 * Haven't had almost any sensation in my penis in two months  
 * Want to know what a sudden drop off in sensitivity in my penis could be caused by  
 * If you've experienced this how long did it last

She finally told me she can't stand my beer gut and finds it difficult to compliment me on my looks anymore. Well, she's no spring chicken, either - but I compliment her all the time. I've resolved to lose weight this year but it's going to take time.

The other problem is sex. I love giving her oral but she just never goes down on me. She's not uncomfortable with it; she just doesn't. I've told her many times it would help liven things up, even to just surprise me now and then like I do for her. But she just never does.

Yet another problem is that she's not willing to try anything new in bed. I suggest dressing up, role-playing together, etc. She just won't try. Just plain ol' vanilla missionary position. I want to mix things up! I'll mention her blindfolding me or whatever and she looks at me like I'm a pervert. I'm very adventurous and think I'd be willing to do all sorts of crazy kinky stuff, but my wife won't have any of it.

And the final problem, her last long-term boyfriend before me was incredibly well-endowed. Why do I know this? Because my wife is pretty open about it. And I'm, well...not well-endowed. And it drives me mad that I feel I feel I don't excite her or satisfy her enough, despite her insisting to the contrary.

From what I've seen on T.V., over heard in conversations, and witnessed in peoples actions I get the growing sense that the American narrative about gays is less about homosexuality and more about effeminate men.  When I hear people speaking about lesbians I most often hear something akin to ""That's hot"", or ""Poor dear, she'll never find a man to take care of her"".  When I hear people speak of gay men the sentiment is repulsion even sometimes violence.  Even men I know who are gay have a negative reaction to flamboyant or highly effeminate gay men.  So am I alone is seeing the debate in America, at least some part of it, being about violating gender roles rather than about sexual preference?  And if that's the case does it not behoove men every where to have equal rights regardless of sexual preference if only to free ourselves from our gender constraints?  Isn't it always better to have more choice in how you can act and who you can be?  

P.S.  Does anyone have statistics for violent hate crimes related to homosexual broken down by sex? E.g. How many attacks per year against gay men vs. gay women.

I'm 21, she's 20, and we were together for just under a year. It was the first relationship of any sort of length, and we spent nearly all of our free time together.

It ended on Sunday, and it was pretty apparent that it would happen. All things considered, it hurt more leading up to it knowing it would happen and there was nothing I could do to fix it. Since then, I've been keeping busy, (Class Monday-Thursday, Work Monday-Friday, lots of supportive friends) working out, and avoiding alcohol like the plague.

My biggest problem is that our relationship exposed some major character flaws in my personal group of friends. They didn't treat her as well as they should have, made inappropriate comments when drunk on one occasion, things like that. These friends are still pretty important to me, but how do I reconcile what they were doing? Or prevent it in the future?

Additionally, I've been feeling a severe loss of appetite, as well as some fatigue. My libido is apparently zero. These are all extreme departures from my normal behavior. Emotionally, I feel relatively stable and somewhat positive surprisingly. I understand that I'm still experiencing a lot of stress, but should I be worried? If not, when can I expect these things to pass?

Finally, the breakup scene was pretty cliche and run of the mill. ""It's not you, you're a great guy, I hope we can be friends, etc. etc. etc."" I would genuinely like to rekindle a friendship with her in the future, but how likely is this? The break was relatively amicable. I returned some important things I think she should have, and she's currently still borrowing some furniture from my family which I will have returned once she moves out of her current apartment.

I know I have to put myself first and watch out for my needs before trying to keep a friendship that may or may not work, but I'd like to be a reasonable, mature adult about this.

I've noticed something about myself.  I'm grossly impersonal.  I don't ask how people's families are, how their partners are, if they have partners, what they like, what they do, etc.  I'm a graduate student and all I can talk about are impersonal things like school, work, and sports.  I used to talk about cars, too.  Part of this, I think, is that I've ended up with very few friends that are close to me, and even then, I don't want to constantly dump on other people about things that go on in my life, so I don't talk about personal things with them.

Now, a year in to graduate school, I've noticed that I've not made any real ""friends.""  My current friends are people who I've made friends with before I went to graduate school (from my undergraduate school, basically).  I've spent the past year working with a lot of different people, and I don't think any of them would be calling me up on a Friday night to hang out... in fact, that never ever happens.  Part of me thinks that because I don't get personal with people, I probably come off as a cocky asshole or something of the sort.  Maybe I just don't seem 'trusting.'  Either way, I want to do better at making friends, because when I finish this graduate program I'm probably going to move to a new city and start this process allll over again.

Women experiencing it are of course more than welcome to share their thoughts.

Does anyone else feel like the women in their lives - be it wife, GF, mother or someone else - for some reason think it's their duty to make sure you're not enjoying life too much? Because it seems to me that the dynamic that has developed between my wife and I over the years is one where whenever I get excited about something she has to put it down. It's like she feels obligated to do so. I'm a creative person and I come up with plans, projects and ideas all the time. But whenever I tell her about them (usually all happy and excited), instead of being excited for me or encouraging me, she either ignores me (""Yeah, honey, that's great..."") or points out some other responsibility that I should rather be doing. 

Me: ""Hey, baby, I'm going to write a children's book!"" Wife: ""Shouldn't you rather be focusing on your studies?"" 

I'm not an irresponsible person. I'm a good husband and a good father. No, I'm not perfect and yes, some plans are stupid and not worth pursuing, and some could potentially distract me from my other, more important responsibilities. But when every single one of them is met with either complete disinterest or ultimately irrelevant criticism, she doesn't exactly help me spot the difference between the good ones and the bad ones. And, more importantly, she makes me feel like crap.

(My mother is the same (she's stayed with us over the summer, so this has come up).)

I'm not simmering in my resentment. I've talked to her about how she makes me feel and have stopped taking it lying down. Whenever she puts me down unfairly, I tell her. It's awkward, but ultimately I trust it will be worth it. She's a good wife and is on board with changing her behaviour. 

What I wonder is whether any other OneY'ers have similar experiences. Because I've mentioned this to some of my male friends and they do. It seems like it's a common thing. My theory is that society tells men to be entrepreneurs and to follow their dreams, while women are told to disregard their ambitions and not be assertive. This creates female resentment against males and it manifests itself in relationships. I don't know.. Just a theory. Maybe someone has some better ones.

I'm big into photography(sports mostly) and I go to all of the high school games I can make. I post all of the pictures on facebook to get out there when I want to start my career in photography. I have been approached by one of the parent's who organizes most of the teams events and such. She has asked me if I want to go on some away games with the team to get some more shots for the team. I have already said yes, but I'm getting a bit nervous about the whole thing now. It's just the whole idea of being one of 2 or 3 guys on a buss full of high school girls(me coach and maybe guy bus driver). I'm a kind of shy guy, not sit in the corner don't make eye contact guy, but I'm not exactly the person that's just going to hop on the bus and act like it's a normal thing. I can talk to girls and all I have no problem with that and everything but, I just cant imagine how awkward it will be. I have no idea how a girls bus ride goes, I have plenty of experience with the guys bus, but before game time I usually sit with my headphones getting a bit pumped up kinda. I don't want to look like a looser and do this on the girls bus, so what exactly should I do? Sit with the coach?

**Edit:** A lot of you seem to be getting the idea that I'm a complete outsider when it comes to girls, I'm not. I'm friends with a good portion of the team and have talked to all of them at one point. I just feel that it would be weird with me being the ONLY guy of their age on the bus.

There's a lot of issues we deal with, right? I get it, let's talk about 'em I guess but what's the point of dealing with these personal issues if it's getting in the way of doing what we're supposed to do? Which is explore space, amiright?

Like...so take mating for example. There's the argument to be made there's a lot of people worrying, ""How do I get a girlfriend,"" when commonly a great answer seems to be, ""Go do what you love, go be a part of something amazing, build up your person and go do what it is you were destined to do, and when you're at your peak enjoying who you are, that's when you'll meet a special someone out in the field of doing what you love, that's when you will feel the most full and feel like you have the most to offer another person as a potential partner in life."" So go do what you love, and build yourself up.

So what is that? That thing you'd ultimately feel fulfilled doing? Making widgets? Selling widgets? Cleaning widgets? Marketing widgets? Making fancy illustrations of concept widgets, and then putting those fancy illustrations in a power point presentation with a logo you designed for the widget, with stock background music you paid a company for so the presentation had that extra POP, and you hire a model to stand next to the widget, and someone develops an app that takes a picture of your friend and replaces his head with a widget with his face on it, and programmers took time out of their day to make the app, and lawyers were paid to make sure no one steals the name of your widget, and ice trucks have to have special coolant gas canisters designed for them to keep the widgets cool while you ship them. 

I don't want to work for a contractor who designs spying technology for a nation state. I don't want to work for a company building bigger bombs, tastier Doritos, the next sugar-free soda, the next app for sharing media I find special, fundraising for a political party...I want to explore space plz. I don't want to take a red pill or learn how to brew my own beer or fill a bookshelf up with board games or blu rays or action figures, I want to explore space. I don't want to argue with a religious person or post pictures of my cat or look at a billion pictures of boobs, I want to explore space. Astronauts probably don't have any trouble getting laid. Do astronauts have existential crisis? It's a fair question...I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of a spaceman who feels moondust crunch underneath his space boots and asks himself, ""What the fuck am I doing with my life?""

I mean, where else is all this going? Do you take comfort in activities that make you feel like part of the human tradition? Bullshit we've been doing for ages? Let's fuck the shit out of space, instead, no one has done that yet.

It doesn't really feel like its part of culture in a way we can easily participate...like I know where to go get a good brunch, I know where to find the best tacos in town, I know where to mentor a young kid or donate food or learn how to meditate or learn how to do web development, but I don't know where I could just go and somehow participate in ""LET'S GO TO SPACE""

Maybe it's just me, right...""Hey dude, sounds like you should go fuckin' figure out how to be a part of space, kuz ......there are people that do that already. So go be one of them."" Butimean, I always look back and wish I was looking at the bigger picture. Efforts towards a small shallow thing or just doing it because I thought it was what I was supposed to do, but when I do these things for a while, suddenly I stop, and ask myself, like, ""WTF am I doing? Shouldn't I be in space by now?"" And I want to talk about it. Because if there's anything I've learned from Reddit, it's that if I ever come up with anything there's already dozens of other similar people all over the planet coming to similar conclusions.

We're actually spending less on space? Budget reduction of space exploration? Cutting programs? It's 2013...WHY?

I've seen arguments that space exploration is ""a waste of money""...think about that for a second...in the grand scheme of things, from the point of perspective from which we're thinking at a global level, as the human race...what IS a ""waste"" of ""money""? If it's what we're supposed to end up doing anyway, don't you just DO it? Like I was listening to some story on NPR, and some politician talks about holding a special election. The question was actually brought up, ""How much money is this election going to cost the taxpayers?"" And I'm like....""HELLO, don't we need an elected official to hold this empty position? So if it's what we need to do then why does it matter how much it costs?"" I think space exploration is the same way. It's what we're supposed to be doing. It's where manpower and brainpower are ultimately supposed to be focused. So can we focus on it? I just think it would be sweet to see space exploration explode by leaps and bounds during my lifetime. During my parents' lifetime, even.

Maybe you don't work for NASA, but how could your expertise contribute to space exploration? Even if you design shoes, it could be said ""well design space shoes""...toilets? Space toilets! Why contribute to the Wikipedia page for [Bugle Boy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugle_Boy) when you could be contributing to the Wikipedia page for the [CMB Cold Spot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot)? Do they have Pacific Rim official branded LEGO sets yet? Are you on the team to come up with the LEGO build? Wouldn't you rather be exploring space? Do we need new flavors of Pop Tarts? Or do we need....SPACE POP TARTS? 

I guess what I'm saying is, look up at the stars one night and just think about space for a few seconds. Uh, as men, I guess. Let's do the space thing. I just wanted to be a voice that said that to you...man. Space.

What was it Teddy Roosevelt said about space exploration? Ah I couldn't find the quote. Anyways. Space. I'm serious, guys. Space.

OR go write that power rangers fan fiction or whatever. Or explore space. Or to take another shower. Or go explore spaaaaccccccce. Just putting it out there.

I was in /r/iwantout and a lot of people are wondering, ""Where should I go? Thailand? Spain? China?"" How about space? Put a pin in it. Go write down 10 of your problems you have to deal with right now. Bump down the number 10 item off the list and replace it with, ""Find out how do I space?"" Stop worrying about what that guy said about you at work and start worrying how you're going to get your ass into space.

What if there are fuckable space aliens? What if aliens have better LSD? What if there are aliens made out of LSD, and when you shake hands with them your minds meld and you mindfuck one another for eternity in an instant? What if there's space pets that are way cooler than dogs or cats? What if you meet your wife while you are on break from your job, welding space shit? All the things that are going to happen to you, the common human stories of striving and struggling and overcoming and proving yourself and making friends and learning how to be professional and learning how to manage different people with different beliefs and plan projects and balance budgets...can they be space budgets?

""Remember that awesome guy that went to space? The one they named that thing after?""

""Yeah what about him.""

""He smoked tons of weed, and he was an atheist, and he was bisexual and had 3 wives and 2 husbands no one ever knew about, they were this big polyamorous space family that all did cocaine together.""

""But all of that shit is illegal! And there are people that don't agree you should be able to do those things!""

""Yeah, but so? He was like, 'We're going to space; y'all motherfuckers can sort this shit out if you want, red tape, bureaucracy, ideology, ism ism ism, while we're doing cocaine in space. Go assert your identity or your individuality or whatever queer shit if you want. On Earth. Kuz we're in space.' Now that shit is named after him. And what the fuck are we doing?""

I've been with The Special Ladyfriend(tm) for a year and change now, she's a keeper, and I'm starting to think in broad terms about popping the question sometime around the end of this year.

One of her friends got engaged a few months back after she picked out her own stone and ring -- at a cost of over $10K. Special Ladyfriend(tm), every time she mentions said friend, tells me how dumb she thinks the idea of dropping a ton of money on weddings is, and especially spending money on an engagement ring which could be used better elsewhere when we're both starting out in our careers. From an I-have-to-pay-my-student-loans perspective, I don't disagree. (The current plans are that, come the summer of 2013, we'll have a courthouse wedding and then a BYO craft beer/homebrew party for all of our friends somewhere in the woods. With a giant bonfire and midnight skinnydipping in a nearby river/lake/swimming hole. You're all invited.)

Thing is, whenever I get around to popping the question, I like the idea of doing it with some physical object she could accept. Call me a classic romantic, but I like it, and even if I can't put a big gaudy diamond ring on it, I'd like to put a *something* on it. Any recommendations as to a non-traditional marriage proposal tactile substitute?

I had these crazy leg cramps that sent me to a dozen or so sessions of  physical therapy for a few weeks. One of the big things my therapist pointed out was that my poor posture had probably caused, but had certainly exacerbated, the problem.

So I adopted his recommended posture, which meant consciously changing the way I walk, sit, and stand. The two main things are that I stand up straighter and while I used to have a kind of leaned-forward, loping gait, I now walk more upright and with my hips tilted forward. For the first few weeks, it felt like I was leaning backward while walking, but mirror checks showed I was walking like anyone else.

The really weird part has been that changing my posture has resulted in feeling more confident about things, which was totally unexpected. I feel way less beaten down by random life stuff than I used to. It's very strange to realize that carrying myself in this new way has resulted in feeling more masculine than I used to, and in a good way.

I don't even mind if I never get a response, but I have a lot to say, and nowhere else to say it. Even if this post is ignored I hope it will help me.

Let me preface this by stating that I grew up in a family of females.  My father/uncles were generally uninvolved, and my older brother grew up out of state.  I love my family, and have grown a sincere respect for the females that I grew up with, they're strong and capable, but I feel that I'm not.  I'm 27 years old.  Apart from my brother and a couple MUCH younger cousins, every blood relative was a female in the past two generations, excluding my father :p

When I left school early I started working construction for my dad, with probably a year or year and a half in between.  I was severely overweight (at the time I weighed almost 400 pounds), and the work was incredibly hard.  I could work maybe 3 or 4 hours a day, and when I got home I would sleep until the next work day.  Most of the time I could hardly work the second day, with inner thighs chaffing so bad I couldn't walk.  I feel like I worked my ass off.  I started working at the beginning of summer in Phoenix, AZ.

I felt terrible about my lack of contribution, but every time I apologized I was reinforced by the guys that I worked with, telling me that I worked hard while I could, and that they understood as much. 

My (now) brother in law worked for my father at the same time I did.  He was a meth addict that slept in his truck for 4-5 hours a day.  He made more money than anyone else at the time, which resulted in my father losing most of his crew as they hated working below someone who was so unwilling to participate.  Today, he's an incredible man, and father, and I love him dearly.  He has overcome his addiction, and is a brilliant father to his children.

After my father lost his crew I tried to pick up where I could, I lost 100 pounds, learned how to do all of the work that needed to be done, and have been bringing on my friends to fill in for labor and help his company continue.

Oh wow, this is getting long winded, I'll try to summarize.

I brought in a good friend to work, he started at the same pay grade as I was despite 6 less years of experience.  When I brought this up I was given a 1 dollar an hour raise ( good for fucking me ).

I've run my father's company ever since.  He chastises me when I ask for more effort from his employees, and refuses to teach me how to improve my work when I ask.

I've been praised for my work by ex-employees and the man who provides the contracts for most of our work.  I'm not just claiming I'm capable for the sake of puffing myself up, but my father and family refuse to acknowledge my efforts.  I've brought this up within my family before and had my sister (who has no knowledge of our work) shit all over me, and my father refuses to defend me.

My mother has told me that she won't defend me against my other family members because I don't need defending.  Every single fucking time I bring up my issues with my family members they tell me about theirs and tell me how lucky I am.  I'm 27 years old, nobody expects me to have a family, I weigh 300 pounds, and I hate the premise that all of my friends will be building lives in the next few years and I have nothing.

I get up at 4:30 in the morning, wake up all of the people that I work with, drive them to work, do most of the skilled labor needing to be done, bring them their pay, and at the end of the week I'm told how good they are at what they do.

When I try to bring up my problems with my family to get some help for myself they tell me about theirs and expect me to understand that I don't have it that bad.

The thing is I respect and love the people I have around me in my life.  I don't mean to claim that I don't.  They seem to care about me.  I just wish I felt the same way about myself.

I can't afford help anywhere else.  I've been making efforts at meditation and dieting, but it's all too fucking hard.  I love life and all that jazz, i just need to vent.

tl;dr pitty me.

Despite what my screenname suggests, I'm 21

I have been interning at a company.  A couple of the guys who I was working were approximately 29/30.  They were talking about their friend who was fucking some girl my age

I recently was seeing a girl who is may age, and part of the reason we split was because I wasn't mature as the guys she normally dates... yet she could objectively act very childish at some points, and I would definitely say I was more mentally mature than she

I have several close female friends. They are all dating men older than them, ranging from 3 years to 10 years older than them (they are 21/22).  I went to a houseparty not too long ago for a girl who was turning 20... her boyfriend was 30.

On OKcupid I see women who only date older men.  Most women want men their age or older.

Essentially what I am saying, is that in general women date men older than them.  I don't really know what to think about this.  It is weird hanging out with girls who are the kinds of girls I would like to date (I am not trying to suggest I want to date my female friends, but girls sort of like them) who have friends my age, but date men significantly older than them.  Now there is nothing wrong with women dating older men... but it seems almost every girl does.  Now I can see why they do... in general, an older man is sexier.  These guys they are dating have jobs, often houses, cars etc.  I dont yet.

I was thinking about my own personal issues and thought this might be a healthy forum for discussion. **No man is an island, so whatever it is, get it off your chest!**

I've always had problems with weight, or specifically *lack* thereof. I wasn't anorexic, I was just horribly lazy. In high school I'd sleep through first period, roll out of bed and go straight to 2nd period without breakfast. Skip lunch to do the homework that I blew off the night before, then come home and nap without eating, so I could stay up late to play video games. I'd wake up, have a quick dinner and that would be the only food for me all day. Ultimately, I graduated high school at 6'1"" tall weighing, generously, 120 pounds.

Not much changed in college, my terrible eating habits continued but I got horribly self conscious about my skinniness. Started wearing layers and layers of clothing to try to hide it. Even in the 90 degree heat of summer I'd wear long pants and long sleeves, afraid to show my complete lack of buttocks and biceps. I graduated college around 128 pounds.

About that time I had a moment of clarity, or terror, that made me change my habits. I was on my way out of a movie theater when a gigantic jacked guy grabbed me by the shoulder and spun me around. Right in my face: ""You bumped into my woman; apologize."" I was completely sure he had mistaken me, but I was fucking terrified at his size and the fact that he was basically crushing my shoulder. I caved like a bitch and apologized, and the next day started working out and buying protein mix.

Fastforward to now, I'm still slim at 165 pounds but I'm just starting to get comfortable in my own body. I can rep 185lbs 7-8 times on the bench press which I think, for my weight, is pretty damn good. Especially considering I started benching with just the bar...

I'm still plenty insecure. Despite my friends and family telling me I'm in good shape, I want to gain more weight. My girlfriend recently mentioned how being with me makes her feel like she needs to start running because I'm so skinny. I think she meant it as a compliment, but hearing that word ""skinny"" made me furious inside. My dad tells me there will come a day when I *wish* I were 165 pounds, which only pisses me off. Whenever I go out I'm always conscious of anyone bigger than me, it brings up my insecurities and I purposely avoid their vicinity if possible.

I think if I hit 180 pounds I'll be satisfied. I hope.

The first one was that my parents divorced and my narcissistic, self-congratulating father who had an affair and left 4+ kids (not exact for TMI) ran away.

The second was when I lost faith in my hero, Joseph Smith.

I grew up a Mormon.  I was toe-the-line zealous, hardcore, exact, whatever adjective you want to use--it would fit.  I ***believed*** and I used what I was given (the Mormon scriptures) to form my worldview.  I voraciously devoured them all.  I was also taught that Joseph Smith (JS) was a prophet, a man to whom God spoke on earth.  So I realized that I could read his words, *the same words which Jesus himself spoke,* and be confident in their surety and veracity.  His prophecies, statements, and pronouncements which comprise Mormon canon (mainly the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price (all different books) and to a lesser extent the JS Translation of the Bible) filled my heart and mind with concrete *absolutes,* things that *were* and *will be,* **period.**  I was happy and my life was full.

A la divorce.

Gradually my father's inability to empathize, to communicate feelings, compounded by his video game addiction drove a great wedge in-between us, that I tried to fill.  When we moved I tried to fill that father-wound with surrogates, which helped, temporarily.  Nothing was enough, however.

I continued to grow in my faith.  &lt;Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip&gt;  One day, disgruntled with my church's profound lack of focus on Jesus Christ (which, despite the name, it really suffers from), I ran across the website [MormonThink](http://www.mormonthink.com/), whose mission statement is to investigate the truth and accuracy claims made re. the Mormon church as shown in both the media and from the organization itself.  That was the beginning of the end of my confidence in Mormonism.

I quickly learned that Joseph Smith had been a con-man, cheating people out of their money by purporting to see minerals and rare metals underneath the ground with the aid of a seer-stone that he placed in a hat, the hat over his face, by which he could then see.

Then I learned he translated the Book of Mormon *in the same manner.*  Old habits die hard, I guess.  ""What?  This book, which I've taken root in and grown up in in faith is nothing but a load of bollocks?""  Hold on!  It gets worse.

* The Mormon temple ceremonies that are held in such esteem were stolen from Freemasonry.

* The health code published by Smith, The Word of Wisdom, will result in obesity and diabetes if followed religiously (by the science behind it), and the claims the church makes today (re. coffee, particularly) are unfounded (by science).  This itself is a product of the culture and time.

* Many of Smith's ""prophecies"" never came true.

* ""Jesus's"" instruction to send men to Salem, Massachusetts to claim ""great treasures"" he had for them turned up nothing, despite several revelations to the contrary.

* Smith sent men on missions *and married their wives.*

* Smith's horniness extended even to 14-year old Fannie Alger, to who's father Smith said such a marriage would ""Ensure exaltation in the Celestial kingdom {the highest reward a Mormon can get},"" or something to that effect.  Smith also married 31 other women, several of which (33%?) were already married.

Is this the hero I had learned about from the hands of the church that I loved?  Never.  No.  Nope.  So I lost Smith, who had been such an important person to me.  And finally, I lost trust in the Church.

This is my problem: learning how to trust again.  I feel I cannot now, for my own safety considering how deeply I've been hurt.  But I know I need to learn to trust again, and as I am still religious in the Christian (not necessarily Mormon) tradition, I *want* to be able to trust in God and Jesus Christ.  But after such monumental betrayal, I don't know how to start.  Please help.

Naturally, the server checked me in with his stuff still on the belt, and since I only had 7 items the other gentlemen returned with me concluding the transaction, forcing him to wait about 30 seconds.

**What's the difference between this reddit and Men's Rights/Male Studies?**

First, please [see this](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/dvxem/on_rmensrights/).

The Men's Rights subreddit was ""created in opposition to feminism,"" for the purposes of fighting for equality in the arenas of sex, divorce, rape and many others. Read their [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/71ui7/faq_list_its_open_for_comments_but_beware_of/?sort=old). OneY does not have a political agenda, but is instead an open forum for discussion about men's issues from the serious to the absurd. Look at [TwoXC](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/): they have posts about shaving legs and other womenly stuff. I don't know what the equivalent would be for males, but ""beards and balls"" has come up in discussion about this subreddit. Just saying.

**Isn't 99% of Reddit male-oriented?**

If you consider world news, funny pictures of cats, weed, geekdom and interesting links in general the sole domain of males, absolutely. Women are certainly in the minority on Reddit, and that's why the tagline of TwoXC is ""We really do exist."" But this isn't a reddit for celebrating typical ""manly"" stuff, this is a reddit for talking about what it means to be ""manly.""

**Can I be a moderator?**

[Nope.](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/dvly0/so_you_want_to_be_a_moderator/)

**What kind of stuff should I talk about/post?**

Sorry if this turns out to be a little long, or is a bit ranty.

I am only 22, and realize I am still quite young and shouldn't worry too much.  But I still do worry about this.

I am an atheist living in Utah, so you can imagine how little people I can relate to here. Not only that, but I have also gone into a field that is very male dominated, so both in High School and in College, I met very few women.  And those I did meet were generally already married or too religious for my taste.  I work with a start up company, so dating anyone there would be a huge mistake; not that there is anyone I would want to date there.

So I tried a few dating websites.  I had little success besides with one, and this was after trying twice over the period of a year.  I did end up meeting a girl and dating for about a month and a half.  But I ended things for a few reasons.  She wanted to make out and have sex waaaay more than I did.  I loved to talk and cuddle, but she just wanted to make out and do some foreplay every day we were together.  We were just not compatible in this aspect. (I hope that doesn't sound weird coming from a guy).  There were other signs that I should have gotten out of the relationship sooner, but being as pathetic as I am, I ignored them, which made the breakup very hard for me to actually do.

I tried going to a couple of get togethers at an anime convention, but there were so many males that I felt kind of embarrassed being there, as it seemed like people were fighting to talk to the few women that were actually there.

I am not the partying type, and don't really like being with large groups of people I have nothing in common with.  So I never get a chance to actually meet any good, compatible, women.  I just feel I never have, nor ever really will, have an opportunity to meet other people. Even when I try and leave my comfort zone, things end rather anti-climatically.  I am trying dating sites one more time, but I don't know if this is a last ditch effort, or if I should just wait and hope that I have an unexpected opportunity. 

What makes matters worse, which this is probably where I am messed up (read as forever alone) the most, is I have way to high of standards even though I know I am not perfect in any way.  I watch tv series, anime, read books, where there are types of women that I think I would really like (yes, I love the sappy romantic comedies). So it is very hard to be content with anyone I do happen to meet because I feel like they just aren't the type I seem to like the most.  

So my major question is this: How do I get over myself?  How can I get rid of my high standards, and actually like someone for who they are, without it turning into my last relationship of sticking around hoping I end up liking her more after dating for a bit?

*Thank you to everyone who helped me out earlier in the week figuring out what to do and how it was gonna happen. Thank you more than I can say.*

So it happened today.

Yesterday we were going to meet and talk about the whole ordeal. She was floundering so I decided to get a hotel room for two nights for us: one, because it was closer, more practical, and more private than anywhere available to us at the moment, and two, because I wanted her to have some type of comfort in this. We ended up having sex last night (the night before it). A lot of sex. Then she cried in my arms. She told me she loves me. Fuck. I can't and don't love her back. Not after the shit she's pulled. I cannot.

This morning we woke up and went to it. Protestors outside holding babydolls. Assholes. Nice security guard let us in. More crowded than I expected (the nurses told me everyone said that). The whole ordeal took around five hours. The first hour was sitting in the waiting room and filling out paperwork. The next three were her in the operation and recovery. The final hour was me listening to her cry silently and trying to make her feel better. It didn't work.

Left the clinic, got her some food and pain meds, then came back to the hotel. Two hours of her crying and coming in and out of an anesthetic fog. She told me things. She said she loved me again. That the only reason she did this was because she loved me. She couldn't have done it for someone she didn't love. I believe her. She told me how, half way through the procedure, she came to and started to scream as best she could for them to stop. That had I not been so young and full of potential she wouldn't have done it. That she did it all for me because I have hopes and dreams. That she shouldn't have told me she was pregnant and just kept it, never to bother me again. That she had a name for it (I didn't listen when she told me). **Fuck** I never told her I loved her though. I love her for going through with this and that is about it.

I feel hollow. She tells me all this and I'm just crying. I've broken her. I've broken a human being. I've utterly destroyed her. She is crazy but fragile, I know it. She was only pregnant 3 weeks. It happened on our first time having sex together. I feel hollow and I know I pushed her (consciously or unconsciously) into this. I feel at once like a terrible person and relieved. Terrible because I've hurt her so immensely, relieved because I can move on with my life.

I told her I'll be there for her. As a friend if nothing else. I can't abandon her. Not yet. I won't be her lover but because I've done this I will make sure she is okay. I have to.

She's in the bed right now sleeping. I'm in a chair writing this out. I've got to go hold her. She's crying in her sleep.

All sensation to touch, temp, etc. is gone 100%. Have any of you experienced something similar? Know of any way to fix this problem?

Little background info. All my previous girlfriends were on the pill, so I have never had to wear a condom before. Never had any problems with sensitivity then. Now I'm seeing a new girl, and we have to use a condom. We've had sex twice now, but I couldn't feel a thing with the condom. I may as well have been pelvic thrusting the wind. Fortunately, I can manage to stay hard and my gal seems to really be enjoying herself. So I'm happy for her at least.

But the condom is really killing me. I know I'm putting it on correctly and everything, but I literally lose all sensation with it on. Instant ghost penis. For the sake of research, I even tried masturbating with a condom on, but it's the same thing. I had to jerk it for 30 minutes nonstop with a death grip before I started to feel anything.

Any idea what's causing this? Is this common? Any way I can fix this, or am I doomed to feel nothing with a condom on?

I had my young teen years growing up heavily immersed in a feminist environment.  I spent a lot of time in feminist safe spaces, work places, homes, etc.  I was always treated very well (being a 11-13 year old male who wouldnt?).  Doing things like take back the night, and the like.  I should also mention I was the only male in my household (divorced mom, sister).  At no time was there any preference to that boys or girls were better, just equality all abound.

Now that I am older, I realize that my experiences have left me feeling unsettled about it. I've had a long time feeling comfortable being male. I was ashamed of shaving for a long time (!).  I still dont feel comfortable in female safe-spaces. In a more subtle and difficult to even formulate thought, I think I grew up without any positive male role models in real life.

Obviously we all become the person we want, but it took a long time to think about this in this way. I sort of feel 'cheated' out of ... something. Not sure what though.

I dont blame the people in my upbringing - they all meant really well. It was just an unfortunate complex side effect that no one could have predicted. 

And lastly, I have a lot of compassion for guys who having emotional issues, are depressed and generally are having a hard time.  It's tough, and life doesnt give guys any toolboxes to deal with this stuff. And for women who frequently despair that their guys dont expression emotions, I am also sorry for.  But women you are fighting against a pattern that is so deeply ingrained.  Direct assaults on 'the wall' wont work. You have to be more subtle I think. Patient. Therapists are probably a good move too.

It seems like an especially male stereotype to think ""she's awesome company, but I don't *love* her."" LOVE is not a harmful thing, it's a wonderful thing - and to  know that you are loved, to be told that you are loved, as long as it is free from any attached strings (""I love you, so why don't you do this for me?""), is one of the most rewarding things life can offer.

Men (and many women), please get off your ""I don't wanna be weak"" trip and go quietly confess your love for everyone that you do love. Strong people understand that it's ok to tell someone you love them, that it doesn't matter if you ""look"" weak or something. They just go ahead and show their strength through their love to those people. And those who are lucky enough to be loved by them... truly feel it.

If you are deeply happy when your friend/family member/gf/bf is happy, sad when they're sad, etc... you *love* them. And that's beautiful! Celebrate it, please... not enough people do, and then they regret it when someone dies and they didn't get to tell them they loved them.

I chalked it up to alcohol, told myself they were both drunk so it wasn't rape.  As far as I know, they each had a good time.  I described his behaviour to him a couple days later (without using the word ""rape"").  He was embarrassed and ashamed to hear he'd acted that way, and I figured that was all I had to do.

Recently I heard him say, sober, that sometimes a person should say ""no"" twice to be clear.  Supposedly, until the second ""no"", it's perfectly sensible to kindly persuade a person to, you know, let loose, lighten up, have fun, etc.  I'm quite confident that this belief promotes rape: when saying ""no"" is the beginning of an argument during which you change your mind and decided to have sex after all, that's rape.  Am I right?

Now I'm going to talk with him about this, and I'm going to be more clear this time.  I expect him to disagree with me.  I'm going to avoid making value judgements because I find that putting people on the defensive blocks the flow of communication.  I'm going to hold to the more abstract ""what is 'rape', exactly?""

I'm sure I'm not the only guy who has ever been in this position, so AMAA, post your own stories, disagree with me, etc...?

Neither are overly intoxicated, and both find each other attractive. One thing leads to another, and they end up at Taylor's apartment—indeed, in Taylor's bed. They enthusiastically remove each other's clothes as quickly as they can, but just before they actually start to have sex, Taylor stops.

“Wait, do you have a condom?”

“No, do you?” Jesse replies.

“Damnit!” says Taylor.

“It's fine, we don't need one...”

“It's not fine!” Taylor says. “We're not fucking without a condom.”

The response from Jesse is not verbal. Jesse simply climbs up on top of Taylor and initiates standard penis-in-vagina intercourse.

****

In this scenario, is Jesse a rapist? For a lot of people, their answer to that question depends on one factor: whether Jesse is a man or a woman. 

Logically and ethically, Jesse would be a rapist regardless of gender. In both situations, the actions are the same. The consent, or lack thereof, is the same. But in practical terms? Only a male Jesse would be a rapist under this hypothetical scenario. To most people, and arguably society as a whole: a man can rape a woman with his penis, but a woman cannot rape a man with her vagina.

Many people believe it is literally impossible for men to be raped by women in the same manner as the above scenario. They will say that such a thing is physically impossible, which is plain false. Or they will say that a man in that situation would simply fight the woman off. Never mind that many men, like many women, are psychologically incapable of violence. Never mind that some men are physically weaker than some women.

But it's more than that. A male victim of rape who went to the police with such a story would be laughed out of the station. 

There was a recent case in Germany of a man who, after initially consenting to sex, was raped by a woman who locked him in his flat and refused to let him leave. He was only freed after he called the police for help. When this story made the rounds in the media, the words rape and rapist was never used. Instead, the woman was described as “sex-mad”. [Incredibly, the woman was never named, but in some articles the victim was](http://www.theprovince.com/news/German+Dieter+charge+woman+confined/6470665/story.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter
). The facts of the event do not seem to be in question, even the woman herself does not deny the above facts. A later news article described a second victim; I also saw one online commenter who said that this woman has raped several men, but each time the police did nothing (though this cannot be taken as gospel).

Imagine an article where a woman was forced to have sex—locked in a room, and only freed by calling the police—after a consensual encounter. The male rapist corroborated the story, so that there was no dispute about what exactly happened. Could you imagine for one second that there would be articles discussing a “sex-mad” man? Or that the authorities would bid him good day and do nothing?

You may be thinking that cases of women raping men are so rare as to be a relatively trivial issue. According to a recent survey by the Center for Disease Control, during the 2010 period, [1.1% of men reported being “made to penetrate” during those 12 months. For perspective, an equal 1.1% of women reported being raped by penetration during the same time period](http://imgur.com/a/aw0eU).

But alas, even the CDC study itself is an example of the bias against male rape victims. Men who were raped in the manner described in Jesse and Taylor's story, were not categorized as rape victims, but as victims of “other sexual violence.”

Why is that relevant? Because then, the CDC can say something like this in their abstract: 

“Nearly 1 in 5 women (18.3%) and 1 in 71 men (1.4%) in the United States have been raped at some time in their lives”

This nice soundbite can be repeated in articles for the masses, the writers of which can be secure in the knowledge that over 90% of readers will never read the [actual study, which is freely available online, to see the data for themselves](http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf).

All of this goes to show that it is easy to prove that very few men are raped. The only thing necessary is to create a definition of rape which intentionally excludes male victims.

Thanks for all the advice and replies previously. Here's where I'm at now. I do Apologize for the length once again in advance. 


so yesterday was the court appearance as I mentioned. The agreement reached is that I get to see my daughter one a month, with no more than 6 weeks between visits from 9-7 on a Saturday with 1 week notice. I also am to attend counseling with my daughter to help work out issues between us. I do gain access to all her medical records and the ability to attend other functions (sport events, school events etc...) I am allowed to telephone and communicate electronically with my daughter at her initiative. I am also to attend a course on parenting. The matter can also be brought back to the court at any time. 

The good:

 I still get to see my daughter a little bit. Even if it is being relegated to being nothing more than a visitor as an extended family member. Measures are in place so that there will never be another period of 7 months without so much as a ""Hi!"" anymore. 

The counseling between us may allow me to break down some of the alienation barriers that have been put up. But after how this all is turning out my faith here is a little lacking. I do get access to her Councillors to finally be able to provide my perspective to them so they're viewpoints may not be so skewed against me in the future as well. 

I do gain some additional time being able to attend and witness events in my daughter's life. So even though I'll have to work and find out the information myself (calling her school to find out about pta meetings, graduation and getting report cards) I can still be there to support her. 

The bad:

I'm nothing more than extended family and a visitor in my child's life. There still will be conflict when it comes to holidays. I'm also getting less time with my daughter than the mother who signed off (this was about me and not what others are getting; is what I was told). 

The communication aspect is based on my daughter contacting me. They completely neglected that her access to these communication forms is entirely montiored and can be witheld and restricted in her living situation. 

There is also nothing in check to prevent any of the progress made in counseling from being completely undone as soon as my daughter gets home. 

The aftermath:

Fuck it. I'm done, I've resigned. I can't allow myself to wallow any further. I've got a good life and all that I could ask for (aside from my daughter). I'm tired of being emotionally broken. I've learned that sometimes no matter how hard you try, how good of a person you think you are, things do not always work out. There is not always justice and the right thing. Things just are. 

I will ALWAYS be there for my daughter in any capacity she wants me in. I will try to move forward and carry that faint glimmer of hope that ""someday"" may come. I'll keep jumping through hoops and doing what I can. But I also accept where I stand and can't invest or push any further.

Also, my English is pretty good, however it is my second language so please bear with me, I'm sure I'm not expressing myself with as much nuance as such a subject matter would necessitate, so keep this language barrier in mind. I really want to find a solution to this problem, I could use all your positive advice. Really looking for a male perspective on this, I hope you guys can give me a different point of view.

So, we've been together for a year. I'm 27F, he's 28M. Sex has almost always been a bit of an issue in our relationship. At first it was great - I'm a very sexual, horny girl and some of the very first things he tried with me were very kinky and I loved it. He's into BDSM a lot, anytime he watches porn it's bondage.

As for me, my kinks are more varied - I'm into dom/sub scenarios, I've never really done bondage seriously but I'm very curious, I love anal play, I'm bisexual, I love seeing bi guys getting it on, experienced in group sex, not jealous and love to share my partner in any possible way, love outdoors and semi-public sex, could see myself being used by random strangers under orders of my ""master"", I enjoy pain to a certain (high enough) degree, I've tried and enjoyed golden showers, etc. I really don't have so many hangups. I usually say that my only real limit is scat or vomit, and cutting (though I'm not even sure about that last one).

For my boyfriend, BDSM seems to be his only kink. He's straight as can be, nervous about anal (on me), quite private about sex (so multiple partners is difficult), nervous about doing it outdoors or in semi-public areas (though I sort of got him to enjoy a quick blowjob in an alley not so long ago)... you know. A bit more reserved than I am. I would never pressure him into something he's not into, this is not the point here. I don't even care if I don't get to share all these kinks with him, I have no hangups about different sexual preferences at large. The point is that I've always had the feeling that deep down, I'm a bit raunchier and more nympho/obsessed and open minded or fluid or malleable than he is.

The first issue we had about sex was that he was being a bit of a pillow princess. I don't mean that in a disrespectful way, but it's the best way I can think of describing this. I was constantly making him cum and working on him and giving him pleasure, and he started just sort of enjoying that without giving back so much. When I first get to know someone, it can be hard to make me cum, so maybe he just got complexed about his perceived inability and got discouraged. However, usually it doesn't take as long as it took him to learn how to get me off. There was something weird there.

Since then, it's been me being disappointed that we don't have enough sex, and him saying he doesn't need it as much as I do. Lately I've just been feeling bad about myself because I feel like he never initiates. He's not a spontaneous person, and I find it a bit depressing that he never just wants to rip me away from whatever task I'm doing to just fuck my brains out.

Anyway, I'll get to the point. Today we approached the subject of sex again, and especially a recurring subject: the feeling that I get that he doesn't enjoy going down on me. After discussing this for a long time, he said that **he doesn't enjoy going down on me for the purely physical aspect of it, but because he enjoys the pleasure he can give me this way**. Well, call me nitpicky, but this makes me feel bad. I've gone down on him in the past when he was so passed out drunk that he didn't give a damn. I just love to have a cock in my mouth. Soft, hard, semi-hard, I don't care - I just love sucking cock. Of course, I really enjoy giving him pleasure too - I'll tease him, bring him just over the edge and back down again, almost make him cum over and over again and then finish him so slowly and intensely and savour the agony on his face when he finally explodes all over the both of us. But also, it's a selfish act for me. I even sometimes masturbate with a dildo in my mouth, and I'll come faster if I have a cock to suck on. In certain scenarios he calls me his little cockslut, and that turns me on so much because I know it's true. I love cock. I can't help it.

In contrast, **he doesn't enjoy eating pussy just for the sake of burying his face in there, tonguing me deeply and getting it all over his face**. He said he would never, for example, go down on me while I was too passed out to care and just for the selfish fun of the physical act. Well, that sort of makes it impossible for me to enjoy. In order to cum quickly and amazingly, I have to feel like my partner is into it, not just for the reaction he gets out of me. I want to be able to call him my little pussy slut, to say to him things like ""Aren't you happy you have such a nice pussy to suck?"" But I can't, because he isn't. Yes, he enjoys it, but it's not the same - he wants to get me off, but something is missing for me. If my pussy isn't appealing to him as a pussy, then it feels like I'm imposing something on him that he doesn't really like doing. Add to that the fact that he rarely ever does it, and I just feel awful about having sex with him altogether.

I know a lot of you are going to think I'm asking for a lot. But I've known guys who were just pussy obsessed. They just love it, they love fingering pussy, they love licking pussy, they love feeling that wetness and just the thought of pussy is enough to get them off. I want to be that for my lover. I find that when a guy is enthusiastic about pussy just for the sake of pussy, they are better lovers in general.

Now, it feels like all the weirdness I've been feeling with regards to sex with him is explained by what he told me today. It feels like as long as he will only enjoy the vicarious pleasure he gives, I won't be able to have any. I feel like I need a guy who moans when he licks me, who just wants to tongue me deeper and deeper. If I don't feel that selfish enthusiasm on the guy's part, I feel like I'm imposing, and I have to retreat inside of my head and imagine fictional scenarios and fantasies to get off, which is what I end up doing with him a lot (he doesn't know this). Additionally, it's very hard to talk to him about these things because after talking about it, he just feels self-conscious about everything and can't act naturally and fuck naturally without obsessing over everything we talked about and how nothing that I told him about could possibly be natural now because he's thinking about it all the time.

Any advice at all would be great... I feel so lost right now, and like my sex life with the man I love can never be as carefree and amazing and hot as I would like to make it. Is there any way to get him more interested?

Addendum: After a few questions my boyfriend asked me, this is how I tried to explain to him the reason why I want him to be that enthusiastic about it, and the difference it makes for me. If he really enjoyed going down on me for its own sake, he would do things differently for sure. Instead of going for technique and trying to figure out what gets me off, he would just bury his face in there, rub his nose in my folds, give my pussy big wet laps because he'd want to taste it so bad, he would tongue me deeply, wanting to taste me... I mean, it would make a difference, and this is what gets me off, not technique. I mean, a girl who really wants to please her boyfriend with a blowjob but doesn't really care for it, is not the same as a girl who loves cock so much she will lick it, suck on the balls, rub it all over her face and moan all the while. It's not that he dislikes it... but he doesn't particularly like it. It's kind of hard for me to get off with that knowledge.

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend says he enjoys performing oral sex primarily for the pleasure he gives me while doing so. Personally, I need a lover who enjoys performing oral sex for themselves and as a purely physical act to really get off, but he says that is not his case. I feel like this is the explanation for a general lack of interest in sex that he has been exhibiting throughout our relationship. I'm raunchy and love sex, and even a blowjob is a selfishly pleasurable experience for me. I wish it was the same for him.

So we agreed on coffee and ice skating, but then she hurt her foot at work and has to wear a walking cast now for a few weeks so that was out. We planned to go for coffee and through this stretch of road near me that's like 18 miles of Christmas lights and stuff. That was the plan tonight but she worked later than expected and I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner instead and we did. I think my friends punked me because they recommended this place that was expensive as shit and full of 90 year olds. The date was kind of going south and getting awkward at dinner (no thanks in part to our waiter who kept coming in every 3 minutes and fucking up our conversations) so I asked if she'd like to go for coffee after and she agreed. We went to Starbucks and got coffee and walked around downtown in blizzard-like conditions holding hands for about 20 minutes until we were both totally freezing, then we went back to her car (she met me at the restaurant and drove us to Starbucks) and talked for 2 hours or so. She dropped me back off at my car and got out to hug me, and we both went in for a few kisses, and she told me that she had fun, rubbed my face and told me that she liked my scruff, told me that she hoped we could do this again sometime, and kissed me again.  She texted me about 30 minutes later and told me that she had a good time and hoped that I did too.

School is good, my social life is good, my health is good, and I have no financial problems to speak of. I'm pretty happy but there is one thing that I'm missing: a girlfriend.

However, it's not just that I want a girlfriend; rather, I feel like the hole in my life that exists because I'm single is abnormally large. Sure, everyone (well, most people at least) wants an intimate relationship of some sort, but for me in particular it really feels like a pressing issue. Not a day goes by where I don't think about this and not a day goes by where it doesn't bother me. I've talked a bit to my (single) male friends about this and I feel like I'm the only one that is this frustrated about being single. 

This problem just stays at the back of my mind and even though I'm usually pretty happy, there are days where I just feel like total crap because of it. I will even get anxiety sometimes as I go throughout my day, worrying myself over why I can't seem to get what I want. And it only seems to be getting worse as I get older.

I've always heard that the best way to avoid having this bother you is to simply live your life, follow your interests, etc etc, and eventually things will work out for you. I'm doing that, and I really do not think I can do anymore ""activities"" or whatever, I'm already very busy doing all kinds of things; the kinds of things that are supposed to help me not feel lonely, meet girls, or whatever.

I think it's probably also important to note that even though I'm 21, I have no relationship experience or intimate experience with girls at all. I'm sure this is playing some sort of role in the problem, but I don't know if it the sole cause or not.

I'm not really looking for advice on how to get a girlfriend, because that's a whole other can of worms. Rather, right now I'm more concerned with why this bothers me so much, and if you guys have any suggestions to make me feel better. I need to stop having my good days ruined just by seeing a happy couple somewhere and feeling down about myself. It's stupid behavior and doesn't help my situation at all.

So I am a reasonably attractive guy (21 years old, 6'2, 80kg) with a pretty good fashion sense.  I have plenty of friends, and I think I am generally quite fun to be around.  But, like a lot of guys my age, I simply cannot get any.  By any I mean relationships / sex or whatever.  And yeh, I'm pretty frustrated about it, this fake account nam comes from the idea of Average Frustrated Chump in seduction lingo.

And I don't know what to do about it.  I've been trying OKCupid for the last couple of months, and it is an absolutely horrendous experience.  I send message after message out, and only get about 15% replies (which isn't even that bad compared to some), but maintaining a conversation seems nigh on impossible.  I've tried a few approaches, and try to be flirty, slight cheeky, inquisitive etc.  But honestly I feel like I cannot stand out.  Of course the girls on the sight are inundated with messages, and have so much choice!  I'm aware a good portion of the messages they recieve are going to be bad, but even with the conservative estimate of one good message a day, they are still streets ahead of me.  I have recieved 2 non solicited messages from girls on my time there... both of which only said ""heya"", and one of whom was a bad match and lived 5000 miles away in New York (I'm British).  Furthermore, a lot of the girls on there are, in the immortal words of Mike Skinner ""fit but they know it""; they know they have the attention of hundreds of men, and many girls seem massively up there own arses, they have sparse, boring profiles or have really pretentious / super-hipsterish profiles that I doubt many men would dare to have.


I'm a student and I go to uni, and I always envisioned it as a place where I could meet plenty of girls.  And I have, but I seem to be permantently friendzoned.  And I definitely am not alone.  Girls either seem to have long term boyfriends, who are often several years older than them (most of my girl  friends do) and thus seem down-to-earth, or seem absolutely spoilt with choice!  I don't want to sound misogynistic, but I know an awful lot of girls who are completely aware that men find them attractive, and can be as capricious, flaky or demanding as they like. Any girl who has the magic combination of down to earth and reasonably physically attractive instantly has the attention of plenty of men.  

I just feel like I have absolutely no sexual currency, while my peers of the oppositve gender have it all.  

I am also a virgin, so even if I did get anywhere I would be absolutely terrible in bed, and I would hate to think what would happen if this knowledge was spread around.

I just hate that I have to lead in relationships.  I do english Lit at uni and of course this involves a hefty load of feminism, and the girls on my course lap it up, but as soon as it comes to the sex/dating scene I feel unbelievably niave to think that there may be some kind of equality there.  I have to put myself out there and actively flirt with them, ask them out, lead to sex etc.  The idea of me finding some nice, reasnoably attractive girl who gets on with me and who we share a lot in common seems like some fantastical story.  Insteas guys seem to end up with girls much younger than them so that they can lead the relationship, but this often comes with the cost of not caring about them in any particular way as they so much more experienced in life.  

I wouldn't describe myself as unconfident, which I know is given as a common reason for guys being single.  In fact I would describe myself as quitely confident, I am confident in my abilities and I can be fun to talk to.  Whene talking to girls I generally avoid the overly nice, pushover-esque talk, and I can be quite cheeky. But I guess sometimes I end up being too ""nice"", often becuase a girl is upset or down about something.  I don't really know how to approach this (and I know this has lead to me being manipulated by emotions), but a lot of sexually successful guys simply don't care.  I know girls are attracted to confindence, but the confindence girls seem to like isn't normal confidence, it seems super cocky, arrogant, boistrous etc.  I am not really any of those things.

I'm not desperate for sex, but I would like sex as part of a relationship, but I simply can't get attractive or sexy.  I just don't know what to do.  Does it get better?

A few other points:

-I am not only going for girls who are out of my league

-My lack of girls isn't becuase of some deep seated misogyny, and, even if it was, I feel guys who really don't respect girls are able to show off and act confident etc 

(i say these two points as I have seen elsewhere as these being common reasons for foreveraloneness)

I was raised by women, in a feminist context and I live with a woman.  Many of my friends are female, and I really don't have problems with women. But one thing I have noticed a lot is that I am not really sure what it means to be a man, and the women in my life are not very helpful.  They often times have a particular point of view, one I have described as female privilege, and it can become difficult to talk about issues and make progress.

One of the central problems with being a man circa 2011 is deciding what it means to be a man. If one is pensive and introspective, and have a wide ranging set of source material to draw from, it is even more challenging. Part of my goal to define ""being a man"" is to draw out the essential positivities of ""manliness"", and avoid common criticisms and cliches. I also seek to avoid the harmful ""man"" concepts as well.  For example, I would like to avoid being patronizing and to assume that women need a man's help to do basic things - for example holding doors open, doing physical labor, buying things.

Integrating all these points of view at the same time is very challenging. It is also difficult to talk about this to some people, a common challenge being ""just be a good person, dont worry about being a good man.""  This statement has several problems, the first is I believe I already am a good person, and the second is the implication that the goal of seeking a ""man"" image is an unworthy cause. 

One particularly difficult part of being a man is integrating and combining the multiple aspects of sex and sex drive. Many guys live with a sex drive, a societal view of men's sex drives, and the practical realities of interacting with women with regards to sex.  There is often a strong struggle between the inherent sex drive - which can feel irresistible - and an external message that his sex drive is dirty, shameful, wrong, evil, violent or just sick.  One of the hard parts explaining sex to women is the idea that a man's sex drive is an optional part of him, when for many guys it is such a central force it is difficult to ignore. As per Lewis CK's recent comedy skit ""you are a tourist in sexual perversion, I am a prisoner here.""  One problem being that men's sexuality is not prized, mostly because it is hardly in short supply. And the other being that men's sex drive is a deep biological hardwiring. The future of the human race depends on it essentially.

I'm currently working on a project that is expanding some of my thoughts and conversations about being a modern man, and attempting to thinking about how one might provide a realistic, male guided, path for younger boys growing up. An approach that respects their very real problems, their essential biologies and is respectful of everyone and creates a world we all want to live in.  I am working on avoiding the bitterness of ""MRA"" type discussions, the perceived ""sissyness"" of so-called ""new age"" men's groups, but providing something that distills the essential MAN in such a way everyone can both agree, but not being cliched, what other people want, and is authentic to us.

I believe a real man must define his masculinity as he chooses. The body he was born into, the hand he was dealt in life, and the shit he ate along the way cannot stop a man. 

What doesn't matter:
- If he's trans, cis, or neither.
- If he's fucked women, men, both, neither, or none.
- If he watches football or curling or both or none.
- If he drinks Bud Light or vodka or ""bitch drinks"" or neither.
- If he wears jeans or dresses. Or of course, neither.
What does matter:
- If he chooses to be a man.

I think manhood is made, not born. If retail labeling threatens your masculinity, know this: being a man is a lot harder than for example, buying a ""For Woman!"" haircare product. You must define yourself in a society that is intent on defining you. You must choose how you will be a man when all other forces, including other males, have already ""chosen"" how you should be a man. The man, when questioned, when quizzed, can say (without a single bat of their possibly well-defined eyelashes), ""Yes, this ridiculously feminized product is for me. I evaluated this item and it is the best fit for my needs.""

You must sometimes walk a path seemingly barren. Sometimes it may up to you to lead the way. Other men have done it before. Other men have tried and failed. No matter what happens, you are a man. You have chosen to be a man. No one can take that away now. Wherever your next step takes you, not just I but *countless* men—past, present, and future—while we may not walk with you, we support you. Whether your last blood is spilled; whether you bring untold riches to humanity; whether you just wake up to a seemingly uneventful new day. 

We are men, and we support you. You step in a path. Many paths are similar, many not, but they are all testament to masculinity, and they are countless. Your path may be unique. You may face struggles none have encountered before. But you are not alone.

I've been single for so long since, like I said in a prior post, I've been cheated on by every girl I've ever been with. I guess you could say that such events have made me suspicious of a woman's actions, believing that each one that speaks to me has a hidden agenda (and most of them do).

However, there's this one individual who's ""forcing"" me back into the dating scene, saying that ""being twenty and single isn't healthy for me, especially since I'm extremely reclusive."" It also doesn't help that I'm the only single person in my group of friends; not that I really care, but I guess people are starting to get uncomfortable.

I honestly don't know how I should approach this, what I should do. I have interests, yes, but they're not exactly what most would consider ""interesting"". 
My most browsed subreddits are revolve around occultism, socialism, or global politics; I'm not really that much of an interesting person. On top of that, I've met no one that clicks with me or has similar interests to me.

Can yous guys think of any reliable means of male contraception? Obviously there are condoms. I know condoms are a very effective birth control, and one of the best ways to prevent the spread of STDs. However, they might not always be the best option for us responsible adults.

HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION MOTHAFUCKA!

Let's say I am in a monogamous relationship. My GF is tired of the pill because of the side effects. Well, yes, there's always good ol' fashioned rubbers, but let's be honest, they're not so fun. Neither of us want a kid, the side effects of female birth control can be heinous, and condoms are a bummer.

You might say: ""But OmniDante, if you want to take charge of birth control, you could get a vasectomy!"" 

 I know, that would be nice, but I don't have health insurance or enough money for even minor surgery.

I've [read](http://www.naturalnews.com/029126_birth_control_papaya.html) a tsp of papaya seeds a day can make a guy practically infertile (reversible), and submerging one's testicles in hot water 45 minutes a day helps (who's got that kind of time?).

I'm thinking of getting an alum bar for my dude as a grad gift. I don't have a lot of money, but I still wanted to get him something neat.

1) he's complained about the discomfort of shaving before (razor burn, dryness, etc.) 

2) people seem generally positive about alum bars for dealing with these discomforts. 

3) I don't think he knows they exist, and, I think it's pretty neat that they do. They seem like a simple problem solver, if they do in fact work. He's pretty minimalist with his products. Nothing beyond staying clean/smelling great as far as I know. 

4) I thought, what's wrong with a guy getting to feel pampered once in a while?

I'm just afraid it'd be interpreted wrongly (e.g., ""I wish you would shave more"") or would just be looked at as a weird gift (e.g., the dreaded ""Oh....thanks).""

Our culture is filled with icons like James Bond, whose smoothness cannot possibly be matched, or Clint Eastwood's ""The Stranger"" who did stuff like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYgC10cVfqg). The media portrays ""manly men"" as those who can either smooth talk a girl into having sex with him or talk down to a girl until she has sex with him. 

For most people, the bar/club/pickup scene is reserved for that kind of behavior. Those men who try to act like this outside of those venues are labeled as creeps. Hell, even in them.

So how many others of you have tried to act like this to attract women and were shrugged off or called a creep? How many of you would NEVER act this way?

I'm going out with a girl, let's call her Sally. My friend is Ray. We all went to high school together, Sally and I are at a state school together, and Ray is at community college. He is planning on getting is associates at the end of fall semester and going to said state school next spring. I was planning on asking to get an apartment with him for the next fall after that, and Sally started having an anxiety attack. She does have PTSD from childhood, but she's got better control over it now. But when I told her about this proposed plan, she started to freak out. I've known Ray has always used Sally as a confidante as he's always been the type that never talks about anything with anyone, but Sally is the kind of person people open up to. So apparently he had told her that he had taken advantage of women, ways that made Sally feel very uncomfortable, even to the same extent as the thought of sleeping in the same building as him, even with me being there. Apparently even throughout high school he had said things to her that reminded her of someone who also took advantage of her, but to my knowledge he has never laid a finger on her. I couldn't press Sally to talk about what he did exactly as she kept having anxiety attacks at the mention of it.

What I want to know is how to deal with this situation personally. I have ruled out living with Ray, but I also think someone needs to talk to him, or at least beat some sense into him. I'd rather not involve his parents (he doesn't listen to them anyway) unless it turns out he had done some awful stuff, in which case I might or might not want to get the law involved. But I don't know what he's done, or how often, all I know is that he's done something wrong and hurt other people, at the very least Sally. How should I proceed with him? I feel a little responsible for him, as I was always the one that told people that despite the fact that he took jokes too far he really wasn't an asshole. He probably won't tell me anything unless I press him, and even then it's almost guaranteed I won't get the full story. But I also feel like some justice or reprimanding needs to get done. So guys, what do I do? How should I handle this scenario? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The thing is, when I see a good-looking, unknwown (as in not knowing personally, even if I get to see her everyday, like a cashier) girl at a place, somewhere (anywhere), I'll think things at the moment like ""She looks nice"" ""Maybe the sex is good with her"" and even later, but I won't feel any sexual intent coming or think about it. Whereas with a girl I get to know more, things are different, I can perfectly (depending on the girl too) see myself do naughty things with her.

A situationnal example, if I could sleep with two girls, one I don't know but beautiful, and another one I know but I find less attractive, I'd go with the second one.
When I'm with my friends that talk passionately about a girl X or Y (that none of us know on a personnal level) that they'd have sex with it and all, and ask me what I think of it, I'm like ""Meh why not ?"" Maybe I'm just meeker than them haha.
As for porn, I find myself really detached from it. I don't particularly invest in it, for me it's really like objects interacting and a means to relief oneself.

**Background:** Just when I thought I had my life figured out, I met a girl a week ago at my friend's party. I was immediately attracted to her. I spent much of my time getting to know her, seeing if my interest was reciprocated, but she was shy and throwing mixed signals. After getting rather drunk, I confessed my interest right to her on my way out (at the time I was too drunk to remember, and she was sober). 

When I returned to my friend's house the following morning to help clean up after the party, she and my friend were the only two still around. Coincidence? No. Sober this time, I had considered asking her to coffee, but resolved just to leave because historically I've talked myself out of forming relationships for a few years now (the reasons I will elaborate on later). However, she stopped me and told me what I said the previous night. I paused for a moment, then revealed that I'd like to take her to coffee that afternoon. She agreed. Turns out we really get along and despite her shy nature, we have a kind of chemistry together, a mutual attraction I haven't felt in a long time, and I have since experienced a lot of mixed feelings. I've since spent the last week communicating with her through voice, text, and email and all seems well (I don't live near her at the moment, but we're from the same area).

Yet to further preface the questions I have for the OneY community, here's some more background. I'm a 22 year old college senior. I have only had one real relationship in my entire life, one that lasted 2.5 years and ultimately wasn't a good arrangement because my ex-girlfriend and I didn't agree on a lot of core values and other qualities (politics, religion, health, etc). That ended almost 3 years ago, and I've only been on one date since (though I did hook up and lose my virginity to another girl 2 months ago; that's another matter but it's over and done with). In short, I have little experience with the opposite sex, but even greater doubts about relationships/monogamy in general.

**TL;DR** Met a girl with potential, but skeptical about relationships. Details below.

---

So, a couple questions / concerns that would really help me out if addressed... I'd love to hear from some older / experienced men here if possible.

Ever since my last and only relationship failed, I've been very critical about relationships. I'm skeptical about the existence of true love, the idea of marriage, and whether monogamy actually works. I'm concerned about the waste of time, money, and energy failed relationships result in, the regret, the risk, and whether any of it is worth it. Sure, I've met plenty of married couples in my life, but even my own parents (married 25 years) never seem to live out my idea of a healthy marriage. In fact, I've seen more failed marriages than healthy ones, and that's [what the statistics say](http://www.divorcerate.org/), too.

Of course, there's a personal side to it also: I've struggled with selfishness, an eating disorder, depression, low self-worth for awhile now, all of which have hindered my ability to seek and receive relationships. Sometimes I think I barely know how to love myself, how would I know how to love someone else? I've had difficultly deciding between freedom / loneliness and companionship / conflict, which seem to be the main pros and cons between being single the rest of my life and being married. But make no mistake, any serious relationship only goes one of two ways: either you break up on some terms, or you get married (and even what happens after that is ambiguous). I have high standards for myself and others, and tend to be *very* independent, thus I find it difficult to justify spending time and money on a relationship. 

Moreover, I feel like all it takes is to discover one deal-breaker, one quality that can completely turn you off to a potential love interest. For example, this girl that I met said that she wants kids someday—I've historically felt that I *never* want kids. See, in my mind, that means I should completely cut things off now: why go through the motions with her if we're only going to disagree? If we were to move along with the relationship, I'd likely find myself committing the [sunk cost fallacy](http://www.skepdic.com/sunkcost.html), like I did in the past. The problem is, I can tend to be an idealist, an optimist, eager to believe that I can find love, intimacy, and companionship. But rationally, there are some hurdles I simply haven't conquered yet.

Well, I've beat the dead horse enough. If I think of anything else, I'll bring it up. Here's some more questions to get this thread rolling...

* Would you advise me to proceed with my new love interest?

* Is marriage pointless? Is marriage a farce? Is the idea that you can actually spend a lifetime with a soul-mate likely or even practical? 

* Can marriages succeed or fail? If so, why? 

* What's the point of any relationship outside of friendship? Commitment? Companionship? Intimacy? 

* What's the most important part of forming an opinion on relationships?

* How do you handle regret / sense of failure from past relationships? 

* Do you love your wife? How do you keep your marriage healthy? What lead you to marriage?

My questions to all of you is what tact, if any, do I need to consider because she is a co-worker who I will continue to see and work with regardless of outcomes.

My experience and knowledge of self tell me that I should just ask her out and not worry too much about the work factor knowing that I have enough character to navigate this successfully no matter what.

He seemed eager enough, went and got a condom, and came back. But he couldn't keep it up. I tried helping with a blowjob, but I wanted him to keep going onto actual intercourse so I got him excited again, and went to (putting this as bluntly as possible) put his dick in me. Again, went down to a semi. Tried helping with my hands, but again he lost it when we went for insertion. Anyways, I have questions for those of you that might know what he was going through.

1. I felt pretty undesirable by the end of our hooking up, is it usually something the girl is doing that makes you lose your erection?
2. Is it usually nerves? If so, is there something a girl can do to help ease any dick anxiety?
3. I didn't want him to be embarrassed because shit happens, so I didn't really say anything about the whole ordeal. Should I approach him directly or is this too sensitive of a topic?

I can't explain it very well but I will try.

I've been self-conscious about it for a while, and it's mostly because I'm constantly hearing guys say how much they love big tits. It's not like I want them to stop enjoying large breasts, I'm just disappointed that I don't have the ability to seduce men with my chest the way many women do. 

I've had a boyfriend for a year now, and he tells me that he loves my breasts. Once, during a small pity party (I don't have those too often), I asked him if he actually liked small boobs or if he was just saying that to make me feel better about myself. He told me that he used to love large breasts, but after realizing how much he liked/loved me, his interest changed. 

Is this possible -- for a man to go from liking large breasts to preferring small ones? Are there guys out there who would shun big tits for little ones? It just seems impossible to me, I can't fathom it. 

I'm really sorry if this post comes across as rude, offensive, accusing, or presumptuous....that isn't what I intended. I'd just like to know whether it's actually possible for a man to prefer an A cup over a C+.

There are countless threads about women being raped, then a trillion issues surrounding it from victim blaming, to telling men not to rape women. 

Well, I dawned on me that no matter how much you talk about rape, it's not going to stop. It's not like crime will stop merely by telling people not to commit crimes. I could sit here all day and talk about how bad murder is, and yet, someone will be murdered today. The same applies to rape, I can talk about how bad rape is, but the fact of the matter is someone, somewhere is going to get raped today. 

And tomorrow someone will get murdered, and the day after someone will commit arson, battery, uttering and publishing, DUI, Possession w/ Intent to distribute, the list goes on forever. 

As much as reddit seems to focus on rape, does anyone ever look at the bigger picture and see a shit ton of crimes are being committed every minute, and rape is just another drop in the bucket. 

My question to all you men is simple, is the human race savage by nature? It's not like we as humans, take days off of commiting crimes. It's not like the United States can go a 24 hour period without crime, so surely there must be some inherent nature toward violence and crime. We all know rape is not going to stop, we all know murder is not going to stop, so what does that say about our species as a whole?

I was out on a quadruple date with my girlfriend and all of her friends (I had met them before; we're all friendly but I'm still the outsider). She and one of the males then began getting into what amounted to an insulting match. It started out playfully enough at first...she made fun of his sandals, he made fun of her eyebrows, and so forth. After a short time, it escalated and I could tell she was getting mad. Neither of them relented. I threw up a couple of comments directed at both of them, trying to keep things light, but it didn't stop then. Eventually it fizzled and they made up, as they are old friends and it's not the first time they got into an insult match.

In hindsight, I feel as though I should have stood up for her more directly. I should have directed comments to her friend, telling him to stop but in a light way, not make it serious but show that I was there for her. In the moment, I still felt like very much the outsider and was confused, and I wasn't certain if I even had the right to step in between something that involved her and close friends. Now, though, I feel as though she and her friends will get the idea that I can't defend her. I came away from it feeling like less of a man. Am I justified in this? What do all of you think?

I also have to say that my girlfriend is very outspoken. She can handle herself for sure, and at no time was she at the mercy of her friend's words. It's just the fact that she was getting flustered by them that concerned me.

-Dracula, SOTN



I do not identify as a traditionally masculine man.  Though I am male, straight, and I enjoy certain traditionally masculine activities, throughout my life I have never been comfortable as 'a guy.'  My friends and I, growing up in a tiny town of 3000, struggled to find outlets for expression in an environment that held little opportunity for alternative extracurricular activities.  I played football, ran track, and swam.  But I also ran our tiny schools drama club, and was an enthusiastic artist and am possibly the only person in my entire class who truly enjoyed reading Moby Dick.  I also love cute animals, something I am somewhat ashamed to admit.

As I grew older, I moved into a larger town for college, then to the big city post-grad.  Since then I have found acceptance infrequent, and the friends I do have I hold very dear.  I was largely unprepared for the real world, and much to the irritation of other men in my life I simply am unable to enjoy watching sports or tuning cars.  My hobbies are just not as widely appreciated, it seems, especially in sports media where I work.

I feel that I, and others like me, have no place in this modern world.  I am not feared or respected, and most women are not attracted to my brand of 'masculinity.'  I'm not an assertive man unless pressed, and I'm not intimidating either.  All I ask is that people accept me for who I am, and respect my opinions on important matters.

Still, I was happy simply being me.  I didn't consider my attitude a threat to anyone or something to frown upon.  Now, however, I've been a Redditor for four years.  I've seen this community change dramatically.  Though not necessarily always pro-academia, with popularity came anti-intellectual riff raf and individuals who argue that I am a weak person- a beta male to the world's aggressive, ultra-sexual alphas. 

Personally, I find it offensive that someone might hold that opinion- that my gender or sex pressed upon me certain expectations.  That I am not an individual unless held up to some arbitrary standard of sexual pedigree.  In school, I found comfort in academia, in post-modern philosophy and even in *feminism*.  These were worlds in which your sex didn't matter, only your worth as a person.  I still appreciate the time I spent studying critical theory in school and occasionally write about it to this day.

That belief, that we are not the sum of our sex or even representatives of it, is an attitude that I find undeniably true.  We are individuals.  I am not just a man, but a person, ruled not through theoretical oppression or conspiratorial forces, but by the choices and mistakes I make.  I do not ask myself 'how can I become a better man?' but instead, 'how can I become a better person?' 

How can you ever be happy if you judge yourself based upon imaginary ideals like 'masculine strength?'  Yet here, even on this subreddit, we see so often men in distress, struggling against imagined expectations like promiscuity or energy.  Certain attitudes in many subreddits are simply destructive and uninviting to those of us who are not traditionally aligned.  Those attitudes do more damage to men then any exterior force.  If we cannot accept each other as we are, and thus accept ourselves, we will only continue to fall into a confused irrelevancy in the modern world.  We will continue to have anxieties and fall to imaginary pressures, striving to be an imagined ideal that probably never even existed to begin with.

A man is more than his twig and berries, and more than what sports magazines push at us.  We're far too diverse a group to lump together, and in that I say we stop holding each other to masculine standards.  A man is only one side of a large, complicated element of modern living.  To me, a man is just the beginning of the conversation, not the end.  It's just a word I use to describe my gender, not my beliefs, attitudes, opinions, or preferences.  What do you think the modern man is?",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,False,,,True,t3_1ajp3p,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1ajp3p/oney_what_is_a_man_to_you_its_my_cakeday_so_i/,

1358730605.0,33,self.OneY,16yl2f,I'd like a bit of a conversation with fellow young guys in committed relationships,44,11,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/16yl2f/id_like_a_bit_of_a_conversation_with_fellow_young/,"I'll leave the definitions of 'young', 'committed' and 'relationship' up to you, I'm not here to judge. And a quick disclaimer, I don't know how or if any of this applies to gay people, so I've left it out lest I make a fool of myself, feel free to fill in below if you know better, leaving people out isn't at all my intention.

For my part, I'm 20, and have been in the same relationship for nearly three-and-a-half years. It's not always been easy, especially now we're at different universities, but it's too good to just chuck away. So here's what my problem is, and I expect plenty of people will sympathise. It's quite well documented; as men, the general expectation is that we'll go out, get laid, dominate social situations and chase women around until one manages to cast some sort of spell on us and turn us into husbands and fathers. Or something.

So when she gets there early and you skip straight past the first bit, or at least most of it, then the media, the conversations you overhear in public, the guy having unreasonably loud drunk sex in the dorm room next to you, they'll all add up to instil a sense of having 'missed out' on something. Make you think you should throw away your fantastic relationship for something that, in all probability, you wouldn't be very good at. I mean, I know I'd be shitty at the dating game, my skill set lies in being a kick-ass boyfriend. And yet the feeling persists. And it doesn't help if your friends are keen to find any opportunity to accuse you of being whipped.

You wonder if you should break up - you can always get back together later, right? And if you can't, she popped up out of nowhere, another one is bound to, right?

Clearly the thoughts of a crazy person, but we're not as rational a species as we'd like to think. If you're lucky, she's got the brains and the sanity in the relationship and doesn't take it too personally, talks you down and you feel drained and guilty from time to time, and hope that the crazy will pass with time.

So here's what I've learned to do at times like this: I've collected a small set of positive portrayals of relationships, especially ones showing young couples succeeding long-term against the odds. I want to share these, and get back any that you might have, so we can collect them together, share experiences, and above all, bring ourselves back down to earth.

So, mine include:

* Tim Minchin; he's an Australian comedian and musician. He's 37 now, and has written this [aggressively rationalistic portrayal of relationships](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeZMIgheZro). 17 is how old he was when he got together with the woman who is now his wife.

* Many say it's jumped the shark a bit these days, I think, but Lily and Marshall's relationship in *How I Met Your Mother* has helped me a surprising amount. Slightly trashy sitcoms are fair game.

* I don't *think* they're internationally popular, but Bloc Party have come out with a couple of soppy-as-fuck soul-baring songs that speak to me; [""Truth""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1CSMdDIRGg) and [""I Still Remember""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-9IgWD36A). The latter is more about lost love, but aren't the consequences of that what we need to remind ourselves of?

* Finally, another one about lost-love, [""She's A Flame""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHpwZ3KWV0Y) by my personal *ohmygodsoindieguys* band, Canterbury

I like to remind myself of things like this on those occasions when things spill over; a little positive reinforcement goes a long way and I hope I can share that with some people here, because I firmly believe an awesome relationship is not worth throwing away for the sake of the vague, probably vain, hope of lots of casual sex. Break up for a real reason.

Anyway, thanks for reading, I hope we can help each other.

Me, I'm *intensely* focused on how the girl is feeling at that exact moment. Maybe it's because I've grown up watching very female-friendly porn and fetishized the female orgasm, or because I've grown up in a misogynistic culture and listened to the rabid, vocal feminists a little too much, or maybe it's because I think too much, but I've built up this image in my head of a woman experiencing pleasure, and I literally can't enjoy myself unless this mental construct is enjoying *her*self. I only cum when the girl cums when I'm watching porn, and in the very few instances where I've had sex, I've been so incredibly concerned about my partner's feelings that the instant I begin to think about her pleasure being tied to the strength of my erection (during sex), I inevitably start losing my erection. :/

What worries me is how *deeply ingrained* this attachment to a female body experiencing pleasure is in me. I *need* 'her' to enjoy herself in order to enjoy myself, and I literally feel like the things she says, the way she moans, and the emotions she experiences are the things that *I* should be doing, but can't let myself because either I'm too embarrassed or uncomfortable doing so, or because if I start thinking that *I'm* actually enjoying *my*self, then I instinctively hold back and lose the feeling... probably because I've trained myself to respond to pleasure by killing it - otherwise I might cum too soon or someone will notice that I'm being emotional and insult me for being unmanly or something. &gt;_&lt;

Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? Or is it weird that I'm picturing sex entirely from the female perspective... so much so that I often experience a sense of 'wrongness' in my abdomen, as if I should actually have female genitalia instead, and I even get a sort of phantom pain in my penis, as if my body were trying to kill it...

For what it's worth, I'm pretty damned certain that I'm genetically male, and I'm definitely interested in women and don't feel like I need gender-reassignment. My orgasms are pathetic, though ...no better than a decent stretch... and I have *never* felt comfortable being with a woman.

When looking at a girl, especially pretty one, I feel guilty, like just next animal from a herd of jocks gazing at her with their tongues out.

I am aware that in fact there's nothing I'm ""supposed"" to do. I don't have to have a girlfriend (or a sex life), however it seems like dating and being in relationships is something people do. Just wanted to know if there's anything wrong with me (or ""too right"").

For some perspective: I've met two (2) new girls in the past year. Invited both of them on dates. First one flaked, the second one just owed me a coffee, we didn't really have any interests in common but ended up having pleasant conversation. Also, I'm 23, studying at technical university in Europe.

Though this isn't necessarily an issue related to being male, it's a personal one and I'd like your advice/thoughts.

Lately, I've been feeling really down about my friends. I just feel like I lack  a connection with any of them. They like me, and I like them, but there's nothing there. I have one friend who I really enjoy talking to (a female), two depending on the day (a male). Why do you think I don't feel connected? I'm not dying to talk to them (in fact, the amount of texting I typically do has halved recently) or really see them besides a few of them.. So the relationships just feel meaningless. I don't feel like they can make me feel better if I'm upset, so I don't tell them that much. Now let me give some background on myself..

I'm a senior in high school. I'm gonna major in music performance next fall in college. So, I love classical music. I despise any kind of ""music"" written today because it's so simple and stupid to me, both the lyrics and the music. I also love video games and tennis. I generally see myself as a pretty good person with good morals. I have always cared for my friends deeply and tried to help with their problems.

None of my friends love classical, but a few really enjoy video games and tennis, and I befriend people with mostly similar morals.

I'm also pretty judgmental.. I can see my friend do one little thing and I think a little less of them. Like lately, I realized that one of my friends is just not very smart. And it makes me not want to talk to them because they lack depth. And personally, I think a bit lower of people who listen to non-classical music. 

However, my friends can be very crappy. The person who's been the closest to being a male friend was really only like that for a summer. I have to beg him to talk to me about things and even to hang out sometimes. He even has told me he doesn't consider me his best friend, or even a good friend sometimes. And he gets mad relatively easily and hurts the relationship, by not trusting me for a bit, for example. Nearly all of my friends always make fun of me and don't respect me, particularly one girl. It upsets me sometimes when I'm always getting laughed at or undermined by ""friends.""

Umm.. I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I'm trying to give all the info I can. I'm sick of high school. I generally consider the majority of students to be idiots who are always getting drunk, high, or having sex and partying. I feel so far above them it's not even funny. However, some teachers have agreed with me on this, so it's not entirely just me.

And lastly, if you think this has anything to with anything, all my ""good friends"" are girls besides one. I've never had many guy friends because I don't fit at all into the male stereotype. I hate sports (minus tennis), could care less about cars, etc. I'm straight, but that kind of stuff just doesn't interest me.

So what do you think? Is it that I just don't have good friends? Am I not doing the right things in the relationships? Is it because we are too dissimilar? Am I too judgmental/snobby? 

Ask me any questions that you think would help you answer.

Tl; dr-- I am not happy with barely any of my friends. I can't emotionally bond with them. Why? Am I too judgmental, or are they bad friends?",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,False,,,True,t3_swcme,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/swcme/empty_friendships/,

(Lots of text) I am a Grade 11 Canadian high school student. My dad shows many traits of narcissistic personality disorder. He tends to be very 'in your face', and he always has to be in control of things. When I am at home with my siblings, and he isn't home from work yet, and we hear the garage door open (the garage is below the family room) we instantly put whatever we are playing away, as he gets angry. My parents are divorced, and have been since May of 2006, my mom is re-married to a very nice man, and my parents have joint custody (every second week with my dad). My mom booked my drivers license test, and I told my dad, and he got angry, and started yelling, and belittling me, some of his (most memorable) words from the conversation are: ""Chalk another one up in the book of disappointments (for going to my mom)"" and ""I CONTROL YOUR LIFE, NOT YOU, OR YOUR MOM, ME."" He also plans a lot of stuff on weekends I'm supposed to be with my mom. I have the opportunity to move in full-time with my mom, but telling him that would create a lot of hatred on his part, and he would stop paying my high school tuition (private school), my musical instrument rental fees, and confiscate a lot of stuff (my laptop, camera, phone, saxophone). This is more recent stuff. He doesn't allow me to have a social life, and has kept me and my siblings doing the exact same things, like sports, and activities. I didn't think he was sheltering me, but when I first got into high school, I was a social outcast, because my dad had been sheltering me. I have 4 other siblings. I hate him a lot. Yes, I understand hate is a strong word, exactly why I used it. I need advice.

EDIT: Some of the material stuff I can live without (phone, camera, etc.) but I need my laptop and my saxophone for my studies. He's also emotionally abusive, (ex., I failed a math test in Senior 9[year 9] and forged a signature. He yelled at me (*lots*) and I began crying. I hadn't cried since my grandfathers death five years prior, mostly poker faced everything. He also insists on having ""five-minute family meetings"" which end up being him 'roasting' my mom for being a drunk (she has maybe a glass of wine a week) and ends up being an hour-and-a-half long. I don't have the courage to move out.

EDIT: EDIT: He has also banned certain (harmless)video games from the house (read: *Minecraft*) for no reason, other than he can't controll us from playing. He also had me grounded for having one of my friends over for a Lord of the Rings marathon. He's also been racist towards me (I'm part aboriginal on my mom's side)and said he hoped the impure blood in you has been purified.

I've got something at the base of my shaft. Like, a bubble. I don't have an STD. I know that for a fact.

At first I thought it was a pimple, but now I think its an ingrown hair.

Anything touching/rubbing on it stings just enough to be annoying.

What can I do about this? I'm 18 and I've never had anything else like this happen, so I'm not really sure what to do about it.

I should also made something clear -- I'm a bit of a bottom and so I generally prefer giving pleasure to getting it.  But I have known several straight men who also say that they find blowjobs boring.

I bring this up in r/oneY  because I feel that we, as men, have been conditioned to view blowjobs as the end-all-be-all event of the sexual spectrum.  If you're getting head, you're ahead, so to speak.

I dated this girl for 3 and a half years before we broke up. It's been almost 2 years now, but we're still pretty close friends, especially considering that she is friends with my friends as well. The past 3 months or so, her and one of my friends, I'll call him Alex, have been getting closer to each other. Hanging out more often together, stuff like that. Recently, she's been asking me and Alex to sleep over her house with her, which rubbed me the wrong way. The one time I did end up staying semi-late, they shared her bed together, and I slept in a chair. They have this thing where they wanna cuddle together all the time, but I don't want to join in because honestly, it's fucking weird for me. When me and Alex hang out, it's cool, nothing has changed, except he's always asking where she is. And then once we're with her, he changes and just hangs all over her, seems to get jealous when she talks/pays attention to anybody else, and really is just no fun to be around. When it's us 3, I feel like the third wheel. They don't talk to me, they ignore what I say. We do whatever Alex wants to do, no matter what. Last night, she invited me, Alex and two other friends over to barbecue. I told her to text me when she left work to meet up, which never happened. Instead, she picked up Alex and our friend, Teddy. It was snowing pretty bad last night so I finally texted her at around 8 to see if she still wanted to hang out. She told me it was really bad outside and I shouldn't drive in it. I come to find out that Alex and Teddy are sleeping over her house. Now, yes it bothered me, but the real thing came when my dad found out about it. My dad and I have a very close relationship, I open up to him about everything, he knows I've been kinda weary about the whole situation with her and Alex, and he understands why. He says something doesn't sound right. He talked to me last night and basically told me to watch myself. That I shouldn't hang out with these guys anymore, that the whole situation of them staying at their good friend's ex's house is pretty fucked up and wrong. I should mention that a few years back. I ended up developing serious trust issues with my friends. I was close to this kid, Richie, who became like my brother in every way possible. I never would've thought he would fuck me over. One day, he decided to send a picture of his dick to this same girl, and then deny it to my face when confronted about it, only for me to show him the texts on her phone from him. Ever since then, I realized that anybody is capable of anything and nobody can really be fully trusted. Maybe I'm overreacting, however, I can't help but keep my walls up and stay guarded to not get myself fucked over again. So I guess in closing, I'm asking what you guys think I should do? I've begun to think about what my dad told me last night and I do think he has a decent point. I would try to talk to Alex about it, but he's not the type of person who will listen. He gets mad and stops talking to you and then goes behind your back and shit talks you, it's happened before between me and him.

I just arrived in this subreddit and I already think it's a pretty neat place :D I'm hoping someone here can help me out... I'm in some real trouble :(  
  
Title says it all really... here's the situation... I'm 19 right now, and basically, over the past few years I've gotten pretty seriously feminist. A while ago I decided that it should really be the _default_ stance for everyone to start out at, and that gender equality is just as fundamental a fact as everything else I know about human beings... etc. and now I'm completely embracing of the feminist movement.  
  
But I cannot stand the fact that I am a man - somehow it's just abhorrent to me. It's so hard to explain, because I have no personal image of myself as anything other than male; I don't think I am trans- or bi- gendered (at least I don't _feel_ that way). It's not even a feeling of guilt; as long as I can remember I have felt pretty much the same way as I do now about women; I have never been 'sexist', as far as I recall. It was just a matter of contextualizing and verbalizing, slowly over these past few years, what I had always 'known'.  
  
I find myself reading through all the top posts in /r/feminisms and 2X, and, like any decent human being, I feel pain, sorrow, outrage at the suffering perpetrated against women constantly throughout human history (not just history...). But for some reason, this makes me feel anger toward myself. I hate myself, even; ugh, I feel so priveliged, like I don't deserve to be alive. It just hurts, a lot, and I don't know why.  
  
Re-reading that, I sound like a damned moron. To bedlamize this trainwreck even further (if 'bedlamize' is not already a word I'm totally coining it), I'm equally attracted (most of the time) to guys and girls... So it's not like I hate Men as a group...  
  
I harm myself over this sometimes. Fuck life.  
  
I really don't know what to do... Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Is it completely messed up for me to feel this way? I have no idea how this reflects on my gender identity. Am I... in the wrong body without even really knowing it yet...? ARGH I wish all this would just go away.  
  
I don't really know if I can even expect answers these questions; it just feels so messed up, so _wrong_ in my head. I guess I'm just looking for a friend really. Thanks for reading through the whole post. :)

I can sit down and pay attention, but I can never get rid of that nagging feeling that what I am watching is utterly pointless (to me at least). I can't care what team wins, or who is going to the finals, or what team gets which players. However, I'm not here rail against pro sports, but rather to ask why following sports seems to be hardwired into our modern idea of masculinity.

I understand that athletic prowess and physical strength are qualities that society encourages among males, but if that were the reason, wouldn't actually playing sports be more valued than simply being a spectator? I have no problem seeing how playing sports can be fulfilling. 

I have also been told that it indulges a sort of instinctual competitive drive in males. This could be true, but it seems odd that some males who are by all appearances not competitive at all still follow sports. And that even if you don't participate in the team rivalries, you are still expected to follow games.  

The most common explanation is that it is just a hobby, that helps people get through their years. I do not dispute that it is a hobby, I just want to know why it is the default hobby, and why this hobby in particular is intrinsic to how we define the ""masculine"".

I never really thanked this subreddit as a whole, so i'm doing it now: thank you. 

i'll try to keep this post brief. i'm 16 years old, will be a high school senior after this summer. I found the whole nofap and pornfree movement about a year and a half ago and have ever since been trying to rid myself of what I perceive to be an addiction to pornography. I believe i'm an addict because I compulsively resort to masturbating to porn when I'm extremely bored (I don't have ED, though). i've been able to go completely without it for the past few months since i've been busy with school, sports, and my social life, but now that i'm on summer vacation porn is slowly creeping back into my life. that's not what I want to talk about, though. 

while I plan to continue on my journey of freedom from porn, i'm at a loss for thoughts when it comes to masturbating (obviously without the aid of porn). since i'm in high school, I probably won't be having regular sex anytime soon. my initial plan was to stop masturbating completely. at this point in time, it's been almost three months since i've last masturbated to orgasm and never doing it again seems appealing. I feel better and more productive when I don't do it, and I always feel guilty after doing it. 

am I being stubborn in placing this restriction on myself? I tend to restrain myself in other areas of my life, too, like nutrition (strict paleo diet), video games (I don't play them very much anymore), facebook, etc. I know moderation is key for almost everything in life, but am I moderating too much?

I went and tried jockey and hanes brands, medium and small sizes (jockey doesnt even do small), regular and slim fit. Every. Single. Pair. PUSHED my penis and balls between my legs. The only way I was able to get any actual support was to take a Hanes small and pull it up past my belly button. And this was an uncomfortably tight fit too, but uncomfortably loose on the junk. Given 2-3 hours my junk would be right back down.

Literally every model on the covers of the packaging has every little wrinkle photoshopped out of the underwear, and every single model is wearing a cup. Was I supposed to be wearing some sort of a jockstrap or something?

I luckily found some actual jockey boxers which I think are a slightly updated version (full cut?) of what I currently have. No weird seams running down both sides of the butt, just 2 boxer halves, exactly the way regular pants are made, with plenty of room. Basically the closest thing to a loin cloth without being a loin cloth. 55% cotton, 45% polyester, ""easy care"" blend.
-------------------------------
EDIT: thanks for your support, guys. Just wanted to give you a quick update. I'm going to try out boxer briefs due to their supposed god-like comfort. I'll probably grab them tomorrow or wednesday.

I am having some extreme difficulty finding some affordable boxers. I think the market is trending away from them because of slim fit jeans, but I still wear loose clothing because I sit around all day and need that freedom of movement.

I have some jockey boxers (55 cotton, 45 polyester) thats my favorite. HUGE leg holes, plenty of freedom of movement. They are quite baggy but not overly so.

I like looser clothing because it is comfy on my manly parts. With whitey tighties and boxer briefs, bikini style, and sports underwear, no matter what ive worn (up to 10 bucks per pair for sports underwear) my junk slowly gets pushed between my thighs and then my balls get squeezed all day. I cant be re-adjusting every 30 minutes. With boxers i can simply stand up, or keep my legs spread and i get a bit of motion.

So I've tried Hanes and the leg holes are too small and they try to ride up. Since the leg holes are always too small (even though waist fits) they simply shimmy down. Also, bending or sitting in any way makes them scrunch into a thong like structure.

Ive tried Croft and Barrow. Those shits were expensive and 100% cotton. They were great for about 2 weeks. now they are shrunken at less than a couple months old. Now no matter what i do those are permanent thongs.

I am looking for something that is basically basketball shorts, but very thin boxer type material. And while I understand that boxers like this would cost more than the kind that are 15 bucks for 5 pairs that come in a plastic bag, I'm not OK spending 20 bucks for cloth that will be rubbing against my sweaty balls and dirty asshole. I'd prefer it to be around 5-12 bucks, and that is justifiable assuming the underwear lasts a while. The current 4 bucks/pair jockey underwear I have has been going strong since january of 2011, if thats any indicator.",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,1370902934.0,,,True,t3_1g0ibb,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1g0ibb/underwear_boxers_advice_needed/,

As a result, I have little to no confidence with women during regular social interactions. I tend to be a blunt person, straight to the point etc., I'm not sure if that's the problem, but I can't really change who I am that fundamentally if it is :( Common interests seem to be hard to find regularly because of the above problems.

This occurred in January of this year. I'm an insomniac so I'm prescribed Xanex. One night I was up until 4am trying desperately to sleep, as I had to wake up for school in about two hours. I desperately took a dose of my Xanex, which I rarely ever do as it's proven not to help me when needed. I still couldn't sleep so I went to school and then to the ex's house afterward. We dated up until March 1st, so we were dating at this time. We laid down on her couch after some time and I feel asleep, however, I slipped into some odd state of sleep paralysis to where I couldn't move anything, not even open my eye lids, but I could feel and hear everything happening around me. 

At some point, my ex picked up my arm. I thought nothing of this at the time as I expected her to just be putting it around her or something of that nature. However, that's not what happened. Instead she started controlling my arm and hand and made me finger her and she started rubbing up against my groin as well. We had been sexually active for about 9 months at this time, but I've ALWAYS had issues sleeping so she knew she had crossed a boundary when she did this. I woke up some point later with clear evidence of what had been done, but she denied it for about two hours. She confessed what she had done later that night through text as I kept pressing her. 

At this point, let's pretend I'm a girl, and that my boyfriend had done this to me. Before you think this is something I wanted, consider if this had happened to a girl. Let's try not to be biased and sexist about this. 

Anyway, I told her I was extremely upset, she had no explanation. She told me the only way our relationship could work after that is if I pretended it didn't happen. I was in love, so I did pretend. Two days later you could already tell how much it effected me. I took her out to a nice restaurant in fear that she would dump me (because I somehow thought this whole thing was my fault.) I couldn't speak to her the entire time, she pointed out how awkward I was being and I just couldn't come up with any words to say. I tried being my old self from then on but it was phony, and eventually she lost interest and cheated on me in the following couple of months. It's been a little over two months since she's broken up with me today. About a month ago, I started piecing back together what had happened to me. Analyzed how badly her taking advantage of me effected me. I talked to a police officer at my school, and threw this whole scenario at him as a ""hypothetical"". It was so complex he had to make some calls to lawyers to figure out what such a thing would be considered. He told me the minimum punishment someone would get for such a thing would be sexual assault. After 2 months of her ignoring me, she replied to a text I sent her when I brought up that she had raped me.

She's threatening to say I'm harassing her if I try to press charges, so I told her I wouldn't press charges if she'd just admit to me exactly what she did, and so she did. She also, in this process, implied that it wasn't the first time she's done such a thing to me. Now, I have proof of her confessing to it when it happened back in January through text records, and a few current texts saved. A good lawyer and I think I have a good case against her. 

The issue now, however is that I'm terrified of what I will have to say to my parents. I know I'll have to admit that I've been sexually active, but the worst part is that I think they'll deny what I say to be possible since I'm a guy. They're racist, and fairly intolerant of such progressive things like a guy pressing rape/sexual assault charges against a girl. They're the only thing standing in my way of getting my justice. What should I do?

TL;DR: Ex forced my hand to finger her while I was essentially paralyzed and my parents are intolerant and regressive so I'm afraid to press charges.

recently my wife also joined the fire department as a firefighter. She is our only female firefighter
although there are 8 other female medical responders in our station that started with us about 2 years ago

With the addition of so many women, it became obvious that there was a unique challenge on the fireground that
wasn't much of an issue before. Bathrooms. For men, if they need to take a leak it was never much of an issue to steal a moment and find a discreet place to get it done.
For women, its much more challenging to find a spot and it requires the removal of their protective clothing, which isn't fun at sub zero temps.

As a result our cheif decided to use our fundraising money to purchase and equip an old transit bus into a mobile bathroom/rehab facility for firefighters to be able to hit the jon or get their vitals checked after stenuously exerting themselves inside the burning building etc. This is where the female medical responders would station while on scene.

To me I could see some sexism here, I mean why are we spending thousands of dollars (approx 50 grand) just because women have a harder time peeing? 
But I decided I was ok with it because it also benifits the guys and if it helps level the playing field for the women, and makes their time at scene easier they cant complain right? At the very least it shows we are inclusive to these women and willing to consider their needs as members of the team. Doesnt it?

Well, my wife finds some sexism in all this as well. How dare our cheif single out the women and suggest they need
extra help on the fireground. He's just doing all this so ""the women will stop complaining"" she says with sarcasm.
It's all an exercise of chauvinism as far as she's concerned, just another (expensive) representation of male priveledge in our world.

I don't need to go into the gory details - let's just say hanging out with me isn't always for the delicately minded.

I'm not ignorant of that. I spent a lot of time inside on a computer in middle and high school, those prime socializing years. I've done a lot of catching up in college because I like feeling comfortable around people. Like, people are life, agoraphobia is a drag.

So I asked my dad what he thought. There are two big points I took away from the conversation that I think y'all would benefit from/find interesting. These are heavily paraphrased.

* ""You can be harsh with the truth. Sure, it's a skill to be able to see things a different way, but you have to think of that as one tool in your toolbox. That's your hammer. You don't want to always pull out the hammer - conversations aren't nails. You want to build up to that, after establishing a base of trust and goodwill. Then, people will be open to hearing the more shocking things you have to say.""

* ""Girls will laugh at those jokes. But really what they're looking for is a gentleman.""

The first part is I think just solid advice. The second piece of advice I thought would be interesting to bring here to talk about. I think there are lots of ways to approach it:

What is a gentleman? What does being a gentleman mean to you? What does it say about being a man, especially today? Does that feel constrictive? Do ladies really prefer these gentlemen?

Throwaway account. I was just wondering what your thoughts were on dating someone with oral herpes (HSV1) when the other partner is disease free. She told me yesterday night, right before we were about to have sex that she had oral herpes. This surprised me a bit but I tried my best to play it cool and told her that we should wait on the sex until I can look into this a little more. 

I did a lot of research and I learned that oral herpes is not a big deal and that close to 60% of the population has the disease. But on the other hand obviously, I'd rather not have the disease. We've only been on 3 dates so far and she seems like a great person with whom I can possibly see myself in a relationship with. But to tell you the truth, I can't decide if it's worth the risk. I'm not sure if ending a possible relationship just due to the fact that she has oral herpes is a reasonable thing to do. Also, I'd feel super bad if I told her ""I don't want to date you because you have oral herpes"" when she was brave enough to tell me in the first place before we had sex. 

So should I look for someone else since we've only been on 3 dates, or should I just go for it? I'd really like to hear you guys' opinions. Thank you. 

**Update 1:** I really appreciate everyone's thoughts (positive of negative) on this issue. I really do. 
Many people say it's not a big deal. I agree 100%, BUT, for obvious reasons, I'd like to avoid getting the virus as much as possible. We've only been on 3 short dates and our time spent together is minimal, thus I don't know her THAT well. My question is, do you guys think it's worth it to risk getting the oral herpes virus just for the possibility that this will turn into a great relationship? Or should I just look for someone else that is hopefully, HSV1 free?

I recently spent some time in a hospital without access to razor.  But now that I'm out, I feel kind of attached to the soft, fine hair on my calves and the rakish little tufts in my armpits.  My skin is very delicate, which means irritation and ingrowns when I shave/wax my armpits and pubic hair, and slightly translucent, which means you can see the roots of shaved hair under my skin (and a sort of blue marbling of veins... but that's another story).

So it's convenient for me, and it makes me feel kind of sexy and animal, like I should be wearing only a silk scarf and a musk and patchouli perfume that's bottled in voluptuous purple glass.  Only problem is, if the majority of men are disgusted by female body hair, I think it'll be difficult to keep on rolling down the 'feelin' sexy' highway.

This is, I find, a lose-lose situation to be in - You can do one of three options:  
1) Keep walking at the pace you're going (same pace as her) - looks bad, like you're following her home, and makes her incredibly uneasy.  
2) Slow down so as not to cause her alarm and make her think you're a rapist - looks like you're trying to hide away in the shadows. Also, you spend more time in the cold.   
3) You speed up to pass her and show you mean no harm - She notices you speed up and catch up to her, makes it look like you're about to attack.

1370882216.0,30,self.OneY,1g1xdq,I've been dealing with phimosis for years and I think I've got it figured out. Maybe my experience will help others.,45,15,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/1g1xdq/ive_been_dealing_with_phimosis_for_years_and_i/,"Hi, I'm an alt of a redditor. I suffer from phimosis, brought on by scarring from ... well, sex. It started about 8 years ago and got to the point (a few times) where even masturbation was uncomfortable. What's phimosis? It's when you get scar tissue on the phimotic ring ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridged_band)) near the head of your penis. It can make sex painful, especially if you get a tear during sex. Ouch! It's a lot like getting a split lip from chapped lips.

Anyway, first, I'm not a Dr. **You should talk to a Dr**. You'll need some betamethasone dipropionate, so that will mean a trip to the doc. If your doc tells you that you need circumcision, don't believe him. Although a frenuloplasty may help. Anyway, get the BMD ointment (ointment works better than cream) and put that on a few times a week. Put on a healthy amount, I usually use about a teaspoon at least. 

I found that the BMD only helped so much though and I needed to stretch that phimotic ring out. I've tried a lot of things. There are commercial products out there to help with this problem (haven't tried those). I don't think you need that. All you really need is something to apply gentle outward pressure on the phimotic ring for a couple of hours per week. After a few weeks it'll be even less than that.

You can do this with your fingers but I found it to be a real hassle and wanted something better. So, I **made my own phimotic ring stretcher**.

[Here's a set of pics that show how.](http://imgur.com/a/88wgg#0) All you really need is some ""friendly plastic"", which you can get on Amazon. I use the beads since they seem like a better deal.

I think the pics are pretty self explanatory. Once you get the stretcher made (final pic), you'll need to pinch it at point #1 and slide your phimotic ring onto the ridges at point #2. DO NOT JUST LET GO. Since I have no idea what your stretcher looks like, it may snap back into shape very fast and be painful. Let the stretcher get back into shape slowly and see how much stretching you can tolerate. I find that making the diameter of the stretcher thinner means it will apply less pressure on the p. ring as it springs back into shape. You can always melt the plastic and reshape it if you didn't get it right the first time.

Leave it in place for an hour or so while you watch TV, read, etc. I've considered adding some sort of hook to the back of it so I could hook it to the waistband of my undies so it would stay in place while I do housework or what not.

Keep with the BMD cream and this stretcher and you should be back to normal in no time. Please be careful. Consult a doctor. I am not a lawyer. Ask for your priest's blessing before attempting this. I accept no responsibility.

Questions?

Edit: took the stretcher that I made in the pics for a test drive last night, did the job and wasn't painful. The diameter of the plastic is very important. If you're just getting started with stretching I recommend about the width of a #2 pencil.

They have been on and off and all over the place for a few years, and have an extremely unhealthy relationship. Besides a whole bunch of ridiculous shit he does, like call her a bitch and telling her she sucks all the time, he is ridiculously aggressive when it comes to sex. He always always always wants it, granted many men do, but he is not nice about it. At all. If he wants it, he will get on top of her and not let her be, and become very pushy about the situation. When she says shes not in the mood, he tells her she doesn't care about him, that if she cared about him she would want to have sex with him, blah blah blah. So shes telling me this yesterday, and I feel like puking...Is this an okay thing to do? Not in my book it isn't. Most of the times they have had sex she needed lube because obviously he didn't even care to warm her up in the least, and obviously she was not in the best mood. This makes zero sense to me. Another thing he does is always try mimic what (I'm assuming) he sees in porn. He just rams it in to her and makes no effort to even try to stimulate anything. She has even told him what she wants and what she likes, and he never ever does it. He has never made her cum. Over 3 years, no cumming. Okay, some girls can't cum, I understand. She can. She knows how to make herself cum, and she knows what he can do to make her cum and he DOESN'T EVEN TRY TO DO IT. The weird part is, he is upset that he can't make her cum, he feels like its his fault, which it totally is, but if you knew it was possible to make it happen why wouldn't you try that way? He gets angry at her all the time for not cumming, not enjoying sex and yet he does not do what she likes. Its as if shes asking him to eat her shit or something, I mean a little clit rubbing should not be the hardest thing to comprehend. One more thing: he enjoys going down on her. He expresses that he does, but he does not do it nicely. She explained to him that nothing really feels good down there except focusing on the clit, which is the case for a lot of women. Personally, to me, you are wasting time if you are licking other areas. She said he would get the whole area like, covered in spit and open things, and move things around, and be messy and just really, really weird. I cant even describe the way she described it. It sounds like the biggest waste of time in the world, AND it was making her uncomfortable. She says to him that she really doesn't like that at all, she likes this area, (she even showed him where and how) and he didn't even take that advise into consideration for next time. It's like he doesn't *want* her to enjoy it, yet he gets mad when she doesn't. All of this made her sex life with him so fucking lame its crazy. AND that's just the cherry on top of their terrible relationship. I can never imagine having this type of sex life with someone, I'd be in deep depression by now.I have told her my take on it, and that it is not normal to do what he does, but I would love advise from other guys very much. Any feedback at all is appreciated. Some things I have thought of are that he is gay, he has sexual issues of some sort, (I don't know what kind, help), and that he has some kind of penis complex (apparently he has a massive penis. like, abnormally massive) I really need a mans help with this!

It was an okay (which at the time, seemed amazing) relationship, but the more and more I look back on how the whole thing went down, the more I'm starting to feel like I was being kind of.. ignored? For example:

-I felt I was always calling her, and always travelling to visit her. I would say this is now the biggest hangup I've developed as a consequence of the relationship. I don't think I could be comfortable again in a relationship where I don't feel there is an even exchange of contact. I really felt sometimes like I was shouting into the void, and it really got to me in the end.

-She would make plans to come, and never show up. We started the relationship with a fairly nice little rota - I'd visit her on weekends, she'd visit on Wednesday nights due to being in town. However, after maybe a month, the cancellations (usually, frustratingly, at 7pm on the Wednesday) started piling up. Missing the odd week makes sense, and I didn't mind. But looking back, I realise how frustrated I was getting every time she'd cancel, and how she seemed to have no consideration as to any plans I had made.

-I was no where near the top of her list of priorities, and yet she was at the top of mine. Another really big issue, from looking back, is that I realise I really wasn't high on her list of priorities. Which for some, I'm sure is fine. But it wa sthe lack of balance was the problem. For me, my priorities tend to go Family &gt; Partner &gt; Friends &gt; Work &gt; Anything else. From my perspective, looking back, her priorities seemed to be Work &gt; Cat &gt; Family &gt; Friends &gt; More Work &gt; Me. Towards the end especially, there was just no feeling of being wanted in her presence.

-A feeling she felt that money = time/energy spent together. So whilst I am studying, she is working a job, meaning she had a significant amount more money than me. She would often buy me little things as if to show appreciation. But the longer everything went on, I began to realise I wanted her time and attention far more than her money - a frank answer is that I didn't want another mother.

There was other stuff, but this seems like enough of a wall of text. My overarching thing is this however - how do I deal with the rose tinted glasses falling off? Over the last few weeks, I've really come to resent my ex, and feel like she messed me around far too much, despite being perfectly happy at the time. Does this always happen? Is this normal? Or did I just get a bit screwed over by not thinking highly enough of myself?

Just wanted to get some opinions on a sort of panty inner-turmoil I've been facing since puberty. So, basically, I'm a fan of the full-coverage panty, though I do buy them in the correct size so they're not all loose and saggy. But they still cover up my entire booty and come ALMOST up to my navel, usually in a cute pattern or color so they're not completely tragic. You get the picture. Anyway, my question to you guys is: is the full coverage/""granny panty"" a complete turn-off? Or are you just so focused on getting the underwear OFF, *if* you get to see them, that it totally doesn't matter? I keep feeling like I have to go to victoria's secret and spruce up my undie wardrobe, but then I'm all like, ""why?"" I'm very comfortable in my underwear, and am not going to be tugging a string out of my ass all day on the off-chance that some lucky gentleman will see them. 

So does it matter as much as I think it does? If you were dating a girl and finally got her in bed and she proceeded to remove her pants/skirt and you saw a full-coverage brief, would it be a total deal breaker? Or am I just crazy and overly self-conscious? I would appreciate any feedback :)

My father is a fairly hairy fellow, and the reason I am not asking him this is whenever I have asked him for grooming tips, it tends to be along the lines of ""If he does it, it's normal, regardless of what other peoples' opinions may be"", so I'm trying to get some second opinions.

I obviously know to keep pubic hair fairly trimmed, but these are the kinds of hair I wonder about whether I should trim or not, and if so how much:


* Armpit Hair 
* Chest Hair
* Belly Hair
* Leg/Arm Hair

Any tips, videos, links, or advice are greatly appreciated, thanks.",,False,self,t5_2s5ni,True,,,True,t3_h5r7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/h5r7c/hair_on_a_guys_body_yes_or_no/,
