Edit: Hey guys, so since you guys have been sending me a ton of questions, I'll answer the few that have shown up the most. 

Q: What do I do?

A: Hotel Management, but got most of my money from stocks.

Q: Any tips for day trading/investment banking?

A: Honestly, the market was different back when I was trading, and most of the tips that I would give, are no longer relevant. Also, a true trader never tells anyone his secrets ;)

Q: How much do I make a year? 

A: For personal reasons, I am not going to answer this one. Sorry. 

Q: How much was the car?

A: Again, I'm not going to answer this one, but I'm sure you can imagine the cost if you go on jameslist.com or ebay. This car was almost fully loaded. 

Q:How did you pay for it?

A:I just paid it off, no financing or leasing. 

Q: How much is service/insurance?

A: Well, for my dad, there is a one year service, that costed him I think about $2k. And then 10k mile services are like $9K? With insurance being about $1800 per year.

By Rex8499

Summary: In an effort to explain how torque and horsepower in cars are related, and what exactly those terms and numbers mean, and which feels faster, I’ve written this in hopes that semi-intelligent people might be able to get at least a rudimentary grasp of the concepts at play. If you aren’t already familiar with how an engine works, you’ll need to start there before trying to read this. Engines are very complicated, and these explanations are simplified, but accurate. There are many other factors at play that I will not delve into here today. Be patient while reading through all of this. You need to understand the basics before getting to the good stuff.

**Torque:** 

At it's most basic level, is the twisting force applied to something. When you put a wrench on a bolt and push down on the end of the wrench, you're applying torque and trying to twist the bolt. 
Torque = (force applied perpendicular) x (length of the arm the force is being applied on.)  

See Picture:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lsbr7) 

Hand A is pulling with a force of 20 lbs downward, and is 1ft from the bolt.  Therefore:

Torque A = (20 lbs) x (1ft) = 20ft-lbs
Hand B is twice as far out, so only has to pull with half the force to create the same amount of torque.

Torque B = (10 lbs) x (2ft) = 20ft-lbs.

You'll need to keep this in mind when working on a car.  Often a bolt will be too tight, or rusted on, and you wont be able to get it loose.  If you get a longer wrench, or put a piece of pipe over the handle to make a longer handle, you can exert more torque on the bolt without working so hard.  Or in that case, work as hard as you did the first time, but exert a lot more torque, and hopefully enough to loosen the bolt.  One of the tools I carry in my toolbox is a piece of pipe for just this purpose.
Let's look inside an engine for a second. When the combustion happens inside, it pushes down on the piston, which pushes down on the connecting rod, which pushes down on the offset of the crankshaft. If you can imagine the center of the crankshaft like the bolt, and the offset arm of the crankshaft as the wrench, and the piston and connecting rod as your arm trying to push down. You're applying a twisting force (a torque) to the axis of the crankshaft. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qrUOU) 

In that photo, the torque created on the crankshaft will be: Torque = F * D
Depending on how big the cylinder is, and how much gas was ignited, your force (F) being applied downward on the piston, and ultimately the crankshaft arm, varies. Engines burning more gas can push down harder and create higher torque. Multiply this torque by the number of cylinders, giving even more torque overall for a big V8 engine vs just 4 cylinders.

**Horsepower:** 

A unit of measurement for work. Back in the day, 1 horsepower was used to describe the power required to lift 550 lbs by 1ft of vertical distance in one second. 1 HP = 550 ft*lbs/second. A standard horse with a pulley system could lift 550lbs by 1ft per second.

 [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/51NXg) 

If you have a 2000 lb Ferrari, and a 2000 lb Volkswagon, and you drive both of them to the top of a hill, the Ferrari will get there faster (aka, shorter time), it has more power. Power =  (work/time). But you will have done the same amount of work with each car. You’d burn the same amount of gas with each car (here in the ivory halls of acadamia, we’re assuming equal efficiencies as well). The Ferrari can do more work in a shorter time, but it cannot do more work in a set distance.

Horsepower is just a unit of measurement to compare how much work that engine can do over time. How many times per second an engine makes that torque determines horsepower. An engine that wasn't spinning could still be making torque without making any power at all. Just like you can apply torque to a rusted bolt, and the thing never moves. You're applying torque, but not doing any work. Hence no horsepower. Once it starts rotating, you're making some power.

When looking at a dyno graph, the torque and horsepower are related. The typical chassis dyno is not measuring horsepower, it is measuring torque and then CALCULATING the horsepower using this equation. Note: this is a simplified equation, and requires torque in ft-lbs and RPM listed as ""X000.""

Horsepower = (Torque x RPM) / 5252 

As such, the HP and Torque dyno curves will ALWAYS cross each other at 5252 RPM. That's just how the equation works out.  Look at this equation for a second and let’s think about it. If you have an engine that makes a huge amount of torque, but it is rotating very slowly with low RPM’s, the Horsepower will be low.

Or, if you have an engine that makes a small amount of torque, but rotates very fast, you could still have a large horsepower number.

If you’ve got the big V8 engine, it makes a lot of torque at low RPM’s, meaning it also has more HP and accomplishes more work in those lower RPMs but it usually has a lower power curve and RPM redline, so the horsepower number in the higher RPMs is limited compared to a motor that could maintain a good torque curve to 10k RPM.

With the small 4-cylinder engine, it makes less torque and therefore HP at low RPM’s with only half as many cylinders, but it usually revs to higher RPM’s and maintains a better torque curve in those RPMs, so the horsepower could still be as high as the big V8 with more torque. If you look at some of the formula one race cars, they often have very small engines that don’t have a huge amount of torque, but they rev to 18k RPM, so their horsepower is crazy high.

So, the horsepower is just a function of the torque at a certain RPM.  That's the most important thing to understand from this. THE HORSEPOWER IS JUST A FUNCTION OF THE TORQUE AT CERTAIN RPM’s.

At lower speeds, the engine makes high torque, but it's making that torque less times per minute with low RPM's, so the horsepower is low because less overall work is being done. As the engine RPM's increases past its most efficient point and peak in the torque curve, the torque decreases for each revolution (I’ll explain why later on). However, it's making that torque more times per minute, so the horsepower starts to increase. Even though it's making less force per revolution, it's revolving (and firing) more times per minute, so the overall work being done is greater, giving more power.
Continued in comments...

Edit 1: clarifying when torque decreases.

Edit 2: clarifying that engines do make power.

Edit 3: Wording

Edit 4: Based on all of the great feedback, and many people begging for me to write more, I've decided to write a whole small book about engines. It'll take me a bit though to make something quality, so don't be looking for it for at least a few months. I'll post a link and on here once I'm done. But this time it won't be out of the goodness of my own heart. You'll have to pay a small fee for this one. I'll set it up as an electronic book through amazon or something. I'll figure that out when the time comes.",,False,,t5_2qhl2,1357169946.0,,,True,t3_154dix,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/154dix/torque_and_horsepower_explainedfor_semiidiots/,

1368198986.0,884,self.cars,1e2m7f,Made a huge gamble on a BMW X5 that paid off in spades - The power of the collective knowledge on forums.,1074,190,238,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1e2m7f/made_a_huge_gamble_on_a_bmw_x5_that_paid_off_in/,"My wife and I have been saving up for her new vehicle for over a year. I recently had to sell my Wrangler as it was totally impractical with kids so we needed something beefy that would tow the boat and safely transport my boys. She's had her heart set on a BMW X5 for years now and with our $13000 in cash I figured we could get a great used one with a decent engine and tow package.

After looking for a few weeks, we found a ""too-good-to-be-true"" story that was a 5 hour drive away. It was a 2006 MY with 35K miles on the clock, one owner, old lady driven, immaculate shape, 4.4l V8. Did I mention it was $4500 below KBB?

Of course, there was a reason it was so cheap. If you let the vehicle idle for more than a minute, you ended up engulfed in a cloud of white smoke. She said it had been doing this for a few months and that everyone she's had drive it saw the smoke and said ""no way""

Previously, she had it checked out at two mechanics AND a BMW dealership:

* The first mechanic couldn't figure it out. They replaced the spark plugs, an o2 sensor, and a few things related to the exhaust thinking it was an issue there  - no dice. They gave up.

* The second dealership she took it to was convinced it was a head gasket issue and said she'd be better off replacing the engine with BMW.

* The BMW dealership said the head gasket was fine, BUT that the valves all needed to be replaced/refitted due to carbon buildup. The accused her of not running premium fuel (she insisted she did) and quoted $7000 for the job. She said the dealership made the diagnosis in 20 minutes leading me to believe they didn't actually remove the valve covers, but rather speculated based on a previous experience.

Before making the 5 hour trek, I asked her to describe the smoke - she did one better and took a video which I reviewed it closely. Now, I've come across a few blown head gaskets in my day and this just didn't match the color/type of smoke. Furthemore, there was no valve tick/detonation I could hear. She checked her coolant and oil and both were clear. She just had an oil change done and there was no milky residue anywhere.

This was odd to me so I went off to research the issue on the various BMW forums. I found a few posts made from people over the years that said if they only drive it short distances, the crankcase vent valve (CCV) could get plugged up as the engine didn't have a chance to properly warm up. The smoke was actually an oil/steam combination caused by condensation that the plugged  CCV couldn't vent.

I called the lady back  and I asked her HOW the miles were put on. She said she frequently drove it a mile or two to work and rarely used it on the highway (explaining the low miles).

Bingo.  I told her that I may know the solution. She honestly didn't believe me that it was a cheap fix. She didn't want to hear it. She was sick of it and it needed to go. Great - I'll drive over the next day.

I knew it was going to be a gamble, but I trusted to power of the forums. We ended up at $12000 and a big, smoky SUV to drive the 5 hours back home.

Sure enough, I took it to my trusted import mechanic and had them do a thorough once over. They had the CCV replaced in 2 hours (with a $280 bill) and said it was one of the cleanest 4.4L BMW engines they'd ever seen. Valves were in tip-top shape (fucking BMW dealers). They replaced a power steering hose and topped off the fluids and called it good.

That was 1 month and 2,000 miles ago. No smoke since, and no other issues. It's raining today, but [here's a quick shot of my gamble that paid off.](http://i.imgur.com/Ay2sp3C.png)

 I'm half-tempted to flip it for a nice $5000 profit, but I value my sex life too much :)

1365546540.0,840,self.cars,1c0rzo,The story of how I had my dream car ...and lost it a week later. (Honda S2000) (Pics),1122,282,812,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1c0rzo/the_story_of_how_i_had_my_dream_car_and_lost_it_a/,"I've wanted a Honda S2000 for years. I've owned an Acura RSX since 2008, and always yearned for what the S2K had to offer. The FR layout, 6-speed transmission, 50/50 weight distribution; A true driver's car. I don't make much at my job. With the very little I had after rent, bills, and every once in a while treating the girlfriend, I was able to put a few dollars a month back into my savings. This was my ""S2000 Fund"".

A few times a week, I would scour sites like AutoTrader and Craigslist, drooling over pre-owned S2Ks, noticing that as the miles went up and the cars got older, the value didn't drop much. Yep, these things really hold their value, which was bad for me.

Until a few weeks ago, when I found a listing on Craigslist that spoke to me. A 2003 Berlina Black AP1 S2000 with 111,000 miles, with perfect interior/exterior, good top, new tires, upgraded Honda alarm system, and perfect running engine; for $11,000. I thought to myself: Could this be it? This might actually be obtainable. Sure, it was 3 hours away- but I didn't care.


After the lengthy process of switching banks, applying and getting approved for my auto loan, driving 6 hours to look at the car first-person, making my down payment using the money from my ""S2000 Fund"", and making the 6 hour drive again to pick the car up, I finally had her. She was all mine!

Here's a shot of us getting gas just outside of Birmingham, AL. It felt good filling her up for the first time:
http://i.imgur.com/LVXROWH.jpg

 Because I had managed to save up for a decent down payment, and thanks to my well-tended credit, I had my S2000 and monthly payments I could easily afford. I was going to have the car payed off in under 2 years. Even better, I told my girlfriend she could sell her time bomb Pontiac Grand Am and drive my RSX. She was ecstatic. She always loved my car, and now it was hers. For that first week she ""felt like a boss"" driving it to work.

Two days later, couldn't walk into a store without looking back:
http://i.imgur.com/otqWqNv.jpg

Then, a week after I bought the car, the unthinkable happened.

I had taken my girlfriend to the doctor's that morning, and we were on the way to the store for breakfast supplies. There's this sweeping right turn at an intersection. The light forward was green, so I dropped it into 2nd gear and coasted through the turn. About halfway through, I fed the car some gas, and that's when it happened...

I had failed to notice a build-up of loose dirt/gravel on the edge of the road. When I tried to accelerate out of the turn, my rear tire started to spin, and the rear of the car slid to the left. I instinctively aimed the wheel to the left, pointing the tires in the direction I wanted to go. (This is where my ignorance to real wheel drive came into play.) Had I feathered the gas and kept the wheel pointed, I may have been able to save it. I may have run off the road, or even spun out, but that's it. I let off the gas, and as soon as I did, the rear end swung around, the car found traction and immediately shot in the direction I had pointed... Into the oncoming lane.

We slammed head-first into a '98 Toyota 4Runner. Everyone always says ""It happened so fast"" and it's true. One second my tires are screeching, the next I'm horizontal on the road, and then all I see is a blinding white flash, followed by smoke and the sound of two car horns blaring. I asked my girlfriend if she was alright, and all she said was ""Your car."" I repeated: ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" and she shook her head yes.

Not sure whether the smoke was from the airbags or the engine, I unbuckled our seat belts as fast as I could and said ""Get out, get out. Now"" As we stepped out, the realization of what had happened hit me. The driver of the 4Runner stepped out. I asked if he was OK, and gave me no answer but a dirty look; a look I knowingly deserved.

First view upon stepping out:
http://i.imgur.com/6pzPmBM.jpg

We stood there in the road while the police did their job, waiting for the tow truck. I held onto my girlfriend, who could only cry into my chest saying ""I'm so sorry baby."" ""Your car."" ""You loved that car."" I felt like crying for the first time in a while. I was in a state of nervousness, shock and disbelief.

Here's the ""money-shot"" of the damage:
http://i.imgur.com/E2irORM.jpg

I took this picture right as we left the scene:
http://i.imgur.com/ljIUB3t.jpg

The truth is... insurance will probably cover what I owed on the loan and if I'm lucky I'll break even. But of course my insurance premiums will skyrocket. I had to ""take back"" my old RSX from my girlfriend, which broke my heart. The $2000 down payment I spent ages saving is gone. The $750 in taxes is gone, and there's one less mint S2000 on the road.

If you take anything from this story, let it it be this: Always wear your seat belt, even if you're just going to the store around the corner. Pay attention to the road conditions, no matter how nice of a day it may be, and know the limits of your car, no matter how good a driver you think you are.

What I feel now is a mix of shame and embarrassment for not being able to control my vehicle, regret at even going through all that work for nothing, and guilt for destroying a car that a lot of people would love to have owned; and I'm sorry.",,False,,t5_2qhl2,1366424145.0,,,True,t3_1c0rzo,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1c0rzo/the_story_of_how_i_had_my_dream_car_and_lost_it_a/,

A lot of *really* neat and unusual stuff.  And this is just the stuff that I've had a couple of free seconds to snap a picture of (and occasionally talk to the owner/driver of).

N.B. for RES users- the actual album has titles and captions for every image.

I have more pictures of most of these cars if anybody is interested.

[here](http://imgur.com/a/vZDeI) it is.  Hope you enjoy!

**EDIT**: **some corrections** (thanks everyone!)

What I listed as a Ferrari 360 is actually a 430.  We're still not sure what the old grey one is...either the incredibly rare 500 Superfast, or the slightly less rare 365 (people are also saying 246 but I'm pretty sure that's inaccurate).

The Sting Ray is a '66, not a '63.  For anybody who is interested, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwyCM6mSbQs) is a video I took of it pulling out of the bay and onto the street.  It sounds just as beautiful as it looks.

The red F100 is a 1957-1960.

The Caddy is a Series 61

The 911 may be a 74-77.  Not sure who is at fault, my own memory or the owner's (I recall him telling me it was a '73, but I could be wrong).

And a little outtake.  It's a shit picture, but you can still clearly tell that [this](http://i.imgur.com/xj631wL.jpg) is a yellow-and-black Citroen 2CV.

As someone who has lost a brother last year because of this and has lost many friends i can not stress this enough. Everyone please be careful because you never know where anyone riding a motorcycle could be. God bless all you guys and ride on!


**EDIT:** There is a lot of debate going on in this thread if its someones fault if a motorcyclists gets killed by your car. Your fault or not, NOBODY wants to live life knowing someone was killed by your vehicle, just check your surroundings its that simple.

I just thought you guys would like to see the car and I wanted to share.

Sorry if I'm saying anything wrong. It's a 350ci/360hp engine - Chevy small-block LT-1. It has the optional M22 transmission. 

EDIT: Thank you for the comments! Of course I will treat it well! I'm also trying to read and learn as much as possible, specifically about this car but also classic cars in general. My dad has pretty much centered his whole life and career around cars, so I'm a little ashamed I didn't learn all this when I was younger. I'm just hoping I soon learn this car inside and out and will be able to fix any problems I run into with it.

Numbers matching 350 4 speed car with one repaint about 20 years ago. Just a few years ago I was with him when the odometer rolled past the 75,000 mile mark for the first time. 

I've grown up around this car and about 10 years ago he got another '72 Chevelle, and then as soon as I turned 16 I looked for a chevelle myself. That didn't work out (big surprise!) so I ended up getting a '74 Camaro with a 383 backed by a 4 speed. I plan to keep it just as he has.

EDIT 2- Here's pics of the other Chevelle a few asked about. It's a project car. It's a '72 Heavy Chevy Chevelle 402 big block backed by a turbo 400. Pretty rare car and it will someday come back to life!

In 2011 I got a call from a guy building a classic rendition of the modern Corvette ZR1. Not only did they shoehorn the LS9 engine and six-speed transmission into a '63 split window Corvette, but many of the steering, suspension, and chassis bits as well.

But what really makes this car over-the-top for me is the interior. Corvettes have never had great interiors, but this was some Ferrari-level leather. A true supercar, and to me, the best-looking car I've done a photo shoot of.

Kinda just threw this album together, and my photo skills (and equipment) have improved dramatically since I took these pics. Some of them are a lot better than others, I know, but constructive criticism is still always welcomed.

Edit: For those wanting more details on this ride, [here is the article I wrote about it in early 2012](http://www.lsxtv.com/features/car-features/joe-bongiornos-63-split-window-zr1-tribute-car-is-pure-perfection/).",,False,,t5_2qhl2,1373558851.0,,,True,t3_1i2szm,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1i2szm/album_of_the_most_beautiful_car_i_ever_took_pics/,

Since I'm really into photography of course I brought my camera and a couple lenses with. Before the meeting we could just walk around the dealer and look at whatever. After the meeting me and a couple buddies asked some guys who worked there if we could go inside the service bay to look around, and after a brief consideration they let us in. Just free (very careful) roam around a garage with millions of dollars worth of cars, no problem. It was such a cool experience, especially considering how big a Ferrari fan I am. 

Now, for pics:

Inside the main showroom were four different seats, along with calipers, brake discs, wheels, and steering wheels on display.

So, what are your thoughts Reddit? This car will not be a track car, just a summer driver fun car. I am not looking to make an extra 100 hp instead of 97 hp from one system to the next.

I got tired of owning two 17-year-old cars right around the time the Miata started burning more oil than I could pour into it.

Last year, at the DC Auto Show, I sat in a yellow Focus ST that was apparently coming to the U.S. ""soon."" The Recaro seats were incredible, the paint color was too cool, and I quickly put the thought out of my head because ""oh, I could never afford that.""

Well, the Miata picked up its drinking habit, the E36 was very solid but kept me always worried about ""what will break next from age,"" and I decided to look around at newer cars to daily-drive.

After crunching numbers and doing some test drives, it turned out that the ST was actually attainable. I picked up a TON of side gigs, saved ferociously, and got a pretty large down payment together. 

The car was ordered on November 12th, built on December 19th, and I picked it up this past Friday evening. To say I'm excited is an understatement. It's just a fantastic little car.

Post your question - stupid or otherwise - here to get an answer. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Want to know what the numbers on the gas pump mean, how to check your tires, or the correct ignition timing be on a 1955 Bel Air Chevrolet, with a 327 cubic-inch engine and a four-barrel carburetor?

I was going 75mph and I'm sure he was going the same if not faster.  I had a premonition that someone would be going the wrong way, I don't know how.  I saw his lights on the wrong side and I slammed on the brakes and went to the right to get off the road.  Luckily he passed what I assume to be just a foot or two from me with a closure rate of about 150mph.  I called my buddy who was maybe 5or 6miles behind me to tell him to watch out then I called highway patrol.  Man it scared the shit out of me.

I had the opportunity to drive a number of Karmas to shake down new software and I took a lot of photos along the way. 

There isn't much nice being said about Fisker these days, but I submit this post as a tribute to the Karma as a car - while it had flaws and its styling was polarizing, it had incredible presence, handled very well, and was a lot of fun to drive. Beyond the company's troubles, the car was quite an achievement. I recommend that you drive one if you get the chance. 

Note: photos were taken with my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, and at some point it started putting a couple of blotches on every photo I took. Apologies.

This was in taught in a Northern Virginia public high school back in 1969-1970. 

It amazes me that she had to learn how an engine worked, how the drivetrain was laid out, and maintenance intervals for the car. This was all before she even got her permit.

All I learned in my Driver's Ed class (also in a public, Northern Virginia high school) about 35 years later was ""you turn the key, put the big thing in R or D, and push the little skinny pedal on the right."" We also learned the basics of passing, lane changes, signaling, etc. but none of this mechanical knowledge. And guess how many of my peers have no idea why they need to check fluids, or how often?

Mom also had to change a tire on a car at home, and have her parents send in a signed note stating that she did it. She learned to change a tire on her dad's Fiat roadster.

OK, I scanned the whole notebook. 30 pages on a sheet-feed scanner at work takes some time, but I did it.

After that I drove it back home and thought nothing of it. This morning at 6:45 I get a call from a co-worker who lives in the same complex and had to be in to work earlier than I did.

Some background for Americans: The LJ Torana is a small aussie-built sedan packing a straight 6. It's famous for being driven by Peter Brock (our most famous driver) and winning Bathurst (our most famous race) against the V8s.

I bought this car for $1000 when I was 15 years old with the plan of restoring it with my dad and using it as my first car. I had no experience with cars, either did my dad. I drove it once down a friends driveway, then stripped it down. As it turns out, stripping a car is MUCH easier than putting it back together!

So after 10 years (mostly sitting dormant in the shed), I've finally got her back on the road!

I plan to begin a series of posts covering all topics related to driving and cars. I hope to not only bring some knowledge to new car enthusiasts, but to invoke conversation amongst everyone. Today, we will learn about powersliding. 

**WHAT IS A POWERSLIDE?**

[Gif 1](http://24.media.tumblr.com/3ead1cf7ba92fbcc70f3bbdfb718a1c4/tumblr_ml22j9tCsn1rpdptuo1_500.gif)

[Gif 3](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18gk8ltqx2ah3gif/k-bigpic.gif)

Powersliding is a technique used to maneuver around corners while still maintaining forward momentum. The technique involves going through the first half of the turn normally, then cutting the steering wheel 180 degrees while still accelerating. This causes the tires to temporarily lose traction, thus causing a slide. 

Note: This is a general description of powersliding. Some cars do not need the wheel to be cut 180 degrees. Much of powersliding depends on the car, the angle of the turn, the type of tires, and the weather conditions.

**HOW DO I POWERSLIDE?**

*I must first take a moment to say that if you do attempt to powerslide, you and your passengers MUST wear your safety restraints. Don't be an idiot.*

1. Enter a turn as normal. Make sure to follow the best line around the turn, taking the front of the car through the apex. 

2. As you pass through the apex, cut the wheel in the direction of the turn at least ninety degrees. Simultaneously, increase your acceleration. Now is when you will begin to feel the tires lose traction. To further reduce power to the wheels, you can dip the clutch just a bit. 

3. The key to properly executing the turn is to recognize when to let go of the gas. **Once the nose of the car completes the turn and points in the direction you want to go, EASE OFF THE THROTTLE.** As you begin to let go of the accelerator, the car will begin to regain traction and thrust you forward.

4. Once traction is regained, re-engage the throttle and accelerate through the turn onto a straightaway. **If you do not let go of the gas at the right time, your car will continue to spin.**

[Quick video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=GDbY6XsMGug#t=63s) (not 100% accurate but close enough)

**WHERE CAN I PRACTICE POWERSLIDING?**

Parking lots are usually the place people go, but dirt tracks, open fields, and desolate roads are great too. 

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POWERSLIDING AND DRIFTING**

This is the debatable topic. Avid drifters will tell you that there is a HUGE difference between drifting and powersliding. Others will say that powersliding is a type of drifting. Mainly, a drift involves entering the turn already in oversteer, whereas a powerslide only overdrifts for half of the turn. From what I've found on online forums, many drift enthusiasts are kind of snobby against powersteering. They see it as whimpy/amateurish 

**FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR POWERSLIDE**

These characteristics are favorable in powersliding:

- More HP. The more, the better.

- Limited Slip Differential

**ARE THERE ANY ADVANTAGES TO POWERSLIDING?**

Not really. They are mostly for show/fun. There are much more effective ways to handle turns in a race. 

____

Welp, that about covers it all. I look forward to making more posts like this. Please feel free to add your own comments, criticisms, and input. My next post will either be about rotary engines or the aforementioned Limited Slip Differential.",,False,,t5_2qhl2,False,,,True,t3_1g4p71,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1g4p71/how_to_powerslide/,

Growing up, my grandmother owned (still does actually) a MASSIVE track of land in East St. Paul, north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Originally, there was just a log house, then two barns, then a potato barn, two guest houses, and a garage where built. Over time, numerous cars came and went, including an old Westfalia, a Signet, a Buick Roadmaster, an LTD, and....a Firebird.

Over time, the log house has begun to collapse, the barns have completely folded in on themselves, the two guest houses are also collapsing, and my grandmother built a new house. But the building that remained was the garage.

I always knew SOMETHING was in that garage, but being little, I could neither see in through the windows, get in through the door, or properly understand the significance of discovering an old car. Last year (May 2012 specifically) my best friend's dad finally finished his 1965 Corvair Corsa. Red. Gorgeous. *Convertible*. One day they swung by my house and I got a ride. I instantly fell in love with the sound of the engine, the wind in your hair (I had some magnificent blond locks then, still do) and looking up at a canopy of trees shadowing my home street. I decided I had to know what was in that garage.

Come June 2012. I broke open the door of the garage. Forced the car door open and let the light in. What the light struck was a 1969 Pontiac Firebird 350 Convertible in Sunburst Red. Now, I've driven small European cars all my life, usually in a dark conservative colour. You can imagine my reaction when I come across this family treasure which is size of the moon and a shade that can burn the back of your retinas.

Anyways, I got a friend (who builds and fixes custom jeeps for a living) to get a tow truck and take a look at it. I was busy finishing that year of school so I couldn't do it myself. Anyways, the consensus in his shop was that the motor was completely seized (expected) there was a raccoon/squirrel/rat/mouse (take your rodent of choice, they all lived in there at one point) colony, and that the exhaust system was *literally* a neat pile of rust sitting on the floor of his shop (but since he deals with 20 year old YJs, TJs, and the like, I thought he'd be used to that).

Fast forward a year of work for him (mostly) and another dreary year of EvDs at the UofM for me, shit finally got rolling. The engine has been bored out, repainted the Pontiac factory blue, new MSD distributor and ignition, Edelbrock intake, and QFT 4 barrel 650 carb. Paired with a shiny new pair of stainless steel magnaflow tips, mufflers, etc. Long story short, is the thing now pumps out close enough to 400 horsepower *ON THE ORIGINAL RADIALS* (which miraculously still hold air and have plenty of tread) and sucks gas like nothing else I've ever experienced.

Took my grandmother for a ride in it, and she couldn't be happier with the final product. It only *occasionally* belches massive ball of fire out of the carb, but hey, it's got showmanship. I'll fix that sometime.

TL;DR. Screw you, I spent ages typing this. Least you could do is read it. Found 1969 Firebird 350 Convertible in ancient garage on grandmas farm. Complete engine rebuild. Grandma relives the past, I get to relive my parent's fear of gas bills. Loud as hell. Go look at the damn [photos](http://imgur.com/a/trQg9).

**note** I bet some are assuming that ""I'm the stereotypical rich kid acting like he knows about cars"". Half right. I'm NOT rich in anyway. I spent every summer since I was 14 saving money from various jobs I did to use for the right moment. I know a BIT about cars, but what I REALLY know about are antique to the late 1990s outboard boat engines. Everything that's been done to that car has come out of my pocket, and my own personal interest in family history and mechanical history. I had to pump the tires up *by hand* since there wasn't room for a compressor in the garage. I then had to PUSH the damn thing *by hand* out of the garage. I only got other people involved in the interest of time, or because of my personal lack of knowledge (because I want it to be done RIGHT, but learn along the way)

1363239342.0,362,self.cars,1a9pfp,"Psh, you went to the Nürburgring?  My rental car was crashed there.  Here's my story.",488,126,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1a9pfp/psh_you_went_to_the_nürburgring_my_rental_car_was/,"One evening in November, I received an instant message from a friend of mine in New York City asking about the Nürburgring.  The year prior, I was in Copenhagen, Denmark on a business trip and had a free weekend.  Figuring that I would never again get the opportunity to be so close, I booked a weekend trip down to Köln, Germany, rented a car, and drove the world-famous Nordschliefe.    I had literally done my first track day (at Thunderhill Raceway in Northern California) two weeks prior to that first visit.  I met up with an individual on the ""ringers"" mailing list (based in the UK) who took me for a very exciting lap in his wife's Renault Clio 172 before I jumped in my rental BMW 320dT/6MT  (that's a 2.0L Diesel wagon with a 6 speed manual gearbox for those that don't speak bimmerease) and did three laps.   I gave the remaining two laps on my 5 lap ticket to an American soldier I saw in a yellow Cavalier entering the track.  I had the flu during that week and just couldn't do another lap.
 

Back to the instant message - my friend was asking me about the 'ring because he found that Continental was offering $99 each way from Newark, NJ to Köln, Germany and he (and two friends of his) had just booked the trip.   Without missing a click, I browsed to continental.com and booked myself on the same flights.  I then called a friend of mine that lives locally and he did the same.    I can pay for my own way to Newark - a $276 round trip (incl. taxes) to the 'ring can not and will not be passed up.
 


My wife (now ex-wife) was not pleased that I had not called her prior to purchasing this ticket. 



April rolled around and I boarded my redeye flight from San Jose to Newark where I had a 12 hour layover.   Took the PATH train into Manhattan and met up with the 3 others from NYC for lunch then eventually headed back to the airport.
 
Another red-eye flight and we land in Köln.   We had two rental cars beween the 5 of us - my buddy and I reserved a ""BMW 3-series or equivalent"" and ended up with an Audi A6 Avant 2.7 Auto (big diesel wagon with an an automatic) and the 3 guys from NYC that reserved a ""BMW 1-series or equivalent"" ended up with an Audi A3 1.9 6MT (small diesel hatchback with a 6 speed manual).   It was Easter weekend and apparently all they had for us were these Audis (and no manuals in my class- lame!).   I opted in to the cheapest insurance option, which was full coverage with a 950 Euro deductible.

 
We booked the first two nights at a hotel in Amsterdam, only 3 hours away, so off we went thanks to my Garmin Nüvi GPS with European maps.    After two nights in Amsterdam we checked in to Sliders Guest House (http://www.slidersguesthouse.com/) which I cannot recommend enough - it's run by a Brit and caters to car and motorcycle enthusiasts in town to drive the 'ring.    There is a large dining area where everyone watches their race viceos on the big screen in the evenings and a large fridge full of great German beer (honor system - put a mark next to your name for each beer you drink and you're charged at the end).       Early the next morning we proceeded to the track and purchased our lap tickets - approximately $465US (at the exchange rate at the time) for a 25 lap ticket which my buddy and I split.     The other 3 split their own ticket.      
 


Some more background - I had been subscribed to the ""ringers"" mailing list and read Ben Lovejoy's web site many times (http://www.nurburgring.org.uk/).    I knew that rental car companies typically did not allow you on the 'ring.   I also knew that in Germany, if there is any sort of accident whatsoever, a police report is generally required.     I also knew that if you hit the armco (barrier) on the side of the 'ring, you were typically charged for repair/replacement, no matter how minor.    I had been on the track before in a rental, I had decided to do it again (""rent a racer"" rentals do exist, but they cost 2-3x more than airport rentals, for obvious reasons).
 


On the second day, we were really moving.  I had just done a 9:52 lap and my buddy did a 9:42 lap in our 4000lb automatic wagon.   We decided to switch cars with the other 3 guys.    After a lap in the A3, I see the other 3 guys in the A6 about to head out for another lap, so I jump in the back seat.   ""K"" was driving ... he came around a corner a little too hot and slid off the track.  The entire right side of the car hit the armco, slamming my head against the side glass in the process.     I did what any responsible person would have done:  yelled ""GO!!!!!!!""
 


""K"" did just that, slowly progressing through the rest of the track hoping nobody had seen what happened (in reality, a hundred people probably saw us - we were within view of a 'spectator area').   As we turned back into the car park (parking lot), I was watching people's heads - seeing if anyone would be looking at the side of our car.  After all, I had not yet seen the damage, and the car was still driving OK...
 


When we parked I noticed there were many small dents just in front of and behind the wheels.  There was a single long shallow dent all along the side of the car.  Paint was scraped off of the wheels.
 
For the most part, the crash did not ruin our fun.  We continued to drive the ring in the evenings thereafter following days of sight-seeing around Germany and Luxembourg.   
 


The nervousness built as we entered the airport for our flight home.   When we checked the rental car back in, the representative scanned the barcode on the driver's side and slowly walked around the back of the car to look for any damage.   He came to the right-rear fender and saw a few small dents - licking his thumb to rub against the dents, checking for paint damage.  He then looked to the right and took a few steps back seeing everything.  He called four of his German co-workers over and they began conversing and shaking their heads.  Here you have 5 Germans and 5 Americans with nervous looks on their faces.  They pointed us to the terminal and we caught our flight home.
 


A few weeks later, I received a letter from the rental car agency essentially saying, ""There was damage to the vehicle.  Please fill out this form..."" which, of course, had a spot for a police report #.   I stated that I had hit a pole in a parking garage in Amsterdam... an accident which was witnessed by the parking garage owner, who waved us on by.     Sounded like a good story to me, and it explains why we didn't have a police report.  I returned the form via fax.
 


Another few weeks go by and I received a large envelope from the rental car agency.  It stated that since we did not make a police report, their insurance did not cover us.  Included was a full estimate from a body shop including pictures and lots of pages of German car parts.  The total was over 6000 Euro ($9000US at the time).    Ouch.   I contacted ""K"" and he said that he may be able to make a claim against his own US car insurance, although he wasn't a registered driver for this vehicle.  Only me and my buddy were.   If ""K"" could not come through, I'd be on the hook.


 
Before we went down that route, I decided to use a benefit my employer offers - a 30 minute free consultation with a lawyer.    I talked to one who referred me to another - an individual in Florida who happens to be licensed to practice law in both the US and Germany. I forwarded him a copy of the rental contract and he agreed - there was no language stating that a police report must be filed in order to make a claim against the insurance.    He also stated that there were no international law precedents which would state the same.      He dictated to me a letter I should write in return and I did just that.
 


Nearly six weeks go by and I finally receive another letter from the rental agency.   They concluded that I was correct and that I only owed 950 Euro (pretty shitty business practice trying to intimidate the uninformed).   ""K"" sent me a check for the full amount ($1350US) and I forwarded it off to the rental agency.       
 


Lots of lessons learned.... and thank you for being a stand-up guy, ""K""!

STORY: I bought this car during the winter break of my Senior Year in High school. Was working part-time during the year and full-time during the summers at DQ. I also tutored part-time as well as worked in a local mechanic shop until I finally saved enough to buy her. YES, I busted my ass to get this car, but it was completely worth every blood, sweat, and tear. Didn't get a single penny from my parents, in fact, they didn't know that I had all this money saved up. I bought the car without telling them from a private owner and kinda just showed up with it at home that night. They were furious and extremely confused at first, until I gave each of them a ride haha.

Graduated with a 6.4 GPA as Salutatorian and now headed into my sophomore at Johns Hopkins University. I've taken the car with me up north. I raise it up a tiny bit during the winters, and only take it out on clear days. And yes, it stays in an indoor garage.

Czech web site says 1190kg (2624lb) - not bad.

Edit:

&gt; features a chassis that's a full 30-percent stiffer than the 2013 model thanks in part to extensive use of high-strength steel.

&gt; the material also let **Mazda cut around 200 pounds from the vehicle**

It's still in its break-in, so unfortunately I haven't gotten to take it to its full potential yet. The wheels are Enkei Raijin 18x9.5"" rear 18x8.5"" front. The tires are 255/35/18 in the rear and 245/35/18 in the front Kumho Ecsta LE Sports. I got the car from a performance dealership who pre-installed the wheels and tires. So far though, the car is truly excellent. I really enjoy the more simple interior and gauge cluster. This car feels connected to the road in a way that most new cars do not, even if its not perfect. The steering is good and the road feel through the suspension is excellent for factory. I can't wait to take this car to a track!

**edit:** A lot of you guys are asking about pricing and availability, and as /u/verdegrrl pointed out these logos and names could be considered copyright and trademarked by their rightful owners. With that being the case, I'm not entirely certain on his ability to sell car logo/name related ones. I did send him an email asking about it, so we'll see what he knows. 

**EDIT 2 WITH SOME PURCHASING INFO** So I got a hold of my dad, he said that he doesn't know much about the legality but said he'll make them until someone says to quit it. I know a lot of you are interested in getting one made, and he's interested in making money but PLEASE keep in mind that he is the only one making these so they might take time. However, he told me that if you send him a message on his ebay store with my username, he can get you some kind of discount. His ebay store is NOT up yet, he said it should be up by the end of the week. I'll post a link here or in a new thread regarding the store link. Thanks for your support everyone, maybe this will net me a new toolbox from him for Christmas. Any further questions, either ask here or PM me. 

**EDIT 3 PLEASE READ ME IF YOU ARE IGNORING EVERYTHING ELSE PLEASE**: To help out making things easier, if you'd like one made, please find a basic logo that you would want. Please make it as minimalist as possible to make my dad's task a bit easier. As long as the mods permit it, there will be a new thread posted as soon as my dad's ebay store goes online. For those of you still expressing legal concerns, my dad's store itself does NOT sell any automotive related signs. You will have to get in contact with him to work out the details, but please have a logo set up for him. He's the only one making these signs. Again, give him my user name and you could get a good discount of some kind. Thanks for your support guys!

*Edit* 
added a Dyno Chart. The dashed line is the power at the wheels. The solid line is the power made without boost modulation. The EGR circuit is not on P28 ECU's, so it was added to facilite ECU control over an electronic boost controller which allowed for significantly more power, the ability to do 2 step with the factory ECU (limiting RPM to ideal launch RPM until the ECU sees a specific MPH) and a low boost mode for lower wheel speeds to aid in traction.

It took 2 years and uncountable hours, but my daily driver is now finished. 

I started with a 1991 Civic SI that was totaled, Painted it and drove it like that for about 6 months while doing the brakes and suspension. Then we set in on the drivetrain. It now makes 280HP and 275 Ft Lbs - with AC. Making everything fit and meet/exceed OEM standards of quality took a lot of time but it was worth it. I didn't want any significant indicators on the exterior to tip anyone off as to what this car can do, and with its unsuspecting appearance, I surprise people on the road often. 

*Edit*
I forgot to mention the remote start. I made a cell phone activated remote start that starts the car by calling the phone IED style. There is a picture of it up there now. One of my friends put the number for the phone in a craigslist ad as a practical joke on me. the car was starting constantly. I have taken measures to prevent this now by block all phone numbers but mine.
