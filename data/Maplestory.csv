[**click here for part 2**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1fsciu/returning_mapler_guide_pt2_classes/)


Quite a few people have been making threads asking the same question:


What has changed from when I last played?

Maplestory is a very rapidly changing game, and to help understand what’s been going on I decided to make this “guide.”

Most of the people asking this haven’t played since before the most influential patch and change to the game was made, “Big Bang.”
This patch occurred on December 7th 2010.

The patch was HUGE for Maplestory. The UI was completely overhauled.The EXP rate and curve was COMPLETELY changed. Before, getting to level 30 could take you a week to a month for most people. Now this can be accomplished in around 30 minutes to an hour. Included in this section of the patch, was the reorganization of the MapleWorld, most notably, Victoria Island. Victoria Island may now be navigated using a central location called “Six Paths Crossing” which is a large tree that allows you to head to any region of Victoria as well as the Intercontinental station allowing ou to travel to other continents. 



Here is a list of things that were added or changed and a brief overview of what they are.

* Potential System: Item can now have a ""hidden potential"" which can be revealed with a magnifying glass purchased at NPC shops. These ""hidden potentials"" add stats to your weapon such as 4% INT or +12 STR.

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIj/equipment-upgrading-101-potentials)

* Enhancement: After scrolling all available slots on an item, you have the ability to ""Enhance"" it with an enhancement scroll. These scrolls add additional stats and effects. 

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIk/equipment-upgrading-101-enhancements)

* Nebulites: Nebulites are yet another way to upgrade your equipment.

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIl/equipment-upgrading-101-nebulites)


* Aditional Potential System: Using items from the Cash Shop, you can upgrade your equipment even further by adding additional potentials.

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FIj/#potentials)

* EVO World: The EVO world is a customizable hunting ground that can be accessed 5 times a day. 

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/MapleStory-Guide-Evolution-World-Guide-453.html)

* Party Quests: PQ's have now been compressed into a single room accessible through the inter-dimensional portal. When inside the PQ room, all NPCs for the PQ starts are inside with you. To start a PQ, join a party and talk to the corresponding NPC for the PQ you would like to do.

* Inner Abilities: Using a circulator from Azwan, you can gain honor experience by completing Azwan challenges, quests, party quests, and games. This experience is separate and provides stat increases.

for more info see [this guide](http://maplestory.nexon.net/guides/game-play/systems/00FLx/inner-abilities)

* Azwan: A new area accessible through the inter-dimensional portal. Here you can complete a questline, play mini-games, do a party quest, and gain Honor EXP which can be used to earn Inner Abilities (see above)

for more info see [this guide](http://www.mapleguide.net/fight-for-azwan/)

* Familiars: Monsters now drop “Familiar” cards as well as the old “Monster” cards. These cards can be used to summon the monster and have it follow you around. Monsters each have different effects ranging from health boosts to meso drop rates.

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/forum/2248216/1/Monster_Familiar_Effects.html)


* Hyper Skills: After reaching level 140, you receive Hyper Skills which are additional skills that improve your stats, skills, and add additional skills. 

for more info see [this guide](http://orangemushroom.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/kmst-ver-1-2-446-inkwells-secret-diary-hyper-skills/)

* Professions: You may now learn 2 professions which allow you to craft items. The professions are: Herbalism, Mining, Alchemy, Smithing, and Accessory Crafting.

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/forum/2072074/5/Profession_Skill_Guide.html)

* Silent Crusade: at level 75 you receive a questline that allows you to earn coins through various tasks and use them to purchase items from Edelstein.

for more info see [this guide](http://www.basilmarket.com/MapleStory-Guide-Silent-Crusade-Questline-Guide-416.html)


* Job Advancement: The level at which job advancements are made ahs been adjusted to
2nd job: level 30
3rd job: level 60
4th job: level 100

Remember, if you have any questions, feedback, or corrections, please PM me.

A couple of weeks ago I stumbled across a video scholarship competition with the grand prize being 3000$ to the first place video. As a videographer, this amount of money would change my film career by allowing me to replace my outdated gear with some really heavy duty-professional stuff; an opportunity that would be otherwise impossible without this scholarship.

 I thought long and hard as to what I should make a video about; and one day it hit me: Falling in love in Maplestory. So here it is! if you like it then hit the little blue vote button and share this flick with your friends.

http://www.gotchosen.com/VideoScholarship.aspx?t=Videos#view/12573/1169880

Voting ends in just THREE DAYS and I'm currently in FIRST .. but not by very much. I've been bouncing back and forth every single day and it's going to be a nail-biting finish.

(sorry for my bad english)
I have never been to this reddit before but i went here to share my story.

This is more than 6 years ago.
Me and my brother wasnt very close at the time, we never spoke, never did anything together but that was about to change, my friend in school told me about a game where you could connect with other people like WoW, with awesome feelgood gameplay and epic music.
So all my friends including me started playing this game and oh boy did i love it, the feeling of being close to my friends and still to have my own character to adventure with.
Eventually my brothers friends heard of this game and so my brother started playing the game, I didn't know of this, we never spoke and we lived on different floors.

I met a player ingame that was from the same country, we played for hours and hours again, we came along really well and we became really close friends, we could play the whole weekend without a single break. We could party up with his friends and roam around the world just writing to eachother and laughing at everything.

One late friday my mom came home with some food, she told me to go get my brother, so i went downstairs, open his door and my brother isnt there, he's in the bathroom, i walked up to his computer to get a shock, on his screen i can se my own character and my friend, my brother.

Dinnertime!

I didn't tell my brother what i've just seen and realized.
I though why ruin the good bond me and him have gotten in Maplestory.

Days went by and we kept on playing like we always did, until one day.
I just got out of bed and logged into maplestory, my brother wrote ""Good morning! It took you some time to get out of bed""

And I was like ""how did he? ...uhm.""
Before i got the time to answer he wrote ""Can we talk *my name* ?""
My brother tells me this amazing story of how he missed how close we were and how he missed hanging out with me.
He asked my friends about the game and looked me up and here we are.
That day changed everything, we got closer than ever and we still are.


And to add, the enviroment and the music of maplestory, we all love it and im sure that maplestory is the only game that can bring such emotions and joy.

Now i dont play, i dont like all the new things i love the old maplestory, i loved everything.

Theres my story, my english sucks but w/e.

heres a song you can put on while you read.

1373135196.0,43,self.Maplestory,1hrcna,I was so close to quitting Maple until I met this guy today.,51,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1hrcna/i_was_so_close_to_quitting_maple_until_i_met_this/,"I was doing my usual stuff, trying to make money for equips, etc... when I saw a smega that said someone wanted to buy my 150 Japanese Mage gloves. Now I got that on my mule doing gach and didn't want to psok it or anything so it was just there... I thought why not try to sell it?

So I whisp him and within a few minutes, he has the NX for a psok and I go on my mule. Remember he never even saw my main (which isn't anything impressive really) so his trust was based off of my level 40 Kaiser mule. Here's the reason why I wanted to quit though (you can skip this if you want). After the unleashed patch, I realized unless I was extremely funded, I wouldn't be able to do my favourite bosses anymore. I couldn't dojo, couldn't do Empress and it was really depressing because I had JUST gotten my fafnir weapon. That's pretty much all I have and I'm working towards finishing the set.

Anyways, I saw his character, you know, the usual level 200 fully NX'ed but it was really well done. I saw his dragon and remembered when I was an Evan in KMS and his equips were mostly the best you could find. I was then inspired by both his trust in me and everything else. It's so hard to find people who you can trust and he did it without question. Sure you might call him stupid but it was so... precious to me.

That's not even it though, the real story is this. My name had a capital i instead of an L and because it was my mule, I forgot this. He sent me his psok to the wrong char and when I realized this, I was devastated. I told him I was extremely sorry and that I'd pay him back. He said np, got some more NX and sent it to me without a question and the gloves were originally for 200m. I just wanted to get rid of them. So I owe this guy 400m for the psok and I tell him I'll give him the gloves for free and another 200m on my drk.

Then he says it's fine and gives me 100m anyways saying how cheap the gloves were. That's what really touched me. It's so hard to find decent people on Maple nowadays and this guy, who I made life so hard for, despite me throwing away his psok, and everything else, he's nice enough to do that.
I honestly wouldn't care if the gloves are worth 3b, just the fact that he was kind enough to trust me just blew my mind.

Too bad his BL list was full, I wish one day to have a BL filled with those ""pros"".

1352991283.0,45,self.Maplestory,138oub,Hello Maplers! Here's some general (and useful) information about the current Meso Ranger event!,53,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/138oub/hello_maplers_heres_some_general_and_useful/,"As I'm sure you're all currently aware, there is an event going on right now involving the Meso Rangers! You have a shot at becoming one of the beloved but long forgotten group. There are other events going on right now, but this post will only be focusing on the Meso Ranger ones.

The overview of this event is, complete event quests by killing monsters or obtaining certain items to gain a score. You need your score to be over 1000 to get a random Meso Ranger equip.

I'm here to tell you one of the best and most efficient ways to get Meso Ranger equips!

There are a total of 8 event quests available that are part of the Meso Ranger event, but one of them is to take the test so there's only 7 that you need to collect/kill things for.

 - 3 quests require you to kill 200 monsters around your level
 - 4 quests require you to pick up books from monsters around your level.

To actually GET the Meso Ranger equipment you have to take a 'test' that requires one piece of Bravery, Trust and Will to take.
There are 3 tiers of each piece needed for the exam and each will give you different amounts of points towards your test score (remember you only need to score 1000 to get an equip).

There are 2 different parts of the test, but the second part you won't have to worry about. It's a multiple choice test basically, but the questions and answers are always the same. Depending on how you answer, you can get an additional 500 points for free. The best answer combination and the one that is imperative to this is...

**3, 4, 1, 1, 3.**

If you use this combination for the question portion you'll get 500 free points. Remember this, it is important.

So you should have a general idea as to how the event works now. It's time to find out a great way to get equips quickly!

First off you'll need to find a training spot around your level. Another great event going on right now gives you a free Resistance character at level 30- that's what I used to get most of my equips

Once you find monsters around your level, accept all 7 quests for the Meso Ranger event. For your first time, you'll just do the event as you normally would. Kill 200 monsters, pick up all the books (and the Bravery, Will and Trust that drops! Those are important!). But once you finish them, **don't turn in all the quests right away.**

**This part is also important and can double the amount of equips you get each time you do the round of quests.**

If, by the time you complete all the quests your first time around, you have 1 of each token required to take the test (Bravery, Trust, and Will) that you picked up from killing monsters, here's what you do to maximize your profit.

1. Turn in the 4 book quests and only those quests.
2. Take the exam. Since you're using the lowest tier of tokens, in combination with the books you'll get 500 points before you take the multiple choice part.
3. Use the combination **3, 4, 1, 1, 3,** for the multiple choice part to get 500 more points.

By doing this you'll end up with one random Meso Ranger equip, and the free random item box that comes with it.

But wait, there's more! You still have 3 more quests to turn in! At this point, sometimes you can acquire up to 2 more Meso Ranger equips still! That can only happen if you picked up one of the second tier tokens while you were killing monsters (Brazen Bravery, Willful Will and I think Trustful Trust?), first tier tokens are green, second tier are blue. **If you have two green tokens and one blue token, here's what you do to get one more random equip than you normally would.**

Keep in mind **this part is only if you picked up one blue token while you were hunting monsters** (in addition to already having two green tokens).

1. Since you still have the 3 token quests to turn in and already have one blue token, turn in **one** token quest. **MAKE SURE IT ISN'T THE QUEST OF THE TOKEN YOU ALREADY HAVE**. Look at the name of the token you have and look at the quest names, turn in any of the two that aren't the one you hold.
2. Take the test. You should have 2 blue tokens and one green token that show up in the window now.
3. You'll get 500 points from your token combination before you take the multiple choice part.
4. Use the combination 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, on the multiple choice part to get a total score of 1000.

And there you have it. So far you've gotten 2 pieces of equipment from one round of quests! And you're not even finished yet.

You should still have 2 more quests to turn in. Both will yield tier 2 tokens. Turn them in and take the test again. **Don't forget about the combo 3, 4, 1, 1, 3 to get your score to 1000**. 

And that's pretty much it!

**TL;DR: There are ways to maximize your turnout from the Meso Ranger event quests. If you have 3 green tokens once you've completed the quests, only turn in the books and then take the test. Then turn in the other quests and take the test again. Don't forget about the combination 3, 4, 1, 1, 3 for the multiple choice part!**

It has come to our attention (PHETZ and myself) that this board has been utterly flooded with topics such as ""I quit xxx years ago, whats changed since then?"" At times, nearly half the main page of /r/maplestory has been topics like these. **Therefore we have decided that these types of posts will no longer be allowed.**

No real punishment will be present, but the truth of the matter is that there are lots of other resources out there to research what is different about the game that does not hinder other peoples viewing of this subreddit. Sites like hidden-street.net, basilmarket, and nexon's official website should be able to provide all the information you need about what has changed.

If your question is very specific, it might not constitute breaking this rule, for instance:


**""I quit 3 years ago, whats changed since then?""** 
Will not be allowed

**""I haven't played for a few months and noticed PVP is dead now, whats up with that?""**

Curryishott has left us, and older Maplers may remember Tiger and Suuuuuushi (sorry if I didn't spell those correctly). With this new update, the level cap is being raised to 250! People like Fangblade probably don't even play anymore. A lot of those first few level 200s that still did play, like Curry, were really nice people, and represented a better Maple community. They are relics of a time when Tiger and Sushi would lead Papi raids in the race to level 200.

With this new update, we officially step into a new age for Maple Story. Any remnants of nostalgia for the old MS will be gone. This has been happening for the long time, most visibly with the incrementally easier EXP curve and the torrent of new classes (which, don't get me wrong, I did enjoy to some degree).

This new update represents that change in the MapleStory community. It used to be a community where there were few worlds, each of which had channels filled with people. The four big servers (Scania, Bera, Broa, and Windia) had enough server load to lag crappy computers. FM ch1 had 3 times as many people as it has now; the economy was bigger and better. Instead of killing monsters and doing quests that would get you to level 70 in an hour, people did Kerning PQ, Ludi PQ, LMPQ, OPQ, among others.

None of that is true anymore. I can't find people in the Free Market to sell things to; no one does the lower level party quests anymore, and some of them don't even exist anymore; all my old PQ and grinding buddies have disappeared; items depreciate rapidly; there are too many servers now, with too few people. FangBlade, Korwyn, Novinha, Starlightzz, and LoOpEdd may/will disappear from the front page, and the memory of what MapleStory once was will disappear with them.

tl;dr The new update, especially the raised level cap, marks a departure from the old MapleStory.",,False,self,t5_2rrdo,False,,scania,True,t3_1gjqr9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1gjqr9/why_i_think_this_new_update_is_landmark_for/,

    As many players were aware when Magnus was first released, the boss itself was not killable under normal means which meant that hackers would likely take advantage of it.

    When a player killed Magnus (Hard Mode) a message was shown to them saying congratulations as well as stating their victory was recorded.

    With this safely in place, Nexon was able to easily compile a list of any players who successfully killed Magnus, meaning they had used 3rd party programs or hacked. All of these players would not have to be Investigated and could easily be banned.

    This is an amazing day, likely the best in a long time, and cheers to Nexon America for their amazing ""sting operation."" There's already been dozens of threads made on other communities as well as our forums, and it's a very good sign. Dozens of well known hackers have stated they were banned as well.

    The best part, every single account attached to them was banned as well; so all mules, other accounts with hacked characters, and more were removed.

    Cheers, cheers, cheers, and what an amazing start of the new year.

1358374330.0,38,self.Maplestory,16plnc,Root Abyss guide,40,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/16plnc/root_abyss_guide/,"This guide is incomplete, as I have not yet beaten all of the Root Abyss bosses. Currently, the only bosses that need more work are Vellum and Bloody Queen. Any information on her mirror attack is useful, as it's proving to be a pretty big mystery and there's only so much charging blindly into a death trap will tell me. Any comments or corrections are greatly appreciated, as a lot of this is just guesswork from what I've witnessed.

It should also be noted that this guide is not entirely accurate for the Chaos versions of these bosses as they all have some extra tricks up their sleeves, but no one can even fight them until the 26th anyway.

**General**

Unlike previous bosses, none of the Root Abyss bosses have any skills that will make you go ""OH BULLSHIT"". Each and every one of the bosses here telegraphs their attacks and they can all be evaded, with varying degrees of difficulty. What's more, each boss has a gimmick. If you don't know the gimmick, you're gonna have a rough time. Also, each boss has a limited number of continues. Each party member has 5 lives, and after dying 5 times, you're kicked out of the map. Finally, it should be noted that between a level 200 who fights the bosses the same way they'd fight Zakum and a level 140 who knows all of the patterns and can dodge, the level 140 will be infinitely more useful, while the 200 will just use up all 5 of their lives instantly.

**Von Bon**

Von Bon is the first and easiest of the bosses. He has 5 attacks, none of which I know the proper names of so I'll just make shit up.

* Cane Whack - Von Bon raises his cane up and smacks you with it. Only used when someone is in range. Deals ~6000 damage.
* Energy Beam - Von Bon waves his cane around in circles 3 times before throwing a beam of energy out from it. Deals ~9000 damage. Ignores buffs.
* Earthquake - Von Bon jumps up and... lands. Deals 90% of your total HP. Ignores buffs.
* Whirlwind - Von Bon disappears for a second and then pops up somewhere else as a Whirlwind. Deals ~6000 damage and super knockback.
* Time Warp - Von Bon casts a debuff on someone. After a few seconds, that person will return to where they were when the debuff was cast.
* Time Rift - Von Bon raises his cane up and creates a crack in time somewhere in the map. Does no damage.

At the start of the fight, Von Bon will use only 3 skills - Cane Whack, Energy Beam, and Time Rift. To avoid Cane Whack, you must simply get out of range before it deals damage. To avoid Energy Beam, you only have to jump over the projectile, which, by the way, will instantly kill ANY magician class. It does not give even a single shit about Magic Guard. 

As for Time Rift, this skill is both his most dangerous attack and your greatest ally. The fight starts with the timer at about 5 minutes, which is probably not going to be enough to actually kill Von Bon. To fix this problem, you must lure Von Bon into the black clocks that he creates, while keeping him out of the white ones. While Von Bon is standing in a black clock, the timer will increase at a constant rate, giving you more time to finish him off. While he's in a white clock, however, the timer decreases rapidly, so you want to get him out of there.

After you get Von Bon down to about 50% of his max HP, he will throw Earthquake into the mix. Earthquake will deal about 90% of your HP if it hits, which means you should probably avoid that. As the name suggests, Earthquake is easily avoided by jumping. Kaisers should avoid transforming at this point to avoid being stuck on the ground.

At about 25% health, Von Bon will start casting Time Warp. There's not much you can do to avoid it AFAIK, but it's also not terribly hazardous. Just keep note of where you're gonna be after it return you to your previous location and try to steer his Energy Beams away from there.

At about 10% health, Von Bon stops using Time Rift and starts using Whirlwind. A lot. Every few seconds, Von Bon will disappear and then pop back up somewhere on the map. When he does, anyone close enough will take damage be knocked back and anyone that attempts to approach or attack him while he's in a whirlwind will take damage and be knocked back as well. Take this moment to recast any buffs. You can't do much else.

In short, Von Bon is pretty easy. He'll make quick work of anyone that chooses to rush into him blindly, but a coordinated team can take him down without much hassle.

**Pierre**

Pierre is the second boss, and requires a bit more coordination from your team to kill than Von Bon. On the plus side, he's weaker, and you aren't pressured to keep your health at max since he doesn't have any map wide 90% HP attacks like Von Bon. Pierre has 7 attacks. I also do not know the real names of these.

* Umbrella Strike - Pierre raises his umbrella up and then hits the ground with it. Deals ~4000 damage.
* [Umbrella Blast](http://i.imgur.com/Upgue.gif) - Pierre holds his umbrella out and then opens it. Deals ~12000 damage and super knockback.
* Hat Trick - Several jester hats fall from the sky and trap anyone under them. Deals 100% damage if escape is unsuccessful, deals no damage if escape is successful. Stuns the player.
* Color Shift - Pierre changes to either Red Pierre or Blue Pierre. Deals no damage.
* Whirlwind - Pierre turns into a whirlwind and pursues a player, leaving a trail of fire behind him. Deals ~14000 damage and inflicts seal. Only used while transformed into Blue Pierre.
* Umbrella Whack - Pierre whacks someone with his umbrella. Deals ~6000 damage. Only used while transformed into Red Pierre.
* Beatdown - Pierre disappears briefly before reappearing somewhere nearby and attacking 3 times. Deals ~60000 damage. Only used while transformed into Red Pierre.

Much like Von Bon, Pierre only uses 3 of his skills at the start of the fight, Umbrella Strike, Umbrella Blast, and Hat Trick. Umbrella Strike and Umbrella Blast are easy to dodge. For Umbrella Strike, simply jump or get out of the danger zone, which is right in front of Pierre. For Umbrella Blast, you need to get out of range, which is also the area directly in front of Pierre.

Hat Trick is cast continuously during the fight, and has no casting animation. When Hat Trick is cast, a number of pentacles appear on the ground and several seconds later, hats fall on them. If you are above a pentacle when the hats drop, you will be trapped underneath a hat for several seconds, preventing all movement and skills. While underneath a hat, you must continuously tap the left and right arrow keys until you break free. If you're too slow, you will die instantly.

At about 50% health, Pierre will start using Color Shift periodically. When Pierre uses Color Shift, he will transform into either Red Pierre or Blue Pierre and each party member will be wearing a blue or red hat. If a party member wearing a blue hat attacks Blue Pierre or a party member wearing a red hat attacks Red Pierre, he will be healed instead of damaged. While Pierre is transformed into either Red Pierre or Blue Pierre, he will cease using Umbrella Strike, Umbrella Blast, and Hat Trick and start using transformation specific skills.

While Pierre is transformed into Blue Pierre, he will continuously use Whirlwind. While using Whirlwind, Pierre will pursue a randomly chosen teammate leaving a trail of fire behind him. Being hit by Pierre himself in this state will inflict ~14000 damage and the seal status effect for several seconds. Standing in the fire that Pierre leaves behind will deal 5400 damage every second, but it will not seal you. According to one commenter, Pierre takes extra damage in this form, but I wasn't paying attention to my own numbers.

While Pierre is transformed into Red Pierre, he will attempt to hit any nearby party members with Umbrella Whack. Periodically, he will use Beatdown, which will kill most classes instantly. When he uses Beatdown, he will not move very far, and there is a small delay from when he reappears and when he does the attack. If you are for any reason near him when he reappears, move. Move very quickly.

All in all, Pierre is also not much to worry about. If your team is coordinated and doesn't heal him while he's transformed, he'll be even easier to defeat than Von Bon was.

**Bloody Queen (WIP)**

I do not know how to determine how much HP Lovely Mirror will heal Bloody Queen for. I've seen it heal her for 10% at times, 50% at others. I also don't know if there's a way to get out of the seduction before being killed or if there's a way to mitigate the health she recovers.

Bloody Queen is some bullshit. Of the 5 attacks she has, 3 of them kill you instantly and one of them kills you nearly instantly. Here we go.

* Slash - The standard attack. Bloody Queen pulls her arm back and makes a wide sweeping motion, damaging everyone in front of her and inflicting a status condition based on her face. Deals ~6000 damage and inflicts one of seal, confusion, poison, or darkness.
* Face Swap - Bloody Queen changes to a different face.
* Fire Plume - Bloody Queen turns black and blows a pink plume of fire in front of her. Deals 100% of the player's max HP in damage. Only used in Normal mode.
* Crimson Shield - Bloody Queen clasps her hands together and creates a large red shield around herself, making her invincible. Attacking Bloody Queen while the shield is up causes damage. Deals 100% of the player's max HP in damage. Only used in Weeping mode.
* Lovely Mirror - Bloody Queen sticks a finger up in the air and creates a magic mirror somewhere in the map that either lasts until it is destroyed or until its timer runs out. The mirror will cast seduction on nearby players and cause them to walk toward it. If a player touches the mirror while seduced, they will receive damage and Bloody Queen will be healed for some amount. Deals 100% of the player's max HP in damage. Only used in Winking mode.
* Black Hole - Bloody Queen holds her hand out and creates a black hole on the ground, dragging all players near the black hole toward it. Standing on the black hole will deal 3600 damage every second.  Only used in Grinning mode.

Bloody Queen is a veritable pain in the ass to fight from start to finish. First thing you need to know is that her slash attack, while not particularly painful, is a huge problem, as the status conditions it causes all have great synergy with her insta-kill attacks. While Bloody Queen is in Normal mode, Slash will cause darkness, preventing you from seeing her. While Bloody Queen is in Weeping mode, Slash will cause poison. While Bloody Queen is in Winking mode, Slash will cause seal, slowing you down from destroying her mirrors. While Bloody Queen is in Grinning mode, Slash will cause confusion, making you inadvertently walk into the black holes yourself.

In Normal mode, keep an eye out for her Fire Plume skill. Being in front of her when she uses it will result in a terminal case of death, and it has a rather long range. It's generally safer to just zip past her and keep attacking from behind, but if you're a slower class and already decently far from her, just create some distance. You do have to be quick, though, she only prepares for about half a second before raining death upon anyone too slow to get out of the way. If she blinds you, just run to the edge of the map that she's not at.

In Weeping mode, watch for the tell of her casting Crimson Shield. Do not get an extra attack in, as hitting her while her shield is up will kill you. It's best to do no damage and be alive than to do no damage and be dead.

In Winking mode, stay away from her mirrors. They heal her, kill you, and are overall pretty nasty. Make sure you have all cures or holy waters for this, as Slash will cause your skills to be sealed up. If you are affected by her mirror's seduction, the best course of action is to curse as many times as possible before you die or a teammate frees you.

In Grinning mode, stay in the air if you get too close to a black hole. The black holes cannot suck you in while you're airborne, giving you time to escape. If you find yourself on top of a black hole, jump and try to get out, as they will kill you very quickly.

I still haven't beaten her. A lot of this may get updated once I do, but this seems to be the general pattern. Fire Plume and Lovely Mirror are the most dangerous of her attacks.

**Vellum**

Remember when I said Von Bon is the easiest? I lied. Vellum, leader of the 4 seal guardians, did not spare your life in the starting quests because he is merciful, he spared your life because he cannot possibly *take* it from you. Now, his attacks.

* Dig - Vellum goes underground for a bit and then creates a yellow pentacle before popping up. Deals ~12000 damage and super knockback.
* Stalactite Crash - Several dark red pentacles appear on the ground before stalactites fall on them. Stuns.
* Fireball - Vellum glows white and then shoots off several fireballs. Deals 100% of the player's HP.
* Leap - Vellum goes underground for a bit and then creates a giant yellow pentacle before leaping from one end of the pentacle to the other. Deals 100% of player HP as damage.
* Poison Field - Vellum goes underground for a bit and then creates a yellow pentacle before popping up close to the ground. Vellum then glows green and creates several green lasting pentacles. Deals 3600 damage.

Vellum starts the fight off using only Dig and Stalactite Crash. Both of these attacks are insanely easy to avoid and neither of them are likely to kill you anyway. Simply stand away from the yellow pentacles that appear right before Vellum pops up and avoid the dark red ones and you're fine. Attack as much as possible, because he spends a lot of time underground.

Once Vellum reaches about 75% HP, he starts being a bit trickier. About half the time he pops up after using Dig, he will start using Fireball. If he does, players that are directly in front of him will be killed, as this is an OHKO move. Luckily, you don't even need to get fully behind Vellum to avoid damage. Simply standing under him will suffice. If you're capable of dodging Dig, you should be able to dodge this.

At 50%, Vellum will start using Leap. The telltale sign for this is that the pentacle is much bigger than that of Poison Field or Dig.

At around 25%, Vellum starts using Poison Field. This is his most dangerous attack by virtue of actually being able to hit you. Fortunately for you, it's still pretty easy to dodge.",,False,self,t5_2rrdo,1358700412.0,,khaini,True,t3_16plnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/16plnc/root_abyss_guide/,

I've been playing on and off since 05' (like most of us) and it's about time this community learned to step away from its obsession with wealth and power and returned to a state where we all just enjoy the game (like I know we all remember). My friend is still debating whether he would like to join me or not, so this may eventually turn into a dual-cast (he of course would be following along the same guidelines as I) if that helps sweeten the deal at all. Whether you'd watch it or not, I'd still enjoy any sort of feedback or fun ideas regarding the stream. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

For the last seven years, I’ve always been somewhat of an ambitious mapler—actually ambitious doesn’t cut it, I’ve been a full on addict. Nevertheless, my addiction has destroyed virtually every aspect of my well being, from my health, to my socioeconomic status, to my ability to function as a valuable component of society. This seemingly mundane hobby evolved much too far without my intentions, and now I sit here, a hopeless shell of a person.  However, the addiction is not completely agonistic as I am simply overjoyed when I play MaplesStory. That moment when you play newly released content, that “brrringg” sound when you level up, and the beautiful, tender faces of my fellow pixilated avatars warm the cockles of my heart. I LOVE MapleStory, and I’m not afraid to say it!  


My history as a mapler started during the game’s Beta testing period while I was in elementary school back in 2005. I had hopped around various online games such as RuneScape and Ragnarok, but nothing really captured my attention until the day came when I discovered MapleStory through a friend. The game hit me hard, and I quickly fell in love. Sooner or later, I saw MapleStory manifesting itself into my real life. Many of my school friends began playing, and the game became somewhat of an after-school social hangout.


Everything was fine for about a year until my addiction truly began. New content was being released after the beta test was over, but my internet was quite slow. I asked my parents if we could upgrade our internet, but they refused. I asked them every day, but they never agreed, until I began throwing tantrums. “ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN ME IN MAPLESTORY!” I screamed viciously at my parents every day. I destroyed bits and pieces of my house, punched walls, and gave my parents an ultimatum: upgrade the internet or I will destroy the house. I’m not sure if it was my perpetual nagging or my parents’ need to adapt to newer technology, but they eventually did it. 	MapleStory continued to consume my childhood; I would draw pictures of my character and various monsters on every single class assignment I had, I listened to MapleStory music in my free time on CDs in my car, MapleStory was the subject of all of my school conversations. We even started referring to each other by our online names and roleplaying MapleStory at recess. If I saw a snail on the side of a sidewalk I would smash it and scream something like “haha +4 experience!!” or something along those lines. When visiting anywhere, such as a park, I would pretend I was in a field full of monsters. My friends would soon grow out of the addiction, unlike me. I spent my summers mapling, even downloading maplestory on every computer I came into contact with so I would never have to be away from the game. I used my dad’s laptop to play on family vacations, even stealing it from him when he thought it was enough. 


Middle School was startin’ and hormones were a-ragin’. Everyone was excited to meet new friends, I however was to get straight home and hop onto MapleStory. The school days were longer and all I could think about in class was “maple maple maple maple maple.” I was usually a good student, but I opted out of doing homework in exchange to grind my ass off for hours after school My parents started cutting my allowance and computer time since they knew all I did was play MapleStory. I started copying people’s homework to maintain my grades so my parents would lay off of me, and that they did. I wasn’t in love with the game exclusively, I also found myself addicted to the Maple culture.  Most of my clothing consisted of MapleStory shirts I had ordered online, and my room was full of plushies of all types of monsters. I discovered forums such as basilmarket and sleepywood and spent lunch every day in the school library reading them, participating in maplestory discussions, and making maplestory comics using paint and photoshop. I started bringing footage of my gameplay into the school library and using their video editing software to make MMV’s and stuff like that. Cash shop was introduced and I began saving all of my lunch money in order to buy NX cash. I quit any other hobbies I had, such as basketball, to play MapleStory. Middle school was the transformation period, and as I entered high school, I was a full-blown addict. 


This is where many of the most destructive habits formed. Throughout high school, I ditched regularly in order to come home early and play MapleStory. Sometimes I would sneak into friends’ homes while they were merchanting and their computer was left on and steal some of their items and mesos.  I spent all of my money on MapleStory-related goods such as NX, iTCG , and clothes; but there was a burning desire for “more” within me. I needed cash, and lots of it. I began by trying to “work” with jobs such as babysitting but those tasks took too much time away from my mapling, so I began stealing cash from my parents’ wallets, but I reazlied that they would soon notice. Instead, I began stealing jewelry from my grandparents’ house and selling it. I noted that they too would eventually notice, so I deliberately stole whatever I could from wherever I could—supermarkets, peoples’ homes, school—and selling it on craigslist in order to make money to buy NX. Eventually, through someone at school who also played Maple, I got hookups for weed and started dealing, only to spend nearly all of my money on NX. This is still my primary source of income, and much of it still goes to Nexon. 


Maplestory also affected my sexuality generously. Since my addiction started at the root of adolescence, all of my sexuality has been strongly linked to the game. Initially, it was nothing major, just admiring cute avatars and well-drawn fan art of attractive characters. Eventually, like any other teenager, I started masturbating, but not to porn like the rest of my peers, but to hardcore maplestory hentai. I searched the internet and compiled folders upon folders of maplestory hentai, even saving some of it on my phone so I could fap on-the-go. I fapped to maplestory hentai exclusively until I started having cyber sex with one of my guild-mates. Eventually, we exchanged phone numbers and had phone sex as well. Through MapleStory I discovered I was bisexual, I had multiple online bfs and gfs and I regularly cybered with them. One of them even stopped in a town nearby and we met up, however he was a creep (he looked better in pictures) and was into some freaky stuff (that I won’t go into detail about). Much of my sexual fantasies involved something maplestory related, and I even started taking weird suggestions from people I met online (such as wearing women’s underwear or wearing diapers while I played). 


Throughout my addiction, I gained a great sum of weight, lost all of my childhood friends (since they quit), and have little to no connection with my family. However, I know that morally these things “matter” but in all honesty, I don’t really care. I don’t feel depressed or lacking in anything in life, but when I think about my life in the context of normal society, I see myself as “pathetic”. 


Anyways, the addiction still persists, albeit, not as strongly as it did in my youth (I'm looking for a job, working on school), and there is much more I can add, but I don’t want to bore you guys, I just needed to get everything off of my chest and am thankful to have found a community such as Reddit who will listen, unlike basilmarket who will just say “gtfo u stupid n00b get a lyf.” If there are any suggestions you guys have, please, let me know! 


**TLDR: addicted to maplestory for 7 years,  became my entire childhood and adolescence, started stealing crap and dealing weed to pay for NX, strongly influenced my sexuality, health, etc. ;still continues but I can’t seem to give a damn.**

1356573872.0,24,self.Maplestory,15hw6a,MechSoySauce's Guide to Maxing Traits (as requested),32,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/15hw6a/mechsoysauces_guide_to_maxing_traits_as_requested/,"**Traits Leveling Guide:**

**Ambition:**

1) Party Option - Kenta 10 times a day killing 20 pianuses each being worth 37 ambition each.

2) Solo Option - Go to security cameras in magatia (most accessible boss for a 29 ambition) or another ""wild boss"" and kill the boss. Channel surf and kill all the bosses.

3) Hot Time Events - Wear the special hats they give you on the character you want to boost traits. If you do this option, you have reached your daily trait cap, so the first 2 options won't benefit you.

**Empathy:**

1) Cheap Option - Herb Pick in the Herb Mines until you reach the daily cap of 500.

2) Expensive/Fast Option - Buy a ton of the Basic Herb Oil Bottles, and Marjoram Seeds and level Herbalism by making oils (or whatever you want, but this is the cheapest powerleveling materials) for the empathy bonus. Once you reach level 10 Herbalism, unlearn, relearn, and repeat the process. You'll need a ton of super moos for this. This process doesn't count toward your daily trait cap. You are highly recommended to max diligence first because it will make you gain double mastery experience 20% of the time, making you use less resources&gt;less expensive to level herbalism.

To guarantee leveling (w/o any double mastery %):

1 to 2: make 13 oils

2 to 3: make 30 oils

3 to 4: make 53 oils

4 to 5: make 80 oils

5 to 6: make 113 oils

6 to 7: make 150 oils

7 to 8: make 193 oils

8 to 9: make 240 oils

9 to 10: make 293 oils

Total: At most 1165 oils need to be made. Each cycle will get you at least 2 trait levels.

**Insight:**

1) Cheap/Efficient Option - Mine in the Ore Mines until you reach the daily cap of 500.

2) Expensive/Lazy/Non-efficient Option - Reveal a ton of hidden potted gear with Premium glasses.

**Willpower:**

1) Party Option - Complete Kenta 10 times a day for 440 willpower, and then finish off with Dragon Rider PQ for the rest of willpower.

2) Stay Online for consecutive hours.

3) Expensive/Fast Option - Buy a ton of the Basic Molds, and Silver/Opal Ores and level Mining by Smelting Plates (or whatever you want, but this is the cheapest powerleveling materials) for the Willpower bonus. Once you reach level 10 Mining, unlearn, relearn, and repeat the process. You'll need a ton of super moos for this. This process doesn't count toward your daily trait cap. You are highly recommended to max diligence first because it will make you gain double mastery experience 20% of the time, making you use less resources&gt;less expensive to level Mining.

To guarantee leveling (w/o any double mastery %):

1 to 2: make 13 plates

2 to 3: make 30 plates

3 to 4: make 53 plates

4 to 5: make 80 plates

5 to 6: make 113 plates

6 to 7: make 150 plates

7 to 8: make 193 plates

8 to 9: make 240 plates

9 to 10: make 293 plates

Total: At most 1165 plates need to be made. Each cycle will get you at least 2 trait levels.

4) Hot Time Events - Wear the special hats they give you on the character you want to boost traits. If you do this option, you have reached your daily trait cap, so the first 3 options won't benefit you.

**Diligence:**

1) Cheap Option - Smelt 50 plates for the daily cap.

2) Expensive/Fast Option - Buy/Make a ton of Opal/Silver Plates and level Smithing by making arrows (OR whatever you'll actually use this is the cheapest powerleveling option) for the diligence bonus. Once you reach level 10 Smithing, unlearn, relearn, and repeat the process. You'll need a ton of super moos for this. This process doesn't count toward your daily trait cap. No estimation on materials needed for this due to the many things you can make, but it's the same process as the other powerleveling methods.

**Charm:**

1) Fast/Expensive Option - Buy tons of NX and do the hair,face, or wear NX clothes.

2) Party/Cheap Option - Complete Kenta 10 times a day for 260 charm, and then finish off with Dragon Rider PQ for the rest of willpower.

3) Solo/Cheap/Efficient Option - Do Monster Park (especially during 2x drop). Buy 5 monster park tickets a day (there's a limit of 5 per day), and hoard ticket pieces for your respective level (exchange 10 pieces for 1 ticket) from monsters around your level. There's no limit on how many ticket pieces you can exchange for full tickets. Wait for a 2x drop event or buy a 2x drop coupon, and do monster park during 2x drop (big spider familar is highly recommended to increase monster park coin drop rates). Collect all the coins and the cologne(+5 charm)/other trait pots/equips, and once you have used up all your tickets, buy a lot of the Spiegelmann's Mustaches from the Monster Park NPC. Equip all the mustaches for the 100 charm each mustache. Think of each coin that you pick up as +2 charm since 50 coins gets you an 100 charm mustache.

There is a chance that you will be notified that there's a special monster on the map, kill it and you will be sent to a bonus map at the end of that Monster Park Run. Kill as many Spiegelmanns as you can and collect all the boxes. If you open the boxes and are lucky, you will receive an avarice pendant. This pendant when equipped will increase the drop rates of coins and equipment, making it even easier to level charm.

To be optimal in Monster Park, remember to bring out the big spider, wear your avarice pendant (when you get one), and monster park during 2x and if possible, with a 2x coupon.

Just give me a bannedstory scenario, or a simple screenshot from in game, or list your hairstyle and clothing and behold! A crudely drawn likeness is yours ~ ~.

**Also I'm looking to join a guild**. Needs to be active, any server and I'd like to actually be helpful aka if you're missing a priest or a DPS or an AOE I'll do that job. I just graduated my game art course and I have a couple of weeks before I have to go job hunting, and I'm looking to take advantage of said time!


edit: thanks guys, I am a little slow but I'm working on them right now! also, having an enlarged/non-jpeggy/equipment picture really helps so I don't have to make it up, so far all of them are totally readable so that's cool :0

edit2: I need to sleep and then eat and then watch a movie I'll be back at 5pm PST. feel free to keep posting, even if you don't get it right away I'll keep coming back to this thread whenever I have spare time. BUT you need to post your character or IGN here, I won't bother with PMing stuff

But for me, I can't just deal with it because my cap is pretty low and I can't afford to pay so much if it happens to goes over. So if your internet connection has been noticeably slower/bandwidth is getting taken up much quicker after installing maplestory, this may solve your problem.

&gt;""PMB runs in the background of your computer, and uploads various files, usually relevant to [Maplestory] to other players in a peer to peer fashion. This means [Nexon] does not need to pay for big servers as most of the files players download will be downloaded from other players, rather than from [Nexon] themselves.""

I've made billions in a few weeks crafting for hours on end, merching and whatever else have you.
It was fun and all until I realized I'll never ""get there"".
In most games you play, there's an incline to your progress and eventually you're done.. or nearly done.
In the case of Maple, the hours of work you put into it doing the attendance events, farming event related things, etc... doesn't come close to what should be happening.

For the people who play MS for the friend aspect, I can always go do that in other games AND enjoy legitimate progress. Having the events in such short successions makes MS feel like a chore and that if I miss x event, I can't get y reward, screwing myself over.
I simply don't have hours a day anymore to just focus on MS, I'd like to play other games and actually enjoy my time with them as well.

I'm hoping it'll change because I love what the game used to be.
There was no overly godlike person and the difference between a funded person and an average player was a tenth of what it is now.
I've done everything from quest lines to just hanging out with friends to enjoy the game and I have.
I just feel like that the only thing left to do is achieve success damage wise and that's just not worth my time right now.

1367450745.0,21,self.Maplestory,1dijwa,A Somewhat Comprehensive Kaiser Bossing Guide,26,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1dijwa/a_somewhat_comprehensive_kaiser_bossing_guide/,"So this isn't really a great guide, but I have some info and a video that goes with it, so hear me out!  I play a lot of Kaiser, and of course I'm not a vet like some Kaisers, (Not funded, other than Books), but I LOVE playing him, and exploring the class.

First things first: This is my how to boss guide as a Kaiser to maximize dps/m

1.) Gigas Wave is your highest DPS output.

2.) Wing Beat should ALWAYS be stacked on a boss regardless if the boss DR's or not.

3.) As you find fit, use Tempest Blades to add extra lines of damage, or to hit ads.

4.)  Stone Dragon can be summoned as often as possible to hit high numbers periodically and group mobs towards him.^1

5.) Inferno the ground as often as you can seeing as the ""flame tiles"" will increase your dps more than not! (Be careful on DR!)^1

6.)  Ancestral Prominence deals massive damage and should be used as the cooldown is ready!^1

Basically as a Kaiser your main idea is keeping Wing Beat on an enemy and slamming the enemy with Gigas Wave.  Now many people think that your damage goes up so much while in Final Transformation.  **This is NOT correct**.  Though you will add extra lines and increase your damage, it lowers your attack speed by possibly 2.  Final Trans will slow down your output, and thus lower your total dpm.

How To Time DR's:  Of course most of the popular bosses have a damage reflect.  Now the best thing about being a Kaiser is that you can attack through Boss buffs such as DR, or Physical Ignore.  Now, when fighting bosses that have a Damage Reflect, ONLY trans during the DR and drop trans right as it ends.  For anyone who is 150+ and has the hyper skill: *Majestic Presence* can potentially never have to transform.  Once you can anticipate DR's and time them you'll be able to attack through them.

Wing Beat Stacking: You can stack your Untrans'd blue wing beats on top of your trans'd purple wing beats for a total of 6 wing beats at a time.  It is highly recommended to throw up three wing beats right before you transform to maximize DPS.^1

Somewhat Infinite Transformation: ""[Y]ou can technically stay in transform 100% of the time. When your current transform is about to end turn on tempest blades; When it does end use majesty then launch the blades and throw 3 wingbeats, then spam command gigas wave. In 15-20seconds your dragon gauge should be full and as majesty is about to end you can go back into transform.  Though [he] highly suggest[s] learning how to time dr at bosses as staying in transform hinders your dps.""^2

DRAGON BARRAGE I-FRAMES:  This is my FAVORITE part about being a Kaiser, and about maplestory.  Now many classes have skills that can induce I-Frames but Kaiser's is one of the longest, and easiest to time.  In this video that I've made, (pardon my poor commentating) I display the correct way to utilize your I-Frames: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzIaWLl-fl8  Using this you can dodge 1/1s Seduce and anything else that some random boss will throw at you.  Not to mention that Cursebite will give you resistance to states.

If you're still sticking with me through this horribly put together guide, thank you!  Finally just some useful tidbits of knowledge for people!


Wing Beat Healing: While Wing Beat is stacked on an opponent Gigas Wave will heal MORE than it should.  I don't know if this is a glitch or intended, but where command skills heal you for ~2% of your total hp per hit, Wing Beat + Gigas Wave will do about 4 ticks per attack, giving you CLOSE to 10% hp every time you use Gigas Slash which makes you nearly invulnerable.

Blade Storm I-Frames:  I've noticed that occasionally while SPAMMING Blade Storm I'm invincible while I keep using it, but that's just a rare occasion and usually only protects me from magical attacks, a lot more research is needed here.

I hope all of this helps!  It's a very poorly formulated guide, and I'm sorry about that!  I hope this helps any of you Kaisers out there, if any other vet Kaisers find anything I need to correct let me know.  The Infinite Final Trans glitch may have been fixed now, seeing as they fixed Terms and Conditions a little while back.

That means that the people helping needs to be trusted as well as being able to read my instructions (e.g. duplicates hunting spots).

I'm planning on having NX prizes (if not, I'm up for suggestions) for everyone helping out. Once I get the usersystem up I'll allow more users to help in.

You'll be able to keep track using a contribution page and basically, it's a contest. The more you do *(SOLID Information here, no spam just to increase your contribution)* the more you get.

But for now, I need helping just adding the fundamental data until the account system is up (Now, I am calculating the contribution from the start already).

Worth noting is that I'm in close contact with Hidden-street so in the future I might be able to integrate their database even better.

Dec 28th, we had 934 Unique visitors to this subreddit. This somewhat amazes me that this community has started becoming so active. I realize the vast majority of these uniques are lurkers, but still, its pretty cool to think that what you post here is going to be seen by so many people.

IGN: yankskinz Server: Mardia,28,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1jagnn/story_from_an_old_player_ign_yankskinz_server/,"Hey guys. I used to sink a lot of time into this game back in the early days probably starting in about 2007. Took me forever to get to 30 and I played a fucking wizard class with only the frozen tuna (I didn't know how to use spells and shit ok? The tuna was a fucking beast) which was interesting. Probably the most exciting things for me back then were gm events and finding king slimes. 

Then I got a bit more competent and made an aran after they came out. Got it up to 100 and probably put in $150 worth of mesos on those sketchy meso selling sites and funded his equips. Then I got some nexon cash or whatever it's called and bought a mount.

Now this mount was a helicopter and I happened to discover quite the glitch with it. Honestly it was the weirdest fucking glitch and I abused the hell out of it. So when you held a polearm (and I was an aran) and then tried to move in the mount your game would crash imediately. So I was a bit pissed that my mount that I payed for was crashing my game but honestly what more could I expect from nexon? I wanted to actually move in the mount so I would equip then unequip (keybind) and then move a bit and repeat.Turned out that when you held a polearm (other weapons did not have this effect) and went on and off of the mount and spammed that while slowly moving forward (but never when you were on the mount) it crashed every player in the area you were in. So that was amazing. Need an FM1 spot? I got you covered. Favorite grinding area full? Crash em all. I never got caught either. I was able to use it for a good 40-50 days until it was fixed and my mount expired. 

Then I grinded and made a crimson arcglaive to 145 attack unhammered with those 50% scrolls and white scrolls and made a lot of weird shit like a stirgeman's cloak of justice and a lot of stirgeman's pants....That shit was cool. I think I had like 6% strength red goggles too and glasses were rare as fuck.

Reached level 137 and then I got scammed by a friend and lost my crimson arcglaive I had put so much into. So I gave all my shit away (to a guy who might have been named 0DarkKnight0 that plays under names like 0Dark(insert class here)0 but anyways) and that was that. Sure I regret giving all of it away but at the time I just wanted to make it so I couldn't go back again. And it worked. I haven't played since but I kind of do just to see things again.

This post was a bit odd but I just wanted to share my fond memories of the place.

Also if you know a guy named 0DarkKnight0 or something similar tell him about this thread and tell him that it was fun playing the game with him.

Three (more) new jobs are coming to KMS in the next few months: *Cannon Shooter*, *Mercedes* (the King of Elves), and the *Demon Slayer*. The Cannon Shooter is another Adventurer branch (like Dual Blades), Mercedes is the Archer Legend (like Aran/Evan), and Demon Slayers are a third Resistance branch.

I will be helping people out with anything I can possibly help with but here are a few things I can do off the top of my head.

**Zakum Runs**

As long as you have your pre quests done I will be doing 2 Zakum runs a day and anyone is welcome to join me. Do you need books? Come join. Want a Zakum Helm? Come join. Just wanna do runs for fun? Come join! 

**Targa/Scarlion Runs**

I can help anyone who wants a Targa or Scarlion helm get one. It is easier to do this if two people come with me but if only one person needs one at a time then I can use another computer at my house to log on a mule account.

**Horntail Runs**

These will need to be set up a little bit in advance since to make these go faster I will need to get a friend to come with us. So let me know like a day ahead of time if you want to do a Horntail run so I can set it up. Also if you have a Badge (Still getting mine atm) and wanna help out with this then feel free to let me know!

**Hilla Runs**

This is another alternative for people too get Skill Books if they can't do Zakum pre quests. This one is a bit harder for me since I play a Demon Slayer and even though my damage is fine her Damage Reflect really messes me up. That being said I can still solo her if you need it and I can get someone too easily come help if need be!

**Alien Doors**

I am able to door people too Aliens but it will be a 1 door per person per day thing. I don't want to have to keep logging on to door you 4-5 times because you forgot potions, so make sure you are ready to stay there before I door you!

**Other PQ's/Expeditions**

I don't do many other PQ's/Expeditions but if someone needs/wants to do a different one than posted just let me know. I will learn how to do them in advance so that I can do quick and efficient runs. Just let me know!

**Guild Invites**

I am part of a smaller guild that is fairly new but we always have nice people online! Anyone is welcome to join our little family as long as you are kind and respectful to your other fellow players! Being in the guild is NOT required to get my help, It helps to make organizing runs easier but do NOT feel like you need to join unless you want to meet some great people. :]



**Small FAQ:**

*What's your name good sir?*

My name is Seth and my main characters name is CrossedLotus.

*What class is your main?*

I think I already mentioned it but I play a Demon Slayer and as of this post he is 161. I also sometimes play my 154 Hayato who's IGN is CalmingLotus.

*What is your range?*

Not gonna brag about it but just know it is enough to solo a good portion of bosses (Non Hard Mode).

*Why are you helping out?*

Why not? But seriously I just want to meet some cool new people and I know how it feels to not know many people and have trouble with certain content in game because you aren't able to get the best gear.

*Do I need to do anything in return for you? :o*

Nope. This is all free and it shall be free for as long as I play this game! Though a thank you is always appreciated and make sure to let other people know about me if they need help with anything!

*What bosses can you not help with at the moment?*

I can't help you with Pink Bean (Never tried but I doubt it anyways), Cygnus Empress, or Magnus. There may be others I can't do but I can't think of them off the top of my head.

*What time zone do you live in?*

I live in PST which is the time that Maplestory/Nexon is synced to.

Thank you for reading all this and I hope too see and help you guys out in game! :D

1362381107.0,19,self.Maplestory,19ml1g,"Farewell, Maple",30,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/19ml1g/farewell_maple/,"After joining shortly before the launch of Ludibrium, I've played Maplestory religiously, but ever since the launch of Big Bang here in GMS the game and the company behind it have been making a turn for the worse. There have been countless game-breaking exploits and hacks, there has been lackluster customer service, and there has been shoddy maintenance. I first started to lose interest in Maplestory after the launch of the first major revamp, Big Bang. This update brought about what many maplers called ""The lag of death"", caused by a memory leak from the NPCs Gaga, Maple Admin, and Cassandra. I stopped playing after a month of trying to bear with unusable towns, but was lucky enough to receive a different, weaker and older, computer from my sister the following summer that was capable of running the game.

Thanks to my sister's generosity and the timing of the summer revamp, Chaos, I ran into a group of Maplers on the forums, some of whom I still play other games with to this day. We began anew on the server Chaos, hoping to get a fresh start in a new world so that we could have a chance at being maple legends. This sadly wasn't meant to be, as within weeks the server truly earned its name. Hacks and exploits went rampant at this time, due to a popular hacking website introducing a free trial of their program. (This website still to this day is a parasite sucking the life out of the game.)

After my guild fell apart, myself and two of my guild mates returned to Scania. I continued to play Maple from August of 2011 up until the following summer of 2012. In June, I graduated from high school, and some of my friends seemed to graduate from Maplestory. Without my 'IRL' friends to play with, I saw no reason in playing the game. I contemplated selling my accounts, as I had offers from in-game friends going into the hundreds. Luckily, I found the Maplestory subreddit, where I found Mike, or DevenAtuDeae as many knew him at the time. Mike invited me into his guild, reddit. reddit offered me many new friends and an opportunity to finally reach the goals I had had since I started playing at the age of 13. 

Two level 160's and over 15 billion mesos. That's what I have done since I joined reddit. But even still, that's nothing. Even with my level 165 Shadower and 7 billion in equipment funding, I find myself unable to enjoy the game. Why can't I enjoy it? Because I can't do anything. And what little I can do, is meaningless. Why is it meaningless? Because I gain nothing from it and my old friends aren't there to enjoy it with me.

These are the 2 reasons why I'm quitting. Because it's finally my time to join my old friends. I'm nearly 20 years old, and I'll be graduating from college in a little over a year from now. I've got great friends that I can see almost everyday, but I don't. Because they're not here with me on this game.

Nothing. I gain nothing from this game or in this game anymore. The only people who seem to get anywhere are those who've got more time than me, more money than me, or who hack. Scarlion and Zakum were fun for a while, but what about Empress? What about Magnus? What about Root Abyss? These bosses are where the profit lie, but Nexon guards them like they're sacred relics. We hear every week about someone being unjustly banned because of the excessive and poorly coded hack prevention that Nexon is using. This is a result of Nexon letting a problem going unsolved for too long. I'm glad that they finally caught on, but it seems like it's too late for them to fix the problem. Even they seem to be getting every last bit they can from the game with all the pay-to-win events they launch.

I won't say I didn't enjoy the time I've had playing this game, in fact I wish it didn't have to end. But when a game requires me to play more than I go to work just to be able to reach end-game while it still classifies as end-game, I know it's time to quit. 

I'll miss you guys. 

Mike, Jig, Danny, and the rest of reddit: It's been a blast, and I'll try to hop on every few months to check on you guys. 

Gary, Mauricio, Mario, Josh, and Brian: I'll always miss coming back to school everyday and talking to you all about our adventures of the previous day. 

Shelby, Alex, AJ, and the rest of the Chaos Executives: I wish our guild didn't have to end the way it did, but at least we had a good run.

		Have Fun Mapling

TL;DR: **I QUIT**!

1361329818.0,16,self.Maplestory,18v2k5,"I just started playing Maplestory again since leaving in 2005/6. Pretty much, my reaction to everything: ""Whaaa?""",23,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/18v2k5/i_just_started_playing_maplestory_again_since/,"This will be a lil' bit of a rant. I dunno, I feel like I want to say this somewhere. I'm confused about what's happened to the game of my childhood.

Back in the day, my 14 year old self discovered Maplestory. There were two servers when I first started, Bera and Scania, and I mostly used Bera.

I left after Broa was created (and I think I logged back on once and created some beginner in Windia but it never went anywhere).

So I came back to Maplestory after it was released on Steam nearly eight years later as a 21 year old now. And here's what I found:

* **The main towns on Victoria Island seem dead to me.** They used to be *packed* with people trying to sell stuff, just chats going out; I remember trying to pack my way into a party for the Kerning City PQ with my warrior whose stats I had allocated wrongly and just having a grand old time (I never did level him very far, after awhile it was just me logging in to chat up with people and trying to grind slowly). Now? There's no one on Victoria Island anymore, at least in Bera when I walk around. Lith Harbor? Ha. I even accidentally went to some other town through some portal thing, and I couldn't find anyone there either. I've logged into all these different times of day; I ended up doing the 'Mushking Quest' by myself (I just created a party and had to kill those mofos with my now fighter by myself, ech). What happened to everyone?

* **I don't understand the new classes at all and the odd stories that come with them**. I was thinking about going to one of the new servers, but with the six (?) different options, I could not figure out how to end up just back on Maple Island killin' folk and stuff. No matter what I did, I seemed to end up in these awful, awful, awful cutscene things about a spaceship and guns and stuff. I looked online and it said 'explorers are the traditional choices' or whatever, but ""Jett"" seems to be the only explorer I can create; I finally figured it out a few minutes ago that I had to click a different button instead. The other classes just make things more... confusing. And also, pirates?!? (Although those aren't nearly as bad as the others). And it looks silly. Speaking of...

* **Everyone in this game looks like magical fairies with pixie dust surrounding them now.** I remember when the Cash Shop was first created, and all the people on my buddy list would laugh at how silly these kids were, jumping around with 'cool' sunglasses and stuff. I came back, and suddenly everyone looks like they're in a K-Pop band with sparkles slowly dropping around them. I dunno, I miss the times when there weren't Call of Duty-style badges that would brand people and simpler uniform stuff (where I could look at someone and say, ""Oh! Crusader! Right!"").

* *Leveling up has become much easier*. I managed to gain about ten levels in a day. I still went ""Whaaaa!!"" to this, but it was more of a, ""Yeah!!"" kinda whaaa. Because that was what really drove me from this game, the sheer grind of it. It's nice to know that the work you're putting into something isn't just for nothing; maybe it's not as satisfying as it once was, but whatever.

Sorry about the tone throughout this, I feel like an old geezer shouting, ""Back in mah day, grandson!!"" Maybe I am, the sheer amount of servers now is kind of shocking to me. Here's to playing and grinding alone for the time being though on Victoria Island (I can't believe how much bigger it's gotten either, 'El Nath'!! Ha! Wow!). I do miss this game a bit though, so y'all might see me around here now and then. :)",,False,self,t5_2rrdo,False,,bera,True,t3_18v2k5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/18v2k5/i_just_started_playing_maplestory_again_since/,

3. This is where not being active for 6 months comes in. Coming in after a long break gives you the privilege of buying ANY item in the Cash Shop for 10% of its original price. From this knowledge, you should buy either one of two things: A 11-pack Premium Surprise Style Box (from Random Rewards) for 3k NX, or a 35-pack Gachapon Ticket pack (also from Random Rewards).

4. But what do you need 5k nx for if you're only buying 3k NX? You can use that lingering 2k NX to buy a Shop Permit (from the Free Market and Accessories tab) for 1.8k NX. This allows you to set up a shop and leave it overnight so that people can buy the goods you get from the Gachapon.

(15 levels below or 15 levels above? To be safe, go for 10)
*If above level 150, disregard and just make sure the monster is above level 150.

2) Are you able to traverse the map easily?
*No huge ropes to climb, your skills can reach a majority of the platforms

3) Is the map not in Evolving World or NLC? (Haunted House is alright)
*Evolving World 100% does NOT drop a single box, not even if you pray to Nexon and perform the ancient rain dance of your people

4) Can you kill the monsters effectively?
*Anything more than 2 attacks to kill is too slow. There's no drop rate bonus if you hunt more difficult monsters, the rate is equally crappy for all

5) Remember that the gold town boxes you click to open do NOT give Empress equipment. Nor will they give out Empress equipment after May 16, so avoid them all together unless you have a fetish for Maple Leaves and untradeable potions. (See Tips and Tricks section for more details)

P.S. Since there is a 90% chance you're collecting these for Empress equips, please be aware that they will NOT be available until the 16th.
*Boxes hoarded prior to May 16 will give out Empress, but only if you open them after the 16th.
P.P.S The boxes are purple with a large '8' on them. If you cannot see the color purple, please consult your doctor. 

tl;dr version

1) MONSTER SAME LEVEL
2) SUPER EASY FLATMAP
3) NO EVO WORLD U NOOB
3a) I SAID NO EVO WORLD NOOB NO QUESTIONS ASKED
4) OHKO OR YOU FAIL NOOB
5) PRESS 'Z' TO PICK UP PURPLE BOXES
6) TOWN CLICKY CLICKY BOX NO EMPRESS.
6a) HUNT MONSTER LAZY NOOB

P.S. DONT OPEN UNTIL MAY 16 OR YOU WILL DIE A MISERABLE, EMPRESS-DEPRIVED DEATH
P.P.S SERIOUSLY DON'T OPEN THEM UNTIL MAY 16
P.P.P.S Unless you want mediocre Maple equipment, you noob.

Other Tips and Tricks

-The golden clicky clicky boxes in town DO have a small chance of giving out the purple celebration boxes as well. To make this as unconfusing as possible:
Click the box in town -&gt; Open the box it drops -&gt; Small chance of the sexy purple Empress box. Boxception. Kinky.
*Has a limit of 50 a day, plus you get leaves and coins to scroll your sexy, currently unavailable Empress equipment

-For higher leveled monsters, try Leafre, Temple of Time, Lower Clocktower, and even Golden Temple if you're feeling hipster. As always, Future Henesys for the very high leveled. For ultimate hipster, Edelstein has monsters of every tier up to 120.

-If you want to be the ultimate box-collecting machine, make a new character and get it to 30, then go to the doll machines in Kerning Square.
*For the absolute manic, feel free to get a pet with an Item Bag and Shoes
**Nexon did not pay me to suggest that, I swear.

-The boxes will be able to give out Empress weapons and capes. Don't hold your breath for shoulders though, they didn't exist when this event was made.

-Remember that the boxes also contain every freaking Maple equip with this event, their respective scrolls/stamps, as well as coins and possibly sacrificed livestock. As such, don't curse the heavens and sell your soul to the devil if you don't get an Empress with the first 10 or so boxes.

-I cannot stress enough that you must wait until May 16th. Possibly longer because Nexon most likely put May 2016.

FAQ

Does Evolving Wo-
NO IT DOES NOT I TOLD YOU ALREADY

OMG I DIDN'T GET EMPRESS U LIED
Wait until May 16, 2013

There's no monsters near my level...?
You're not looking hard enough. There are dozens upon dozens of maps that have monsters of all sorts of levels. Even Basil in all its outdatedness is still accurate to a degree on monsters.

But wait, what if Nexon made a mistake on Evolvin-
GET OUT

Why can't I access the Falling Leaves quest?
This is irrelevant, but I'll answer it anyway. Nexon has poor planning skills, and thus made the quest limited to 1 person per channel, working similar to a party quest.
You know all those quests where that NPC tells you ""If someone is currently in there, you cannot enter"" Same thing, but this time there's ACTUALLY someone in there. Shocker.

Will I be able to trade and sell these Empress equips?
Of course you are, Nexon's too lazy to create a seperate untradeable version of the Empress equipment, and they don't care about your precious economy either; so deflate away!

EMPRESS?one!1?
Yes, Empress.

Will Nexon ever give out Tyrant or Root Abyss pieces?
Be sure to sacrifice the holy lamb during your rain dance

I thought I would share a tale, a story if you will about my experiences in the Maple world.  It all started around 8-9 years ago I want to say?  (God, it's been almost a decade - I am getting old).  I stopped playing before the Big Bang, started a new character this weekend, and quit after I reached lvl 48 in a day.


Here we go... settle down and find a nice comfy spot.


**I** was in middle school, 7th grade to be precise if my memory serves me right.  I got into Maplestory because a bunch of people in my middle school played the game, so I decided to join them.  I joined the Beta and created a rogue/assassin on Tespia (for those of you who don't know Tespia - it was the world for the Beta, before Scania/Bera/etc. were released).

**My** friends and I would play almost every day during the week and every weekend.  Because I wasn't supposed to play video games during the week, I had to try and sneak playing Maplestory while my parents weren't watching.  You know, try to kill a few mushrooms here and there, jump onto a rope and heal while my parents were around, rinse and repeat.

**Back then**, it took a month if not more to reach level 30 and do your 2nd job advancement (it was even harder to level in Beta than it was in pre-bigbang official release).  I remember all the memories I had in exploring the Maple world.  My friends and I traveled throughout Victoria Island and found the Stone Golems.  We travelled all the way through Sleepywood Dungeon using Dark Sight (go thieves!) and saw the Taurmacis and Taurospears.  I was simply in awe of these monstrous things that no one could kill.  The Maple world seemed to be limitless and appeared to have no end in sight for how far I could go.  

**The place** where all the ""high"" level people would go was the Sleepywood Sauna (lvl30+).  Channel 1 Sleepywood regular sauna (not the VIP sauna, psh) was where everyone would come hang out and talk.  We'd met new friends there, talk and relax, play drop games, you name it.  There'd be the occasional or frequent hacker who fly around the sauna would vac-hack dropped items to himself and steal them.  Heck, some of them would use their hacks to hide in the bottom corner of the map and vac items from there.  Haha a lot of us got mad about that back in the day, but looking back, it was a truly memorable time.

**There** was Kernning PQ.  Back then, it was all about if you had a track and if you had an autoclicker.  In case you don't know/remember, tracks were the names of people who were in the PQ at the time (because PQs can only have 1 party doing it at a time per channel).  People bought these tracks from other people in order to follow their progress throughout the PQ and approximate when they were going to be done.  Autoclickers were 3rd party programs (you'd get banned for this now) that would let you keep clicking on the NPC responsible for starting the PQ - this was that girl in front of the Kernning sewers.

**Regardless**, let's get to the point.  Back then, there'd be huge waits to get into the PQ.  Even though this felt frustrating back then, it was enjoyable too.  I met so many awesome people in PQs and waiting for PQs.  As a low level 21-25 assassin, no one wanted me in their parties, but occasionally, some nice guy would add me and let me in.  I just remember the first level of the Kernning PQ where you needed to kill like 25-30 strong crocodiles for their passes, and I couldn't hit them for jack damage.  Mages were the only class that could clear this stage quickly because of their ungodly damage in Kernning PQ back then.  It was such an exhilarating feeling getting through the PQ quickly.  I remember that we'd always send one person out of the PQ first to ""check"" and see if the coast was clear.  This person would leave the PQ and check the sewer area of Kernning to see if any other party was waiting to get in.  We'd either make a mad dash to beat them, have the person who left early to give them a track to another channel to get them to leave, or simply make the most use of our time and stay in the bonus stage :)

**In these times** of Beta and Official Maple, before the release of the Free Market, the #1 place to buy and sell your stuff was Perion Channel 1.  The whole bottom floor was packed with people everywhere yelling, ""B&gt;WIOEURIOEW@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" or ""S&gt;WIOWIEUROWE@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@,"" adding as many @ signs to get their speech balloon higher than everyone else.  You would be able to press up in the chat to get your previous message to show up again.  But if you kept spamming your message too quickly, you'd be muted for a short while - in this way, it was almost an art form to effectively/efficiently get your message read by other people in Perion1.  You could make amazing money in Perion1.  Oh a Chas Robe for 100k??  I'll pick that up and resell it.  Steely stars for 8mil??  That's a steal, I'll resell it for 9-10mil (short story: I got my first set of steelys in Kerning City when while waiting for  PQ, someone dropped them.  I guess he wanted to mess around with people by playing a drop game, but at that exact moment I had coincidentally jumped down from above and picked up his set of knives.  It was completely on accident but instantly made me the richest level 30).  My friends and I would make bank buying and reselling things.  Heck, there'd be times when we would buy up the competition so that we would have the only supply of that particular item.  Then, we'd be making real dough haha.

**There** were certain items that everyone wanted.  All magicians wanted a panlid.  I remember training with my friends in that 1st map to the left of Henesys where there were mushrooms/snails on the lowest level, then slimes, then orange mushrooms, then green mushrooms at the top.  Only the strongest of us could face those green shrooms.  Either that or a bowman/assassin botting at the straw bales there, shooting their arrows/stars at a safe distance.  If a panlid dropped from a green shroom, you were a millionaire easy.

**When Scania** was first released, all of us Beta players got a Mark of the Beta hat from a creepy looking NPC in Lith Harbor (Mark of the Beta was that black bandana with a red maple leaf on it).  I feel that the number of people in the game with a Mark of the Beta hat has gone to a tremendously low number as a lot of us have moved on with our lives - some of us are in college, graduated college, have real jobs with families, etc.

**I eventually** got to become a lvl 60ish bandit (I became a bandit once the Beta ended) on Khaini (I quit my Scania character).  I was friends with some people who seem to be big names now - Salleem, ggxmel, ryanxus7, edwardxus7, KhainPriest (not a close friend but in the same guild), etc..  There was also SaIIeem (looked like Salleem in game) who was apparently Salleem's brother.  This confused me at first haha.  

**Regardless,** I took a 'dark turn' and started hacking with my friends once we had leveled to ~lvl60 'legitly.'  A lot of my old friends like Salleem, ggxmel, Ryanxus7, etc. refused to talk to us and still be friends with us.  I remember edwardxus7 was a good guy and was still our friend, despite what we did.  Regardless, I ended up getting banned at around lvl87 (heck, can't blame anyone but me) as a Chief Bandit in Khaini, while training on those black cat things in Orbis which would drop the tails - forgot their names.  To be honest, I think I had more fun hacking than playing legitly.  Hacking let me level quickly, giving me that great feeling of leveling up and putting points into new skills while also letting me hang out with my Maple friends and hanging out with them in game.  Once a lot of my Maple friends stopped wanting to be friends with me, I kind of lost interest in the game, so the ban came at a good time.

**At this point**, I quit playing and didn't look back for around a year.  At this point, I started a new character - a priest to be exact and got him to around level 83.  It was fun to meet new friends again, because who DOESN'T want a priest to level with?  You got to love Holy Symbol.  I remember leveling up at the Puppet Ghost guys in Ludi before I ended up selling this character and quitting.



**So here** I was this weekend and today.  I reinstalled Maplestory a few days ago and saw there were a million different classes now.  I figured I would look up info on each on Google and decided to create a Dual Blades (I heard they were a great character!).  I was hitting gigantic numbers that I wasn't hitting on my bandit/priest at a ridiculously low level.  I hit level 48 this weekend after only a day and a half of playing!  I felt a pretty hollow feeling when I would level up - no ecstatic feeling of OMG, I did it!  I bought equips from the store but soon realized that I was leveling faster than the equips could be used for.  Clearing monsters was a joke.  I used my Tornado move which would clear all the monsters WHILE pushing me forward.  I found a flat map to train on and went back and forth clearing monster after monster wave, leveling at an insane rate.

**None** of my old middle school friends played this time.  I couldn't find college friends to join me - we're all busy seniors trying to find jobs now.  It was just me, a guy who was nostalgic for his past and came back to relive a childhood that was meant to only be lived 8 years ago when the game still felt magical - when you would look at people like Tiger (I heard he got banned), Fangblade, level 1xx's, level 8x's, even level 4x's and 5x's in awe as you and your group of friends traveled the seemingly endless Maple world, partied together to feel the sweet feeling of leveling even 1 level after a few long days.  F2'ing each other and congratulating each other for a job well done.  We met lots of awesome people in that game as we performed the same repetitive task each day that somehow retained its magic throughout the years, at least enough to draw me back into the game many, many years later.  We were young back then -  the game has since changed and so have we.  I won't be going back to my new character I made.  Post-Big Bang Maplestory had deviated too much from what it used to be - a game when meeting new friends was just as important as leveling.  I met a lot of great people and am glad I did.  I think this concludes my Maple career, from Beta to Official Release to hacker to legit 3rd jobber :) to new dualblader.

1371714814.0,15,self.Maplestory,1gprsg,MapleNostalgia - 8 years of memories,19,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1gprsg/maplenostalgia_8_years_of_memories/,"I'll post some random nostalgia since I have nothing better to do right now and this patch made me realize how much MS has changed (I joined when Khaini was released, nearly 8 years ago. I was also pretty young back then):

- My brother and I once had a plan to kill Golems by using Snail Shell back when it was 100% accuracy. We thought if we collected maybe 100 red snail shells and chucked them at the Golems we'd get like a level per kill

- When I first read about Pico Pico hammer on hiddenstreet (I browsed it for fun lol) I was like ""omg why so low attack and it's super fast attack speed"" and immediately imagined myself killing Zakum by hitting infinite 1s at light speed.

- I used to take screenshots when I saw people over level 50

- My friend (who introduced me to Maple and even had a Mark of the Beta) lent me wooden tops, which were like 80k back then (A LOT OF MONEY). A few years later, while we were reminiscing about stuff (I stopped playing for a year or two during that time, I've been playing on and off a lot), he was like ""hey you still owe me like 100k for those wooden tops"". He's stopped playing for a while by then, and didn't realize the economy had already changed a lot by 2 or 3 years (I had like 100m at the time and thought I was pretty rich)

- Spending 20 minutes rolling stats to get that beautiful 4/4

- The same friend had introduced me to the game as a Warrior, and taught be about the way STR and DEX should be added (I don't even remember anymore). I got to level 18 after about a month, and decided to make a mage. I used the same skill build and remember magic claw hitting 2s (I was using an independence day flag too, but I remember thinking about how cool Magic Claw looked)

- Amoria Haircut thing. Gotta get dat Antagonist. I quit one of my higher-leveled mages (and by higher-leveled I mean like 15) because I got that ugly buzz-cut with the Z in it.

- Lucidas (I think that's what they were called) in Amoria and looting mesos and dying a lot

- People dropping things in that Henesys little platform where you couldn't stand that was right outside FM (it was like a little stand). My dream was to get to level 70 on an Assassin to get Flash Jump - I was convinced that I would immediately get rich from being able to loot all those awesome things

- My level 22 main warrior is still trapped in Omega Sector (I just recovered the account a few months ago after it being hacked for like 5 years). I was adventuring in Ludi with my friend (he was level 40) and accidentally died and respawned in Omega instead of Ludi because of how far we'd gone down. I was really sad.

- I played MapleSEA for a while (I lived in Hong Kong for two years because of my dad's job) solely because my friend let me on his level 25 Archer. I thought it was freakin' awesome

- bamboo hats were super cool

- People summoned things in the KPQ area

- people would summon robots and trojan horses in HHG1 to kill us noobs

- Slime tree + vaccers. A lot of hackers in general

- Once, I was at another friends house and was watching him train at that iron pig place or something. Suddenly, a massive crowd passed by b/c someone famous (might have been Tiger but I don't remember for sure anymore) was walking by. I thought it was so cool that we got to see a celebrity.

- Sleepywood was a super dangerous place. The sauna was glitched for a while (instant crash), and the only way to get out was by immediately pressing a bunch of buttons (basically open every window possible, quest, worldmap, etc) and lag it so that you wouldn't immediately D/C, and run over to the portal and get out.

- Warriors had to immediately level their HP skill because it was for every level-up, so you had to get it early to avoid losing a potential 1k HP (which was a lot)

- People mostly bought NX for looks not wealth

- FM was a scarily crowded place where I dared not enter

- People actually got the Recovery beginner skill because pots rarely dropped from mobs and money was more important than the slight speed of Nimble Feet.

- When I saw my first perfectly scrolled item (+7, yellow glow) I was amazed. I calculated it was all 10%s based on the current attack, and it was selling for over 1b (SO MUCH). I then calculated the chances of landing 7 10%s in a row and was even more shocked (this was before white scrolls)

- my character names were considerably worse than they are now after millions of new characters have been registered. I use 4-letter names almost exclusively now, while I remember a character named thief587rf (omg so bad) which was my main for a while.

- One day, I found 2 50k sacks on the floor. I picked them up and cried with joy. Someone suddenly logged in and was like ""fk please man can I have that back I was dropping them for fun and I d/ced please"" but i was like ""no way this is more than i've earned in a year of playing"" and ran away. I don't really remember what I spent the money on anymore but I think I just bought those store equips for my warrior for a full level 20 armor set.

- Screws were a great way to make money but it was hard to get the materials (come to think of it, I haven't seen a screw in a long, long time)

- I went begging and some rich guy (over level 70!!!!) gave me 100k and I was so happy. I begged a lot from then on but never got much else (maybe like 5k) 


Now for some memories after my long break (this was when Pirates were released, and then when Arans were released)

- DG'ing. Oh god the fun (I was TehAran/Noobzwalk in Khaini and my brother was halflifenoob, if anyone remembers us). I earned my first 100m from DGing in Hene pot shop (never forget). I had that fruity branch thing for a while but lost it. I wonder how much it'd be worth now (it was 10-20k NX in MTS)

- Training at Truckers just after Big Bang. So fast.

- I thought Big Bang was amazing and researched it for months before it came to GMS. It was so awesome. I was so happy that I'd finally be able to get past level 30!

- My Night Walker was my first character over level 30 after years of playing

- I had Ilbis for a while and was really proud of them (I would attack randomly in non-mob places just to show them off)

- I really wanted Maple Stars for that special effect

- I thought Bowmen sucked in general because they couldn't shoot at close range, though Arrow Bomb was pretty cool

- Once someone dropped Glitter Gloves for fun and lagged out for a second and I got it (this was just during chill time, we weren't DGing). I sold it for 50m and was SO happy.

- I had a good Witch Hat (it was purple glow) and was trying to sell it for money - it was worth approx. 50m back then but would be &lt;10m now in terms of stats. someone offered me 111m and did that trick where you keep retrading and change it to 11m. I cried that day in real life, it was so depressing. Now when I think about it, I actually got a really good deal and that guy got ripped off

- My first level 70 was my dual blade. I had the whole dual blade NX set and it was awesome

- I got hacked on my dual blade and lost ~7b worth of stuff in today's economy (8% DEX Unique Specs, 27 Luk Bathrobe [worth a lot back then], 50k NX in MTS which I'd earned from selling other stuff, 12 Attack PAC with some % stat pot) I quit for a year before coming back to that account - I still had 100m or so in Broa, and that's when I made the move from Khaini to Broa

That's about all I can think of right now. Feel free to post your own memories!

Obviously, if you're going to level up and constantly train and train, then you have no interaction with people on maplestory. Even as events, you tend to do them by yourself.

I used to be into maplestory when I was about 10 years old, and I remember it being very social. Everybody would hang out in Maya's house, chat a bit, and even once in a while, I would CC in maya's house and I would see a AFK person, just chatting in his/her BL and stir up a conversation. 

To this day I still see some people on MS chatting, but in different places now, no longer in Maya's house, but in Heney's Market.

Everybody complained that the old MS was better, and I would assume that person was much more social on MS, while other people who prefer leveling, prefer the easy leveling system.

I think it's decreasing. What you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2rrdo,False,,scania,True,t3_1bcxeh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1bcxeh/do_you_think_the_social_side_of_maplestory_is/,

Hey guys,

I'd like to give back to Broa after receiving so much from the community, so I'm going to take anyone who wants to on a free Zakum or Hilla runs for Skill Books or Zakum Helmet!

I do have a few simple requirements though: 

* You must have completed the Zakum prequests (for Zakum)
* You must provide an Eye of Fire (for Zakum)
* I prefer not to take those who can solo these bosses easily on their own. 

Now I do not consider myself very strong, but I can pull off a decent Zakum solo (&lt; 5 minutes). Unfortunately, I am not yet strong enough to solo Chaos Zakum, but if I have a couple of friends online who are able to do it with me, then we could try Czak. 

If you'd like to do Hilla instead, that's fine too. Just have a character above level 120 and you're good to go!

Here is a list of Skill Books that drop from Zakum and Hilla:

Aran: Combo Barrier, Combo Tempest, Final Blow, High Defense

Bishop: Angel Ray

Dual Blade: Final Cut, Phantom Blow

Evan: Dark Fog, Flame Wheel, Magic Mastery, Soul Stone

Hero: Advanced Combo Attack

Paladin: Advanced Charge

If you would rather save the time, I'd be happy to give out any books that I pick up from previous runs for free, providing that you gift me a SoK of course. 

FAQ: 

**You are literally the greatest person on the planet. Please make love to me** (I get this one a lot)

Oh please. 

**No but seriously. What can I do to repay you?**

I am doing this for free, and I do not ask anything in return. However, if you do want to show your appreciation, a fame is appreciated :)

**When the boss drops the items, am I free to take what I want?**

Yes, but only after I tell you to. I may want to keep a Zak helm or two for myself for the charm.

**What happens if I die in the middle of a run?**

Sorry, but I am unable to compensate you if you do happen to die during a run. If you are up for one more run, I'd be happy to take you again, but you will need to provide another Eye of Fire. 

**Should I stay on the rope the entire time, or should I attack as well?**

Do whatever you like. I can solo Zakum without problem, but if you'd rather attack, that's also okay. For Hilla, hanging on the rope isn't an option, but you can stay to the far side of the map if you wish. 

My IGN is: **BadAsBlades**
My time zone is: PST

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask them below!

PS:

If any of you think that you've seen this thread before, it's because I copied the format and some of the content from DelusionDash of BasilMarket. Check out his listing [here](http://www.basilmarket.com/show/listing/165305/0/Skill_Book_Boss_Run_Service_Free.html#0). He can probably solo any of these bosses faster than I could. 

PPS: 

I am also up for Root Abyss if you'd like, although I can't solo these bosses :/",,False,self,t5_2rrdo,1362550679.0,,broa,True,t3_19oqwr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/19oqwr/free_boss_runs_broa/,

* If you are going to merge, when?

* When you merge, will you please notify me so I can change the sidebar?

Lastly, while I have your attention, some things that an average /r/MapleStory Redditor should know.

* Follow [Reddiquette](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette). It makes everyone's life easier.

* Please do not link to random ass websites for image hosting. You will get stuck in the spam filter until I unstuck you. (I suggest all images be uploaded to http://imgur.com)

I saw the subreddit needed some sprucing up, and as soon as I got permission from PHETZ, updated the subreddit header to a ""Justice"" one earlier this week.

I didn't think that was enough, so I updated the CSS a little bit tonight as well.

* This update moved the ""Submit a Link"" button to the top right of the subreddit, making it easier to...well..submit a link!

* I've included new bubbley bubbles for ""Hot"" ""New"" etc buttons.

* For non-RES users, you will see new colors for Mod and OP titles when posting. For all RES users, I will somehow make that work for you later.

* I have also updated the backgrounds for your login bar, and subreddit quick select bar at the top.

If there are any questions, comments, ""This looks ugly, fix it""'s, let me know in this thread. I will do my best to do so. But please be patient with me, as I am still new-ish to CSS.

She comes back to trade it back, and starts trading random stuff. It was funny, her trolling me. Then she went afk, and I was getting tired, wanted to log off, it was probably 2:30 am.

From official website:

To address player concerns about an imbalance in EXP gained from some Masteria monsters versus other areas aimed at a similar level range, the stats and EXP gained from some monsters inside the haunted house have been adjusted as well.
Monsters inside the Haunted House remain the same levels as before.

Lion King's Castle

To address player concerns about an imbalance in EXP gained in Lion King's Castle versus other areas aimed at a similar level range, several changes have been made.
The level requirement to enter maps has been removed.
Party Play bonus EXP has been removed.
Monster stats have been adjusted because of the Party Play removal; the monsters are weaker and give EXP that is similar to other monsters in their level range.
The monster respawn rate has been increased.
The use of the Mystic Door skill has been limited.

With the upcoming patch the damage cap will be raised for 999,999 to 50,000,000. Just think about that for a second. That is some insane [powercreep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_creep). The value of the numbers are becoming less meaningful. Instead of exponentially increasing how much HP monsters have, it wold be more meaningful to decrease their HP and our damage. Adding more 0s at the end isn't improving the game, its making it more redundant. Soon, you will see numbers 8 digits long fill up the screen. It would be better if instead of increasing the cap by 50x, the cap would be reduced by 10x making the cap 100,000. Monster HP wouldn't have to inflate to match the cap. You would be able to see the improvements in your damage if it goes up a few thousands rather than a few hundred thousands. For those of you thinking, ""oh its fine, bigger numbers make me feel more powerful"", that may be true now, but how much is too much. Maybe in another few years, they will raise the cap again by 50x making it 2.5b. I know there's alot of things wrong with this game, but inflating numbers isn't going to fix it.

TL;DR
Bigger numbers are redundant, smaller numbers are the way to go.",,False,self,t5_2rrdo,False,,,True,t3_1ghf7q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/1ghf7q/smaller_numbers/,

I'm training on my kaiser at LHC (going through that trudge between 155 and 165). I join a party with HS and an open spot, and I feel quite lucky. However, the HSer, a 136 phantom, isn't doing his job properly. He HSes once every three minutes, and refuses to get off the rope (he's essentially leeching for the service of HS--I'm okay with that) and make sure everyone gets HS. When I ask him to hs (about four to five times), no response, so I say, ""Dammit, [his ign]!""

So he replies:

Watch your mouth.

So I say that if he isn't doing his job, he shouldn't be on the party

and he says ""okay"" and leaves the party.

Is it so radical to believe that if you're not attacking and you're only providing HS, it should be of the utmost importance to make sure that everyone in the party gets HS? Is it also so radical that you shouldn't be treated like a king if you are providing HS, you should be treated as any attacker should?

I've seen a bit of flaming going on in the past few weeks...some quite extensive flaming at that.

To combat that, I've added a new rule to the subreddit. Anybody who extensively flames someone will have their posts removed.

***********************
  
I'm not the best at examples, but I hope you get the picture. 

We are bigger than this, and the last thing we need is to rip apart our little subreddit. We are too small to start losing members.

*******

In other news, to help enforce our current rules, the Redditstory mods here will start enforcing a ""[3 Strikes](http://text-red)"" rule. 

-Rules that the 3 Strikes affects-

* Linking to hacking sites.
* Linking to Meso sites.
* Selling X for $$$
* Attempting to scam someone.

After 3 Strikes, the mod team will look upon the user with remorse while adding them to the ban list.

If for some reason the moderation team sees that more rules be added, we will notify everyone.

Edit: I forgot to mention, if you use this subreddit SOLELY for self promotion^1, you are ignoring Reddit's actual Rules. Our subreddit filter (with the mods help) will slowly learn to just start automatically spamming your posts.

- [Overview example](http://maplesource.net/overview.php?id=30)

Over the last couple of days I've been working my arse off on getting this site somewhat functional. As some may know it 'did' work but the overall design/coding as lacking too much.

Now, the website still isn't complete and I got a lot of new features coming up in the near future **but!** we need to get the fansite running. 

And for that I need you: ***Reddit.***

Since the ideas was born at this community I want it to stay here as well. I know I had a couple of people helping me out earlier (*Thanks*!) and hopefully they'll want to-do the same again. But! enough of the past, let's discuss the future:

I've added a bunch of features *(comments/additions/facebook intergration/rss feed/design overhaul/support for coding)* which should help out and give the impression of a more serious fansite. 

---

**Contest time!** To give you, reddit, a bit of an incentive to help out I'm going to award the top contributors with some NX prizes (not sure of the exact sum but around 100k-250k NX split up between the top5-10 contributors).

**So** if you're interested in helping, leave a comment here and I'll get you started. 
Though, I might add: due to a rather weak (underdeveloped really) usersystem on the website you'll be given a lot of access meaning that 

1) Only trusted redditors can participate.

2) They must have some knowledge of basic HTML or a wish to learn the basics. 

3) Have fluency in English 

4) Able to write in a structured and detailed manner that people understands.

Sidenote: Any old redditor who participated in the previous version still has their account intact. But, before you start adding anything: message me first so I can explain what's new as well as the Do's &amp; Don'ts.

1328740318.0,15,self.Maplestory,pgwho,The direction of Maplestory over the past four of five years is community driven. Nexon just responded in the wrong way.,22,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/pgwho/the_direction_of_maplestory_over_the_past_four_of/,"If you've been playing Maplestory from the beginning, you know that the game started with but four classes, and one continent. The vast majority of players were lucky to make it to 60, and those who did were held as true heroes. 

When the game began to evolve, truly evolve, Wizet had a clear image for what they wanted to add: New areas for players to train, bigger better monsters, more levels worth of gear, better party systems, guilds, ways for players to get together and work toward a goal, and a reason for the community to come together other than to trade gear. And they did a great job. I refer to the 'Golden Times' of maple as the era where Ludi PQ, Kerning PQ, and to a lesser extent Orbis PQ were the dominant ways to level and attain rare scrolls and gear. 

Everything started to fall into an inescapable black hole with the introduction of the Free Market. The economy, up until then, was driven by strict 'supply and demand'. The prices of scrolls were dictated by their demand in the community. Bandits were popular, therefore, dagger scrolls were expensive. Simple really. When the Free Market released, it allowed the maple equivalent of Wallstreet, and the stock market to emerge. 

People began to buy low and sell high, beginning a very steep inflation curve for the once less than one million meso scrolls, and similar objects. Then, you got the topscum 'free market kings', and the demand for these obscene prices were only met by other 'free market kings' looking to buy and sell for higher margin. Prices skyrocketed, and they had nothing to do with demand, or rarity of item. 

Wizet then incorporated ""Nexon"" into the Maplestory future. I, to this day, do not know what decisions they made, but they obviously went with what they saw popular to the community. 

People wanted faster leveling, harder hitting characters, and godlier equips. Nexon began with ease of access to scrolls, with gachapon, and harder hitting characters at an easier pace, beginning with Pirates and Cygnus Knights. ""Hit more monsters, for more damage"" seemed to be the motto for the changing climate of Maplestory. Fire/Poison Mages quickly began to decline, along with other ""Single-Target"" classes that couldn't keep pace with the new Over-Powered rivals. As the age of new classes continued, this example was only multiplied, with classes like the Aran, who hit like trucks for characters of their time, able to wipe entire bulks of monsters clean with a few swipes. Evans were, thankfully, a balance to the insanity, but lone behold, they reigned supreme for all of...a week before the horde of damage whores jumped back to their 'All sugar, no sustenance"" classes. 

And the straw that broke the camels back, ushering in the death of all low damage classes: Dual Bladers. Once people got a taste of the volatile formula: high damage, hit lots of monsters, hit them lots of times, no single class has not been some variation of that. Mechanics, Battle Mages, Wild Hunters, Demon Hunters, Mercedes, everything. It's no longer fun because it's no longer a challenge. Big Bang did nothing. It may have given them a better opportunity to add to the game and bring events in, but what do we get? Constant down-time and events that barely make sense. 

Does anyone actually read the quest text from events? Do they even try anymore? As long as they can show you that you'll get a solid amount of Weapon Attack or Magic Attack or % equip from it, people will jump at the chance, regardless of the means. Whether it be taking advantage of new players, hacking, or botting. It's tearing the community farther apart than the days of Ch1 Perion (bottom right corner by the entrance to Sleepywood.), where we were just robots searching among each other for items. 

Obviously I still play the game, and I play how I want. I can't stop anyone from picking the class they think is the 'coolest' or anything like that, but  what I'm really trying to poke at here is the direction which the game went since it's inception. I really hope that they take some time to adjust the huge imbalance, and lead maplestory to a new direction. Keeping the awesome quirky, fast-paced 2 &amp; 1/2D feel, but leveling off the playing field and readjusting the usefulness of each class.

How you may ask? Well I'll show you!
Say your NX rate is 1:50 in your server.
That's 1k NX = 50million mesos, right?

5 SSS = 50 million mesos.
Meaning 5 SSS = 1k NX.

Now, for the people who will ask ""can someone confirm this works""... Here's a visual for you.

http://i42.tinypic.com/wldm6g.jpg

Notice it CAN be bundled, hence the /5 at the end of the price.

I have recently discovered that SSS can be MTS'd!
As I've thought of experimenting this.. I never got the chance until just now.

So.. what you'll simply do is agree with your seller/buyer to trade NX for SSS. 
Buyer puts up amount of SSS equivalent to the price of NX.
Seller purchases SSS and turns in the SSS to Leafre's Chief Tatamo.

http://i43.tinypic.com/346kmef.jpg

""And exactly what would happen if this becomes a currency in this game, and Nexon just decides to remove buying/selling the SSS?""
That's why I said in my other thread to transfer exchange them back immediately.

---


-First of all, I found out that Krexel now gives amazing exp! IIRC, he has 250,000,000 HP in each eye, so 500,000,000 HP total. However, EACH eye gives approximately 8,250,000 exp, and if you have elven blessing that's nearly 10,000,000 exp per eye, giving about 20,000,000 per run with elven blessing. Since you can do 2 runs per 24 hours, you can get 33,000,000 exp per day without elven blessing, or 40,000,000 with elven blessing! He does have crappy drops though, BUT since he drops a lot of mesos, the 300,000 meso cost to go to Singapore will be covered!


-My 2nd feature I just recently learned about in Root Abyss is the Neglected Garden. It's for levels 180 and up. When you enter, you'll see imps level 180-190. They give about 12,000 - 18,000 exp per kill w/o elven blessing, which is a good place if you can't train at Hall of Honor at that time. To get there, you click the chair in the center of the room in a party, although I think you have to kill all 4 of the bosses first and finish the quest line.

Couple months down the road I was in school when I heard someone talk to a group about Maplestory and this kid said that his username was Marrowdown.

Maple is usually a summer fling for me, and this summer I'm finding that I'm enjoying it a whole lot more than the other times that I've played. I made a couple of new characters in Renegades, a Mihile and a Xenon to be exact, and I'm finding that playing now is a whole lot more enjoyable than before. These characters have somewhat of a story-line to follow, and that intrigues me. The leveling post-Big Bang has been easier, but when I was playing my Dual Blade last summer, it still seemed boring. I don't know what it is, maybe the gorgeous new areas (Chryse, Golden Beach, Pantheon), the new classes (I very much am enjoying Xenon's flashy play-style right now), or even the questlines that follow each area. 



I'm a very RPG oriented person (Dragon Age, Mass Effect, the Witcher being some of my favorite game series) and the addition of more character-specific quests really makes Maplestory that much more fun for me. I see posts on this sub and on other forums (Basilmarket and Hidden-Street) about how the game has deteriorated or has been ruined by some patches. I honestly think that the game has been improving more than it has been ""ruined."" I realize that the active player base isn't as high as it used to be (it's more solo-based play now) and that is the one ""maybe"" detriment. Or maybe it's just because I'm starting fresh in a new world. Or maybe I'm just not at the point where funding makes all the difference (I'm around level 40~50 on my characters). 


Thoughts?

PS: I don't think I'm posting a ""Returning to Maple"" thread like the sub rules prohibit but if I am I apologize in advance.

With r/maplestory's new status as an official fansite, we have to be a bit more proactive with that sort of thing.

I've seen many points made against this approach, and I'll try to give my perspective on a few of the most common ones I've seen.

1) *You're censoring the subreddit.* Yup, we are. Most every sub has rules and this one is no different. Whether they dictate the content, structure or titles of posts, rules exist. If you're not okay with this, that's fine, but if you're still subscribed to any other subs with banned topics, you're a hypocrite. It's also worth noting that most other Maple forums prohibit the discussion of hacking, it's not like this place is some kind of freak totalitarian state. 

2) *The rules aren't even for anyone's good.* One of the biggest issues this sub has faced is a small userbase. Lack of users means lack of content and community, and without those, there's really no point in even having a sub. Being listed as an official fansite by Nexon gives us exposure. Exposure will give us more users and credibility. This will bring content and keep the community alive, interesting and engaging. I have no idea what the ""coming soon"" perks are, as I'm not active in-game or in the sub at the moment, but having it exist is certainly a big enough bonus for me.

If you want to talk about hacking, there are places which condone discussion on that topic. It's not as if your one avenue for this sort of thing has been ripped away. r/maplestory has always been about gameplay and community, not hacking. Whether or not you choose to participate in that sort of activity is none of our business, but your posts here are.

She was very excited about seeing you again. You're asked to go to the Sky Nest Entrance map to greet her. 

-When you get there, she asks why you're late and says she's been waiting all of this time and that she really wanted to see you.

http://i.imgur.com/rFwWg.jpg

 She thought you had forgotten all about her. Your character is surprised at how different Sheryl seems from her usual self. She has been looking for a traiter from within the Cross Brigade. She asks for your help with this and she asks you to go talk to Vince for an invitation to see the second ranked Captain of the Cross Brigade, whose name is Sophia. She also gives you some lamp that teleports you to Sheryl's location. 

-Vince is surprised about what Sheryl says and he asks you to go defeat Master Harpie for proof of your strength before you can receive the invitation to see Sophia. 

-Upon defeating Master Harpie and returning to Vince, he says to give him some time before the invitation is ready. Then, your character suggests to go see Sheryl. You use the lamp to teleport directly to her. She's disappointed that you must wait for the invitation to be prepared, but then she says you're the most important person in the world to her. She then says there's one more thing she wants you to do. She says there's an object called the ""Fragment of Devilishness"" within the Cross Brigade and that you should go back to Vince for more information. 

By the way, Sheryl laughs very girly a lot. It's pretty obnoxious. And the last line of the dialog at this point says ""There's really no one for me but &lt;your character name here&gt;."" 


-Upon returning to Vince, he says the Rock of Devilishness is a participation requirement for the Cross Brigade's Tower of Trials. The Tower of Trials is a place where Cross Brigade members are trained and true members are chosen. He asks if you plan to take on this Tower of Trials. He says if you plan to climb the Tower of Trials, you must collect the Fragment of Devilishness in order to show proof that you may take on the challenge. You're asked to go eliminate monsters around your level (+21/-11) to find these fragments.

-When you collect all 100 fragments and return to Vince, he tells you you have one more test before you can participate in the Tower of Trials and asks you to wait for it to be prepared. Your guy then starts thinking to himself. He wants to believe in Sheryl's intentions, but he feels there's a lot of weird things happening. So... You go back to talk to Sheryl again. 

-She asks if you've investigated information about the Fragment of Devilishness and seems surprised when she hears about the Tower of Trials. Your guy tells Sheryl about what Vince wants you to do and she gets angry, saying you should do what *she* tells you to do. She tells you to stop dawdling and go get the mark required for the test. 

-You talk to her again and she apologizes and said she said too much. She says to hurry it up and do what she wants and tries using your kindness to get what she wants. She tells you to go ask Vince to give you the final test for the Tower of Trials and she says she must enter that tower at all costs. She calls you her hero after you accept the request. 

Now, I'm not a genius by any means... but I don't think this is Sheryl, at this point. I think this is that vampire peach that we saw in the extractions and she's using magic to either control Sheryl or to disguise herself as Sheryl to get what she wants out of you. 

-When you talk to Vince, he says he's ready to give you the final test. For this test, you must defeat Manon.

-When you defeat Manon and return to Vince to tell him you've completed the test, he gives you a stamp as proof that you succeeded. It is the seal required for entry into the Tower of Trials. He then tells you you have a little bit of time before the Tower of Trials is ready to begin, so you must wait a while. 

-A light bulb quest pops up over your head. The dialog is interesting. ""I've finally obtained the Stamp of the Test Taker. I was able to deceive Vince... no! The entire Cross Brigade. I have my doubts that what I'm doing by Sheryl's request is the right thing to do. No, it doesn't matter what Sheryl is planning! I believe in her and I'll give her this stamp.""

-Using the lamp, you travel to Sheryl's location, which is somewhere in an Ant Tunnel-like map. She yells at you saying you're late. What a bitch. She asks for the stamp, but your guy is like ""Yeah, yeah. I just have one thing to ask you."" Uhhhhhhhhhh... Basically, your guy says recaps that Sheryl is trying to find out who is betraying the Cross Brigade, but then he says that is entirely unlike Sheryl. Sheryl then yells at your guy to shut the hell up and hand her the seal.

-The real Sheryl arrives! Your character is confused; why are there two Sheryls!? The real Sheryl then calls you a moron that never changes and your guy is confused on which one is the real one. The obvious fake one says she's the real one, then the real Sheryl shoots at her, saying that such sentiments the fake one is expressing doesn't suit her (the real Sheryl). 

-Your guy is an idiot. ""This is difficult! Which one of you is the real Sheryl!?"" (It's kind of obvious. ._.) The fake one says, ""That's enough of this. I'll show you my full power."" 

http://i.imgur.com/Am4S5.jpg

-Her name is... uh... Procelphin? Puroserufin... I don't know. Your guy is like, ""You've deceived me! I'll never forgive you!"" 

-The evil bitch is like, ""Huh? Wasn't it a lot of fun, &lt;your name&gt;? Well? If you give me that stamp, I'll take Sheryl's form and be by your side forever! Hohohoho! Surely I can entertain you more than the real Sheryl, don't you think?"" 

-Sheryl replies ""Hmm! &lt;Your name&gt; is an idiot, but he's not the kind of guy who fall for someone who deceives him like you! Isn't that right, &lt;your name&gt;?"" 

-Your guy : ""Huh? What? Uh... Uh... Hahaha... Of-- Of course!"" *followed by a pissy reaction by Sheryl and your guy getting nervous*

-The bitch : ""Hehe. I guess I have no choice. I'll show you my true power. Your life would have been spared if you had just given me that stamp while you were under my deception. &lt;Your name&gt;, I shouldn't be the one you hate. You should hate Sheryl! Hohohoho!"" 

*epic battle that lasts for a whole 5 seconds*

http://i.imgur.com/o8Pin.jpg


-The bitch : ""Ugh... I lost..."" 

-Sheryl : ""For deceiving the Cross Brigade and for your crimes of seduction, you will pay with your life!""

*bitch transforms into a stirge*

-Bitch : ""Ohohohoho! Don't think you have won agaist me yet! We will always be somewhere your imagination can't even reach, corrupting you all! Ohohohoho!"" 

-Sheryl : ""Puroserufin!"" 

*The Bitch flies away, as a stirge*

-Sheryl : ""What could this mean? Even though you're an idiot, to think you would fall for such a fake person like that succubus..."" 

-Your guy : ""Eheh... I wouldn't think it wasn't you in my wildest dreams, Sheryl. That's why... I believed in and did everything you said and asked for.""

-Sheryl : ""Wha--what!? Don't say such weird things!"" 

-Your guy : ""S-sorry..."" 

-Sheryl : ""You're an idiot... but I'm glad."" 

-Your guy : ""Huh?"" 

-Sheryl : ""Nothing! By the way, you did pretty well to obtain that Stamp of the Test Taker, didn't you?""

-Your guy : ""What did you say just now?"" 

-Sheryl : ""That vulgar succubus named Puroserufin. She's a member of the most terrifying ""Mugengumi,"" who are the highest ranked monsters of the Black Blooded Demon Brigade."" (I don't know how to translate ""Mugengumi"" (夢幻組) without it sounding butchered.) 

-Your guy : ""The Black Blooded Demon Brigade? The Mugengumi? N-no. Didn't you say something before you just called me an idiot?"" 

-Sheryl : ""The Black Blooded Demon Brigade is an organization that was created for the sake of going after the Cross Brigade. I've heard that there are many, many terrifyingly powerful people in the Mugengumi, aside from the Succubus we just met and the Incubuses.

The succubi of the Mugengumi aim to infiltrate the Cross Brigade and seduce members into betraying their own so they can cause all kinds of bad things. It is the same case for Gerect from before.

It seems this time, they wanted to infiltrate the Tower of Trials and cause a mess with the Cross Brigade members training there. We were barely able to stop them this time, but at some point, they will try to deceive a Cross Brigade member again in order to get the stamp.

If you wait a while, the next Tower of Trials will open. Here on out, there is nothing we can do but enter the Tower of Trials immediately to draw out the succubi and eliminate them. &lt;Your name&gt;, with that stamp you hold, you should participate in the Tower of Trials when it opens. Together, we shall eliminate all of those obnoxious succubi!

Well, until the next Tower of Trials opens, do your best to train! Until that time, it'll be a little lonely, but we must split up again. Farewell!"" 

-Your guy : ""What was it you said before?!"" 

*Sheryl disappears*

-Your guy : ""You wouldn't answer me in the end. The Tower of Trials, huh? Well, I've certainly gotten some interest now! I guess I'll be able to see Sheryl, that succubus, Procelphin, and everyone else again there. Well then, I guess I must do my best to train until then!""

First off I'd like to welcome the 234 new members that subscribed last month and remind them of add there name to [the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFpGcWlBRU0zWUZuTjI1cGdhNXhSOVE6MQ#gid=0) and add there flairs in the sidebar.

last month you guys asked for some changes;

1. Make a price check subreddit(also to include a ""should i"" buy X) - **held off, haven't had that many p/c threads this month.**

2. Make an IGN list using an open to all free to edit google docs - [Done](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFpGcWlBRU0zWUZuTjI1cGdhNXhSOVE6MQ#gid=0)

3. Subreddit for memes only - **held off, not quite big enough yet**

4. link flairs for world chat i.e. ""[Renegades] Looking for new guild members"" - **This is done, to set a flair to your thread just click the fliar button after you have submitted your thread.**

So whats on the table this month?

1. AutoMod in coming, we are looking into getting the Automod to help us out 

2. New Moderator, we are looking to add one of you guys as a mod, we may or may not make you guys submit a quick resume or we may just pick. in any case not happening for a few weeks.

3. Possibility of official nexon fan site recognition, that said still in its early days don't get your hopes up. 

that's pretty much it, i'll turn it over to you guys to drive the convo as this is as much your community as it is mine.",,False,self,t5_2rrdo,False,,bera,True,t3_10ue3h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/10ue3h/state_of_rmaplestory_month_of_september/,moderator
