I accumulated most of this during my time spent at Berklee.  It's fairly organized but I'm sure it's missing stuff here and there or maybe a file was duplicated and renamed.  I'll clean it up when I get around to it.  Without further ado:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6ha0bs45jgop0p8/-F1q-d9bhj?m

EDIT: Removed any files (seven total) that could land me in hot water, legal or moral.  Same link still works.  I hope this appeases the downvoters (wink).

EDIT II:  Added some jam tracks from Guitar Center's annual King of the Blues contest, blank chord charts and a few files regarding practicing.  These are all readily available on the interwebz.  I may continue to update this folder at random intervals due to the overwhelming response.  No lie, I have gigs of this stuff; I also play upright, electric bass and sing not to mention all the theory information I've acquired over the last...shit, I've been playing for nineteen years now.  Kinda depressing.  

EDIT III:  Dropbox shut me down.  I wonder what Box.net's policies are...
Someone said I should use Mediafire.  Any other suggestions?

EDIT IV:  New link!  Probably just a temporary fix until I figure out something better.

A: There's a few things you can do to kick start your guitar playing career. I personally recommend taking three or four lessons with a qualified teacher to help set you on the right path. They will tell you how to hold the guitar properly and what techniques you should concentrate on to get you started. 

If a teacher isn't possible, then [www.justinguitar.com](http://www.justinguitar.com/en/TB-000-TheBasics.php) is the next best thing. It's an amazing, informative, and highly accessible website that was created specifically to help people with no prior guitar experience learn to play. Read through the beginner section / lessons and if you still have questions, post them in the subreddit! That's what it's there for ;)

-------------------------------

* *Q: I'm new to guitar and I'm getting discouraged. Can you offer any advice to help keep me motivated?*

A: Getting discouraged is natural and there's nothing wrong with it, as long as you don't let it defeat you. Be mindful that because you are just learning how to play, there are going to be techniques and concepts that are currently beyond your grasp. In fact, at every level of playing there's going to be things beyond your grasp. And this is OK. It tells us what we know, what we don't know, and what we really should know. These two posts written by users [sirberus](http://www.reddit.com/u/sirberus) and [Adrewmc](http://www.reddit.com/u/Adrewmc) offer valuable insight to help keep you level-headed and motivated.

----------------------------------

* *Q: I have a basic understanding of how to play guitar, but I'd like to learn more about scales and chords. Where can I learn about this?*

A: [This excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/b5dbu/scales_and_chords/) by former moderator [cbg](http://www.reddit.com/u/cbg) provides a great introduction to the world of scales and chords and how they relate to one another. 

If you want a more comprehensive overview of scales and chords, our very own [rcochrane](http://www.reddit.com/u/rcochrane) has a free e-book available for download that is sure to answer any questions you may have about scales, chords, and their use in music. His e-book is available for download [**here**](http://www.scribd.com/doc/87559596/Scale-and-Arpeggio-Resources).

------------------------------------

* *Q: Where can I find some good, free online guitar lessons?*

A: User [himit](http://www.reddit.com/u/himit) has compiled a list of the best guitar lessons available online in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/oz13h/best_internet_lessons_around/).

-------------------------------------

* *Q: Where can I find tabs to learn songs?*

A: I personally use [ultimate-guitar.com](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com) along with [TuxGuitar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/). TuxGuitar is a free, open-source tab reader that will open GuitarPro, PowerTab, and TablEdit files.

[Songsterr](http://www.songsterr.com/) is also a free tab site with a playback feature.

[gprotab.net](http://www.gprotab.net)

-------------------------------------

* *Q: How can I get better at jamming with people?*

A: The best thing you can do is: listen. Listen to the direction of the song. Listen for the chord changes. Listen to the drums (they carry the time). And most importantly, listen to the bassist. Bassists take a lot of heat for their instrument but, when it comes down to it, they're the ones who drive the song. 

In terms of practical advice, if you want to improve at something, you have to practice at it. That means you need to jam on your own. Play along with backing tracks or a drum track. If you're learning a new song, play along with that song. When practicing scales / chords, use a metronome. All of this will help you develop a sense of timing and rhythm and will help you carry a beat when playing with others. 

------------------------------------

* *Q: What do the various pedals (aka stompboxes) do and what are they used for?*

A: Gibson has a pretty good website that lists the top 10 most commonly used pedals and what they do/what they're used for. You can find the list [here](http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/stomp-box-basics-0825-2011.aspx?utm_source=iContact&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Gibson%20Guitar%20Corp.&amp;utm_content=Editorial+eBlast+10-16-2012).

----------------------------------

* *Q: How do I get better at soloing?*

A: The answer to almost all questions like this is ""It depends on what style you want to play"", but there are a few general things you can do.

First, listen to the players you want to emulate closely and repeatedly. Transcribe (figure out by ear) solos or just phrases you like. Everyone finds this hard at first but it gets easier with practice; there's some good advice for getting started [here](http://jazzadvice.com/if-you-can-sing-happy-birthday-you-can-transcribe-your-favorite-solo/).

Second, sing your lines as you play them. Again, this can be hard at first, especially if your singing voice isn't much good, but it's worth it. It forces you to slow down and really *hear* what you're playing. It also tends to help with your phrasing, because you'll start playing lines the way you'd sing them, which is almost always an improvement. It will also help you to develop your ear.

----------------------------------

* *Q: I want to get into playing jazz. Where do I start?*

A: Too often the answer to this is that you have to learn 1000 chords and 50 scales.  Don't get too bogged down in all that stuff. [This article](http://jazzadvice.com/where-to-start-learning-jazz-improvisation/) and [this FAQ](http://jazzadvice.com/faq-the-questions-we-get-over-and-over/faq/) will set you on the right track. Then watch the [Hal Galper Masterclass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2XnB5G6oSc&amp;list=PLADD179921985D950), [Emily Remler's *Bebop and Swing*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j0qLksgXDE&amp;list=PL895242C9F3A8A440) and [Jimmy Bruno's *No Nonsense Jazz Guitar*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7SY6aIfi6g). There's a ton of other material but these are good solid places to start. But above all, listen to nothing but jazz, all day every day, until it's absorbed into your system!

----------------------------------

* *Q: Do I have to learn all the notes on the neck? If so, how do I do it?*

A: If you mostly want to strum open chords then it's not necessary, but most guitarists beyond a beginner level would benefit from knowing the names of the notes and for lead players or those who want to be able to read music it's essential. 

Take small areas of the fingerboard (a few frets at a time) and memorize them. When you're away from the guitar, draw a fretboard and label it with all the note-names you can think of. Visualise the area of the fretboard you're working on and test yourself on different string/fret combinations, or try to think of where to find all the notes of a particular name (all the Cs, or all the F#s, say). [This video](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/198qj4/lessonhow_to_learn_every_note_on_the_guitar/) provides some really good exercises to help you with the process; [this site](http://www.fretboardmaster.com/fretboardgame.html) and [this site](http://www.musictheory.net/exercises) give you an opportunity to test yourself. It shouldn't take more than 2-3 weeks of daily practice. If you work on reading music that will help as well...

----------------------------------

* *Q: Do I have to learn to read music (i.e. traditional notation)?*

A: For many styles of playing (other than classical) the answer is ""not unless you want to"". Guitarists use tablature, a special form of notation that gives information about how the music is to be played that's often easier to work with. 

But there's a lot of information out there that's only in traditional dots and lines. What's more, sometimes in a band or professional situation you'll find you can't do something because you can't read it. So at some point you'll probably want to get this useful skill. [This site](http://www.musictheory.net/lessons) contains the basic information and has some exercises; mostly the rest is just practice.

----------------------------------

* *Q: How do I increase my speed?*

A: Guitarists sometimes come across as being obsessed with speed, and the reaction against that can be that working on this is nerdy or ""robotic"". Yet speed is necessary: you have to be able to play a little faster than you need to, otherwise technical problems will prevent you from getting the music out. Other things are necessary too, heaps of them -- repertoire, ear training, stylistic knowledge, theory, phrasing, timing and so on and on -- but we all need enough speed to get us through the performance, too. How much depends, of course, on whether you want to play chilled-out folk or shred metal, but all of us have to work on it sometime.

Start with [Tom Hess's articles](http://tomhess.net/Articles.aspx) under the heading ""How to Practice Guitar Effectively"". Troy Stetina also has good advice on [using the metronome](http://www.stetina.com/lessons/metronome.html) and [developing a practice method](http://www.stetina.com/lessons/edge.html). These are rock players and you might have to adapt their specific musical examples, but the general principles are what you want to take away.

Edit. Feel it. Be exuberant. Exhilarate. Soar. Rock on. 

So, first, be patient with yourself. The big bang happened 14 billion years ago. Shit takes time. So relax. 

Make sure your instrument is set up properly so it is easy to play. 

Teach your self. 

Get a teacher. Lean from the teacher. Then teach yourself. 

Experiment with different styles and techniques. Push yourself. Stretch yourself. Insight and excellence are born of your ingenuity. 

Practice every day. Yes, I said every day. If you miss a day, start again. There are numerous reasons. One, it improves your playing. Two, most important, it leads to discipline. Discipline applied to intention is how humans get stuff done. 

Your practice does not have to sound good. You are practicing to improve. 

You can apply this to all things that you are doing. Discipline applied to intention has great power, it is how we get shit done. 

PS. Guitar playing is a proven aphrodisiac and a potent force in the mating process. 

Say amen. Amen. So say we all. Keep smiling. Hope this was helpful. Yo.

His current plan is to open his post in /r/iama a bit early so you can post questions (and up/down vote questions based on their quality), then he'll actively be answering for a couple hours.  He said he might pop back by to answer follow ups off and on.

If you have any other suggestions, post them here. (Please don't request a time change, though... this is the time that Justin selected).

I will post again to remind you as the date draws nearer.

Understanding the way that chords and scales relate is fundamental to a slew of more interesting ideas that will open up your playing.

**Scales**

In concept, scales are simple: they are collections of notes.  One way to think about any scale is as a series of ascending tones with specific distances between consecutive notes.  For example, to play a major scale, start on any note, then play a note a whole step (2 frets) above that, another note a whole step above the last, then a note a half step (1 fret) up, then a whole step up, then a whole step up, then a whole step up, then a half step up to the original pitch one octave above where we started.


It is easier to write out the pattern just using W for ""whole step"" and H for ""half step""... Major scale: W-W-H-W-W-W-H


Consider the C major scale, for example.  The notes in C Major are: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C.

We'll put the whole and half step jumps in parens: C-(W)-D-(W)-E-(H)-F-(W)-G-(W)-A-(W)-B-(H)-C

...

Here are some other useful scales:

Natural Minor Scale: W-H-W-W-H-W-W

Harmonic Minor Scale: W-H-W-W-H-(W+H)-H  (Note that (W+H) or ""whole step plus half step"" is equal to a three fret jump).

Melodic Minor Scale: W-H-W-W-W-W-H

Pentatonic Minor Scale: (W+H)-W-W-(W+H)-W

Pentatonic Major Scale: W-W-(W+H)-W-(W+H)

**Intervals**

In the last section, we were thinking of the scale in terms of a series of whole and half steps that describes how to move from one note to the next.  These leaps between notes are called intervals: the interval being the ""space"" or relationship between two notes.  When we look at a scale, we can think of it in terms of the intervals between adjacent notes in the scale (as above) or we can think of it in terms of the intervals between the scale's root and each of the other notes in the scale.  Both perspectives are useful.

...

Here are different intervals and their mapping to the distances between frets on a guitar:

1 fret = minor 2nd (b2) also called a half step or half tone

2 frets = major 2nd (2) also called a whole step or whole tone

3 frets = minor 3rd (b3)

4 frets = major 3rd (3)

5 frets = perfect 4th (4)

6 frets = augmented 4th or diminished 5th (#4 or b5) and often called a ""tritone"" (3 whole steps)

7 frets = perfect 5th (5)

8 frets = minor 6th (b6) also called an augmented 5th (#5)

9 frets = major 6th (6) also called a diminished 7th (bb7)

10 frets = minor 7th (b7)

11 frets = major 7th (7)

...

Of course, we are frequently not playing all along one string, so it is useful to know how these intervals fall across the strings in one position.  This is the way that these intervals occur as you stay in one position on the neck and move across strings:


    e | r |b2 | 2 |b3 | 3 |
    B | 5 |b6 | 6 |b7 | 7 |
    G |b3 | 3 | 4 |b5 | 5 |
    D |b7 | 7 | r |b2 | 2 |
    A | 4 |b5 | 5 |b6 | 6 |
    E | r |b2 | 2 |b3 | 3 |

...

So, returning to the major scale...

We can think of this scale in terms of intervals between adjacent notes (as above)... Major scale: W-W-H-W-W-W-H

Alternatively, we can think of this scale in terms of intervals from the root to each of the other notes... Major scale: r-2-3-4-5-6-7-r

...

Here are the other scales from above rewritten with the intervals from the root:

Natural Minor Scale: r-2-b3-4-5-b6-b7-r

Harmonic Minor Scale: r-2-b3-4-5-b6-7-r

Melodic Minor Scale: r-2-b3-4-5-6-7-r

Pentatonic Minor Scale: r-b3-4-5-b7-r

Pentatonic Major Scale: r-2-3-5-6-r

**Chords**

Before we can see the relationship between scales and chords, we have to look at how chords are constructed.

...

To build the ""standard"" chords, take a root note and then build upon it in thirds.  The choice of minor or major thirds determines the character of the chord built.


For example, the four basic triads are built out of all possible combinations of two thirds:

Major triad: r, 3, 5 (the 3 is a major third above the root; the 5 is a minor third above the 3).

Minor triad: r, b3, 5 (the b3 is a minor third above the root; the 5 is a major third above the b3).

Augmented triad: r, 3, #5 (the 3 is a major third above the root; the #5 is a major third above the 3).

Diminished triad: r, b3, b5 (the b3 is a minor third above the root; the b5 is a minor third above the b3).

...

Extended chords continue in this vein:

Major 7th chord: r, 3, 5, 7 (the 3 is a major third above the root; the 5 is a minor third above the 3; the 7 is a major third above the 5).

Dominant 7th chord: r, 3, 5, b7 (major, minor, minor)

Minor 7th chord: r, b3, 5, b7 (minor, major, minor)

Augmented Major 7th: r, 3, #5, 7 (major, major, minor)

Minor (major 7th) chord: r, b3, 5, 7 (minor, major, major)

Half-diminished 7th (""minor 7 flat 5"") chord: r, b3, b5, b7 (minor, minor, major)

Fully-diminished 7th chord: r, b3, b5, bb7 (minor, minor, minor)

...

By making a simple rule (""build chords from thirds"") we get a whole bunch of chords that are widely used throughout western music.  So what is the relationship between chords and scales, then?  Well, scales are collections of notes and all scales besides the chromatic scale (which contains all notes) have some notes ""missing"".  If we take a scale and build chords using just the notes in that scale, we'll find that our choice of whether to use a major or minor third is often constrained by the fact that one or the other uses a note outside the scale.

**Harmonizing Scales**

When you take the notes in a particular scale and build chords out of them, you are ""harmonizing"" that scale.  Here are two examples of building chords from a scale...

Let's use the C major scale and build a chord with the root on C:

* C is our root; (now we have C, ?, ?, ?)

* the C major scale doesn't contain Eb, which is a minor third above C, so we'll have to use a major third here...

* E is a major third above C; (now we have C, E, ?, ?)

* G is a minor third above E (and Ab--the note a major third above E--is not part of our scale); (now we have C, E, G, ?)

* the C major scale doesn't contain Bb, which is a minor third above G, so we'll have to use a major third here...

* B is a major third above G; (now we have C, E, G, B)

* C, E, G, and B are the root, major 3rd, perfect 5th, and major 7th... this is a Cmaj7 chord.

(Note: stop with just C, E, and G and you have a plain Cmaj chord).

...

What if we build a chord from the C major scale, but choose the second note as the root?  Starting on D:

* D is the root; (now we have D, ?, ?, ?)

* F is a minor third above D; (now we have D, F, ?, ?)

* Ab is a minor third above F, but C major doesn't contain Ab, so...

* A is a major third above F; (now we have D, F, A, ?)

* C is a minor third above A; (now we have D, F, A, C)

* D, F, A, and C are the major 2nd, perfect 4th, major 6th, and root in C, however...

* Because our chord is centered around D, think of these notes as the root, minor 3rd, perfect 5th, and minor 7th of D... this is a Dm7 (D minor 7th) chord.

(Note: stop with just D, F, and A and you have a plain Dm chord).

...

If you continue this exercise, writing out chords built from thirds starting on each note of the C major scale, you will build 7 different chords: Cmaj7, Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7, and Bm7b5 (B half diminished).  This is the harmonized C major scale. (Without the 7ths included, we get Cmaj, Dm, Em, Fmaj, Gmaj, Am, Bdim).

Hopefully, it's becoming clear why certain chords and scales belong together: chords are, in a sense, built from scales.  This process of harmonizing a scale can be applied to any scale.  Try the C natural minor scale, for example, to get Cm7, Dm7b5, Emaj7, Fm7, Gm7, Amaj7, Bm7.

It's a bit more complicated to work with some scales.  The harmonic minor scale, for example, will give some funky chords: the C chord built from C harmonic minor is Cm(maj7), which contains the root, minor 3rd, perfect 5th, and major 7th. The pentatonic scales are missing more notes than the major and minor scale, so things get still more complicated... that's not important for these purposes.

Grasping the relationship between chords and scales will help you understand how keys work, how the modes can be applied, and how improvisation works.

I'm in the process of getting all the technology stuff researched and set up right. After I get everything finalized and testing all done to make sure this will go smoothly we'll be in business in the next few weeks I'm thinking :)


Original: 

I've been playing guitar for about 10 years now, and I've always entertained the idea of doing lessons over the internet to try reach more people and help them to learn guitar. 

I taught in a local studio my freshman year of college for some extra money, and I had a lot of fun doing it. I know it'll be a little different online, but the technology available to do it is extremely powerful these days and I'm fascinated by it. I think we can use it to our advantage!

If there's sufficient interest, I plan on using YouTube Live Streaming (Google Hangouts) to do the broadcast as it provides a lot of great benefits. One great one being that it will automatically upload a recording of the entire event to a YouTube channel for those that couldn't make it for any reason. 

I would love to get a good group of beginners to start from the ground up and help them get up to speed with basics and progress from there. So you would not have to have any prior knowledge at all! Just a guitar, internet and willingness to learn. 

I figure the live streams(plus the options to watch the streams at a later date) would offer the option of having the players(students) be as involved or uninvolved as they want. Ask questions live, possibly play live together to check for correct technique, etc, or you can sit back and just take it in. 

To tell you a little bit about myself: 

I learned guitar back in my grade school days to be a part of the blues band, and of course to impress chicks. I grew a pretty big love for it and took it farther than I thought I would. 

I've been playing for the better part of about 10 years now, and I would say I'm a pretty versatile guitarist. I of course have a love for the blues, since that's what I started out with, but I like playing anything from bluegrass to metal. 

So, what do you guys think? Any interest here? Are there too many other options for this type of thing? Any questions for me?

Is my content worth keeping on the interwebs?,76,9,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/w3h5z/ive_been_running_a_guitar_lesson_site_for_several/,"Hello everyone! I posted this question yesterday on /r/Guitars [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/w2a8g/ive_been_running_a_guitar_lesson_site_for_several/) and someone suggested that I re-post here where my target audience should be.  This is what I asked:

&gt;I'd like feedback as to whether my site is worth keeping up or not: www.vitalguitar.com. It's just a free lesson site with as much information as I could think up. I can provide proof that I am the owner of the site if you would like.

&gt;More details in case you are curious: I made the site in 2010 because I have been playing guitar for 11 years and wanted to ""give back"" so to speak. The site costs maybe $80/yr to keep up and I haven't made even half that amount in two years. There have been some months where I have gotten as many as 400-600 visits per day (depending on the metric), but people haven't been coming back because I don't advertise anymore. The project seems to be a failure and I'd like a second opinion before making a decision.

I have already gotten some amazing feedback (for which I am extremely grateful) and I would be very happy if anyone here would be willing to comment with any suggestions.  Thank you so much in advance!!

This is a great little sub, with many very capable people posting useful and fun links and helpful, considered advice. But in practically every single post where someone asks for technical advice, some genius(es) will offer this incredibly considered and helpful gem, or some variation thereof:

*""Just practise man. Practice practice practice. That's how I got so awesome lol!""*

**Firstly:** This is completely obvious. Pretty much nobody is coming here saying ""I picked up a guitar for the first time ever today, and I couldn't play any of the Yngwie Malmsteen licks I like. What am I doing wrong??"" Everybody knows they have to practice to improve. EVERYBODY. Tell them how and/or what to practice, or pipe down! Maybe *you* got as good as you wanted to be by just charging forward on your own, but people who ask for advice here clearly aren't achieving their goals with that approach, and/or are pretty sure they are doing something not quite right which will hold them back in their further development.

**Secondly:** This is very often WRONG. If someone has fundamental issues with their technique that are hindering them in their pursuit of their guitar-playing goals, simply repeating this incorrect technique over and over ad infinitum will inevitably make their playing *worse*, as tension from struggling becomes ingrained into their muscle memory, making fluid and comfortable playing impossible. And muscle memory is *very* sticky: once your flawed technique is thoroughly memorised, it requires much, much patience and attention over a very long time to train yourself out of your old habits and into new and better ones.

~

I had a little pm exchange with one of the mods several months ago on this matter, who basically said that he/she hadn't really thought of it before, but he/she saw my point, but had too much going on at the time to look at putting something into the sidebar about it (this is how I remember the conversation going anyway, apologies to said mod if this is in any way inaccurate).

My plea is just this: Can we please not respond to technical queries with 'just practice' or any variation thereof, unless it is truly the only advice worth giving (hint: it never is).

**TL;DR Please only post an advice comment if it goes beyond ""just practice"". Saying ""just practice"" is patronising, unhelpful, and can even be detrimental to someone whose technique is flawed.**

If you think for some reason I am wrong to ask this of you, please let me know why. I am open-minded.

Cheers :)

---

**EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION:** Some of you are misinterpretting what I am saying as ""practise isn't that necessary if you know 'proper' technique"", and are concerned that I might be consequently encouraging laziness in students, so to be clear:

**Practice is absolutely vital, no question. But there *is*, believe it or not, such a thing as *bad practice;* repeating faulty technique again and again until it becomes integral in your muscle memory. Therefore, making a throwaway ""just practise"" response without making efforts to make sure the student will practise the correct thing in the correct way can actually very much hinder their development as a guitarist. I am just asking that people understand this, and be more specific and thoughtful about what they are actually telling the student to do.**",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,True,,,True,t3_qihls,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/qihls/please_stop_an_argument_against_posting_just/,

These are in no particular order.

1.  Remember it's about the music.  You can learn every flashy, complicated guitar trick under the sun, but unless it's serving the music, it's just masturbation.

2.  Develop your ears.  The ultimate goal of playing is to hear something in your head and have it come out your fingers.  The easiest way to accomplish this is by listening to something and then trying to play it exactly like you heard it.

3.  When playing with others, try to make everyone else sound better.  It doesn't matter how good a technical player you are or how simple the parts you play are; if you can make the band sound better, you will always have people to play with.
 
4.  For playing barre chords: Fret everything that isn't the barre first, then lay your finger across the strings while keeping your wrist out.  Then keep your wrist out more.

5.  Bend strings by pivoting your wrist.  It will give you more power and control over your bends.

6.  Learn other instruments, especially the ones you expect you'll be playing with a lot.  You don't have to be a virtuoso at everything, but a basic understanding of other instruments will help your playing.  I learned more about guitar playing drums for 3 weeks than the six months playing guitar before that.  Also, by learning how to play drums or bass or whatever, you gain insight into how a drummer, bassist, or whatever thinks.  This allows you to better communicate with the people you're playing with.

7.  Spend more time than you think you need to on your picking hand.  A lot more.

8.  When playing along with something (band, CD, etc.), listen for what's missing and play that.

9.  Practicing and playing are two completely separate things.  Practicing is what makes you play better.  Playing reminds you of why you practice in the first place.  Don't neglect either, but focus on practicing since you're more likely to let that slip.

10.  When practicing, remember isolation, repetition, reintegration.  Isolate whatever it is you're doing wrong, repeat it correctly VERY SLOWLY, and then reintegrate it into whatever you're working on.  Makes practicing a lot more efficient.

And an important bonus one:
11.  Find a good teacher.  You can learn a lot from books and the internet, but you need a real live actual person to listen to you and say, ""Hey, you know you're sucking at this, this, and this.""  They'll also usually tell you how to not suck at those things.  But having an objective set of ears tell you what your actual weak points (instead of the imagined weak points we all think we have) is worth every penny you pay the teacher.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,False,,,True,t3_c2wr1,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/c2wr1/10_things_ive_learned_in_my_years_playing_guitar/,

Also, fancy progress graphs/charts,leaderboard, ability to create exercises (Video + Tabs + Description + PDF)
Check it out [www.gitori.com](http://www.gitori.com)

Hey guys, I'm a guitarist and a web developer and created this to scratch my own itch. I hope you guys find it useful too. My primary problems/wishes that Gitori solves are:
1) Improving on the metronome. The most popular piece of advice I've gotten for improving technique is to use a metronome and start slowly, gradually increasing tempo. I did this for many months and found the constant Metronome-tweaking to be annoying. I wanted an auto-pilot Metronome. Gitori is my attempt at an autopilot metronome.

2) I find practicing exercises/scales to be a bit boring. Especially taking the extra effort to practice everything in multiple keys

3) I lack the discipline to fix a minimum warmup period before trying to play faster. Having the whole practice workout laid out in front of me forces me to adhere.

4) My exercises and practice material are not organized in the same place. I have an ad-hoc collection of bookmarks/emails/books/CDs/PDFs Gitori allows me to create my own exercises and put all of them in one place.

5) I would like to track my progress by looking at data. I wanna know how long I practiced last week/month. Was I able to consistently practice 5 days a week last month? Can I play faster than I could a month ago?

The app works best in Chrome but it is functional in FF and Safari. I look forward to your feedback.

Lessons will be taught over Skype and a schedule will be made after contacting me.

Please leave a comment with a little bit about your background with the instrument and what you are looking to accomplish/learn through lessons. I'm trying to get a good selection of students from every walk of life, so everyone is welcome.

The core focus of my lessons will be geared towards technique, theory, performance and practicality, as well as any interests/genres you wish to explore/learn. I'll try my best to custom tailor lessons to your own play style, based on the skill set I have to offer you.

Not sure what kind of demand something like this will bring, so thank you for all who reply and sorry if you don't get immediately selected to take part in this ""experiment"".

The approach will be based on pitch-class theory, which is standard in the academic world but not well-known outside it. Everything will be explained as we go, so there are virtually no prerequisites. In particular, musical notation won't be needed.

It'll take me a while to put the materials together but my plan is to start teaching in February. The three sessions will probably happen on a weekly basis; I may break them up if it seems like too much at once. Once the materials are up it should be possible to follow the course at any time.

I wish someone would have taught this to me as a beginner.",58,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/aulbn/ok_heres_a_lesson_the_numbers_system_i_wish/,"Here's a quick tutorial on the numbers system.  If you don't know the major scale absolutely rock solid this won't help you much.  I can pretty much chart any song on the radio without an insturment, just a piece of paper because I know this system.

I learned this system reading charts in Nashville. Here's the theory: Different singers will often sing the same song but will prefer it in different keys. Musicians have a real need to keep *one* chart of a song but quickly transpose it. So this number system was created (by who knows...) and it lets musicians write the structure of a song only in a musical shorthand which they fill in the details with their experience.  It also quicly trains your ear to hear these relationships so it will dramatically help your improv as well. Ready? Ok, let's go.

Let's start with the C major scale: (C) whole to (D) | whole to (E) | half to (F) | whole to (G) | whole to (A) | whole to (B) | half to (C) and assign each scale degree a number.  C1 D2 E3 F4 G5 A6 B7 (C8)

Also we know that we can have major, minor, diminished and augmented triads (chords built in thirds or every other note in scale).  We'll be focusing on major and minor here. ( Need a hand with Triads look them up on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(music)) )

So we have a definitive pattern here with the major scale and triads and we can leverage those patterns to make some very easily written and remembered shorthand rules.  We do that by building triads from each scale degree and noting their tonal color (major/minor/diminshed).

For example, the 1 chord in the key of C is C E G - a major triad. The 2 chord is D F A - a minor triad.  So let's write all of the scale degrees out as chords but in scale degrees vs notes and let's use Roman numerals for the chord degrees, uppercase for major and lowercase for minor. (Some use numbers.. 1M, 2m ... while others use roman numerals, it's the same concept so I've included both.)

* 1M (I) chord - 1 3 5 - Major
* 2m (ii) chord - 2 4 6 - Minor
* 3m (iii) chord - 3 5 7 - Minor
* 4M (IV) chord - 4 6 1 - Major
* 5M (V) chord - 5 7 2 - Major
* 6m (vi) chord - 6 1 3 - Minor
* 7dim (viidim) chord - 7 2 4 - Diminished (extended 7 2 4 6 is half diminished)

In Roman numerals you should be able to play the scale chord degrees like this:
I ii iii IV V vi viidim I

In the key of C  - C major D minor E minor F major G major A minor B dim C major

You should play this pattern quite a bit forwards and backwards to help your ear get used to hearing each chord next to each other.

Now that you know the pattern of major and minor chords you can use this to quickly identify the chords of a song. For example if you hear two different major chords together you know that's either a 1-4, 1-5, or 4-5 combo, you can narrow it down even more by hearing the ""distance"" between the chords.  For example, if you can tell they are really close harmonically it's the 4-5 combo.  Same goes  with minor.  Trying to find the 2 chords that are tonally the same (2 minors/2 majors) and guaging their distance apart is the fastest way to find where you are at in the progression. As you become more skilled you'll just hear these relationships as well ALL the relationships.  (Understanding [chord leading](http://www.theguitarsuite.com/Theory/Chord-Leading.html) will help you learn this faster as well.)

For an example here let's use [Amos Lee's Keep It Loose Keep It Tight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmQFwIKsU1U).  I'm going to count this fast so each chord will be a bar to make it a bit easier. In the way I'm counting it's a 9 bar intro that I would write like this (the // and //// are a half and full rest respectively):

| IV | V | IV | V | IV | V | vii V | IV // | //// |

You should be saying to your self 4, 5, 6, 5, 4 as you listen.  It helps...

In the key of E the chords would be
| Amaj | Bmaj | Amaj | Bmaj | Amaj | Bmaj | C#min Bmaj | Amaj // | //// |

An experienced musician would fill in the sus2 on the 4 chord.

Hope this helps and I'll take questions on it for the next couple of hours.

Alternate title: teach me what I should've learned years ago.",57,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/16fwkg/looking_for_some_help_im_a_pretty_experienced/,"Let me give you a little background information first. I'm 26 years old and I've been playing guitar since I was 11 or 12. I have not had any formal guitar lessons. I'm mostly self-taught via playing the tabs of songs I like. 

I suppose that is enough for a lot of people, but I'm not satisfied with my current level of playing at all. I've always wanted to take playing guitar more seriously, but never had the motivation to really buckle down and get things done. I've been attempting to write my own music, but I always feel like I'm not adequately prepared to do so (I used to just wing it and hope for the best). I mostly enjoy playing metal (prog metal and death metal to be specific), but I've spent only about half of my guitar-life trying to play these more advanced styles. I'm open to learning some basics that I may have brushed over and tips and tricks from various styles of playing.

I've found some tools and lessons to help me improve my playing technique, which is awesome, and I hope to put them to good use. What I'm hoping you guys can help me with is knowledge about music. I know music and music theory aren't guitar centered, but since guitar is familiar to me I'll start here. Links to videos and websites that can help me are great, but I would really like for someone to explain a few things to me in a more personal manner.

In terms of theory, I have a very basic knowledge. I know how scales are built and about the intervals between notes; I even understand a little beyond the scope of the common scales. I don't really understand chord progressions or its significance and I don't understand how to identify modes in terms of what is being played (I know what a mode is and their relation to the scale, though - if that make any sense). I also would like to learn a bit about the actual process of writing music.

I'll ask some questions to help you guys understand what I'm looking for. Hopefully you will be able to see where my misunderstandings and deficiencies lie and point me in the right direction. Please give it a shot if you can, I know I'm probably asking a lot here.

*  **Scales and Modes:**

1. What really determines the scale, 'mode,' or key you are playing in? More specifically, how is one determining the root note of what they are playing? Does that have something to do with chord progressions? Is this something that is chosen before the writing process begins (and if so, how does one make that decision)? I've always been confused by this since the mode is just another scale started from a different ""root"". Perhaps it's more simple than I think it is, but I always walk away from an explanation with the same misunderstandings. To put it in perspective, I always viewed the root as the ""lowest note"" or the ""note you start with"". Is that wrong? It seems wrong.

2. Is there a specific method to fit accidentals into riffs without making it sound too deliberate and 'wrong'? It always sounds like I'm trying too hard to fit them in.

3. In regards to leads and solos are you supposed to be playing in a scale based on the key you are in, or on the chord that's being played? It seems like there are a lot of ways to go about this so any clarifying would be of help.

* **Chord progressions:** 

1. Are they just ""pick some chords that go along with this scale""? I don't understand what's going on there for certain. 

2. Is a chord progression really an integral part of every measure of a song or are they not always necessary. For example: [Animals as Leaders - Do Not Go Gently](http://youtu.be/lTbu5yMkOQ8?t=54s). At the time marker linked the guitar is only playing one note on one string at a time. Is this riff based off of some kind of chord progression or are the notes of the riff simply parts of a scale. Explain the method that goes into writing this kind of riff (I'm not asking for a transcription). 

3. Is there a certain way to fit in chords that don't have notes related to the current scale?

4. Where exactly does the chord progression lie in the structure of a song. Is it over a certain number of measures? One measure?

* **Writing and structure:**

1. In writing, more specifically in more progressive/technical music, what kind of methods are there to switch between different elements of songs? This includes changing key, making new unrelated riffs mesh with previous riffs (i.e. switching from very fast metal riff to a slower style with elements of a different genre), mixing different scales and modes, switching between time signatures. When I write a really neat sounding riff I always feel like I can't transition to a new part of a song for the life of me. It always ends up sounding too abrupt or uncreative. I know anybody can play 4 measures and then add a layer and repeat or start a new riff, but I'm looking for more advanced techniques. I've tried to look at the way other songs are written and copy what they are doing to figure it out, but I think an explanation in terms of theory or methods would help me understand exactly what is happening. I can provide specific examples if that will aid you in aiding me.

2. I have a song I'm working on that starts with a measure of 5/4 and then is followed by a similar, but shorter, measure of 4/4 and then the two repeat for some time. Should I be combining them into a whole measure of 9/4 or does that even matter?

3. Is there some specific method to using odd time signatures that I'm unaware of? I know a lot of 'math' bands will string together a bunch of measures that eventually add up to 4/4 or something. Do odd time sigs need to do this to sound correct?

I know I'm probably asking for an entire lifetimes worth of knowledge, but I'm desperate for any progress towards my musical goals. I've scoured the internet for lessons, but it feels like there are too many puzzle pieces missing. Like I said before, any links to lessons and videos are great, but I'd really like to see how you guys would explain it. 

A big bonus for me would be if someone could reverse engineer a song. If you can take the song ""Selkies: the Endless Obssession"" by Between the Buried and Me (there are tabs on [http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/between_the_buried_and_me_tabs.htm](Ultimate-Guitar)) and explain to me the inner workings of each part of the song (example: in measures x-y the rhythm is playing this progression and the lead is playing this and then they transition by doing this) I would be forever grateful. I've always understood things better by taking them apart and fiddling with the pieces so seeing someone do this with a song I'm familiar with might put me on the right track.

As a beginner, a lot of the practicing has felt more like clumsy struggling, but nothing was as discouragingly difficult as the F chord. It just felt completely impossible and downright insane to expect the human hand to do anything like that. 

Regardless, I kept at it (sometimes as little as 5 to 10 minutes a day) and today, for the first time ever, my F chord actually sounded like a proper F chord. I was so freaking psyched, I wanted to run outta my room and strum it at everyone.

I know it probably sounds super trite and tired, but seriously, all it takes is just **consistent practice.** (Incorporating it into chord changes is gonna be a whole another uphill battle, but I guess I'll take it one step at a time. :P )

**TL;DR**

I almost gave up trying to learn the guitar cause of the goddamn F chord, but I still kept at it, and much to my surprise, I got the hang of it.

I play both acoustic and electric but I like acoustic more, with a focus of blues and folk.  Can you guys suggest a routine to start with that will help me increase my technical skills? or at least a basic structure to follow, I always end up learning a scale and then going, now what? That is not what I want to do.  Anyways thanks ahead for anything you all throw my way

1st edit

**What people have suggested**

* Use a metronome.  You'll hate it, but love it later.

* So that practicing is more fun than a chore try breaking it down into smaller increments.  Start with 30 mins a day, 10 spent on learning a specific scale and practicing to get it faster and perfect (again using a metronome).  The other 20 practicing something you enjoy, this can be a song, a solo, a chord arrangement, your own thing, just make sure to work on the technique of it.

* After learning a scale try playing it over backing tracks of that key.  Usually people learn the box scale first so on the 12th fret that is a A minor pentatonic, try playing it over a A backing track.  Work on your phrasing, and playing licks within the scale (not just doing the scale in order up and down)

* if you have the money get a teacher

* Check out Rocksmith, basically guitar hero using a real guitar.

* also http://musicdiscipline.com/

* Check out Hal Leonard Guitar Method (book)  [Amazon Link](http://www.amazon.com/Leonard-Guitar-Method-Complete-Edition/dp/0634047019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375741845&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Hal+Leonard+Guitar+Method)

* try learning a new song in a scale you are working on.  Then once you have it down practice licks within the scale over the song you are learning.  This gets you learning new songs and keeps practicing scales fresh and exciting!

* Write out your practice routine, makes it easier to remember and provides a tangible reminder of your practice routine.

* So I started playing guitar 13 years ago. I spent the first year taking lessons from a guy who was able to teach me Ode To Joy and Yanki Doodle. 
* I took a 6 month break and then took lessons from a really good acoustic finger picker who had a huge collection of his own arrangements of Chet Akins, The Beatles, and ect... 
* In the mean time I spent many hours trying to play Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen..ect...
* I played in a couple of bands during high school, by the time I was 18 I had found a couple of good guys to play with and we sounded pretty good. But that has long since disolved itself and I have not found any musicians to jam with since.
* My theory is is strong up until the harmonization level. I took theory while studying the trumpet in high school.
* Last year I grew tired of rock (and roll) and moved to a folk. I have since been playing Gordon Light Foot, Jim Croce, America, Cat Stevens, ect...I don't have a great voice it is not that enjoyable.


After a lot of thought, about a week ago I decided to do a 360 and go back to the beginning. 

Why?

There is a saying that after 10,000 hours, one can master a skill. I have put in my 10,000 hours and yet feel guilty calling my self a guitarist sometimes. If a song isn't played on a Am-Dm progression I can't solo to it. My ability to play chords is restriced to maj, min, and the 7ths. I only know the pentatonic minor scale. I don't know what notes are what on the fret board. I really feel like I have failed at this insturment.

But I don't want to give up. I have invested too much time and money into this...my passion is with music...I know I have a good understanding of what it is that Im doing, I just don't know how to apply it to the insturment.


I went to the local music store last monday and bought a scale book. I have put in about 5-6 hours since Tuesday and have since memorized the main 6 variations to do a double octive Amajor scale and can play them in 16th at 94 tempo. (pathetic that after 13 years I just learnt how to do a major scale on the guitar).

But I was thinking this morning...what if I approach this wrong..what if another 13 years go by and still know nothing....

My question to you is a mash of: What path do I take. How can I become comfertable with the guitar? How does one approach scales and chords? 

Any comment is greatly appreciated...even if you just want to tell me that Im a fool for wasting 13 years and should shoot myself.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,False,,,True,t3_17fnd2,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/17fnd2/hey_fellow_guitaristsafter_13_years_and/,

1343868600.0,49,self.guitarlessons,xjcni,Thought I would share these. Probably the most useful two things I've ever found as tools for teaching myself.,60,11,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/xjcni/thought_i_would_share_these_probably_the_most/,"This: www.pbguitarstudio.com/pdf_files/GUITAR_PDF/Important_Scale_Sequences.pdf

Paired with this: www.looknohands.com/chordhouse/guitar/index_rb.html

The intervallic sequence sheet is amazingly useful. I can't even begin to explain how it's improved my ability to improvise. Anyone playing an instrument should have it. It completely changed my perspective on even the most basic scales. You think you're pretty good at improvising in the C Major scale? Bullshit... Work that bitch out in these sequences and get back to me. Then tell me you aren't a better musician. I wish someone would've stressed intervallic sequences to me the day I started practicing scales.   

The other site (chord house) is equally as helpful especially when used in combination with the scale sequence sheet. I use them like this... I practice a mode per day in combination with 2-3 sequences from the sheet. Example:

Monday- Ionian (3rds, 4ths, 5ths).....
Tuesday- Dorian (3rds, 4ths, 5ths).....
Wednesday- Phrygian (3rds, 4ths, 5ths).....
Thursday- Lydian (3rds, 4ths, 5ths).....
Friday- Mixolydian (3rds, 4ths, 5ths).....
Saturday- Aeolian (3rds, 4ths, 5ths).....
Sunday- Locrian (3rds, 4ths, 5ths).....

I play them all in C Major to start with; after that I move it to other keys. A better guitarist than me might recommend learning modes another way but that's just how my brain works since I relate pretty much everything to the key of C and then just move root notes. I also play them in the keys with no sharps/flats though. Example: 

Key of C: C D E F G A B- Ionian                 (**I**).....
Key of D: D E F G A B C- Dorian              (**D**on't).....
Key of E: E F G A B C D- Phrygian           (**P**unch).....
Key of F: F G A B C D E- Lydian               (**L**ike).....
Key of G: G A B C D E F- Mixolydian      (**M**uhammad).....
Key of A: A B C D E F G- Aeolian                (**A**).....
Key of B: B C D E F G A- Locrian                (**L**i).....
 
... and then onto just all other keys in general. When I get those sequences down and the shapes are engrained into my soul I move onto another set of sequences and the cycle starts again in every key. The Muhammad Ali stuff is just an old mnemonic that's helpful for remembering the order of the modes. Do stuff like this for even 30 min/1 hr every day and you're golden. So there it is. Also, if anyone has a better suggestion for me on learning modes, feel free to comment. Hope the links helps someone else as much as it's helped me.

Edit: The scale sequences are from Pebber Brown. I found [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B5IhqT3q-8&amp;feature=relmfu) on it. Should clear up a lot for those who don't understand how to use it.

I may be alone in this, but I think it would be prudent, prior to posting these sorts of questions that the would-be poster does a quick google search first.

In no way shape or form am I asking that. I have been playing for about ten years now, and consider myself at least above average. I took lessons for about 4 of those years, and primary focused on blues, classic rock, and folk starting off. More recently I focused my playing on writing/playing for a pop punk band I was in for about 3 years, but we have since broken up.

I have the ability to play pretty quickly and accurately in everything that I've done. I have always started at a slower bpm and then sped up as I went along. I have drilled scales into my head, but I feel like I don't understand what they actually mean, I have just figured out how to move my fingers in a pattern across the fret board pretty fast. When writing for the band I was able to incorporate some more intricate leads than the style of music normally calls for, but still when I play I feel like a child compared to almost everyone when it comes to soloing.

I don't even know where to begin with this. What can I do to get the ball rolling? Will it benefit me more to learn other solos, or to write them myself? What resources online can I use to get better? Any ideas to get me started. I really just really like there is a gigantic hole in my abilities, and in wanting to be the best player I can be, that just won't do.

I know we're all very focused on our guitars and maintaining them, but one thing to keep in mind. Keep an eye on all of your gear. 

As I was rehearsing on stage today, my guitar strap that I had kind of just taken for granted for the last few years gave out during a solo where I was near the edge of the stage, and my guitar plumetted off stage into a 6 foot fall. Luckily the small venue had a carpeted floor, and the guitar landed on it's back and Schecter makes some insanely awesome guitars.. so it suffered minimal visible damage, and I luckily have it covered under warranty, but the thing to keep in mind is to make sure all your equipment is maintained and kept up to standards not just your guitars. 

The little things can give out when least expected. So just be conscious of them. Make sure your straps and stuff are in good condition.

I'm still not a jazz guitarist, but I'm working on it. I can share this one with you though: 

When practicing scales, go up the Ionian mode, down the Dorian, up the Phrygian, down the Lydian, and so on. [as suggested in Mark Levine - Jazz Theory p. 96] 

&gt; You're stargint on each note, reversing directions on each note, and ending on each note of the X major scale. This equalizes the importance of each note in every scale. This way, when you're taking a solo, your ear can choose what note to play, not your fingers gravitating straight to the root because of their memory always starting there. 

It looks like this:

Then, while in physics class I learned about Beats in sound waves. Basically beats are created when 2 different frequencies repeatedly reinforce and cancel out to create a pulsing effect.


**Here's How:**

Do the typical 5th fret tuning.

e--------------

B--------------

G--------------

D-------------

A-----0-------

E---5--------- 

Now when the notes seem close start listening for these very subtle 'waves'(You can also feel them on acoustics and the higher strings). I suggest playing the strings separately(half second) to hear the waves and playing the strings simultaneously to *feel* the waves. Also, starting off with the higher strings might give you a better idea of what you're looking for. The Key is that you're not listening to the notes. You're listening for these underlying frequencies and you'll hear them pulsating like waves. If they are going fast it means out of tune. So you'll want to adjust the keys to slow the waves down to get it perfectly tuned. Have your tuner handy to check the accuracy and practice at it til you get it down. I also need to mention (thanks Donttellmother) that this works really well with [harmonic tuning](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/16ikwk/lesson_tip_if_you_have_trouble_tuning_by_ear_and/c7wnhe4)



bonusTip: Practice this on your own time, get it down, and always use a silent tuner when playing shows. hearing someone take forever tuning a guitar is annoying and looks unprofessional when playing a show. However, hearing someone tune a guitar is not as bad as someone playing a guitar out of tune.



EDIT: also for you beginners: to keep your guitar in tune longer always tune UP into the note, as in, D# into E never go E# DOWN into E. So when you have to tune down, tune a little past it and then UP into it. It helps with the tension and keeping the strings locked into place better.

I won't be giving any tabs or explanation of what to play. This is in no way complete.

First, use your pinky finger. Many people don't do this in the beginning because it hard to do, later your going to either be glad you used you pinky from the start or wish you did

Practice. Practice Practice. All the time. Once a day, even for 10 mins and you'll improve.

Learn how to play ABCDEFG major and minor chords in the first 3 frets. Music using western notes only has 12 notes, you have 6 stings, this means that in any four fret space (open + 3 frets) you have all of the notes spanning at least two octaves. Then learn how to play major and minor chords down the next, take a lets say A major chord and learn how to play it in different places on the neck.

Learn to switch chords smoothly, this takes practice but it will help. Go from A to D to E to A to E to D for example over and over, until it sounds good and you can do it blind.

Learn the Major and minor scales, first in a four fret space and then all the way down the neck. In doing this you will be able to play in key much easier because the major scales essentially is a key (I know that it a little more complicated than that but for beginners it a good step). Many people will say learn the blues scales (or other scale) first but for the most part these scales are part of the over all major scale. The reason why your frets are where they are on the neck is because of the major scale, the guitar (and other instruments) are made for the major scale. (I might explain this in more detail later if this post get a good response) For example Metallica plays in the E minor scale a lot, some of there songs use it almost exclusively, from riff, chorus, bridge to solo. 

Read. Read. Read. Take advice anywhere you can get it. There are many web sites that offer tabs, and lesson. There are many book that also do this. I suggest the Guitar Grimore series.  If you can understand these book you won't need another book to learn any chord or scale ever!

Your muscles need to be strengthened. Most people can't pick up a guitar and do a bar across all six strings. This is because your fingers and hands are clumsy, they need to build muscles to be able to finger chords correctly and press down hard enough that the sound is clear. Also you need to do this to stretch farther. A good rule of thumb is that when you hand hurts, dull pain is good and building muscle. Sharp pain is bad and is ripping muscles a bad way, you should STOP playing when this happens.

Take care of your guitar. Replace strings, nuts, bridges etc when needed. Use string cleaner, guitar polish and lint free cloths. Wash your hand before you play. 

Don't get discouraged. It's hard to play music. You'll find that sometimes it seems like your not getting any better even with practice, this is not true. I find that people plateau for a while throughout their playing, what is really happening is you are training your muscles and your mind to think better. You will not progress at an even pace, you will jump suddenly and play things you didn't think you could at ease, and then plateau again, then jump again. This is especially true in the beginning, because you need to build muscles, learn a whole new language basically, and you start with knowing nothing at all.

Don't forget you right hand (assuming your playing right handed guitars) Many people concentrate solely on where their left hand is, placing fingers at the right place, switching chord etc. You can't forget you right hand, it is the only thing that makes noise (ok tapping is an exception) You have palm muting, pinch harmonics, alternate picking, finger picking, tapping, sweep picking etc.

Learn an entire song. You don't have to learn an entire song every time but when you learn a few good song all the way through you'll learn a lot, hopefully (there are some bad players out there)

Finally always be a student of the guitar, learn from yourself, others and from reading. There is no point in figuring out something that can be explained to you by someone else, it just takes longer. Hope this helps.

i've been playing guitar for almost 9 years now, and have been mostly self-taught. one thing i learned about 6 months ago is that learning from a book is much better than learning from random youtube videos or free lessons on guitar websites. the reasons why are:

1.) the authors of published books are most likely better teachers than random people online    
2.) the authors of published books put in a lot more effort in making sure you learn everything you need to know    
3.) the overall learning experience is much more organized/coherent than a bunch of random free lessons online    
4.) it's much easier to reference and restudy a book than it is a youtube video or a bunch of random lessons online    

so that's my tip for all self-taught beginners: buy actual books! free online lessons are too saturated with bad lessons. i discovered how much better books are after first buying ""Fretboard Logic SE"" by Bill Edwards, and then ""The Jazz Theory Book"" by Mark Levine. holy shit! i never ran across the CAGED method that Edwards teaches throughout all my years of random online lessons, and that jazz theory book just completely demystified jazz for me. as a matter of fact, i've found that free online jazz lessons only contributed to the mystification of jazz for me because of how incomplete and, overall, unhelpful they were.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,False,,,True,t3_tpcfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/tpcfx/my_one_piece_of_advice_for_all_new_selftaught/,

It's time to learn how. ,39,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/xpec4/been_playing_guitar_for_12_years_its_time_to/,"Backstory: I'm 25 now, and I got my guitar when I was 13. I was only seriously into it for a year or two. That time consisted of playing along to punk and pop-punk songs using tabs, and a little bit of jamming with like-minded friends. I never learned much in the way of chords, and while I can form a couple I have no idea what they're even called. My usual solution to my poor playstyle consisted of ""Turn up the distortion and play faster so nobody realizes how much you suck."".

Past that, I occasionally pick it up and try to play, but I always get discouraged and leave it to collect dust for another month or two. It's fun, and I really enjoy it, but I'm really just noodling around and hoping some nice sound comes out of my amp (It rarely does.). 

So now here I am, and the past month or so has been filled with thoughts of learning how to actually play the guitar. I'm going through the content in the sidebar (Slowly but surely), and I think I'm on the right track now that I'm in this subreddit. The only problem is I have 12 years worth of terrible habits and no idea what I'm actually doing. I'm starting to worry that I've put too much into playing with no direction and that I'll never be able to unlearn all of the incorrect techniques.

So, I come to you folks for inspiration, advice, anecdotes and anything else you can offer. Am I past the point of no return? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Should I suck it up and take a few lessons with a professional?

1272306346.0,35,self.guitarlessons,bwci5,One Way To Find A Song's Key,39,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/bwci5/one_way_to_find_a_songs_key/,"There are a number of ways to figure out the key of a song or progression.  Some are very informal (e.g., keep trying different scales until one works), some are guided by theory, but only loosely (e.g., look for the chord that the song keeps returning to and that's a good candidate key), and some are more systematic (e.g., the one described here).  You can use this method without understanding a ton of theory, but theory will help.  In particular, if you understand the [relationship between chords and scales](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/b5dbu/scales_and_chords/), that knowledge will be useful.  It also helps to understand the *roman numeral system* or [Nashville Notation](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/aulbn/ok_heres_a_lesson_the_numbers_system_i_wish/).  It is also helpful to be comfortable with intervals, as a concept and as applied to the fretboard.  Regardless, here is one reliable approach to figuring out the key of a song or progression:

**Step 1: Know the chords that go with the major scale**

Harmonizing the major scale (i.e., building chords out of the notes in the major scale) gives us seven chords.  For example, if we take the C Major scale and build chords from those notes, we'll get C, Dmin, Emin, F, G, Amin, and Bdim.  You don't really have to know *why* this is the case, but you should know that these chords go with the major scale.

C is the first note in the C Major scale, and C (major) is the first chord.  Let's call that the I chord (roman numeral 1, capitalized to show that it's major).

D is the second note in the scale, and Dmin is the second chord.  Let's call that the ii chord (roman numeral 2, lowercase to show that it's minor).

E is the third note in the scale, and Emin is the third chord.  Let's call that the iii chord (roman numeral 3, lowercase = minor).

F is the fourth note in the C Major scale, and F (major) is the fourth chord.  Let's call that the IV chord (roman numeral 4, capitalized = major).

G is the fifth note in the C Major scale, and G (major) is the fifth chord.  Let's call that the V chord (roman numeral 5, capitalized = major).

A is the sixth note in the C Major scale, and Amin is the sixth chord.  Let's call that the vi chord (roman numeral 6, lowercase = minor).

B is the seventh note in the C Major scale, and Bdim is the seventh chord.  Let's call that vii(dim) (roman numeral 7, lowercase with a ""dim"" to show that it's diminished).

So we have C, Dmin, Emin, F, G, Amin, and Bdim chords from the C Major scale, but we can call them I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii(dim).

The nice thing about using the roman numeral system is that we can think about *any* major scale and the same chord ""names"" apply (e.g., if we look at the E Major scale, we see the chords E, F#min, G#min, A, B, C#min, and D#dim; which, once again, can be written I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii(dim).

The interesting thing to focus on is the major/minor character of each chord: I, IV, and V are major.  ii, iii, and vi are minor.  vii(dim) is diminished.

**Step 2: List the chords that make up the song or progression you're trying to figure out.**

Let's imagine that you're trying to find the key of Guns n Roses' *Don't Cry*.  The chords in that song are Amin, Dmin, G, C (in the verse) and F, G, Amin (in the chorus).

Write each chord out across the top of a sheet of paper (there is no need to write the same chord twice, even if the progression hits it multiple times).  You may want to do this separately for each section of a song if you think there is a key change.  Here I'll just do it for the whole song at once.

    Amin    Dmin    G    C    F


**Step 3: Determine what ""roles"" each chord could be playing in the progression.**

In our example, we have Amin as the first chord.  If we look back at the roman numeral names of the chords from the major scale, we see that ii, iii, and vi are minor.  So Amin is probably the ii, iii, or vi chord.  Dmin could also be the ii, iii, or vi chord.  G is major, so it's going to be the I, IV, or V chord. And so on for C and F...  Write out the possibilities for each chord below it on the paper:

    Amin    Dmin    G      C      F
    ii      ii      I      I      I
    iii     iii     IV     IV     IV
    vi      vi      V      V      V

**Step 4: For each possibility under each chord, write what the key would be if the chord you're looking at were playing each role.**

In our example, if Amin is the ii chord, then what would the I chord be?  Well if A is the second note of a major scale, then the first note (one whole step below A) is G.  So if Amin is the ii, then the song is in G.  But wait, we have to do this for all the possibilities and all the chords...

    Amin    Dmin     G      C      F
    ii:G    ii:C     I:G    I:C    I:F
    iii:F   iii:Bb   IV:D   IV:G   IV:C
    vi:C    vi:F     V:C    V:F    V:Bb

**Step 5: Look at the possible keys you've identified and find one that is shared among all the chords.**

In our example, Amin tells us that G, F, and C are possible keys.  Dmin suggests C, Bb, and F.  The ""common"" suggestions from these two lists are F and C, so let's move on looking for those...

G suggests G, D, and C, so F is eliminated!

*Don't Cry* is in C Major.

Sometimes, you'll have to work through more chords to pare the possibilities down to a single key; other times, as in the example, it will happen when you look at just two or three chords.  To save time, you can write out the possible keys for the chords one at a time and check for common keys after each chord (caution, though: if the progression does change keys you may miss that by looking at only a subset of the chords).

**Step 6: Wait... what?  It doesn't sound like C Major.  Check the relative minor.**

Well... A Minor is the relative minor of C Major, and this song centers on Amin, so we can think of it as being in A Minor.

However... note that our analysis is sound: C Major and A Minor contain the exact same notes (that's what it means that A Minor is the relative minor of C Major).  When it comes to choosing scales, we can pick based on C Major and we'll get all the right notes.

When you apply this method to a progression that is in a major key, you'll come straight to the correct answer.  When you apply it to a progression in a minor key, you'll end up with the relative major of that minor key.  As noted, you can choose a scale based on either, but there are subtle differences in how you emphasize different notes for the relative major and minor scales (which I won't discuss here).

**Step 7: Stop writing letters and numbers on paper and play your guitar.**

----

To summarize:

1. Know the major scale's corresponding chords: I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii(dim).

2. List the chords in the song/progression of interest.

3. Determine what roles each chord might be playing in the progression.

4. Note the key that goes with each possible role for each chord.

5. Look at the possible keys you've written out and find one that's common to all the chords in the progression.

6. Check whether you want the relative minor of the key you've identified.

7. Play a scale that goes with the key.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,True,,,True,t3_bwci5,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/bwci5/one_way_to_find_a_songs_key/,

I'm just beginning to use this guide. 

I have a question, though. For step 5 of the practice routine you are supposed to find the closest ii and V7 for each of the CAGED chords. Is there a trick to knowing which ii and which V7 is closest.

For example, if I'm playing A major with the C shape (5th string 12th fret as the root), what Bm and E7 do I use?

I'm guessing G shape for the E7 because that's obvious, but which Bm?

Maybe I just need to learn all the chords better.

Edit: 

Oh, the D shape! Of course!! The ""trick"" I've discovered is just use the chord shape that you would normally switch to if you were playing open chords at the nut. For example, if you're playing a G shape A chord as I, then your closest ii will be your A shape Bm. This is because if you were actually playing G then your ii would be Am. And for the E7 you would use your D shape chord because if you were actually playing the fifth of G you'd use D.

Here's 3 little things that I've discovered that makes the end result so much better:

1. Hyperbole: whenever you play something slowly, play it like you were SHOWING someone how to do it... Overdo it and really push down on the frets, this helps your muscle memory learn it faster.

2. Timing: practise with a metronome and try playing it as it's written, but slower, lower the tempo, not the note values; this helps you not have to concentrate on rythm once you play it full speed.

3. Feel it: now is the perfect time to really FEEL every single note, do it, and those kickass arpeggios will sound even more badass once you get them down!

Some final notes: ALWAYS metronome, no excuses, there are free apps if you don't feel like buying one. If you make a mistake, take it from the top, this teaches you that mistakes aren't acceptable, or else you'll have to start over the riff/lick/melody/exercise. And last but not least: mix up those exercises with learning a tricky song that you love, guitar is afterall supposed to be fun!",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,1371381167.0,,,True,t3_1geu8r,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1geu8r/a_quick_guide_on_how_to_make_the_most_out_of/,

1369944783.0,31,self.guitarlessons,1fcwjs,Sweep Picking - Fundamentals of Technique Lesson (x-post r/metalguitar),37,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1fcwjs/sweep_picking_fundamentals_of_technique_lesson/,"Hey r/guitarlessons, I wrote this lesson up for r/metalguitar and it got good response, so it may be useful to some players over here! Lots of people get frustrated with sweep picking, so I'll be breaking it down for everyone here. I'll be splitting this into two parts - Technique and Theory. Today, we'll be focusing purely on technique, so don't worry about what you're playing musically in the examples I give you just yet. I want you to focus on the physical aspect -- what's going on with your hands.

So, let's get to it! First, we have to examine what's going on with each hand.

**The Right Hand**

The name of the technique has ""picking"" right in the title, so let's go right where the action is. In broad terms, sweep picking sounds mostly self-explanatory: instead of alternate picking when we shift strings, we simply continue in the direction we were picking on the previous string. This allows us to execute some interesting patterns when we glide across the strings quickly. It's not quite strumming a chord, since, in that case, the aim there is to get all of the notes out ""simultaneously"" (or, rather, as close as the strumming motion will allow); with sweeping, we want to articulate each note clearly before we get to the next one. The right hand's job seems easy here. Where people get tripped up is turning the sweep around in the other direction. We'll cover how to get more comfortable with this with a few examples momentarily, because how to do this is contextual to what sort of sweep shape you're playing

**The Left Hand**

Obviously, it's the left hand's job to fret the notes - but that's not all. A lot of players starting with sweeps can't seem to get it to sound ""clean"", and will tend to tighten up on the right hand in order to try and get the sound cleaner, but it won't help. Why not? Think about how you keep extra strings ringing out when you're playing plain chords on your guitar - if you're strumming away, you can't lock your right hand down to mute the unneeded strings, so what do you do? You rely on your left hand to mute the other strings of course! By gently resting parts of your fingers against strings you don't need, you deaden them. In sweeping, it is the same: it is generally the LEFT hand that is keeping the sound ""clean"". The key is getting the sync down.


**The Sync**

Let's start putting this together with an example:

    l----------9-----------l
    l-----10-----10--------l
    l-11-------------11----l
    l----------------------l
    l----------------------l
    l----------------------l

Here's a basic starter shape. You'll want to use your 3rd (ring) finger to hit the 11th fret on the G, your 2nd (middle) finger to hit the 10 on the B, and your 1st (pointer) finger to hit the 9 on the E. Set a metronome at a slow tempo, and play this as eighth notes - two notes per click of the metronome. Let's start sweepin'.

What you're going to do is, pick each note at the same time as your fret it with your left hand. Hold the note for as long as you're supposed to (eighth notes, here!), and just as your pick is about to hit the next note, lift up the finger that was fretting the previous note enough to get the note to stop ringing and mute it - you may also use the tip of the finger that is about to fret the next note to deaden the string you have just fretted further. The finger that frets the next note will usually also help to deaden the previous string - again, this depends on the shape.

Ok, this seems all well and good til we hit that last note, it's a sweep pick so just carry the down pick through that third note, the 9 on the E, right? NOPE! Think about it -- if we carry the sweep and continue to pick down, when we have to up-pick the 10 on the B again, we have to lift our pick back up over the E! This flies in the face of the economy of motion sweep picking is all about - so, if we have something like this, and immediate shift in direction, you're gonna want to set up the shift in direction on the last note - so, in this case, our right hand would pick DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, UP to play that sweep. If we don't stop the sweep down at the 11 on G again, we're gonna want to set up the change in direction again. So, just before you hit that note on the G string, start picking down again. If we played the lick twice through, the pattern would read DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, UP. Get it? Let's try something new.


    l---------9-10p9------l
    l-----10--------10----l
    l-11---------------11-l
    l---------------------l
    l---------------------l
    l---------------------l

Play this one as triplets, or three notes to each click of the metronome. Slow it down a bit from the last example if you have to. Remember, GETTING THE SYNC DOWN COUNTS MORE THAN SPEED!!! In THIS situation, we have to pick the E string twice. Therefore, we actually will carry the motion of the sweep down through the E string, but since we are immediately shifting direction at the G string again, we do have to set that up - resulting in a pattern of DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, etc if you sweep endlessly on this shape. You'll want to practice both switching direction immediately, and having to pick the string twice for another note on both ends of the sweep: add in some hammered/pulled off notes of your own on that G string to get that down. Don't worry about note choice yet, we're talking about technique for now.

Ok, that's the basics. Now start applying these to a few other shapes so your fingers don't get used to only one kind of sweep: 

    l--------------9------------l----------------10------------l
    l---------10-----10--------l-----------10-------10---------l
    l-----11-------------11----l-------11---------------11-----l
    l-12--------------------12-l--12------------------------12-l
    l--------------------------l-------------------------------l
    l--------------------------l-------------------------------l

Here's two four string sweeps to add a little extra. Again, play as triplets - three notes to a click. Don't play them one after the other just yet. On the second one, you're going to want to play both of those 10th fret notes with your first finger. Learning how to roll your finger is one of the tougher parts of sweep picking - apply the same ideas about fretting the note/deadening previous notes, but using just one finger! Add some hammered/pulled off notes at the top and bottom of these sweeps to get used to both styles of sweep-direction changes. Again, just use a comfortable one for now - worry about theory later.

Here's a final shape that's a killer. It's a 5 stringer, but you can turn the sweep around at the G or D strings too just fine - in fact the three string version of this is one of my favorites:

    l---------------------10h14p10-----------------l
    l-----------------12-------------12------------l
    l-------------11---------------------11--------l
    l--------12-----------------------------12-----l
    l--9h14------------------------------------14--l
    l----------------------------------------------l

Remember - be conscious of how you're transferring each time you change direction. Start slow, and focus on fretting/muting with your left hand and proper pick direction in your right. The SYNC is more important than speed!! You actually don't have to sweep too fast to sound impressive.

That's the technique lesson. Next time, a theory lesson on how to construct sweep patterns, embellish them, and where/how to use them in a song. Learning this technique takes time, don't feel like you can tear through this lesson in a day. In actual lessons, I would be stopping you and commenting on your playing, but I do not have the luxury of doing that via text. Feel free to ask questions in the comments, or let me know if something wasn't clear/you could use another example.

Just recently (as I'm beginning to learn a bit of theory), I've been actively trying to play the chord tones of the scale when playing along to a backtrack (simple I-IV-V stuff)...

...and holy shit...it's like I've never picked up the guitar before.  I am amazed at how foreign this is.  My fingers want to do one thing (incorrectly), my thinking brain is trying to figure out what is happening (and why?), and my ""doing brain"" is trying to override my fingers.  Its like a dog trying to fuck a turtle eating a lawnmower.

I'm not sure if I'm working against some bad habits (probably), if this is just ""part of the leaning"" process (hopefully), or if I'm just fucking retarded (likely).  I've been reduced to picking only the tonic note (?) for each chord, whereas prior to this little experiment in ""doing things correctly"" I was able to mindlessly run through the scale like I knew what I was doing (...to be fair, I didn't and it sounds WAY better hitting the chord tones,...even in this infancy state).

Aside from the actual mechanics of playing, it seems to me that all of the following is happening when trying to learn to play a scale over a progression:

--Processing the notes of the scale in the pattern (although I'm using a sheet to look at the note names as I'm playing them).

--Processing the note names on the fretboard

--Processing which chord of the progression currently in

--Processing which chord comes next

--Processing which notes make up the current chord

--Sending finger signals to hit current chord tone notes

--Figuring out that ""if I want to hit the next tonic note, then I need to target the E"" in the scale

--Repeat all

That is a LOT of shit to think about in 1, four beat measure.

Maybe I should be glad that simply recognizing that this is where I'm at, is a sign of progress.

Okay...I think my little ""This is SO HARD"" tantrum is done.

Note:

- Youtube links are probably the best, but anything that will stream to a regular PC is fine.

- No zany be-bop or shredding. Not when I'm doing this for free. Also, I am not good enough for this kind of really advanced shit. Anything blues/country/folk/rock/pop/alternative is fine.

- No promises- if I'm overloaded, or get bored, or really hate the song/s, I reserve the right to opt out. I won't totally scumbag out though. Probably.

BRING THA NOISE!

- Sonic Youth, the greatest experimental rock band ever - [Brother James](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgxevKwvbaQ)

- The Drones, the most frightening and frighteningly talented garage/blues/punk/noise to come from Australia, possibly ever. Gareth treats a Fender Jag just right - [Six Ways To Sunday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eD-IOKWahw)

MELLOW OUT

- Nick Drake, another genius who succumbed to mental health issues way too early :( - [Pink  Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXnfhnCoOyo)

- Joni Mitchell. If you only know her as 'the chick who did Big Yellow Taxi' before Counting Crows, you are sorely uninformed. She was (is) a deadset genius - [A Case Of You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voJjexENok)

GET THE BLUES:

- Hendrix, you know? The greatest electric blues player of all time, hands down. Not just a freaky rocker. Hear he is on a 12-string acoustic, for something different. You should acquire the posthumously released compilation 'Jimi Hendrix - Blues'. All of you. Now. - [Hear My Train Comin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rOh0dYGFyM). Maybe skip to about 1:10.

Much as blues makes heavy use of a particular chord progression (I-IV-V), jazz compositions and improvisations frequently employ a standard progression: the ii-V-I.  Here's a primer on playing with this progression, its origin, and some simple ways to spice it up.

*The origin*

In western music, the ""strongest"" chord change is the V-I cadence.  For example, in the key of C Major, a progression that goes G-C is very nice.  Wanting to makes things a bit more interesting harmonically, jazz players added one chord onto the front: Dm - G - C.  Why did they choose Dm?  The interval between D and G is the same as that between G and C: in both cases we're going from a chord in C Major to another chord in C Major such that the first chord has its root a perfect fifth above the second chord's root.  That is, D-G is a like a V-I change, and G-C is a V-I change.  So the ii-V-I progression is really just two consecutive V-I changes.  Anyway... wikipedia has [a much better explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II-V-I) that you can read, too.

*The basic progression*

The ii-V-I can be played in major and minor keys.

*In a major key*

Harmonizing the major scale gives these chords: Imaj7, ii7, iii7, IVmaj7, V7, vi7, vii7b5.  That is, harmonizing the C major scale gives Cmaj7, Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7, Bm7b5.  The jazz progression in a major key then, is ii7 - V7 - Imaj7 (in C major: Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7).  Frequently, the V7 chord is extended to V9 or V13 in the major progression.  Here are some nice basic fingerings for this progression (both using extended chords in place of the V7 chord):

        Dm7   G9  Cmaj7
    e|---x----10---x---|
    B|---10---10---8---|
    G|---10---10---9---|
    D|---10---9----9---|
    A|---x----10---x---|
    E|---10---x----8---|

        Dm7   G13  Cmaj7
    e|---5----x----3---|
    B|---6----5----5---|
    G|---5----4----4---|
    D|---7----3----5---|
    A|---5----x----3---|
    E|---x----3----x---|

To improvise over this progression, use the C Major scale throughout (which is like playing D Dorian - G Mixolydian - C Ionian), or simplify to a C major pentatonic scale.

*In a minor key*

Harmonizing the (natural) minor scale gives these chords: i7, ii7b5, IIImaj7, iv7, v7, VImaj7, VII7.  For C minor: Cm7, Dm7b5, Emaj7, Fm7, Gm7, Amaj7, B7.  The straight minor progression should then be ii7b5 - v7 - i7.  However, more often you'll see that v7 chord *altered* and *major*, which provides a stronger resolution to the i7 chord.  So, a more common minor jazz progression is ii7b5 - Valt7 - i7 (in C minor: Dm7b5 - Galt7 - Cm7).  What is an altered seventh chord?  It's a chord that contains the root, major 3rd, and b7, but also one or more of b5, #5, b9, #9, #11, or b13.  A common choice is #5... so Dm7b5 - Galt7 - Cm7 is played as Dm7b5 - G7#5 - Cm7.  A #9 alteration is also a reasonable choice, giving Dm7b5 - G7#9 - Cm7.  Here are a couple nice fingerings for this progression (both using alterations of the v7 chord):

       Dm7b5 G7#5 Cm7
    e|---x----x----3---|
    B|---6----4----4---|
    G|---5----4----3---|
    D|---6----3----5---|
    A|---5----x----3---|
    E|---x----3----x---|


       Dm7b5 G7#9 Cm7
    e|---x----x----x---|
    B|---9----11---8---|
    G|---10---10---8---|
    D|---10---9----8---|
    A|---x----10---x---|
    E|---10---x----8---|

Here, you can use the C Minor scale throughout or simplify to a C minor pentatonic scale.  When using an altered chord (as above) you can also play an altered scale over the V chord.

*Some simple substitutions*

The ii-V-I is a more interesting progression than just V-I, as discussed above.  Still, it can get a little stale if you stick with the same voicings of the same chords for a long time.  Moving between voicings or changing chords subtly can help (in the major progression, choose a V9 or a V13 or a V7 to mix it up a little; in the minor, switch up the alterations on the Valt7 chord).  Another way to spice things up is to use chord substitutions.  Here are three common substitutions used in the ii-V-I.

*Tritone Substitution*

In a major key, mix things up with a ""tritone substitution"" (also called a ""flat 5 substitution"").  Here, instead of playing the V7 chord in the ii7-V7-Imaj7, we play a dominant seventh chord (or some extended dominant chord) whose root is a tritone (3 whole steps, also called a diminished fifth, flat fifth, sharp fourth, or augmented fourth) above the original V7 chord's root.  For example, in C major, rather than play Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7 the tritone substitution gives us Dm7 - C#7 - Cmaj7.

Your ears will tell you that this works, but why does it work?  First, notice that both the original and substituted chords are major chords, so the general character of the chord is not changed by the substitution. Second, the chords share two important notes… in G7, G is the root, B is the 3, D is the 5, and F is the b7.  In C#7, C# is the root, F is the 3, G# is the 5, and B is the b7.  B and F are shared, which helps the subbed chord to fit with the general sound of the original progression.  Third, the substituted chord creates a chromatic descending pattern of the chord roots.  Instead of D - G - C as roots, we get D - C# - C, which descends nicely to the I chord.  In sum, the similarity of the original and subbed chords (both in structure and actual notes) as well as the pleasant descending motion of the chord roots make this substitution work.

Here's a nice fingering for the tritone substitution in a major ii-V-I (use it with the first major progression shown above):

        Dm7   Db9  Cmaj7
    e|---5----4----3---|
    B|---6----4----5---|
    G|---5----4----4---|
    D|---7----3----5---|
    A|---5----4----3---|
    E|---x----x----x---|

*Diminished Passing Chord*

Another fun twist on a major key ii-V-I is to use a diminished chord to transition from the I chord back to the ii that starts the progression over.  Once again, put the root of the dim7 chord on the note between the I root and the ii root.  In C Major, we'd play Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7 - C#dim7 (here, note that the I chord (Cmaj7) would normally be played for two bars, but we'd substitute C#dim7 for the second of these bars).

Again, there is a chromatic progression of chord roots (this time ascending: C -  C# - D), and the C#dim7 chord nicely anticipates the return to the Dm7.

Here's a nice fingering for adding this dim7 passing chord to a major ii-V-I:

        Dm7    G13   Cmaj7 C#dim7
    e|---5-----x-----3-----x---|
    B|---6-----5-----5-----5---|
    G|---5-----4-----4-----3---|
    D|---7-----3-----5-----5---|
    A|---5-----x-----3-----4---|
    E|---x-----3-----x-----x---|

(You can use [interchangeable diminished 7th chords](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/b0le2/interchangeable_diminished_7th_chords/) to add extra flavor when using this substitution).

*Diminished Chord for Valt7*

In a minor key, you can use a iidim7 chord in place of the Valt7.  For example, rather than Dm7b5 - G7#5 - Cm7, play Dm7b5 - Ddim7 - Cm7.  This is sometimes described as substituting a dim7 chord on the ""five of the five""... that is, play the dim7 chord rooted on the note that is a fifth above the root of the five chord (Valt7).

Why does the substitution work in this case?  Originally, we were going to play G7#5, which contains G, B, D#, and F (the root, 3, #5, and b7).  We're substituting Ddim7, which contains D, F, Ab, and B (the root, b3, b5, and bb7).  As before, two notes (B and F) are common to the two chords.  This substitution also works because three of the notes in the dim7 chord: D, F, and Ab (the root, b3, and b5) are in key,  (note that these same notes appear in the ii7b5), and the one ""odd note out"" is the bb7, which is the major 7th of the i7 chord that we're headed toward.  Thus, when moving Dm7b5 - Ddim7 - Cm7, the Dm7b5 - Ddim7 change constitutes a change of only a single note (the b7 drops to bb7) and the drop brings us to a leading tone for the Cm7 chord.

Here's a nice fingering for the dim7 chord substitution for the Valt7 in a minor ii-V-i:

       Dm7b5 Ddim7 Cm7
    e|---x----x----3---|
    B|---6----6----4---|
    G|---5----4----3---|
    D|---6----6----5---|
    A|---5----5----3---|
    E|---x----x----x---|

/r/guitarlessons, let's talk about practicing with a band. Recently, my band has been taking our good, sweet time with really nailing the details of our songs. What are some tips and tricks you have regarding band practice? I'll hit the obvious ones-

* **Slow it down**: when it doubt, slow it down. If you just can't seem to get that part, slow it down. Slow it down to the point that you are humbled at the fact that you have to play something at 40 BPM. It's never a bad idea to slow things down.

* **Repeating sections**: take a section of music (verse through the chorus), play it, and count off without stopping, talking, or feedback. Just keep going. Over and over. ***Repetition is the mother of all learning.***

* **Play with a metronome**: the metronome doesn't lie. it is unforgiving. and every second you spend with a metronome is a second you spent improving your timing. A comfort with rhythms is every bit as important as a comfort with scales and fretwork.

* **Record yourselves**: this one is huge. There is nothing as stimulating as listening to yourself in the buff; getting to hear every subtle nuance of that moment in time. Noting your progress is just as important as being committed to making it. [Here](http://soundcloud.com/brad-arl/ifallelsefails8-19) is a recording of my band from from 8/19/12 (19/8/12). [This](http://soundcloud.com/brad-arl/1-1) is the same song recorded 9/15/12 (15/9/12). Since august, we've added autotune, a stop, backup vocals, and I feel like I'm missing some stuff.

At present, /r/guitarlessons is growing by about 40 people per day and so we're growing at a pretty steady rate. That we're growing so quickly is great, but it also presents new challenges in terms of both the direction of the community and the content being submitted. 

------------

**[Lesson] Tags**


At present, the subreddit seems to be characterized by two types of posts: lessons and questions. The front page, to me, feels a little disjointed and disorganized at times and it may seem a little confused to new subscribers. What I'm proposing to help organize the front page a little better is to have guitar teachers use a [Lesson] tag when submitting their posts. This could at least help people better navigate the front page but also serve as a reminder that its appropriate to ask for advice/help and that this subreddit isn't exclusively for posting lessons. I'll include a reminder of this on the submission page. 


------------
**Sidebar: Organized Lessons and FAQs**

One of the suggestions I received was about the sidebar and 're-organizing' it to include a more organized lesson set. This would involve having three categories in the sidebar for Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Misc lessons. The beginner section might act as a ""FAQ"" section which might include an overview of what music is, what scales are, the anatomy of electric / acoustic guitars, and a glossary of terms. I'm uncomfortable with including a gear-guide and a ""what to buy"" section as a few people have suggested, mainly because gear is rather subjective. A glossary of terms, I think, would help explain what sorts of gear is out there without making any value claims.

If you have specific lesson / post in mind, recommend it here.

------------
**Personal Link Submissions**

One of the main complaints that I've received since becoming a mod has to do with the submitting of personal links. Blogs, youtube accounts, etc. might fall into this category. The general consensus has been that people are more than happy to have these posts insofar as submitters aren't spamming them. If a website is showing up multiple times on the front page, its probably being posted a little too quickly. While the lessons may provide valuable insight, its not really fair for a few individuals to monopolize the front page with submissions. I have *zero* desire to police submissions, so all I ask is that people use discretion when posting their personal links.

------------
**Themed Posts**

One of the suggestions I received by a few people was having a themed posted once a week. I've thought about this and I think it's a great idea. A few of the ideas I have are ""Gear Discussion"", ""Song Writing"", ""Technique Questions"", ""General Theory"", etc. One themed post that I think would be quite interesting would revolve around people discussing problems they had related to their playing/learning and detailing what they did to overcome that problem. 

If you have your own ideas about potential themes, they are more than welcome. 

------------
**TL/DR of everything above:**

Lesson posts use a [Lesson] tag when posting.

Re-organizing sidebar to include more organized lessons, i.e. beginner, intermediate, and advanced sections. (Recommendations?)

Personal link submissions: (please) don't spam.

Themed Posts: Once a week, a post dedicated to a theme. 

Life philosophy: be excellent to each other.

**Accept the fact that, at first, you WILL suck. And you will continue to suck until you build up callouses. In fact, for the first several weeks of learning, you should be more concerned with sucking while building up callouses than you should be about perfecting your chords.**

The most obvious reason so many people give up on guitar is because ""its hard,"" but I have found that many people don't seem to understand that it doesn't matter how fast you can memorize chords if your pudgy fingertips are smooshing over the strings and touching stuff they shouldn't.

But yeah, I have one friend who is doing really well with the new outlook on practicing and another who almost gave up on guitar but can now do a few clean chords... all because instead of thinking they sucked at guitar, they realized that it was more of a physiological thing that you can't really shortcut, and if you stick in it long enough to earn your callouses, practicing becomes legitimately fun.

So again, for all you beginners who got a guitar and a chordbook and are edging on giving up because ""you can't do it."" You can't -- **yet**. Keep practicing your chords, but switch your mindset from, ""I can't play this chord clean yet,"" to, ""I don't have enough callous yet.""

I'm one of the most ADD people imagineable, but I've gotten to the point where I enjoy playing a couple hours a day if I can... and its fun because I have earned my calluses. 


**Edit:** Just to add something that [yakka2](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/fjkxg/the_best_beginner_advice_i_wish_someone_had_told/c1ge8s5) mentioned... coming to terms with sucking is something that you'll need to get used to every time you try to up-the-ante and reach a new level of playing. I mean, a lot more comes into play like muscle memory and strumming styles -- but one constant remains the same: you will suck at first. But that's okay, even the best guitarists sucked before they didn't.


tl;dr: You can either worry about embarrassing yourself and end up never learning a really awesome instrument, or you can do what many other people fail to do and keep working towards your goal long enough that your body catches up to your mind.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,True,,,True,t3_fjkxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/fjkxg/the_best_beginner_advice_i_wish_someone_had_told/,

So when I jam with others I can usually figure out the key pretty easily. I then just solo over the progression by just playing around the same scale of the key that the chord progression is in.

I have read a lot about scales and modes. A lot. Like others I'm still unaware of exactly how to use modes. 

1.) Okay so when soloing, are you supposed to just use the same scale of the key the entire chord progression is in? I understand some chord progressions can switch keys, so when that happens I obviously just switch the scale I'm playing to fit the new key. 

2) Am I supposed to change the scale I'm playing with each individual chord in the progression? So when a Dm comes up I just play a scale to fit it, either Dm itself, or another one containing the Dm chord, but then when A comes up, I switch it to fit A? And is this how modes come into play? I would just use a different mode to fit each chord in the progression, instead of staying in one scale that matches the progression's key?  

So whenever an A chord pops up, I just choose a different mode to play over that A, based on the sound that I want? Then when the next chord in the progression pops up, say a Cm, I change to a different mode to fit Cm?

3) Or is staying in one scale that matches the key of the entire progression the correct way to do it, and you use the modes of the scale you're playing as you change chords.

For instance if the progression is C, Dm, Em, Dm


Would I just use the C major scale, and when we play over C I just play the first mode, when we got up to Dm, do I use the second mode within the C major scale, then move to the third when we go to Em???

Or are all of those ways okay?


I'm sure that questions been asked a million times?

Personally for technique I spend 15-20 minutes doing an exercise with a metronome, repeating a single pattern for a number of frets or the whole fret board, then raise the tempo slightly and repeat. I try to do it every day for at least an hour, doing 3-4 different patterns. At times I get carried away and do two or maybe even three hours.

In the patterns I try to keep an odd number of notes, so for each 'run' the picking pattern will be the opposite of the previous one. The patterns I create myself from any flaws I notice in my playing, and focus on it heavily until I can play it right effortlessly, then move on to the next one.

Naturally any exercise is done without any types of effects or distortion, unless it's a hammer on/pull-off/legato type of thing.

After the exercises I either start learning songs or solos, or just fool around and play, depending on the mood. For solos and riffs, I set the tempo to half of the original and play until I can play it completely clean; This is what I like to call the 'foundation' of it. After that I again raise the metronome by a small amount and play until I get it clean on that tempo, then repeat.

Riffs and solos are broken into parts. After I get the parts played I work on integrating them with a metronome so I can play both adjacent parts seamlessly together.

Anyway, I've been playing guitar (Blues/Blues Rock) for a couple of years now and I'm feeling sort of lost with it. I can play all of the common chords, E-Shaped Barre chords, A-Shaped Barre chords, and can play lead (albeit poorly) in the first position of the minor Pentatonic scale. But when I see someone like Jack White or Jimmy Page play, I don't see how to get from where I am to anywhere near where they are. I really don't expect to be as good as those guys ever, but I'd like to know what to practice in order to lessen that gap. If anyone can give me sort of an outline of what I need to learn, I would be in your debt.

Riffs Stolen From Other Instruments

Standard rules apply:

1. Of course, tab links are required as well as a youtube/soundcloud video of the song.

2. Powertab/Guitar Pro links are allowed, but only in conjunction with the tabs.

3. I think including a genre tag just so we can see what we may get ourselves into or filter through genres easier.
4. Please no Smoke on the Water.
5. If you're feeling brave, record yourself playing that song and let us critique you! Outside ears can be very beneficial!
6. Post any tips you may have for playing the song if you feel them necessary.
7. Have fun and remember reddiquette! Don't downvote a riff just because you don't like that particular band and don't bash someone's choice or skill!

Step 4. It takes you to a page with the scale laid out for you.  This is good practice, also, but there's a link below that says ""Chords that sound good with xxxxxx scale"".  Click this.

[x-post to /r/guitar],29,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1f19gq/best_guitartools_to_start_teaching_self_xpost_to/,"I'm looking into buying a guitar and teaching myself. Would like to keep my total cost to around a couple hundred dollars (US$), with the thought that if I get good enough/want to keep going I'd upgrade down the road.

I've played piano for almost 30 years. I've self taught myself other instruments like flute, violin, etc. I'm no novice at picking up a new instrument and learning. My father has a very nice acoustic guitar that a friend of his handmade (my dad used to be a bit of a hippy and made guitars - awesome!) and I've picked that up a few times, back when I lived at home, to try to start teaching myself, but never quite got passed the fingertips hurting phase.

My father is *not* going to part with his guitar, so I'd like to pick up my own, but am not sure at all what to get/look for. I'm also curious if anyone knows of good online websites, software, programs, or books, etc, to help me self-teach. Again, if I got a point I wanted lessons I'd definitely seek those out. I have a tendancy to pick up new hobbies and get bored, so I want to start off on my own first and see if the spark ignites. 

Thanks in advance!

**ETA: Thanks to all for the great replies - I feel like I have a good base to look into supplies now and will maybe even try to find a teacher/some lessons to start off with since I can see how that'd probably be a good idea ;)**",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,1369774214.0,,,True,t3_1f19gq,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1f19gq/best_guitartools_to_start_teaching_self_xpost_to/,

I would say I am intermediate level. I played random gigs for venues, for my church, and my jazz band.
I know my basic theory (circle of 5th, tirades, how keys and changes work) and I can improvise like a novice (using the first block of the pentatonic) Wasn't the most creative but I would just come to practice for my church and find out key and just make up random arpeggios and licks.

I have a fairly good ear. I know what a good solo consist of but I just don't know how to make it like that.

What I lack the most is creativity and especially speed.

I have this book: [Shred Guitar](http://www.amazon.com/Shred-Guitar-Complete-Improviser-Contemporary/dp/1576236048/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365169537&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+to+shred+guitar). I was wondering if anybody had experience with it and anyone can tell me what's the best way I can use this book (or not this book but some other program).

I just would like help getting into the rhythm of things (pun not intended).

I'm having a few problems, which are problems that everyone has to deal with, I'm sure.

1. Getting all of the notes to sound. My teacher has me working on E, Em, A, and Am shapes, and I'm having issues with either the notes in the barre (specifically on the G and B strings) or the notes played by the middle finger not sounding. I know what the problems are (barre not straight or lined up properly or pinky muting the string below it) but I'm not sure how to fix them. I'm trying to correct the angle but my hand just doesn't want to do it yet. 

2. The A shape.

I'd like to be able to choose between different tunings and scales for those tunings.

Also, I'd like to have the option of having those scales repeat indefinitely.

I have an app right now, Scale Wizard by Planet Waves, but I have to stroke the screen to make it run through once or once up and then back down.  Not conducive to how I learn.

The minor pentatonic scale is a staple of blues and rock guitar.  This lesson gives an overview of the scale, outlines some useful positions, and shows how to connect the different positions to make your leads more interesting and dynamic.


**Minor Pentatonic Scale Construction**

The minor pentatonic scale is based on the natural minor scale, but uses only five notes instead of seven; that's why it's a pentatonic ""five tone"" scale.

The natural minor scale includes the root (r), major 2nd (2), minor 3rd (b3), perfect 4th (4), perfect 5th (5), minor 6th (b6), and minor 7th (b7).  Starting with the root on the sixth string, the natural minor scale looks like this:

    e | r |   | 2 |b3 |   |
    B | 5 |b6 |   |b7 |   |
    G |b3 |   | 4 |   |   |
    D |b7 |   | r |   | 2 |
    A | 4 |   | 5 |b6 |   |
    E | r |   | 2 |b3 |   |

The minor pentatonic scale omits two of the seven notes in the natural minor scale... the 2 and the b6 are dropped out, leaving r, b3, 4, 5, and b7.  Here is the same  position with the 2 and b6 dropped to form a minor pentatonic scale:

    e | r |   |   |b3 |   |
    B | 5 |   |   |b7 |   |
    G |b3 |   | 4 |   |   |
    D |b7 |   | r |   |   |
    A | 4 |   | 5 |   |   |
    E | r |   |   |b3 |   |

This position is simple to memorize and simple to play, in part because of the way the bottom of the pattern lays all the way across the fretboard at one fret: the pattern is easily played using only the first (index) and third (ring) fingers and doesn't require repositioning of the fretting hand along the neck.  Many beginners learn this shape and never explore beyond it, which ultimately makes for pretty boring solos.  The minor pentatonic scale can be played in a number of other positions and learning them will open up the fretboard quite a bit.

**Other Minor Pentatonic Positions**

We already looked at the first position for the minor pentatonic scale, but let's put it into a particular key so it's easier to locate on the fretboard.  The following diagrams show the A minor pentatonic scale in multiple positions along the neck (number below the diagram shows fret position):

*Position 1:*

    e | r |   |   |b3 |   |
    B | 5 |   |   |b7 |   |
    G |b3 |   | 4 |   |   |
    D |b7 |   | r |   |   |
    A | 4 |   | 5 |   |   |
    E | r |   |   |b3 |   |
        |
        5

*Position 2:*

    e |   |b3 |   | 4 |   |
    B |   |b7 |   | r |   |
    G | 4 |   | 5 |   |   |
    D | r |   |   |b3 |   |
    A | 5 |   |   |b7 |   |
    E |   |b3 |   | 4 |   |
            |
            8

*Position 3:*

    e |   | 4 |   | 5 |   |
    B |   | r |   |   |b3 |
    G | 5 |   |   |b7 |   |
    D |   |b3 |   | 4 |   |
    A |   |b7 |   | r |   |
    E |   | 4 |   | 5 |   |
            |
           10

*Position 4:*

    e | 5 |   |   |b7 |   |
    B |   |b3 |   | 4 |   |
    G |b7 |   | r |   |   |
    D | 4 |   | 5 |   |   |
    A | r |   |   |b3 |   |
    E | 5 |   |   |b7 |   |
        |
        12


*Position 5:*

    e |   |b7 |   | r |   |
    B |   | 4 |   | 5 |   |
    G | r |   |   |b3 |   |
    D | 5 |   |   |b7 |   |
    A |   |b3 |   | 4 |   |
    E |   |b7 |   | r |   |
            |
           15


Note that once you reach the last position, you can play the first position again starting on the 17th fret (it's the same position one octave higher up the fretboard).  Similarly,  position 5 can be played an octave lower by starting it at the 3rd fret.


Only a very modest amount of practice and repetition is required to memorize and become fluent with all five positions.  If it's not already obvious, note that the shapes fit together (like puzzle pieces) as you move up the fretboard (i.e., the right side of Position 1 perfectly matches the left side of Position 2; the right side of Position 2 matches the left side of Position 3; and so on...).  Seeing the repetition of the pattern can help you learn how these shapes fit together.


All five positions are useful.  However, I personally find that Positions 1 and 4 are exceptionally useful.  This is because they are easiest to play based on shape and because they have the root note in a easy-to-use position on the 6th and 5th strings (respectively).  Once you've got the positions down, you can begin playing minor pentatonic leads all over the neck rather than just in that first position.  It's much easier to add excitement and tension to a lead when you can expand the range of notes that you're using by moving up the neck.


**Diagonal Shapes to Connect the Positions**

Learning the positions above is a great start, and some players will feel that the fretboard opens up immediately when they can use all five.  However, some folks (like myself) find that they can use the different positions, but can't easily move between them. That is, it's easy to get stuck in one position: even if you know there's a useful position next door it can be hard to ""get there"".  These two ""diagonal"" shapes (shown again in A Minor Pentatonic) span the positions and so provide a natural way to move among them.  Play these patterns using just your first and third fingers. When ascending, a ""&gt;&gt;&gt;"" shown in the pattern indicates that you should move between the surrounding notes by sliding your third finger up.  When descending, a ""&lt;&lt;&lt;"" indicates that you should move between notes by sliding your first finger down.


*Diagonal across Positions 5, 1, and 2:*

    e |   |   |   |   |   |   |b3 |   | 4 |
    B |   |   |   |   |   |   |b7 |   | r |
    G |   |   |   |b3 |&lt;&lt;&lt;| 4 |&gt;&gt;&gt;| 5 |   |
    D |   |   |   |b7 |   | r |   |   |   |
    A |   |b3 |&lt;&lt;&lt;| 4 |&gt;&gt;&gt;| 5 |   |   |   |
    E |   |b7 |   | r |   |   |   |   |   |
            |       |           |
            3       5           8

*Diagonal across positions 3, 4, and 5:*

    e |   |   |   |   |   |   |b7 |   | r |
    B |   |   |   |   |b3 |&lt;&lt;&lt;| 4 |&gt;&gt;&gt;| 5 |
    G |   |   |   |b7 |   | r |   |   |   |
    D |   |b3 |&lt;&lt;&lt;| 4 |&gt;&gt;&gt;| 5 |   |   |   |    
    A |   |b7 |   | r |   |   |   |   |   |
    E |   | 4 |   | 5 |   |   |   |   |   |
            |       |           |    
           10      12          15

Use these shapes to create nice ascending and descending runs, and simply to move around the neck to add variety to your playing.  If you learn a couple licks in each of the minor pentatonic positions, these shapes can help you bridge between positions to access them.  Practice these shapes ascending and descending and practice using just half of the patterns to move a shorter distance along the neck.  Hopefully, you'll never feel stuck in a single minor pentatonic position again!

Well wait no longer, fo we are gonna Thursday, because I say so.

This week's theme is:

**Acoustic songs**

It can be either songs written for the acoustic guitar, or stuff modified from electric to acoustic, or what have you, so long it played on an acoustic guitar.

Standard rules apply:

1. Of course, tab links are required as well as a youtube/soundcloud video of the song.

2. Powertab/Guitar Pro links are allowed, but only in conjunction with the tabs.

3. I think including a genre tag just so we can see what we may get ourselves into or filter through genres easier.
4. Please no Smoke on the Water.
5. If you're feeling brave, record yourself playing that song and let us critique you! Outside ears can be very beneficial!
6. Post any tips you may have for playing the song if you feel them necessary.
7. Have fun and remember reddiquette! Don't downvote a riff just because you don't like that particular band and don't bash someone's choice or skill!

The things i liked to play on electric guitar all sounded very empty, so to speak, you needed a rhytm guitar to make it sound complete. Which makes a lot of sense of course. 

Now with acoustic songs, like [this one for example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xtbF6I8GWc), it doesn't sound empty because he's also using the some lower notes through the song, in addition to the higher tones. Having played only solo-ish stuff and some riffs that don't sound complete when you play them alone, this is really cool in my opinion. 

The problem is, i can't really think of acoustic songs like this, and i'm kind of new to finger picking. Finger picking on an acoustic guitar was the first thing i started out with as a kid though, so it might come back a bit easier now, who knows. So i was looking for some recommendations for some songs that use this ... technique (?).

Since most people learn the 5 shapes of the pentatonic scales first, DAE use those shapes as sort of a ""base"" for the major scale? For example, since a pentatonic scale is basically the major scale minus a few notes, does anyone think about major scales as pentatonic only adding a few notes in certain spots?

I feel like this may make it easier for some people when trying to memorize a major scale... It can be a little overwhelming to think of each shape of the major scale all over the fretboard, but thinking in terms of pentatonic and then adding a few notes might make it easier to comprehend.

I put my guitar away earlier today frustrated with where my skills were at. I decided to not play for the next week thinking that perhaps I am just sick of the sound of my guitar. I was on youtube a bit later and as usual my clicking led me to watching music videos. Well, I couldn't resist digging my guitar out again so I decided to try something different. I picked a basic rhythm guitar piece (wonderwall) and played it along with my metronome.

Surprise surprise, my rhythm was way off. I was playing ""UDUD"" much faster than the rest of the strokes, ruining the groove. While I've practiced with a metronome before I've always ignored it thinking I have great natural rhythm... what a joke. After practicing with a metronome for about thirty minutes I found it completely changed the timing of everything I played. Suddenly the rest of the songs I knew sounded nice again. I then practiced Tangerine by playing along with tuxguitar and improved my sense of timing there as well.

I then played other songs I knew without a metronome such as Wish You Were Here and something I got off of an acoustic rock DVD and even they had improved.

So I think I'm officially converted. From now on when I'm practicing songs I'm going to either use a guitarpro file, a metronome or play along to the song itself.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,False,,,True,t3_djpvx,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/djpvx/how_i_went_from_hating_every_note_i_struck_for_a/,

So I've been playing guitar on and off for almost five years now, and my problem is that I'm not nearly as good as I should be at this point. I know the open chords, as well as barre chords (Maj, min, Dom7, min7). I'm also quite familiar with the pentatonic scale - in several modes. That's pretty much it. I know the major and natural minor scales, but I don't really know how to integrate it into my playing, nor do I know how to play fast. I know a bit of theory; however, I could not tell you which chord would go well with a particular scale. I've  never attempted to write any of my own material, mainly because there are very few existing songs that I know how to play - I think that's my biggest problem.

The reason for why I'm not progressing as quickly as I should be is because I have very little motivation for playing, and I know why: because I don't know what to practice. This is not for lack of practice material; I have a lot of material to work with. In fact, I'd say this is the big reason for why I don't want to play. When your computer has 169GB of guitar e-books, instructional videos, notes and bookmarks stored on it (yes, I know...), playing guitar gets to be a bit daunting: You don't know where to start, you don't know which book or video offers the best teaching method, etc. In other words, practicing hasn't become difficult because of too few choices, it's become difficult because of an overabundance of choice! I'll start on one course, only to drop it for a new one after a few days. I've given up playing guitar in the past for the same reason.

I have tried coming up with practice routines in the past, but there are a few problems with this. Firstly, assigning practice times to certain tasks is pointless, as something always comes up (chores, meals, friends, etc.). Second, writing something like ""practice the major scale and modes for xx"" means very little if you don't know **how to practice those scales to integrate them into your general playing/improvising**. Third, though I know what my long-term goals are, I'm not very good at making short-term goals for myself, and without those, going through those strict practice routines can seem like you're not really getting anywhere. Last but not least, how do I know which practice routine is best for improving my playing?
I've also tried a few teachers in the past, but none of them were really helpful - or looked like they knew what they were doing, for that matter - even after several months of instruction. At this point, going to a teacher isn't really an option finance-wise for the time being.

It's not all hopeless, however, since I do have some good practicing habits. My rhythm is pretty solid due to the fact that I play everything under the sun with a metronome or a backing track. I play most of what I learn from ear, using tabs only when the record is particularly old, or a part of the track is played too fast for my ear to pick up individual notes (in which case I usually end up using audio software to clean it up/slow it down anyway). I'm also very particular about playing as cleanly as possible.
I know my slides, bends, vibratos, hammer-ons (quite well), pull offs (not as well), double stops, I can use alternate picking or economy picking, and I can some 3-string sweeps.

So what I'm asking for is advice, preferably from the experienced guitarists on here, regarding practice. Should I spend some time on technique, or should I only worry about getting more songs in my repertoire for now? Should some time be spent on ""doodling"" to a backing track?
If I am going to set aside some time for scale/mode runs and other technique-related practice, what kind of exercises should I be doing?
If not, I have some ideas for albums I want to learn (lead and rhythm), including: AC/DC's *Back in Black*, Led Zeppelin's *Mothership*, Guns N' Roses' *Appetite for Destruction*, and *The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble*, in that order. I'm also thinking I should learn Van Halen's *Best of Both Worlds* at some point, but that's optional. If you have any suggestions, feel free to share!
Also, I'd like to know the best way to practice. Should I play everything I learn on an acoustic before playing it on an electric, Keith Richards-style? Should I learn everything with the upstrokes and downstrokes inverted, in addition to how it's played normally?

I mainly play electric guitar, but I do have a nice Taylor acoustic that I play from time to time. Some of my favorite artists are Guns N' Roses, Pink Floyd, Rush, Metallica, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Iron Maiden, Jimi Hendrix, and my all-time favorite: Dream Theater. I'm a metal-head through and through, I suppose, but I also listen to a bit of blues (B.B. King, Buddy Guy, etc) and some classical music (Vivaldi, Mozart and Tchaikovsky are my favorites). That said, my long-term goals are pretty clear: I want to be able to shred (but not rely on it), I want to be able to play whatever's in my head, I want to be able to play heavy metal, not only existing songs but also create my own.
To give you an idea of my skill level, I'd say the most complicated thing I can play is either the solo to ""She Builds Quick Machines"" by Velvet Revolver, or the solo to ""Enter Sandman,"" both very cleanly. 

So Reddit, what kind of practice routine can get me back into the game? :) If there are any books/instructional videos/websites/software that you swear by, please share.

Where do I even begin?,29,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/v5t1u/wanting_to_learn_guitar_know_absolutely_nothing/,"Title pretty much says it all. I'm really, really wanting to learn Guitar. A lot of times I get an urge to want to do something, spend money, and give up. However, wanting to play guitar has always been a warm desire. Anyway, I'm really trying to do my research before investing my money into possibly learning the Guitar. Sadly, I know absolutely nothing about music. Absolutely nothing. I can't read music, identify parts of a guitar, or any of that, but I really want to learn, even if it takes me a long time before I can play the most basic of songs. I've been searching around this subreddit and reading other beginner posts, but still have some questions:

1. Electric vs. Acoustic. Are they more like different instruments (chords, etc.) all together rather than ""versions"" of a Guitar? I know Bass is completely different, but I didn't know there was difference between acoustic and an electric?

2. Is it true electric is easier to learn on for beginners? I don't know anything about the equipment (amps) either.

3. Are there any amazing books for learning? I found (this one)[http://www.amazon.com/How-Play-Guitar-Everything-Need/dp/0312287062/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339893914&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=learn+guitar] on Amazon which seems to be highly liked.

4. Ideal practice time? I've heard you can practice for ~15m/day and still make progress. That sounds wonderful, as I don't have much free time on my hands right now, but could still push 30+ other days.

5. Buying a Guitar. If Acoustic, is it better at my age (I'm 20) to start on a Beginner, or a normal sized one? If Electric, what should I be looking for, or are there good beginner electric guitars too? Also note that I'm hoping to use Amazon, as I have quite a bit of gift card allowance, and am a Prime member (free shipping).

6. Where in the world do I start? I literally know nothing at all about guitars or music. I'm hoping there's others on here who were in my shoes at one time. It's such an intimidating hobby to get started in when you know nothing, but I'm willing to give it a shot.

Thanks for any help! Also, if it's any addition, I love Classic Rock, and would love to learn classic rock songs, but would be willing to practice others as well. I'm really wanting to go all the way with this and make it a new hobby of mine.

All inspired by Jonny Greenwood's quote: ""*There's only 12 power chords, and I think we've had about 20 years of them, so maybe it's time to move on, aye?*"", I set out to find chords that not only were basically power chords (with the 1-5-x form (a real power chord, being 1-5-1)), or something similarly compressed into a three string form. So I drew the guitar fretboard out for about 5 frets, and mapped out all the specific intervals relating to a base root note, and I found a wealth of forms, such as:

    e|----------------------------|
    B|----------------------------|
    G|-5---4---3---0---2---3--4---|
    D|-5---5---5---2---2---2--2---|
    A|-3---3---3---3---3---3--3---|
    E|----------------------------|

(In order from right to left: Generic power chord (1-5-1), Dunno what to call this one(1-5-M7), (1-5-m7), Generic Cmaj Shape (1-3-5), maj 6th chord (1-3-6), 7th (1-3-m7), maj7th (1-3-M7))

and a lot more. 

I've found this comes into great use when learning the major scale forms, according to the Caged System, because the Caged System is a great way to learn the roots. So with the roots in mind, the intervals can be worked out. And the notes from there. It's great practice as well, in terms of its transposability, and it helps you to remember the notes in a scale, and their position. I also use it to work chords out, on the spot. 

The greatest thing about this method for me, is the fact that if I want a parallel minor chord, I just flatten the relative intervals, and there I have it. The main disadvantage though, is that you can find yourself in the same box shape if you don't expand.

Sorry about the long post, and hope this method works for anyone else. I'm self taught, so I don't know if this is common sense to most guitarists already, haha.

Here are a few places in which I'm stuck:

* I'm trying to learn all of my chords up and down the neck of the guitar. All of your drop-2 inversions and things like that. It feels like I'm just chipping away at them. The ones I do know, I don't know what to do with. Sure I'll try to play all of the chord changes of a tune in as little positions possible so as to not move all around the fretboard, but it doesn't sound right. I never know which version of a D-7b5 to play. 

* Every day I practice scales and modes up and down the neck in all different keys. It's great to know, but again, I can't use them. Improvisation is something I'm very weak in. I mean I can play a bit outside by using chromatics to get from A to B, but my melodic phrasing is just garbage. I'd give you an example, but I have no way of recording myself.

* My ear is pretty good and I can transcribe solos as long as they're slowed down, but I can't always recognize chord tones (I can hear major/minor/aug/dim, but I can't tell if you're playing a 6/7/9/11/13 chord).

So I've got my hammer and my screw driver, but I don't know how to build anything without blueprints. I have no problem playing something on sheet music. I've been told that fake books and play-alongs are both good and bad. Some say transcribing is the only way to go. I also enjoy studying music theory (especially the jazz theory book). 

Hope someone can point me in the right direction (books, blogs, advice). Getting passed this would help me with all genres of music, really.

I'm looking for a little advice/help/pointed in the right direction.

first a bit of back story,

I picked up the guitar back when I was in the UK equivalent of high school, I taught myself to play and diligently practiced for 45 minutes to 2 hours each day for a number of years. I wasn't exceptionally good I admit, but I was more than adequate for the type of music I enjoyed playing on guitar at the time so I was content.

Fast forward a number of years and depression sets in, this eventually causes me to stop practicing as regularly and eventually all together.

Now fast forward again to the present day and I realise that It's about time I got my shit together again, starting off with neglecting the instrument I'd previously loved so much, ideally starting from scratch because I really need to learn the fundamentals.

So, here's the question: Do you guys have any advise for someone getting back into guitar after not really playing for so long,
and do you guys know any good resources that would help someone with a little knowledge improve?",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,False,,,True,t3_14l2jo,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/14l2jo/picking_up_guitar_again_after_nearly_10_years_of/,

Googling like this like: *zz top ""cheap sunglasses"" backing track* returns these [practice tracks with the solos removed](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbs=vid%3A1&amp;q=zz+top+%22cheap+sunglasses%22+backing+track&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=) (or google to find some backing tracks of your favorite guitartists). 

Pick two or three or four notes and make those notes into the best solo you can. 

Do everything: bend up, down, slide between notes, play the same notes alternately an octave higher and lower, mix 16th, 8th, 1/4, half and whole notes. Change the order of the notes every way possible. Experiment with attack of the pick, with vibrato and every manner of articulation.
____________________________________________________________
**BACKGROUND:**

Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) is one of the best minimalist rock/blues soloist ever. Jimi Hendrix named Gibbons as one of the best and that's interesting because Hendrix was a monster technician and Gibbons is a minimalist, almost complete opposites. Everybody seems to want to shred but shredding doesn't have much heart or soul (unless you're Hendrix). ZZ is not one of my overall top few favorite bands but I love Billy exactly because of his simplicity.

Gibbons' soloing seems a little slow out of the gate and that's why he's so good for beginners to analyze and copy. It demonstrates that a good solo can be simple, all the while leaving a lot of time for beginners to think a little before moving their hands.

Notice how Billy almost always builds a solid foundation with just a very few notes notes at the beginning of a solo (sometimes only one or two notes and usually no more than four or five) and slowly but carefully branches out from that minimalist beginning.
___________________________________________________________
When you hear a solo that sounds good, often it's not just the notes that make it appealing to your ears, it's the articulation. *Articulation* is all the little extras that our hands can do besides just playing notes and strumming chords, things like:

* Hammer on
* Pull Off
* Slide up
* Slide down
* Dead notes
* Muted strings
* Haromonics
* Bend up
* Bend down
* Vibrato
* Slide (bottleneck)
* Trills
* Etc.
___________________________________________________________
**DETAILS:**
The following links start right at the beginning of a few of Billy's solos. Some are more complex than others but notice how significant parts are just one or two notes, usually right at the beginning of the solo and almost never more than four or five notes. Notice too how once he gets something good going -- *anything* good going -- he almost always repeats it a few times with just minor variations. Sometimes the variations are different notes, sometime the variations are added notes, and sometimes the variations are merely in articulation or meter. This is very helpful for the beginner soloist trying to fill time as he's thinking about what he's going to do next -- but don't think too hard; remember to keep it as simple as possible at first.

__________________________________________________________

So you see, often what he's got going is just one or two notes and maybe five at the most so he's making the best out of just a very little. Satisfied with that simple one or two note foundation, he repeats those original few notes with a few new variations or articulations. Very often if you need to or want to, you can play the same two or three notes past the present chord into the next chord change; just remember to add a little variation to make it sound different from the previous chord and phrase.

If you've listened to some slow blues, you'll know that a lot of players use that minimalist phrasing here and there but almost immediately start shredding it to pieces (think Jimi Hendrix's ""Red House""). While many players use the minimal approach only on slow blues, Gibbons uses simplicity to make his solos very satisfying even on faster and rocking tunes.

Search [google videos](http://video.google.com/?hl=en&amp;tab=wv) for more ""ZZ Top"" to find other Billy Gibbons solos. Often there's more than one solo in each song so listen all the way through to get the most out of each song and pay particular attention to the repetition and articulation.

Notice too that on the second solos and the live cuts, he plays with much more complexity and speed as if to prove he can do it. But over all, he likes to build it simple and soulfully. For our purposes here, this slow and simple approach gives the beginner some time to think about what to do next -- but again, don't think too hard -- remember to keep it as simple as possible for now. 

This minimalist approach will give you a great start to rock and blues soloing. Make all your solos simple like this and once you can confidently make every simple solos satisfying, begin to add a fifth, sixth, seventh note (and so on) one added note at a time. 

Hendrix is my favorite but I'll never be a Jimi Hendrix. Minimalism has been enough for me and Bill Gibbons and we never felt it necessary to shred unless the song demanded it. 

I'll take the slow soulful approach any day.

So again, to practice this approach, google to find the ZZ top backing track of your choice and play a simple solo over it. Googling like this like: *zz top ""cheap sunglasses"" backing track* returns these [practice tracks with the solos removed](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbs=vid%3A1&amp;q=zz+top+%22cheap+sunglasses%22+backing+track&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=) (or find your own). Pick two or three or four notes and make those notes into the best solo you can.

1265847357.0,22,self.guitarlessons,b0le2,"Interchangeable Diminished 7th Chords
",23,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/b0le2/interchangeable_diminished_7th_chords/,"**What is a diminished 7th chord?**

First, it helps to know some basics about chord construction.  Briefly, the standard chords are built from notes that are thirds apart.  The choice to use major thirds and minor thirds determines the tonality of the constructed chord.  If we pick a root note, then a note a major third above, and another note a minor third above that, we've constructied a major chord (we end up with the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth).  If we use a note a minor third above the root, and a second note a major third above *that*, we've constructed a minor chord (root, minor third, perfect fifth).  By adding a fourth note on top, we create seventh chords: choose a root note, a second note a major third above the root, another note a minor third above that, and a fourth note a minor third above that, we get a dominant seventh chord (root, major third, perfect fifth, minor seventh).

A diminished seventh chord comes from using all minor thirds.  That is, we choose a root note, then a note a minor third above that, another note a minor third above the that, and then a note a minor third above that.  So, a diminished 7th chord is made up of the root (r), the minor third (b3), the diminished fifth (b5), and the diminished seventh (bb7).

(Note that the diminished seventh (bb7) is NOT the flatted seventh (b7) but is a half-step lower... the diminished seventh (bb7) is the same as the major sixth (6)).

For example, a Dbdim7 chord is Db, E, G, and Bb.  Notice that the root note (Db) is also a minor third up from the diminished seventh (Bb)... this is important in the next section.

*Take home messages:*
 
* Diminished seventh chords contain the root, the minor third, the diminished fifth, and the diminished seventh (e.g., Dbdim7 is Db, E, G, Bb).
* Two useful fingerings for Dbdim7 are x4535x and xx5656 (fret positions for strings, low to high (EADGBe)).


**Substituting diminished 7th chords**

There are a number of places that one can use a dim7 chord as a substitute for another chord.  For example, in a ii-V-I jazz progression, a dim7 chord can be substituted for the Imaj7 chord (a half step above the I) as a passing chord between the I and ii.  However, it turns out that dim7 chords can easily be substituted for *each other* by using a very simple trick.  Anytime you play a dim7 chord, you can freely substitute any other dim7 chord whose root is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, or 21 (any multiple of 3) frets above or below the original chord's root.

Why?  As described above, dim7 chords are built entirely out of minor thirds… for example Dbdim7 contains the root Db, the minor third E (a minor third above Db), the diminished fifth G (a minor third above E), and the diminished seventh Bb (a minor third above G).  (Again, note that the root Db is also a minor third above the diminished seventh Bb).

So, when you slide that Dbdim7 up 3 frets (a minor third) to a Edim7, you take a chord that contains Db, E, G, and Bb and slide it to a chord that contains E, G, Bb, and Db… the same notes!  Slide that Edim7 up three frets to Gdim7 and you have a chord with the notes G, Bb, Db, and E (same notes).  Slide up three more frets and you get Bbdim7, which contains the same notes.  (Hopefully, you can see that sliding down works the same way).  Thus there are ""families"" of dim7 chords that are all interchangeable by virtue of sharing the same four notes.  Effectively, the dim7 chords in a family can all be used as alternate voicings of one another.  In practice, instead of playing Dbdim7 for four beats, you can play Dbdim7, Edim7, Gdim7, and Bbdim7 for one beat each without affecting the underlying harmonic structure and you get a nice bit of movement in your chord voicings.


*Take home message:*

* Move any dim7 chord three frets up or down the fret board to get a new voicing of the exact same chord!

 The first person, I told them I wanted to learn the blues scale. He played for me a little blues solo, and told me to listen to the notes and the feel of the solo. I was intrigued and did the best I could. I listened intently and got that bluesy feel I've come to expect. Then he told me to start on the 5th fret of the low E. He proceeded to tell me to find the next note in the scale that sounds bluesy. I surprised myself here by hearing what sounded right and what didn't. Figured out that the pattern being 1-4,1-3,1-3,1-3,1-4,1-4. It was almost blatently obvious when a note was out of place. I was almost able to fix all the notes. It was pretty exciting. 

The second fellow game me some music theory talk before jumping in helping me construct a chord. I've unfortunately lost the specifics of his talk but we defined some terms like minor, major, diminished, etc. I told him let's construct a ""jazz"" chord. He told me what type of chords those are. We picked a scale, played it note for note. We then picked the notes from the scale that would define the chord, something about 3-5-7. I forget the technicalities of the lesson. But when we were done we had a chord I could play. But the fingering were derived from the scale I had played on that one part of the fret. So he said, let's move our hand. He said, find the root note and try to find the rest by sound. I played some notes and tried sounding it out, and surprisingly i was one fret on one finger away. He then said, take this chord and ""diminish"" it. I was like hey-o, what's going on, that sounds hard. He quickly explained how it effected the notes that you picked, and I was like, so I just move these two fingers to their flat note? Yep. I was like, whoa. So this is music. Mind = blown. 

I've heard explanations of music theory, scales, chords, and all that, but it carried so much weight when I had the feeling that I came up with it and heard the differences. The instructors did a mind blowingly good job at letting me feel the notes out, and poking and prodding me along.

Well, so I'm hoping there's some type of interactive tutorial that would gently put me through the paces on music theory.

New here!

Been playing guitar for a long time now. Kind of been stuck in a rut for the last 5 years not really pushing myself. My skills are pretty limited at the moment.


I spent alot of my youth playing Oasis songs, and it doesn't really require much to play them anymore, as much as i enjoy doing it. However recently i've got into more metal music and realised that I'm actually not very good!


I've been around YouTube and Google looking for lesson of how to improve, but I struggle to find lessons that match where I'm up to, and where to go from here.


Anyone have any suggestions? Soloing is a particular weakness as I have terrible finger speeds (both picking and fingering). And my knowledge of scales doesn't go past 1 pentatonic shape. I struggled learning the shapes as learning scales without an end goal kind of bored me. However if it's needs to be done then i'll knuckle down.


Cheers in advance

So, I've been progressing fairly well...Rocksmith was an amazing aid. Instead of sitting down and trying to fuck around by myself I was able to have a small 'band' experience.(Playing 'any song by yourself isn't nearly as much fun as when you can hear all the instruments coming together.)

My picking is decent but my chords are a bit lacking...so lately that's been a huge focus of mine.(House of the Rising Sun, and a few CCR songs) But, this leaves me in a bit of a predicament. My skill level is so varied between picking and chords I'm having a hard time finding appropriate songs to learn. It also doesn't help that my tastes in music reflect the sheltered life I've lead...The usual google searches (Chord songs, beginner/intermediate level) doesn't turn up anything familiar or interesting...And when I do find one, my lack of confidence (Or perhaps the crutch of having Rocksmith telling me if I nailed it or not.) Always makes it sound a bit off to me. 

I guess to sum it up: I feel as though I've hit a plateau and am not really sure how to get to the next level. If anyone has any advice about chord exercises or songs that helped push them forward...it would be greatly appreciated. As I'm mostly self taught, much of the lingo/terms are lost to me...
Thanks again for any help, ladies and gents...

My biggest problem now isn't hitting the frets or anything, but improvising or filling in parts of solos i don't remember. So i keep hearing about these 'patterns' and 'boxes'. First of all, are those the same thing ? Then secondly, here's the pattern i kind of can remember:

http://www.theguitarlesson.com/guitar-theory/guitar-scales/pentatonic-scale-forms-shapes

This one is for the songs that goes in the Key of E. Wouldn't this technically be the Key of E Minor ? Since they are calling it pentatonic minor?

A song I'm working on now is 'Mother Mary' by UFO. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfoupNoXeK0 , solo starts at 2:35)
I would think it goes in ~~E minor~~ F minor and I am wondering if there's a neat trick to adjusting from a major to a minor (if that what needs to be done here).

I tried playing the pattern on top of the song, and it fits nicely, but the song has additional notes. so now I am confused.

Do I have to remember the patterns and also on top of that remember the additional notes? Or am i wrong and this song isn't plain pentatonic but one of those crazy-named 'modes' ? (Dorian, Phrygian , etc)
I am kind of hoping it's a mode that i can memorize a pattern for, because that would limit how much i need to know. :)

And then finally, let's say I want to play over a song in Am. Can i then just move all the patterns 5 frets to the ~~left~~ right?

Ninja Edit: This song doesn't go in Em, it goes in Fm right ? I was thinking of another song (Love to Love). I played the pattern shifted one fret to the right and it seemed to fit, exept with extra notes as i said.

It is a little smaller, but the pressing down of the strings to the neck required little to no pressure (maybe lighter strings?), and better yet, I was able to get my barre chords coming out clear, much clearer than I could do on mine. Anyways, point is, it felt absolutely great to hold and play.

I'm now pondering if I should move on and perhaps get a new guitar (probably the same). Is there any moment when it comes to playing that you know that you should move on? I still consider myself a complete beginner, so I rather not go around spending 200 bucks on guitars when I can't even play them half decent, but damn it I'm tempted. I just feel like if the comfort level is that much of a step up that it can help, I would be leaning towards purchasing a new one.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,1353643201.0,,,True,t3_13ngf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/13ngf2/how_to_know_when_you_should_move_on_from_your/,

I guess this could just be considered tapping, but there's a very specific kind of sound I'm going for.

In an effort to reduce the amount of repetition in this sub-reddit, I've thought it a good idea to create a FAQ section for the side-bar. So, I would like to take this opportunity to create a consolidated thread of some of the more commonly asked questions. 

**If you would like to answer the same question that you are posting, that would be of tremendous help!** 

**If you have a question but don't have the answer to it, feel free to post it here too. If its a commonly asked question I'll include it in the FAQ**

*As questions / answers (hopefully) start to roll in, I'll update the post with them. I will credit all answers / questions to the OPs*

Thus far, I've come up with this (if you have any recommendations / changes to the answers, let me know):

* *Q: What string gauge should I use?*

A: As a general rule, the lower the tuning the thicker the gauge. If you plan on playing lead in standard tuning .09 or .10 should suffice. Most instrumental guitarists (Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, etc.) use .09 or .10 gauge. Many death metal bands play in lower tunings (Drop C) and will use either .12 or .13 gauge strings.

----------------------------------------

* *Q: What guitar/pedals should I buy?*

A: Purchasing gear and equipment is a largely subjective experience. There is no rule written in stone saying X guitar is better than Y. Which guitar, amp, or pedals are right for you depends on what *you* to do and what  *you* want to achieve in your playing. Some gear facilitates a certain style better than others, so when buying a new guitar, pedal, or amp its important to experiment! 

----------------------------------------

* *Q: I don't know any scales, what scale should I learn?*

A: A minor pentatonic is a good starter scale. It's one of the easier and more commonly used scales in rock music.

----------------------------------------

* *Q: How are chords related to scales?*

A: Chords are made up of different notes of a scale, based on a specific formula. The *major chord* uses the formula 1-3-5 which means its made up of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a scale. For example, the C major scale consist of the notes C(1), D(2), E(3), F(4), G(5), A(6), B(7), C(8). Therefore, if we use the formula for the Major chord (1-3-5), we get the notes C, E, G. These notes make up the chord of C major. 

----------------------------------------

* *Q: Should I play with a metronome?*

A: While it's not absolutely pivotal to play with a metronome all the time, doing so can benefit your playing tremendously. Playing along with a metronome will help you develop a better sense of timing which is very important when playing with others. I would recommend to set aside at least 10 minutes for metronome practice. If you don't have a metronome, you can use a drum track or anything that keeps a steady beat and playing along with a drum track while noodling around can also do wonders for your timing. It's all about feeling the beat!

I'm trying to arrange my teaching material into a comprehensive book with increasing difficulty. First I need to list the songs I plan to include, and I'd like to hear your opinion about missing sections and examples. As you can see, it begins with the basic stuff, and reaches some intermediate level songs. I'll be glad to hear advanced level suggestions. As you can see, I pretend it to be restricted to very well known songs, kind of classics (with some exceptions, to work determinate techniques).

Later on, I'll make a pdf file with all the tabs, nicely arranged. If you know some books of this style, please refer them to me.  

I'll appreciate every comment! Thanks in advance

(may be benfical to others),23,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/13zbzd/need_help_understanding_the_fretboard_may_be/,"So I've been teaching myself guitar for the last 6 months and I've hit a mental roadblock. I've been learning all the basic chords and techniques but I'm stuck when it comes to playing freestyle. 

Ideally what I want to accomplish is if my buddy is playing a riff, I want to play along with him and be able to move beyond 4 frets and have confidence in the notes that I'm hitting. I think its how I see the the fretboard.  If my buddy is playing in G or a song is the key of G, I would typically play over a G pentatonic or G major scale but only stay within 4 frets.  I see the fretboard as limitations and I know thats why I can only play the notes located there.

I've been studying theory for the last 2 months to try to overcome my ""limitation mindset"", but I'm still stuck. For example I started leaning the entire C major scale across the whole fretboard. I would play some of those notes behind a C backing track and it would sound awful.My understanding is that I should only play notes in the scale for it to sound decent.   This flawed understanding of how I percieve  notes  being played along a chord progression may also contribute to my roadblock. 

So I have 3 questions  - 

How should I view fretboard when playing along with a song?
How do I know what will sound good with a song before I play it?
What should I study/learn to combat this problem (scales, modes,)?

Any advice would be much appriciated.

When I was learning guitar, the first trick was getting those chord changes, fingerings, and buzz-free strums.  I called it ""low and slow"" - I worked on knowing my basic G, C, D, E, and F major and minor chords before I worried about strumming.

Then it was time to make that leap.  At first I had a heck of a time:  it felt really awkward and clunky.  Even though I think I have decent rhythm, making this occur in a strumming fashion just didn't happen.  I could do a down, but not up.  I could do both, but the pick would fly out of my fingers.

One thing got me out of the rut and I had my breakthrough: Just relax.  I was worried so much about strumming that I help the pick too hard, and it would fly out of my hand.  

One night I came back from the bars and was just holding the guitar, pick just barely hanging in my hand.  I was unconsciously ""bouncing"" my relaxed and loose hand on the string and noticed - hey, I was *strumming*.  It sounded good.  

I wasn't worried about how many ""downs"" and ""ups"" to do - I was just lightly bouncing my hand up and down, dragging the pick very lightly across the strings.    

I'm not advocating having a couple of beers before you practice, but the key here was the relaxed approach.  Just think of your hand almost falling across the strings, and bouncing up.  * Don't think so much. *

It's the same with playing guitar. When you sit down to practice should you see how fast you can move your fingers? No, your fingers have nothing to do with it. It's the sound that is being created. Take your time, hit each note perfectly and to the best of your ability, and once your brain can play the music perfectly, you can challenge yourself to how fast it can be played.

So next time you go to learn a song/piece, learn it to the best of your ability. Slow it down, play to a rhythm you can handle, hit each note like you are a marksman.

I play mostly rhythm guitar and have only recently tried to play lead guitar.  I've learned the blues scale and can play it proficiently.  My problem is trying to put it music.  I am confused as to whether I should stay in the same key throughout a song, or if I am supposed to change the key of the scale I'm playing along with the chords of the song.

Play the white keys on a piano from one C up to the next C: 
C D E F G A B C. 
This is the C major scale. 

Notice that the scale is made up of: a Root (C), Major 2nd (D), Major 3rd (E), Perfect 4th (F), Perfect 5th (G), Major 6th (A), Major 7th (B), (and then repeats at C an octave higher). Notice that there's a whole step between each note, except between the 3rd and 4th notes and the 7th and the root (an octave higher).

In other words, from C (the root) to D is a major 2nd. From C to E is a Major 3rd. From C to F is a Perfect 4th, etc. (If you don't understand this, your first step is to back and review intervals before learning about modes. Musictheory.net is good for this).

This set of intervals is the structure of any major scale-- it's pretty much the definition of a major scale. (e.g. If we build a major scale on D, it will have the same set of intervals: D is the root, E is the Major 2nd, F# is the Major 3rd, etc.)

*****

**(2)**

Now play the white keys again, this time start with G, playing from G up to G:
G A B C D E F G.

If we think of G as the root, and look at what intervals are involved, we get: a root (G), Major 2nd (A), Major 3rd (B), Perfect 4th (C), Perfect 5th (D), Major 6th (E), *MINOR* 7th (F), and the root (G, an octave higher). Compare this with the intervals I listed for the C major scale above.

Notice that this is not a G major scale: a major scale has that specific set of intervals I listed above. This scale has a Minor 7th (F) where the major scale would have a Major 7th (F#). In other words, this scale has a whole-step between the 7th and the root, while a major scale has a half-step.

We call this scale G Mixolydian. It is a mode of the C major scale, that is, it uses the same set of notes as the C major scale (both scales contain just the white keys). However, it is *not* a C scale. G is our root. 

The fact that this scale is the 5th mode of C major (i.e. built from the 5th note of C major) is just not important for most purposes. What matters is how this compares to **G** major.
*****
**(3)**

We now have the interval structures for two different scales:
Major Scale (a.k.a. Ionian):
Root, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Maj. 7

Mixolydian:
Root, Maj 2, Maj 3, P4, P5, Maj 6, Min 7

Let's pick a random note on the keyboard, let's say Bb, and build a major scale. Following the interval structure listed above, we get:
Bb C D Eb F G *A* Bb

If we build a mixolydian scale on Bb, we get the following:
Bb C D Eb F G *Ab* Bb
*****
**(4)**

Chords are built by skipping every other note in a scale.

If we go back to our C major scale, and build a three note chord (triad) off of the root, we would play the root, skip the 2nd note, play the 3rd, skip the 4th, play the 5th. C, E, and G. Therefore this chord, having a root, major 3rd, and perfect 5th, is a major triad.

We can build chords off of each note in the scale. If we build a three note chord off of the Second note in C major (D), we would play the 2nd, skip the 3rd, play the 4th, skip the 5th, play the 6th. D, F, and A. While D is the second note of the C major scale, it is the root of this particular chord. while F is the 4th note of the key/scale, it's is the third of this particular chord (If D is our ""1"" then, some kind of E would be ""2"" and some kind of F is ""3"", and so on). However, notice that D to F is not a major third: it is a minor third (D to F# is a major third; F# is not in the key). Therefore, the chord built off of the second note of the scale is a minor triad.

This is important information because it applies to any major scale: The chord built off of the first note in the scale is major. We can call this the ""one"" chord (labelled roman numeral ""I""). The chord built off of the second note of a major scale is a minor chord. We can call this the ""two"" chord (labelled roman numeral ""ii""). We can keep going and build chords off of every degree of the major scale. 

This is what it means to be in a ""key"": we are using a scale as a resource for harmony--the chords are built to conform with the set of pitches in the scales.
*****
**(5)**

We can build chords with more than 3 notes, by continuing to skip notes up the scale. If we take our triad built off of the root of a major scale, (root, third, fifth) and skip the 6th, and add the seventh, we will have a four part chord: a seventh chord, because it contains the seventh. This would be a major seventh chord: a major triad with a major seventh. We can do this on each degree of the scale; each note in the scale will produce a specific chord structure.

If we wanted to continue with 5 part harmony, from the seventh we can skip the root and add the second. But now, because we are in the second octave of the scale, we will call the root the eighth note, and the second the ninth note. Therefore we can call this 5 part chord a ninth chord. The ninth chord built off of the first degree of the major scale is called a major ninth chord. Of course we can also build 5 part chords off of each of the other notes in the scale.

We can keep going. If the ninth is the second note in the scale an octave up, the 10th would be the third an octave higher. The four becomes and eleventh and so on. So if we have our 5-part ninth chord, and wanted to add a 6th part, we would skip the tenth and add the eleventh. Note that the tenth is already present in the chord in the lower octave, as the third). If we add go one one more to a 7-part chord, from the eleventh we would skip the 12th (the fifth) and add the 13th (which is the 6th in the higher octave). We have now added every note in the scale: the scale only has 7 different notes; if we add another note from the 13th by skipping the 14th (the 7th), we end up at the root two octaves higher, right back where we started.

*(Note that in practice, you usually don't hear extended chords with every note included. Usually you would just grab root, third, seventh, maybe one or two extensions.)
*****
**(6)**

With this side discussion on chord construction we've arrived at an important point. We now have a new way of thinking about a scale:

*A scale is the linear arrangement of the fully extended harmony.*

This is important to understand, because with this statement we can see that *a scale and a chord are the same thing*. In other words, if arrange the notes step wise (one after the other) within an octave it's called a scale. If you stack them in thirds over the course of two octaves it's called a chord. With this new piece of information we can go back to our Mixolydian scale and return to our discussion of modes.

I've recently started playing a lot more guitar lately, and there's this thing that keeps bugging me and holding me back. 
My trouble is that other strings sort of ""ring"" through the one I am holding. So i cant hold a note for a long time. 
For example: when I do a wide vibrato or bend I make the other strings I am bending towards ring a little, and this drowns out the tone i want. The whole thing ends up sounding a bit messy. Another thing is when doing pull of / hammer on routines over more than one string, I make the string i move away from ,ring ( like played open). I am having a great trouble getting these problems away, and I am not sure how to contradict them.

My question is this: is it just my technique and muting? or are there certain adjustments that can be made to my gear that makes it more susceptible to the tones I play and removes the ""background noise""

Also!: This has been bugging me. I see a lot of people posting videos on youtube recording themselves directly onto a sound card, and the sound is just PERFECT. Can this sound be achieved live? or only by editing a recording?

To whomever that can help me
Thank you!

Edit: 
I have been looking at my playing after reading all your posts, and to me it looks like it's a muting problem. 

If you download this http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/r/racer_x/technical_difficulties_ver2_guitar_pro.htm and go to line 78. Here is a great example of my problems. When i jump from 15 on the G string and go to 12 on the E string my g string rings open in the background. [by open i mean played without holding any frets]. So it's mostly when doing routines that traverse over several strings I have a problem. Also it's mostly the G string i sound without wanting to. It seems like i cant mute anything over the D string with my palm, so I need to work on this.

I have played music now for 12 years i.e. since I was 5 years old. For seven of those years I have played the guitar. After years of blues/rock playing with simple pentatonic patterns as well as gliding out of the scale to create what I believe is playing modally. But I do not know since my theory is not too good. Most of my journey has been learned 100% practically by just exploring using my ears. Which i believe is both good and bad.

Now I want to start playing jazz/fusion to develop a more interesting improvisation vocabulary. I have been trying for about a year now to learn jazz but I feel like i just learn whatever random stuff I come across and forget it in a week again. I have tried to tackle on the modal playing but it sounds like shit and I don't know how to start, with what mode, etc... I have also tried to learn the 2-5-1 progressions but when it comes to improv I just fall back into pentatonic scale.

The two scales I know theory-wise is the major scale and the pentatonic scale. Then I'm probably already playing loads of other scales unconsciously.

Basically what I'm asking is if you could give me 3-5 really basic stuff to learn in order to kickstart my jazz journey. Then I'll take a good month (maybe more?) to learn them thoroughly and by then, I guess that I'll have a feeling on where to carry on. 

A big thanks in advance!

I've been playing for about 4 years (started rnb on the acoustic then moved onto rock/metal on the electric, now into jazz fusion). I've been practicing systematically with/sometimes without metronomes different scale shapes. I have no problems connecting between different positions and different scales, however I'm finding it difficult to not follow the shape of the position when I'm in it.

I think this is caused by the systematic practices which means I'm only able to play licks or some fairly standard runs.

2) Why do people play classical guitar in a vertical/diagonal orientation? Does it really make that much of a difference, or is it just the ""proper"" way of doing it?  How exactly are you supposed to hold it?

I'm well beyond the fundamentals and don't know where to go from here. Someone told me to start learning all of the notes by name, but that's pretty annoying. Is that really what I should do next?

1374427426.0,14,self.guitarlessons,1irb9v,How do I know if my guitar teaching is teaching me correctly?,18,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1irb9v/how_do_i_know_if_my_guitar_teaching_is_teaching/,"I've had about 10 guitar lessons so far (around 38$~ / 45 mins per lesson) and from those, I don't think I've picked up a huge amount.

When I first arrived I could play a handful of open chords and showed my teacher what sort of music I wanted to play (most songs consist of barre chords throughout, nothing too hard), I also told him I didn't know where I wanted to go with guitar, as I had very little clue about anything.

The first lesson was being given a tab of a song I liked (which was the first tab on Google + incorrect) and a few riffs from various other songs, and being shown what I was doing wrong whilst doing them, this continued for a few weeks on the same tab and trying out various other riffs, I asked about strumming correctly and was given a couple of riffs that were strumming heavy.

This started to get quite boring - learning a riff is fun, but not that much fun when you can't play the rest of the tune. I then told him I'd like to write my own music, and that I'd love to start a band at some point, the lesson after this I was told I need to learn basic theory to write my own music and was given a booklet about scale and chord theory (bare in mind I have 0 idea about music at all, reading a tab was the only thing I could do). I went back with a bunch of questions (it was super confusing) and was then told I should learn to read music.

The next lesson was explaining how music is written, what all the symbols were, etc. The lesson after was going through Guitar Pro 6 software and showing me how it worked, how you write music in it, and was told I should learn what the open strings on the guitar look like in written music. (At this point we hadn't played my guitar for about 5 lessons and had been given nothing to learn / work on in regards to playing my guitar (lessons are every 2 weeks!)).

My last lesson was showing me how to record my guitar through Garage Band and how to use the multi effects pedal he recommended me to buy to learn more about effects. 

Through all these weeks I have been going through JustinGuitar.com beginners course (currently on stage 5) and I have learnt around 80% of the things I can play on my guitar from there.

So far I have given him the benefit of the doubt, I was recommended him by the shop I got my guitar from, I have seen how well he plays the guitar (playing for 30+ years) so I've always thought what he is teaching me is relevant in some way.

Recently I've been getting very annoyed with it, some lessons he is asking me what I want to learn (my answer: I don't know!!), but I always thought the teacher would have a general plan for their students (e.g. a progression path like JustinGuitar), does every teacher expect you to know what you want to learn?

I would love to hear your experiences as a beginner taking guitar lessons and what the teacher taught you, and whether you think my teacher has been reasonable as I'm thinking about swapping teacher.

Cheers.

I've always had trouble with scales and keys and I'm going to ramble a lot in this post because when I confused I get very annoyed and flustered and mad. But I'll try to explain my problem the best I can.

I want to learn to play guitar really well and I'm fully understanding that it takes a lot of time and practice to do so.  I already know a decent amount about guitar I suppose you could say. Alternate picking, scales, chords, barre chords, and all of that jazz. But something isn't adding up and I'm getting frustrated.

 So I'm watching this video here to learn some blues licks/solos and he points out that his first chord is Bmaj7.  In my mind, I would think ""Ok, B pentatonic blues scale"" and begin playing.  He doesn't do this at all. So I used my internet resources (reverse scales look up) and find that the very first lick he starting teaching about 3 minutes in is not in any scale at all. It just sounds right. But he is chatting around about it being in a major scale but also in a blues scale?

Do I just not understand music or what? Like I said, I have a short fuse and get really frustrated when I don't understand things, that's why my guitar practice has been very slow because when I feel like making progress I feel like get in way too deep and drown in an ocean of music theory and very discouraged and go back to moderatly picking up and down scales and never make any progress.

EDIT: Ok, I've cooled down from my frustration a bit and could better word my question. Better yet, I need help an explanation of the words in music if anyone could lay that out in layman's terms. For example, in biology, a cell is made up of many parts with many terms. mitochondria, cell wall, cytoplasm, nucleus, etc. It's easy to list them all out but unless you know how they correlate to make up a cell those words are nothing but arranged letters. But I do know that mitochondria are responsible for energy and and cell wall for protection, and nucleus for control etc(I know you don't want a biology lesson, so I won't throw one at you).  Anyways, my point is...

could you guys explain to me what a key is and its relation to scale and it's relation to major minor and pentatonic and what all of these words mean and how they correlate into music theory? Can there be more than one scale in a key? how do these terms all relate?

I've tried tabbing songs by ear a couple of times but lost patience and giving up after the first couple of notes.
Should I start trying to tab by ear again and progress from that onto music theory and then composing?
Where do i begin?

Thank you everyone for the advice, you've all given me a lot to think about. I'm going to start developing my ear and learning some scales as well as other basic theory, I'll see how it goes and move from there. Im actually pretty excited, since I first picked up a guitar I've always dreamt of being able to write my own music and not depend on tabs. It feels good to finally make the first steps towards reaching that goal.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,1373816448.0,,,True,t3_1i6gs2,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1i6gs2/taking_the_next_step/,

When I load up a backing track, I can come up with a decent sounding riff from a scale, but I feel rushed to hit the target note for the next chord. As a result, I feel more like I am drowning in the track than rocking out. I've also tried improvising over songs with simple chord progressions (i.e. Glycerin by Bush) and that went worse than the backing track (I guess that is to be expected as there is more going on in a song than a backing track).

Obviously, I will get better just by practicing, but is there something I can do to speed up the process?",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,False,,,True,t3_1gkbaq,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1gkbaq/how_do_i_get_better_at_improvisation/,

I picked up guitar around 3 weeks ago, and have been playing about an hour a day, I'm self taught but think I'm doing a few things incorrectly without noticing it.

My first bad habit I noticed when I tried to play C major, I noticed my thumb moved naturally to a very awkward position (it feels comfortable to play, but swapping to another chord requires a lot of movement, after 30 minutes my wrist really hurts of swapping to and from this position), here's a picture: http://imgur.com/NPcvWob.

No matter what I try, when I go to play C major, my thumb moves to an angle, I can't get it to sit vertical (which is how I thought it was meant to be) without it feeling very awkward.

The next bad habit is when putting my fingers on the fret board, they are always angled, see this: http://imgur.com/ywHbufN, should my fingers be straight here? (I notice this most when playing C major / G major, fingers are at an angle)

I'm actually going to find a guitar teacher for next week (to see what else I'm doing ""wrong""), but would appreciate any advice.

ps. I know there is conflicting opinion about where on the neck your thumb goes, and which is ""correct"", but my position seems neither in the middle of the neck or over the top of the neck.",,False,self,t5_2r8ca,False,,,True,t3_1a7q0j,http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/1a7q0j/beginner_trying_to_break_some_bad_habits_pics/,
