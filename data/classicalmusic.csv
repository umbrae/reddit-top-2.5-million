I'll also be very glad to read brief descriptions of their life, if it helps me understand how it influenced their music, and how it shows through clearly in their compositions: what kind of a childhood, youth, love life did they have? what kind of a political climate were they in? how were they in real life -- mean, genial, aloof? if they were pioneers, then which traditions did they break away from? if they were superhuman prodigies, then I'll love to get a brief description of their superpowers, and hear exactly how did they tower over the other everyday geniuses. i know it will be a lot of effort to write brief biographies -- but anything you have the time to write in will be appreciated! i'm hungry to know more, and will gladly read all that you folks write, with a million thanks :)

1325795923.0,607,self.classicalmusic,o4ei0,"Regarding the latest ""Strad vs Modern"" study...A long rebuttal.",699,92,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/o4ei0/regarding_the_latest_strad_vs_modern_studya_long/,"This latest [study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/01/02/1114999109) has been all over Reddit lately, and it has been equal parts interesting and frustrating to see the response. I suspect my views will also be meet with criticism, but here I go:

1. **There Is No Original Strad, Guarneri, Or Any Other Old Concertizing Violin In Existence**

This isn't really a criticism of the study *per se*, but most people are really not aware of how much the violin has changed since the days of Stradivarius. The original **Neck** and **Fingerboard** have long been tossed away, replaced with much longer counterparts, which changes the angle of the strings; the **Bridge** is now taller and more arched; the **Tailpiece** is completely different; the **Chinrest** wasn't invented until \~90 years later (1820); the **Bass bar** is much stronger now to cope with the added stress; **Gut strings** have almost been completely replaced by steel strings. The **Bow** has also been radically redesigned, anyone who has used a baroque bow will know that those are much more delicate than modern bows.

And those are just the general changes. Many vintage instruments have been subjected to a lot of horrors over the years; There are instances of old luthiers who, thinking they could improve upon old Italian designs, actually took apart instruments and *carved the individual plates to make them thinner* (Many of Strad's cellos succumbed to this fate). There are also many instances of parts being taken off one violin and put on another, and this is much more common than you'd think. I was told by no less than Ruggiero Ricci that Jascha Heifetz' famous 1742 *ex-David* Guarneri del Gesù was actually a composite; only the back was actually by del Gesù, the top and sides were from other makers. And let's not forget human fallibility; shoddy workmanship, misguided restoration techniques, general ignorance...a lot of crap can happen in \~300 years.

All things considered, **I doubt any vintage violin today is more than 60% authentic**, and even the parts that are will be under much more stress and tension than their makers ever envisioned. Therefore, the Strad or Guarneri sound we hear today is really the result of several happy (or sad) accidents, and is almost certainly completely different from what Strad or Guarneri heard themselves. 

These facts are not really talked about; Violin dealers in particular really don't like to discuss them and can be quite shady if you try to pin them down. After all, it's much more convenient to propagate a myth than introduce a lot of ambiguity which might negatively affect the value of a violin...but more on that later.
*****
2. **Just Because It's The Same Maker Doesn't Mean The Violins Are Similar**

We're conditioned today to expect a certain level of quality from a brand; because of stringent Quality Controls, most mass produced products come off the production line nearly identical to their brethren. 

Old violins were not mass produced, and were not nearly subject to the same exacting standards. Makers like Stradivari were refining their designs all the time. If you tally up the Strads virtuosos play the most, you'll find nearly all of them fall within the 1710-1730 time period. Strad seemed to use a system where he'd make 2 violins for each variation on design. Guarneri seems to be alot more temperamental, his designs seemed to have varied with his mood. There's a joke that Guarneri must have gotten really drunk when he made the [Cannone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Cannone_Guarnerius) because the design is so wildly dissimilar to his other violins.

So even from the start these violins were not uniformly made. Add \~300 years of variability and it's not hard to see that the violins have become very different and unique unto themselves. There is no Stradivarius^® or Guarneri^TM .
*****
3. **There's No Reason Modern Violins Can't Be As Good As Old Ones**

This is probably the last thing dealers like to hear, but it needs to be said. A violin in the end is a physical object. There's no reason it can't be improved upon. A good analogy is the Great Pyramid at Giza; it's a monumental structure, but does anyone really think we couldn't build a bigger, better pyramid if we really wanted to with modern technology?

*""Oh, but the varnish is a mystery, and the wood was from the Little Ice Age!""*, some will scoff. Oh yeah? Well I got news for you: **There's actually very little original varnish on any of these concertizing violins.** And even if it's still there, it's most certainly under layers of dirt, grime, polish, and god knows what other contaminants have come over the centuries. Violin varnish is incredibly delicate, and has to be tended to and replaced when it wears away, which it will. And that Ice Age wood? **The Little Ice Age was a global event that lasted over hundreds of years, how come it only affected Strad and Guarneri?** What was stopping all the other makers from using it? Guarneri in particular was not a rich man, his choices were limited and it shows; the wood of his violins generally looks rougher and a lot less uniform than Strad's. And yet Guarneri's are generally preferred to Strads among top players.

The most frustrating thing about these ""theories"" is that as already stated, the tone of these instruments today is completely different from when they were made. If Strad and Guarneri knew stuff like the Brahms and Sibelius Concertos would be played on their violins, I'm sure they would've altered their designs. There's no reason modern violins can't take advantage of this hindsight.

There is a caveat to this; I do believe violins need a break-in period before their tone really comes out. I've heard anywhere from 5-30 years of use so it's quite variable, but a brand-new violin is certainly not going to attain its peak.

Many people, IMHO, have gone insane looking for the ""secret"". They study the effects of fungi and celestial events and use CT scans to analyse wood density when Strad himself probably just knocked on it. 

This is not a new or radical idea. All great players, going all the way back to Paganini, had modern makers make copies of their antique violins, practicing on the new ones to save stress and wear on the old. Heifetz in particular got quite annoyed with people who attributed his sound to the violin instead of him. There is a story that Heifetz brought a cheap fiddle to a rehearsal, wowed the orchestra, and smashed it in full view at the end to get the point across that *he* was in control, not the violin. Which brings me to my last and probably most controversial point:
*****
4. **Modern Violinists Aren't Really Maxing Out The Potential In Their Violins**

This will probably upset some people, but the mark of a great violin isn't that it makes the player sound good, it's the fact that a great player can project his own personality through it. In other words, a great violin will have the ability to output a range of colors and tones if the player desires and has the technique to do so. And therein lies the problem.

I'm not aware of any player in the last \~40 years where I can close my eyes and go, ""Yes, that's Mr./Ms. X"". To put it bluntly, they all sound so damn generic. This wasn't always the case. Anyone with ears will be able to distinguish between Kreisler, Heifetz, Oistrakh, Menuhin etc...their sound signatures are so unique, there's no mistaking them. Perlman probably comes closest, but his range still pales in comparison to the electrifying variability of the older masters. **Their violins are still being played, so what's the problem?** And what was their secret; super secret body lotion?!

Far too much emphasis is placed on ""purity of tone"" these days. In reality, it really isn't that difficult to get a pure tone from a Strad or a good modern violin; just play an open string. The opposite is not true however; What if I want to imitate a French Horn like in Glazunov's Violin Concerto, can it handle the groovy jazz of Gershwin, do battle with Brahms, output all the vivid colors of Prokofiev? More importantly, can I, the player? These are the questions that should be asked, not whether Strad soaked his wood in chemicals or which violin sounds best in the 20 sec. opening of the Tchaikovsky Concerto.

To conclude, there's nothing wrong with modern violins rivaling old masterpieces, but the situation is much more complex than ""Strad vs Modern"" and any study that claims otherwise is already fundamentally flawed from the beginning.

**TL;DR: Please just read the damn thing, it won't take long and I put some effort into it. And let me know what you think.**

No style, not even serialism, is ""wrong.""",386,62,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/vpk7k/in_response_to_the_schoenberg_post_i_nearly/,"Throwaway for privacy.

Years ago, I was a student at one of the most prestigious colleges in the United States, one which has a strong legacy of music theory and composition. I had won awards for my compositions, and I thought I was headed for the top of the world.

As I continued to study composition, I felt an increased pressure to write in an obfuscated style, despite the fact that my natural inclination is somewhat traditional. I began planning my music more and more, deliberately distrusting my intuition and turning to algorithms and patterns. I began to idolize the serialists and the total serialists, not because I loved them, but because I believed it was the only way to be a ""smart"" composer. Harmonies had to be as complex as possible. Rhythms had to be viciously complex. Melodies (or, God forbid, ""tunes"") were out of the question.

Things got bad fast. I couldn't focus on my writing, and I hated everything I turned out, both the intentionally ""academic"" material and the more traditional music that came out naturally. I got more and more anxious about composing, and I began exhibiting strange psychosomatic symptoms.

Within several weeks, I had checked myself into the university hospital, telling them I was going to kill myself.

To make a long story short, I didn't kill myself. I went on to an outstanding graduate education in composition, where I learned to open up and trust my intuition, my emotion, and my influences. But it was too late. I will never have a career in composition. I am too far behind; I lost my chance to learn well and stay ahead in the game. Years later I am still anxious about composing, and I suspect I always will be.

This happened because I felt some pressure (partially real, partially imagined), from the academic community at large, to restrict my composing to a specific style. In my case, it was the mid-century avant-garde that broke my spirit. But when Schoenberg was first writing, it was the tonalists. Tomorrow, it could be anybody, and the target could be you.

My point is this: **no one should ever say how anyone else's music ought to sound.** There is *no* excuse for saying what ""is"" and ""is not"" music. Many people involved in the classical world do this. The conductors do it, as we've seen in the [article](http://www.insidethearts.com/sticksanddrones/2012/06/27/billeddins/3783/) making the rounds today. Reviewers do it. Sadly, composers do it—from both sides, from caustic atonal-fascists to drooling Whitacre hacks.

Anybody who writes music should feel free to write in the style she chooses, and nobody should criticize her for it. Let their art be theirs. If you don't like it, write something you do like. But nobody gets to say what someone else's art should sound like, look like, or accomplish. I almost died because of that kind of sentiment. Now I'm fighting back.

**Edit:** Everyone, thanks for the terrific, thought-provoking, and supportive responses. I'll try to respond to everyone's comments more tomorrow, so keep them coming. But I want to get a little work done on a piece before I go to bed!

[Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Shostakovich)

**Life and times**

Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich (Дмитрий Дмитриевич Шостакович, 1906-1975) is probably more popularly associated with Soviet Russia than any other composer. He was a child prodigy, but his adult career flourished during Joseph Stalin's reign of terror, and this influenced his art very directly. In 1936, Comrade Stalin attended a performance of Shostakovich's opera *Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District*; although the opera had previously been praised by the Soviet press for its ideological correctness, Stalin quite visibly did not enjoy it. Two days later, an editorial in *Pravda* called the opera ""Muddle Instead of Music"" and suggested that things ""may end very badly"" for Shostakovich. In this first prototype of the Communist regime's new mechanism of cultural control, critics who had previously praised Shostakovich's work publicly revised their opinions; he lost most of his commissions and performance engagements, and several of his friends and family were soon imprisoned or executed.

Shostakovich's response was the Fifth Symphony, which he advertised as an apology for *Lady Macbeth*: ""an artist's creative response to just criticism"". Thus began a series of apparently patriotic compositions to gradually restore his official favor with Stalin and the musical authorities. Most of this work is ignored today, with some exceptions like the wartime Seventh Symphony (""Leningrad""). Meanwhile, Shostakovich wrote his most personal feelings into ""desk drawer"" compositions, mainly piano solos and especially chamber music, not meant for public performance.

Of course the biggest event in restoring Shostakovich's public reputation was Stalin's death in 1953, the same day as Sergei Prokofiev's. Shostakovich ostensibly commemorated Stalin with his Tenth Symphony, and many of his earlier works were finally premiered. In fact, he regained so much favor with the Khrushchev regime (fortunately, Khrushchev had no ear for muthat he  joined the Communist Party to become General Secretary of the Composer's Union; by this point, younger composers were happily studying forbidden musical concepts like serialism, and Shostakovich suddenly seemed like an icon of conformity. It's not clear what was going through Shostakovich's head, even from his own conflicting accounts, but soon he wrote the Eighth String Quartet - some previous works had been dedicated to friends and family who perished under Stalin, but this one was privately dedicated to himself, a musical suicide note.

Though the quartet trailed off in a signature *morendo*, Shostakovich survived, turning inward to psychological pessimism and dread for his late period. Despite his conservatism, he influenced a school of younger successors, including /r/classicalmusic favorite Alfred Schnittke.

**Music**

Even when Shostakovich seemed to be at his most patriotic, did he really mean it? Or did the apparently simple-minded themes sit on a layer of irony, concealing deep commentary on Soviet repression? And were these messages meant to be recognized by audiences while eluding official critics? These allegations are made in a supposed memoir, but historians question its authenticity.

At any rate, Shostakovich's music is structurally conservative and old-fashioned for the time, official Soviet policy on ""formalism"" notwithstanding. Nearly all his work is quite clearly and accessibly tonal, with some extensions or tidbits of chromaticism. With fifteen string quartets and fifteen symphonies, often with roughly traditional movement orders, he was certainly one of the most prolific composers of these backward-looking genres in the twentieth century. And backward he did look: he was fond of quoting melodies from other composers or himself, and channeled Bach in his own preludes and fugues. Even his most personal chamber music generally follows the same formal and tonal idioms as his symphonies meant for public consumption.

From Mahler, he took not just orchestration but the concept of the symphony as psychodrama (Boulez: ""the second, or even third pressing of Mahler""). His late string quartets show an affinity with Beethoven's, in much the same respect. He was influenced by many Russian composers, including contemporaries like Prokofiev and Stravinsky as well as the old greats like Tchaikovsky and especially Mussorgsky. Though it's not immediately apparent to the ear, he counted the Second Viennese School among his strongest inspirations.

**Some examples**

* [Two pieces for string octet, II: Scherzo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tZ1hgmkUfI) (1925) - from his early radical period, but certainly not juvenilia
* [Two pieces for string quartet, II: Polka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NsDNyk0xc4) (ca. 1930) - adapted from his 1930 anti-bourgeois (?) satirical (??) ballet *The Golden Age*
* [*Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk*, love scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4fdfN4Tk_0) (1932) (mildly NSFW) - supposedly Stalin broke into laughter, and Shostakovich went white as a sheet
* [Symphony #5, IV: Allegro non troppo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogJFXqYEYd8) (1937) - a heroic triumph?
* [Violin concerto #1, III: Passacaglia (cadenza)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QDfwcFxz6A#t=3m28) (1948ish, premiere 1955) - David Oistrakh, the dedicatee, pleaded for a pause before the final movement so he could wipe the sweat from his brow
* [Prelude and fugue #1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuj5uzgmB5A) (1952) - a fugue in C major without a single accidental; Shostakovich himself at the piano
* [Symphony #10, II: Allegro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKXQzs6Y5BY#t=27m50) (1953) - ""a musical portrait of Stalin, roughly speaking"", according to the dubious memoir
* [String quartet #8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDDNS4BM1xQ) (1960), ""to the victims of fascism and war"": note the prominent D-E flat-C-B theme (D S C H, in the German notation - his musical signature), and a pastiche of his other work
* [String quartet #15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz6o9wCNxbc0) (1974) - he instructed the Beethoven Quartet to play the first movement ""so that flies drop dead in mid-air, and the audience start leaving the hall from sheer boredom""
* [*Orango*, fragment](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/12/music-review-premiere-of-shostakovichs-lost-opera-orango-.html) (1932, premiere 2011 - sorry, can't find audio) - Shostakovich wrote about 40 minutes of this planned opera about a human-ape hybrid before suddenly breaking off, perhaps because of his tenuous position with Stalin; it was only rediscovered very recently

**More?**

I'm sure one could write a much longer essay about any one of these compositions, and I've certainly left a lot of good ones out. Any more facts/rumors/opinions about Shostakovich and his music? Also, please do submit additional works as separate posts, if you like - but notice the new reminder to mention the composer and title in your submission.

[24 Preludes, op. 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTOEG0jt3LQ) played on an 1848 Pleyel.

[Polonaise-Fantasie, op. 61](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTo9fsx-Djs) played on an 1848 Pleyel.

[Berceuse, op. 57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaXfgFOEaGQ) played on an 1849 Erard.

[Ballade in G minor, op. 23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctQnER9JxME) on an 1848 Pleyel.

[Nocturnes, op. 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv4FjYWYpsE) played on an 1849 Erard.

Later tonight I intend on uploading the recordings of his Polish songs, the piano sonatas and possibly the piano trio and cello sonata.  I'm also currently in the process of uploading a video over an hour long (my own solo piano recital from a couple weeks ago, which unfortunately doesn't feature any Chopin :( so I don't want to steal *all* my campus' upload bandwidth!)  The box set includes recordings of everything he ever wrote, so don't be afraid to ask for your favorite piece if I haven't uploaded it yet!

As a side note, I also recently had the amazing experience of being allowed to play/sample many historical pianos at a museum in Massachusetts, including an 1840 Erard and an 1845 Pleyel.  I also spent a lot of time playing pieces by my beloved Schubert on an 1830 Bosendorfer and an 1830 Trondlin.  Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about what these pianos were like to play on. 

Enjoy!  If you love these recordings and have the cash to spare, I highly encourage you to purchase the box set for yourself.  It's well-packaged, well-recorded, and authentically Polish (the booklet is primarily in Polish with English translation!).  One of the coolest things I have in my collection.

**EDIT 1**: Very positive response.  Thanks for listening and discussing!  I'm about to upload a bunch more requests, but in the meantime here are two more for everyone to enjoy:

[Fantasie-Impromptu, op. 66](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tib-wMkTXtg), played on an 1848 Pleyel

[Etudes, opp. 10 and 25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuh4yRu-Yow), on an 1849 Erard

It should be noted that in multiple-movement works (ie the Preludes and Etudes), I have included the timestamps of each individual movement in the video descriptions.

**EDIT 2**: Put up a few more, and now it's time for bed.

[Ballade in F minor, op. 52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6pDrlCbcw) on an 1848 Pleyel

LISZT EFFECT: Child speaks rapidly and extravagantly, but never really says anything important.

BRUCKNER EFFECT: Child speaks very slowly and repeats himself frequently. Gains reputation for profundity.

WAGNER EFFECT: Child becomes a megalomaniac.

MAHLER EFFECT: Child continually screams - at great length and volume - that he's dying.

SCHOENBERG EFFECT: Child never repeats a word until he's used all the other words in his vocabulary. Sometimes talks backwards. Eventually, people stop listening to him. 

IVES EFFECT: The child develops a remarkable ability to carry on several separate conversations at once.

GLASS EFFECT: The child tends to repeat himself over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

STRAVINSKY EFFECT: The child is prone to savage, guttural and profane outbursts that often lead to fighting and pandemonium in the preschool.

BRAHMS EFFECT: The child is able to speak beautifully as long as his sentences contain a multiple of three words (3, 6, 9, 12, etc.) However, his sentences containing 4 or 8 words are strangely uninspired.

CAGE EFFECT: Child says nothing for 4 minutes, 33 seconds. (Preferred by 10 out of 9 classroom teachers.)

1336157072.0,200,self.classicalmusic,t78hf,How Beethoven changed music history with a single C# (sort of).,237,37,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/t78hf/how_beethoven_changed_music_history_with_a_single/,"There was a little disagreement about Beethoven over on this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/t1ssa/the_greatest_composer_who_ever_lived_i_would/), and I thought I would explain a little.  I am going to argue that Beethoven is easily the most influential composer of the 19th century, and the most important moment can be found in the 7th measure of his 3rd Symphony (Eroica). [](http://youtu.be/tHvztnHOWEQ)

The 9th symphony is important because it changed the symphony.  And that was cool and all, but the symphony hadn't even really been around all that long. The form and style had been codified by one man (Haydn) who lived in The Middle of Nowhere, Germany (Esterhazy) with a large group of well-paid, well-fed musicians, all maintained by a single man [\(who sunk his family fortune on the likes of Haydn and Beethoven... and his little brothel\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaus_II,_F%C3%BCrst_Esterh%C3%A1zy_de_Gal%C3%A1ntha).  By the time of the 9th (1824) The Symphony was still rather young, having taken baby steps with the short compositions of [Stamitz](http://youtu.be/UmhBXDeYmD0) to becoming a fully fledged form thanks to Haydn, and his 104 examples.  Haydn had only completed the his final ""London Symphony"" 8 years before Beethoven's 3rd symphony (1803). 
 
So why is the 3rd so important?

Well, think about the classical era.. this was the era of enlightenment.  Art looked back at classical form and structure, science began classifying animals and plants into categories, European culture was obsessed with order and logic, and they expressed this in their music as well.  The ideal of musical perfection in the classical era was that which followed proper structure and form.  
So along comes Beethoven.  At first all seemed well, in fact, to listen to his [1st Symphony](http://youtu.be/c2qr3iYFIi4) is to hear the voices of Haydn and Mozart.  Beethoven is just learning the basics in his first two symphonies... but then,
in the [3rd](http://youtu.be/tHvztnHOWEQ) Beethoven gives traditional form the finger.  Firstly, the opening theme is in the BASS and CELLO, wtf?  And then, there isn't a call-and-response, antecedent-consequent phrase structure. AND THEN he starts the thing off in  Eb major until the 7th measure when all of a sudden there is a C#... he is not just playing with ideas, he is playing with harmonic structure as well.
But then to top it all off, Beethoven uses that C# to set up the most unheard of thing: a completely new theme in the development section!

This may seem silly to us today, but to the ears of the 19th century music literate, this would have been unbelievable.  
Beethoven took a huge leap forward with this one piece of music.  So, ask me why I like the 3rd more than the 9th: The 9th changed the symphony forever, the 3rd changed music forever.

BTW[ here](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113180375618328351247/posts/GfHSg1h9rZU) is a little thing I wrote a while back about the 9th.

Someone pointed out that the [sandwich post](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13tu0a/well_this_is_a_really_shitty_twitter_account/) was probably filtered for using profanity in the title.  I think the solution here is simple: use profanity in every title!

""Amazing shitty performance of Mahler's second symphony!""

""Fuck Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor""

""Cunt Joaquin Rodrigo's *Fantasia para un Gentilhombre*""

If the last publishable post on the Twitter account is [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/13ulxt/you_should_stop_following_classicalm_we_steal_all/), you might only need to keep this up for a month or so before the Twitter account loses many subscribers.

As a contemporary composer, he nicely rounds out our series of eternal masters, which also includes [J.S. Bach](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/pccko/februarys_composer_of_the_month_is_johann/) and [Jean Sibelius](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/qxi48/marchs_composer_of_the_month_is_jean_sibelius/).

Kroeger, born Chad Turton in Alberta, is a true Renaissance man, showing from an early age talent as a vocalist and guitarist as well as songwriter. He matured as a professional quartet player in the late 1990s, honed on the well-worn classics as usual, but quickly grew to exploring his own potential as a composer. By the early 2000s, he distilled his musicological studies into an innovative, groundbreaking style that quickly won universal attention and acclaim that persist to this day.

In particular, his imaginative lyrics are known for their poetic perspective on the struggles of working-class society with crime and substance abuse. His oeuvre is considered challenging and unorthodox, disregarding mainstream trends and staking out his own compositional territory to force listeners to confront and expand their musical expectations.

Examples:

[""How You Remind Me"" (2001)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cQh1ccqu8M)  
[""Too Bad"" (2002)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7_8FWqY9o)

My school have a lot of grand pianos, upright pianos, harpsichords, grammophones, phonographs, lutes and even a [Lur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lur) for which there was no space at the new buildings where musicology is moving. Everything that didn't get sold is to be burned.

One professor bought a grand piano, but found out he had bought the wrong one. He then bought the right one. For $15 (yes, fifteen dollars for a grand piano). Another professor bought an upright piano, a grand piano AND a harpsichord for 1 Cent. 1 fucking cent. 

I'm not sure why I'm saying this, but it just makes me so sad that all of those perfectly fine instruments burn (the ones that didn't get sold - which was a lot.) Wasn't Bösendorfers (most of them were Danish brand ""Hornung &amp; Møller"" or Yamahas - not $200000 instruments, but very decent). The worst part is that everyone of us students wanted to buy grand pianos and what not, but there were just no way we could transport it (which was required).

You will not learn about this in school because it hasn't really been written about in this capacity. Please do read this, and I will share more tales from this man as time goes on. I am getting amazing first hand accounts",141,18,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/17lto9/here_is_a_bit_of_music_history_that_i_have_gotten/,"I have the extreme privilege of having Peter Westergaard, one of the most important American theorists of the latter half of the 20th century, as the endowed chair at the University of Alabama (where I am currently finishing my undergraduate degree in music composition). He will be in residence until the middle of March, and I am absolutely ecstatic about this fact. It is only three days in, and he has already told some of the most amazing stories and given some of the best advice that I have ever gotten. I am not wrong in saying that he is one of the smartest people in any field that I have ever met, and he is equally as enlightening. Want to talk about madrigal? Sure! Why not? He will gleefully talk about madrigal with you for hours on hours on hours, write out examples from memory, etc etc. He can do this with almost anything in the field of music. I can not stress how brilliant this man is.


But today was even more special.


One of our theory professors teaches a course on serialism every other year in the spring. Given that Dr. Westergaard was really beginning to be active and become known in the 50’s and 60’s, the professor requested that Dr. Westergaard come in and essentially just reminesce (all loosely tied into what led him to write his incredible article on Webern’s Op. 27 piano variations, mvt. 2. It is in *Perspectives of New Music Vol. 1 No. 2*, if you are interested). He then started recalling his time in Germany and France on a Fulbright in the years leading up to that. He got to study composition with Milhaud, analysis with Messiaen, and would frequently travel to Darmstadt and interact with the likes of Boulez, Stockhausen, and Nono. Many know these composers as being extremely mathematical (which I have a personal problem with, though it is not incorrect) and having music born not out of an inner, romantic pull, but rather completely by a systematic logic.


Peter began to wonder why this was.


And so did someone else.


There was another man on a Fulbright at the same time as Peter, and he was running a few different programs that would pull in composers from all around. They pulled in some Hungarian composer at one point that no one had ever heard of. This man had been completely cut off from music and music’s progression because of the war, so it was as if, to quote Peter, “he was viewing the world of music as pinpoints through a curtain,” though he was fairly overwhelmed by it all at first.


One day, the Hungarian had to catch a train to head back to his home. That train ended up being three hours late, and Peter said that the train being late is one of the best things to ever happen to him. He and the Hungarian both had multiple questions: why did the so-called “serialists” reject Schoenberg’s romanticism so much? Why did they reject romanticism in general? Why did they prefer the completely unpredictable (within predictable confines) music of John Cage as opposed to the completely controlled music of Milton Babbitt, which exhibited a similar amount of control that they themselves were using?


The gentlemen pondered this for a while and eventually had a large epiphany.


Let us again orient ourselves in time. Most of the Darmstadt composers were beginning to become active during and after World War II. Dr. Westergaard made it an extreme point to note a conversation that he had with another man (whose name escapes me) about how some words were no longer used in Germany for a large number of years. Words that were commonplace before the Third Reich had been completely adopted and bastardized by the group, so the general public simply could not use those words without having them associated with the Third Reich. The Reich also adopted the music of Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart, and many other Germans/Austrians as its own. This music is among the most romantic music that there is. Imagine hearing Beethoven and having it only associated with the single most terrible experience that you have ever had to endure in your life, and experience that was endured with millions around the world. Imagine Beethoven being the rallying music of the group causing that suffering.


The Darmstadt guys rejected their romantic pull because romanticism could be no more. It couldn’t. Peter said one thing that caught me off guard, but makes COMPLETE sense. The Nazi’s were the most absolute extreme form of romanticism in the history of the world, and they were what happened when one could no longer make the distinction between art and real life. Think about it. The grandeur, the uniforms, the unbelievably naive goals. It makes sense.


To go back to that would have been too painful. Romanticism has reached critical mass and exploded. Here, we are left with the music of Boulez, Stockhausen, and Nono. I’ve always found their music touching, but it really is something different if you consider the time period. This music is not devoid of emotion or any type of attachable meaning. This is a music of the most severe pain, a music of starting over without any reference whatsoever to the romantic works of old. Absolutely none.


It is also worth noting that Boulez, Stockhausen, and Nono were French, German, and Italian (respectively).


So Peter and the Hungarian both thought that it made sense. If your house ends up getting destroyed, sometimes it is worth just digging up the foundation and starting over from scratch if the foundation has already crumbled.


It is also worth noting that the Hungarian’s name was Gyorgy Ligeti.


This is just one story, poorly retold, that Peter has supplied me. This is a side of history that you never, ever hear about, and I have a first hand source. I will update this periodically, because this is information that I believe needs to be shared.


It should also be noted that no one is saying that the Darmstadt guys were the only valid way to go. They were simply one of the trajectories that music took.",,False,self,t5_2qhyq,False,,,True,t3_17lto9,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/17lto9/here_is_a_bit_of_music_history_that_i_have_gotten/,

I don't know many people at my age (21) that really appreciate classical music. I really only have one friend that enjoys it as I do. So I'm curious to know if this subreddit is mostly an older audience, if it's diverse, or what?

Also curious to know how you got into classical music. It really is not easy these days!

EDIT: Wow, just got on reddit and am amazed at all of the responses! Keep em coming! Such a variation of ages and musicians and composers... this subreddit should start an orchestra! :p

As for me, I just remembered how I fell in love with classical music. I was in Junior year of high school and was on vacation with my parents. Bored in my hotel room, I used my ipod touch and somehow came across a youtube video of Wilhelm Kempff performing Moonlight Sonata mvt 3. My head almost exploded. I started playing piano again after that, and I wish I had never given up when I was younger.

If you haven't done so yet, [answer the survey](http://questionpro.com/t/AKBNrZPgVP) that /u/Arsenious set up for us. Thanks to him.

[Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy)

**Wagner ruined tonality for everybody**

Young Claude came of age (age ten, actually) and entered the Paris Conservatoire in an interesting time. The Conservatoire employed the greatest French composers as professors (e.g. Guiraud, Franck, Farrenc, Gounod; later, Fauré, d'Indy, Milhaud, Messaien), most of whom had also studied there. It was the place to be for any French-speaking musician. It was also under siege by the music of Richard Wagner (1813-1883), who stretched Western harmony, orchestration, and eardrums to their breaking point. You see, the Conservatoire was a bastion of musical conservatism, where independent, experimental Debussy ""struggled for several years to write a cantata sufficiently dull to win the sinecure of the academically oriented Prix de Rome"" (Alex Ross, *The Rest Is Noise*) - Debussy wrote, ""I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamored of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!"" And Wagner was challenging everyone's ideas of what music could, or should, be. There were supporters like Franck (Debussy's organ teacher) and young Saint-Saëns, but also severe opponents like old Saint-Saëns (who also hated Debussy and Franck); reaction to Wagner divided the French musical establishment, concentrated in that one institution, as well as the rest of the West.

**Touched by magic**

Debussy attended Wagner's personal opera house in Bayreuth in 1888 and 1889, and *Parsifal*'s sensuous harmonies utterly captivated him. This was a time of much other experimentation in his life: he explored obscure religions and cults (he is rumored, even outside *The Da Vinci Code*, to have been the grandmaster of the Priory of Sion, which guards the Holy Grail). He heard Javanese gamelan music at an exhibition, and realized it was possible to have complex and honest music without any of the trappings of Western rhythm, melody, harmony, or texture (it ""contained all gradations, even some that we no longer know how to name, so that tonic and dominant were nothing more than empty phantoms of use to clever little children""); this is likely where he became interested in pentatonic scales. It was also around this time that he met the enigmatic umbrella-fancier Erik Satie, a fellow musical experimentalist.

**Debussy stakes out new musical territory**

Debussy developed a music style unlike anything previous: he occasionally or even thoroughly abandoned tonality and key, using chords willy-nilly as sorts of melodies rather than any traditional functional harmony, and when there were scales, they were as likely to be the Phrygian mode or whole-tone scale as anything else. He explored the use of unlimited harmonies and forms to create pure musical soundscapes rather than any familiar structure, and this was a huge influence on all but the most regressive composers who followed. Debussy's style is sometimes called ""musical impressionism"", a term he attributed to ""imbeciles"", ""which is as poorly used as possible, particularly by the critics"", though some scholars think he was reacting to negative criticism and would be pleased to be heard the way we see the impressionists today.


**Notable examples**

[""Clair de lune"" from *Suite bergamesque* (1890)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuazkV70vaM), early post-Wagnerian experimentation

[*String quartet in G minor* (1893)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXnO_VAoZic), played here by his contemporaries (and my teacher's teacher's teacher)

[*Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune* (NSFW) (1894)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4s1nhlCMMI#t=20), a controversial masterwork that put Debussy on that map and changed the course of Western music-history; Ross: ""It is music of physical release, even of sexual orgasm"" 

[*La mer* (1905)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsxmnt2wy4E), a semi-symphonic form - warning, you will get wet

[""La Fille aux cheveux de lin"" from *Préludes* (1910)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfQ5hOOLk1o), ""a brief but harmonically complex Pre-Raphaelite expression of beauty"" (?)

I am attending a concert tomorrow with Philip Glass, and have been selected to meet him afterwards. I will have time for a few questions. 
When I leave for the concert, I'll take whatever you want to know with me. 

Update: 
I just got back, and was somewhat disappointed by the meeting. I only had time for two questions:

In response to Sbine's third query (When he writes is he concerned with posterity or is he only concerned with how the piece will sound right now, at this moment in time.), PG says that he writes for his current audience. He isn't concerned with the impact of the piece other than its impact on the current audience. 

In response to Fbthpg's first question (What is he listening to these days?), he responded that he is listening to his second cello concerto. Apparently, it has him occupied. 

It was mostly an event for signing autographs (which I have never understood), but in my research, I found him commenting on young people in music, found [here](http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2011/01/21/3118463.htm).

I hope you guys don't mind me asking them here.,118,19,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/11mkuz/the_1st_of_january_i_accidentally_got_into/,"In advance sorry for the long story but I tried to give some backstory to my questions. I am 25 years old and in my surroundings no one plays an instrument and no one listens to classical music. But January the 1st of this year I was just getting out of bed and turned on the TV and the Vienna New Year's Concert was on. I decided to listen to it while I made breakfast and see what it was. I sat down and listened to the whole thing feeling a bit overwhelmed. So I started to read about classical music and tried to find out if anyone I knew knew something about it so that I could ask them questions. As I expected no one did and everyone looked at me funny when I talked about it. I read a lot online of course and eventually I made a list for myself with about 10 famous composers and some of their works and wrote down what I though about it.   

The thing is, I felt like I just walked into the library of Alexandria and I had no idea where to start. I found this subreddit and I read the introduction threads and I learned a lot more about the composers and I found even more music to listen to. The thing is though, now it's been almost a year but I still don't ""understand"" why I like some pieces and why I don't. To use the library comparison again. I am reading books and I enjoy most but not all of the contents but I don't understand what I am reading. For example the list of composers with their works and whether I like them or not is based solely on feelings. I can't even really distinguish the instruments.   

So basically my question is, what can I do understand the music, the jargon, the instruments etc. Also if there is a redditor from the Netherlands here, I don't got a lot of funds but I'd love to go to a live concert, any recommendations?

When he moved house in 1957, he kept the same housekeeper, Nellie Hudson, who supervised the cooking. Britten liked plain foods that reminded him of the foods during his schoolboy days, including rice pudding and [spotted dick](http://www.ocado.com/cmscontent/recipe_image_large/33932.jpg?TsA). He intensely disliked shellfish, despite living on the English coast, and a number of other foods such as mushrooms, tomatoes, and pears. He would sometimes consume a whole tin of condensed milk. But he had a taste for fine wines. Britten's BF Peter Pears was more of a gourmet. 

Britten kept to an orderly schedule. He woke up early, took a cold bath, and composed from 9 to 1. In the afternoon, he wrote letters and took walks with his dachshunds and paying attention to the birds he saw. 

Tea (the meal) was an important part of the day. Britten couldn't cook for shit - according to Pears, he could hardly boil an egg- but he was adept at making tea and blending all sorts of varieties. After tea, he returned to his studio until dinner at 8. After which, he would read or listen to music on records before bed, often with the score of a string quartet.

1319845693.0,93,self.classicalmusic,lsr5w,I'd like to have a friendly discussion about the superiority of classical music.,115,22,333,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/lsr5w/id_like_to_have_a_friendly_discussion_about_the/,"I want to start off by saying that I am a senior in college, about to finish up my bachelor of arts in music. I originally majored in French Horn and was dead-set on pursuing a position in a professional orchestra. I studied under a former horn player for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and I obtained enormous amounts of wisdom from this wonderful teacher. I will refrain from using his name for the sake of anonymity. Anyways, to make a long story short, I transferred to another university due to financial restraints and I am now pursuing a career in pop music with my electric bass guitar. 
The reason I'm giving you this information is so that you do not assume I am bashing classical music without sufficient knowledge or study. I love classical music, I simply question its intellectual and academic ""superiority"".

Now maybe you're thinking, ""No form of music is technically superior to another. It is an art form, and a means to express emotions."" I agree, but why is classical music (in general) the only form of music that is taken seriously in the academic community? If I go to a state university to pursue a degree in music, I will only be exposed to classical music (and some jazz). So when I ask the question regarding a genre of music's superiority, I'm referring to its academic merit. 

I was once a classical french horn player (and a damn good one, I think) but now I am pursuing a career playing/teaching popular electric bass. This is a very strange transition. The ""educated"" music community is a vastly different one compared to the ""popular"" music community, but not unequal. The thing that has been bothering me is that very few professors in the academic music community know anything at all about GOOD pop music. There are modern bands that have composed fascinating pieces of music that easily rival the level of complexity found in much of the classical music that I have been forced to study for my degree. 

I would like to know what your response is to these thoughts. If you feel classical music is in fact superior both in quality and academic merit, I have no problems with that, I just would like to have a friendly discussion as to why you feel that way.

Anyways, I could type forever, but then no one would read it. I will save the rest of my thoughts for any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully posting!

EDIT: I am happy to see so many interesting and valid comments. This has been very insightful for me and I thank this community for your contribution. I wish I had the time to reply to every one of your comments right now...However I am reading everyone's comments, and hopefully I can find the time to reply to as many as possible after I finish this giant pile of homework!

EDIT 2: So for the sake of discussion I would like to post this brief excerpt of a book that is still being written by Greg Sandow. It is the reason why I decided to make this post in the first place, because it really got me thinking about this particular topic. Let me know what you guys think of this excerpt.

I mean, Mahler is great, but why do people get so hard over his music. I even see people here recommending it to listeners who are new to classical music (why?) 
Is this a fad, or can you Mahler fans actually explain why you think his music is so epic?

**EDIT:** I love the comments on this thread, however I am starting to notice a trend. Many comments are very genuine and heartfelt, and this is sorta what I am after. Some comments, on the other hand, are quite condescending and suggest that to not adore 'Mahler' (or feel free to insert your favorite composer here,) is to not understand classical music, to not have a heart, to (insert your favorite one-liner here).

This means that not only will we have a discussion thread right here, but you're also encouraged to  separately **submit your favorite performances of this composer's works, stories about his life, relevant jokes, etc.**

So, this month [we have elected](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/p6cmw/nomination_thread_for_februarys_composer_of_the/) &lt;sigh&gt; [J.S. Bach (1685-1750)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach). Why sigh? Because it's predictable. Why predictable? Because in classical-music circles, I think his name is invoked more than any other as the best composer of all time. (As Radar is advised in *MASH* when dating a classical-music buff, just say ""ah, Bach"".) Why best? Read on!

**Life and times**

Briefly, Bach lived in a small region of Germany and didn't really get out much. The notable exception is when he traveled 250 miles north, on foot, to see the great composer and organist [Dieterich Buxtehude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieterich_Buxtehude). Afterward, his appointments were as music director in noble courts and a church: first somewhat briefly in Weimar, then briefly in Köthen, and finally a long time in Leipzig. He was responsible for directing small orchestras and choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as music education, plus he had to be able to play a whole variety of keyboard and stringed instruments. This kept him composing nonstop, and had the consequence that his earlier work is largely secular and his later work largely sacred (based on Lutheran translations). This also means he didn't really do opera, even though it was just coming into vogue in the Baroque era, but some of his sacred oratorio isn't that far off.

**Fame**

Bach was at best somewhat well-known in his lifetime but especially obscure afterward. He was certainly recognized as an unequaled keyboard player; one of his side jobs was testing out new organs for their manufacturers and it's rumored that his [ubiquitous *D minor Toccata and Fugue*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd_oIFy1mxM) was written to help him stress-test their power and responsiveness. There is a story that a famous French organist had challenged him to a keyboard contest, but upon hearing the surprising cadenza at the end of [the first movement of *Brandenburg Concerto #5*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBw6wwa7eC8) (surprising not just because it's totally punk shredding, but also because the harpsichord hadn't really been a concerto instrument prior to that), the Frenchman called it off!

However, after J.S. died, he faded from the public eye as Baroque music went out of style and the new fad was Classical, including the work of his sons [J.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Christian_Bach), [C.P.E.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach), [J.C.F.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Christoph_Friedrich_Bach), and [W.F.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach) He remained a little bit of a cult classic: Mozart and Beethoven were both introduced to his work late in their lives and frantically started writing fugues as a result. But he didn't really reappear for the general public until [Mendelssohn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn) revived interest with a performance of the masterpiece oratorio [*The Passion According to St. Matthew*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2XUaCWezRY). Other works were only gradually rediscovered; the famous solo sonatas/partitas/suites that every string player learns as a student were only resurrected for that purpose by [Joachim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Joachim) in the late 1800s ([violin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Lq1nHRp24)) and [Casals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Casals) in the early 1900s ([cello](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHhtSm5bfmM)).

**Why he's so damn famous**
 
Of course, Bach is best known today for being history's essentially undisputed master of [**counterpoint**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint). Counterpoint is polyphony, i.e. multiple voices carrying independent musical lines at the same time, but there are a lot of rules it has to follow. They may seem arbitrary when described, but they're glaringly obvious if you hear them broken. This is difficult, maybe a bit like solving a Sudoku except it has as many columns as the piece has measures, and there's no guaranteed solution, and it's under a bigger variety of constraints, and it needs an overarching musical structure to make it sound appealing. The difficulty increases exponentially with the number of voices. Two make a good challenge, three is noteworthy, and four is a show-stopper. For example (nearly every textbook example of counterpoint is from Bach), [this fugue from *The Well-Tempered Clavier*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAAUmCqmYdU).

In 1747, Bach met [King Frederick the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II_of_Prussia); Frederick showed Bach one of the first true pianos, then challenged him, on the spot, to improvise a three-voice fugue based on a complex theme of the king's own invention. He did. (This is shocking.) Then Frederick challenged him to do it with *six* voices, which everyone thought was a joke. A short time later, Bach mailed him [precisely that, in what would become part of a suite of clever, punny variations on the King's theme, *A Musical Offering*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsh88GrsY34).

But I want to impress on you that **Bach is notable for his emotional appeal, not just his technical skill**. Though it's embedded in technically flawless and often complex forms, Bach's music is still music, and is still meant to arouse feeling in the listener. To persuade you of that, I'll just let Bach speak for himself:

* [Chaconne from *D minor partita for solo violin*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zvRWFD_1_M), thought to be written when Bach returned from an extended voyage to discover his wife was dead. Also contains basically every virtuosic violin technique that existed at the time. Performed by the virtuoso Isaac Stern.
* [*""Come, Sweet Death""*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xje4OYalB5Q), a popular sacred aria based on a [cheery text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komm,_s%C3%BC%C3%9Fer_Tod,_komm_selge_Ruh); here the fabulous Virgil Fox performs it on a ridiculously large organ. Subwoofer recommended.
* The aforementioned [*St. Matthew Passion*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1Q3tcnZxdc). Note that I link to a slow, broad, epic performance by [Klemperer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Klemperer) and the German operatic rockstars of the 1960s. That wouldn't fly today; [historically informed performance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_informed_performance) is an influential recent movement that strives to perform old music the way it would have sounded when it was new, and this certainly isn't it. But I'm using this hysterically uninformed performance to make a point about Bach's emotional impact, so there.
* Finally, for a bit of contrast, something upbeat: [""Jauchzet, frohlocket"", the opening of the *Christmas Oratorio*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggm0SZCWKZo), which I gather is as much of an annual festivity in the German-speaking world as [Handel's *Messiah*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_(Handel\)) is in the English-speaking one. Lucky krauts. This time we see [John Eliot Gardiner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eliot_Gardiner), a superb conductor of Bach and a reliable HIPster.

So! I hope that's enough to get you started. More stories or impressions of Bach?

I also love to listen to recordings of classical music from Ligeti, Mahler, Reich, Cage, and more at a [7]. What's even better, though, is actually going out and watching the concert live. You get to listen to some of the most skilled and talented musical artists perform the music almost flawlessly. Not only that, but you listen in a perfectly quiet room that has been acoustically engineered to deliver great sound. You also don't have to rely on the sound guy to mix the ensemble which can be quite problematic, especially for openers at rock shows. Instead the musicians play their instruments acoustically and balance the volumes themselves while playing. All in all, it is just a fantastic concert experience.

You may be saying to yourself (in a 1950s voice at that!), ""Gee, 1-800-Ghost-Dance, that sounds great, but I just don't have that kind of money to get those expensive tickets..."" **WRONG!** If you are a student, most orchestras including some of the top ones, like the [New York Phil](http://nyphil.org/studentrush/) and the [Chicago Symphony](http://cso.org/TicketsAndEvents/Students.aspx/) have student tickets for around $10. Orchestras tend to play the standard repertoire of pieces, so there are usually more recognized names on the program list.

Not a student? Not a problem. If you are by a university with any kind of music program or school, there are many **FREE** concerts performed there every week. Go watch the faculty string quartet or brass quintet. Check out the artist or ensemble-in-residence there. Give the student band or orchestra a listen. Check out a faculty or student recital (if you are at a place with a good music school, it will have grad students who are pretty exceptional players). At a music school, you will hear some standard repertoire, but you are also very likely to be exposed to contemporary composers and to many pieces you might not have listened to just on your own.

Unfortunately, classical music has taken major blows in the last few years, largely from the economic collapse. Many orchestras face funding issues. Even the Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the most renowned american symphony orchestras, was forced to file for bankruptcy in the last year. Go out and see one of their concerts and you are helping to give some financial support to these great organizations that preserve the great tradition of western classical music. Plus, everybody would love to see more young people attend classical music concerts. The old people because the tradition is continuing; the young people because they won't feel like the youngest people there.

So, I am asking for your help here. Please go out and support classical music and enjoy some astonishingly beautiful music. I think you guys will like it too.

**TL;DR** Go out and see some live classical music. Don't just listen to recordings, it doesn't fully capture the experience. It's not as costly as you may think (often it's even free) and it is one of the best high experiences ever.",,False,self,t5_2qhyq,False,,,True,t3_lubp0,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/lubp0/a_plea_on_behalf_of_live_classical_music_xpost/,

Personally, I love reading AMAs and the Classical Music subreddit, so I was wondering if it would be possible to combine both and have a couple of intensely classical-music orientated AMAs on here? I have read ones like 'I am an opera singer', or 'I play viola', but I was thinking it would be fascinating to read an AMA by a professional orchestral musician in a major orchestra, someone who goes to a world-famous conservatory, musician who travels the world, etc., to ask them things like

*how they got to the stage they are at now

*what the industry is like in their region

*what troubles they had to overcome

*if they could have one piece of advice, what would it be?

Hopefully people and the mods like this idea, and there are redditors floating in this subreddit who have made it to be able to do an IAMA :) *crosses fingers*",,False,self,t5_2qhyq,False,,,True,t3_qehuu,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/qehuu/idea_rclassicalmusic_amas/,

1345149145.0,85,self.classicalmusic,yc7xa,What is the most amazing melody you have heard in a classical piece?  Let's focus on a specific passage rather than the whole song.  ,100,15,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/yc7xa/what_is_the_most_amazing_melody_you_have_heard_in/,"I'm not talking about a movement or piece, but rather, a melodic line that appears every now and then that makes you shudder in amazement.  

Two examples that I can think of off the top my head are Wagner's main theme to Ride of the Valkyries (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V92OBNsQgxU, 1:59-2:32), and Tchaikovsky's famous Swan Lake theme (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP132E-xABg, 7:00-7:45).  

But let's not limit this to main themes - the melody can be a transition, a bridge, a forgotten part tucked in the middle of a grand symphony, anything.  

EDIT: Another one I'm adding on: the cello verse in Elgar's Cello Concerto (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM9DPfp7-Ck, 2:41-3:03).

EDIT #2: WOW, SO MANY AMAZING RECOMMENDATIONS.  I've tried my best to compile a bunch, but there are just so many.  Below are just a few, I'll try to build the list throughout the day.  (I'm simply exhausted right now after listening to so many gorgeous pieces within a short span of time)

Fung Lam - Endless forms

Boulez  - Anthemes II

Per Norgard - Symphony No. 7

Kaija Saariaho - Laterna magica

James Macmillan's Violin Concerto

Naresh Sohal - The Cosmic Dance

These I've all heard because they are played at the BBC proms during the same concert as the romantic/classical pieces I like and are going for.  

Here's what I don't get: in these pieces there's no melody, harmony or discernible beauty.  I listen to music in part because it's beautiful and emotion-inducing.  I don't get any of that from modern stuff.  I hear dischord, no melody and sounds that grate on me.  My friend and I play a game wherein if the first chord of a piece is discordant we won't like the piece and it works every time with the modern pieces we hear at the proms.

In your replies please be brutally honest, tell me how/why I'm woefully ignorant (with explanation).  I just need to hear the opinions of people who know what they're talking about (I don't) - how this music gets composed, why it's so different even from relatively recently pieces (Rachmaninoff dies in 1943).

I don't know much about classical music, so I want to know if the symphonic or fine art elements of death and black metal are just the hyper-dramatic but shallow pomp of movie-soundtrack symphonies, or if they actually have some of the technical brilliance that the lay person might think they have.

So I show up for the show early, but not early early. I'm slowly getting set up and I go to get my (bassoon) reeds and they're not in their normal spot, no biggie, go to my car...not there either. Well...that's no good.

I wonder if perhaps they got lost at the other show I did today, or fell out between my car and somewhere else...no clue at all. So I decide after some discussion with the other people that the only reasonable course of action is to make the hour round trip drive home to where I hope they are. Mind you the show starts in less than 20 minutes...

Well as luck would have it another member of the orchestra gets a hold of a friend that has some reeds much closer. I meet up with her, get the reeds, all good for now.

Get back to the show, have to play red light, green light to sneak back in to the pit since I don't want to distract from the stage action, no biggie.

Start playing, reeds pretty rough, but in tune, so I can deal.

Intermission I take a moment to carve the reed a bit, super standard stuff, I do it all the time, no biggie...

1/3rd of the way in to the 2nd act one blade of the reed decides it's tired of being one piece and splits about halfway down to the wire...which makes playing about 3 times harder, sound 5 times worse, and cuts my range down to about 2/3rds of normal.

Pretty much the worst night as a musician I've ever had.

As it turns out the reeds had fallen under a piece of paper back at my apartment when I pulled something else out of my case earlier today.  

Edit: just to clarify, the whole 'sneak back in to the pit' part wasn't all that dramatic since it was an outdoor show...lucked out on that I guess.

I'm not particularly interested if this is ""the greatest piece"" by a particular composer in your opinion, or even if this piece will ""change my life"", I'll be the judge of that. All I'm saying is that, if we're linking to a piece, say what the piece is. Also, a post title should say if it's an arrangement or not, who the performer is, and , if possible, the catalogue or op. number. I know this is a lot to ask, but I'm rather tired of seeing links to pieces of ""life altering beauty"", only to find it's a piece I already enjoy. I'd love to hear what everyone thinks.

The characters described within intentionally resemble persons living or dead, and serve as a caution to other gigging string players.

 

**PRELUDE**

 

Before booking a wedding, write up a contract. You can make up anything you want in said contract, because the bride won’t read it unless she wants her money back. Now that you know this, make sure to include in the terms and agreements that the musicians require a 500% deposit and leftover wedding cake.

 

When agreeing to play a wedding, make sure the bride knows that you are playing a violin, and that playing the violin does not guarantee that you play the double bass, accordion, or vuvuzela. You definitely do not also DJ, unless they want to hear Mozart’s “Jupiter” Symphony for all the single ladies on the dance floor.

 

Be sure to carefully outline that your musicians need armless chairs in which to play, otherwise they will get either bar stools or industrial ladders. If the bride is the type who doesn’t read the contract, denote that your group requires La-Z Boy reclining chairs.

 

If the bride is younger than 30, make sure she knows how wise and mature she is. If she is older than 30, pretend she is younger than 30 and make sure she knows how delightfully youthful she is. If she is older than 80, she might be Betty White and you are either incredibly lucky or completely screwed.

 

On that note, never refer to the bride as a “client.” You may, however, call her Mrs. [Groom’s Name], The Boss, or Princess. Never refer to her mother as “whatserface” either (at least not within earshot of the bride).

 

When she mentions that this is “the most important day of her life,” make sure you respond with “And it is also mine.”

 

Always make sure to ask whether the wedding is indoor or outdoor.

 

*If it is outdoor between the dates of April 1st and October 31st, it will probably rain and you are screwed. In the event of rain, stay away from “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on my Head” or “Purple Rain,” but “Rainbow Connection” is okay. (“Tomorrow” from Annie is a lovely choice as long as no one sings along.)


*If it doesn’t rain, it will snow or be over 95 degrees. So make sure to bring an umbrella, galoshes, sunblock, bug spray, and a parka.


*Under NO circumstances should you wear sunglasses, because this is unprofessional, and the exorbitant fee which the family is most certainly paying you covers up to $100k in insurance claims if you go blind as a result of the sun.


*If it is moved indoor because of inclement weather, the most important day of the bride’s life has been ruined. Play “Walkin’ On Sunshine” to make her feel better, while wearing sunglasses. They are no longer unprofessional.


*If it is indoor regardless of the date or the weather, you might be dealing with a less crazy bride. Ask her if you can borrow her wedding dress to clean your violin immediately.  

 

*When the bridal couple respond to your email with what appears to be a completed contract attached, open it immediately and check to make sure that it is not the bride’s Hooters application.

 

*If you speak to the groom at all, talk about sports. If you don’t know anything about sports, talk about Metallica. If he asks you to play “Fade to Black” as the groomsmen are coming down the aisle, switch back to sports.

 

*If at any point during the planning process you hear the phrase “Disney wedding,” RUN.

 

**CEREMONY**

 

Brides think that musicians book events and then don’t show up. And as everyone knows, you don’t want to disappoint a bride. Make sure you walk in 30 minutes late (if at all) with rumpled hair and an empty six-pack of beer.

 

When you do finally arrive at the wedding site, the bride will be crying in a bathroom somewhere, so you need to find the wedding coordinator instead. This wedding coordinator also has a degree from a high-ranking conservatory and knows way more about the violin than you, so just do what she says. Never interrupt her when she is going through the list of events, as she has this memorized and has been practicing in front of the mirror for days.

 

Even though you are required to be at the wedding location from 10am to 6pm, you are NOT allowed to ingest any food at this time. So ignore the rumblings in your stomach and as I mentioned before, just do what the wedding coordinator hors d’oeuvres. I mean orders.

 

There is usually music for the Seating of the Mothers. Just so you know, the bride and her mother have been fighting for months about this, the most important day of their lives. Do NOT disappoint the motherzilla with your musical selections. If she wants “Arioso” by J.S. Bach, she will definitely know if you substitute “Air in G” or “Air in D” or “Hair in K flat,” because she has perfect pitch and is a Bach scholar. So it’s better to either just stick with “Arioso,” or play Van Halen’s “Hot for Teacher” because that’s what her husband sang to her in college.

 

One of the hardest parts during the ceremony is knowing when the bridesmaids are done filing in and the bride enters – in other words, when to switch from “Pachelbel’s Mind-Numbing Canon in D” to “Trumpet Involuntary.” Here are some hints to help determine this:

If the bride went to state school, there will be at least 26 bridesmaids from her sorority. The wedding coordinator will tell you to watch for Jenna because Jenna is the last one, and you obviously know who Jenna is (not) - the problem here is that they will all have exactly the same orange skin tone and peroxide blonde hair, so you just have to guess and say that it’s safe to play the Canon about 80 times with repeats, or the equivalent of one episode of Jersey Shore.


Whether the bride went to state school or not, she will definitely have little kids in her wedding because it’s so cute. There is no need to extend the canon for an additional 10 minutes, because everything will go exactly according to plan and both the flower girl and ring bearer will execute their duties beautifully without even a hint of temper tantrum or stomach flu.


When the bride does finally arrive in the entranceway, you have transitioned from the most important DAY of her life to the most important MOMENT. Look at her admiringly, forget your duties as you are momentarily distracted by her breathtaking beauty, then snap back to reality and play the “Wedding March” as you have never played it before. When she is precisely 5 more steps down the aisle, she will be cognizant of nothing but the adoration of the entire world shining upon her from the church pews, and you can take your snack break while she walks the rest of the way down.

 

During the ceremony, you and your colleagues choose the most bored-looking groomsman and make faces at him. Five points if he cracks a grin, 10 points if he stifles a yawn, 25 points if you win a game of Draw Something.

 

If this is a Jewish wedding, they will inevitably step on the glass. Whatever happens, do NOT nod off before this is done. Otherwise the transition from solemn prayer to the glass-shattering cry of “Mazel Tov!!!” will make you jump 2 feet out of your seat with a shriek and startle Grandma Tzeitl, who also nodded off.

 

If this is any kind of Greek or Italian wedding, just try not to let the mother know you are single, because dumpy Antonio is 42 and looking for a girl. Good-looking Daniele is married, so don’t even try. Uncle Cal is also married but will ask you to marry him anyway. Little Rico is only 17, but look what a sweet guy he is, in twenty years you won’t know the difference, and he inherits the family pizza shop, won’t that be nice!

 

Modern Quaker weddings are beautiful. Wear a shirt with a peace sign, play “Colors of the Wind,” and try not to fall backwards into the river.

 

Speaking of outdoor ceremonies, large tropical insects eating the skin off your feet and turning them into a bloody mess is NOT cause for alarm. Remember, you are getting paid to be a slave, plus what the bride doesn’t know is crawling up her gown won’t hurt her.

 

Asking for payment on the day of the wedding is severely insensitive, even uncouth. Just don’t do it. You will get a check in the mail eventually by the year 2016.

 

**RECESSIONAL**

 

You might get asked to play cocktail hour. For this they will pay you at least minimum wage to sit and watch Uncle Cal dance, while you continuously turn down his requests for line dances. Uncle Cal will dance anyway because he doesn’t realize that dancing does not happen during cocktail hour.

 

The groomsman with whom you have been playing Draw Something will at some point come over thinking he is really slick, and try to skillfully determine which of the lady musicians is single. This is why you always hire a cellist who is at least 6’4” and a muscular 280lbs.  If/when the mother of the bride approaches, immediately compare her daughter’s big day to the Royal Wedding, and politely take your leave. Unless she asks you to play the reception, and then you are screwed.

 

If you do play the reception, you give it 30 minutes, then go find the (single) bridesmaid that seems to be having the most fun, and immediately book a wedding and get her to sign a contract before she can say “slide to the left.” For the reception you can play absolutely anything you want, because string players are cool when they play pop music. If you know any Deadmau5 you will be the talk of the bridal party for years to come.

 

When the guests are looking sleepy and Uncle Cal can no longer throw his hands on his knees, hands on his knees… keep playing for another 3 days just to be safe. By this time all guests should be home, decorations cleaned up, leftover wedding cake stored in the freezer, and the bride signing divorce papers in the 2nd most important day of her life. Then, and only then, it is okay to pack up your instrument and go home.",,False,self,t5_2qhyq,1344116266.0,,nielsen,True,t3_xodn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/xodn7/rules_for_working_violinists_a_friend_wrote_it/,

* The choices are then [announced in a designated thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/kyl6k/the_books_for_november_have_been_chosen/)

* Then there is [a discussion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/k17di/discussion_thread_catch22_by_joseph_heller/) that floats around the subreddit for the rest of the month where people go to have one long conversation about it.

I love listening to pieces of music with the score. Particularly orchestral works that are somewhat ambitious in scope... lately, I've been doing a ton of score reading and some analysis, and I've loved every minute of it. Does anyone else feel like this? Every time I open up the score and start reading, and listening, I feel like I'm going on some sort of excessively revealing adventure through someone's mind. And I feel the same as when I think of some kind of rich and vast fictional universe... every page has some kind of a story to it, and what represents 5 seconds of music can take hours to compose, or (when analyzing) de-composing.

I've been developing a huge interest in English music of the 20th century, from Elgar to Ferneyhough and everything I can get my grubby hands on in between, and the scores all have the same effect on me. Every page has so much information, every page has so much flavour to it, and by and large it makes me want to delve into the music even more. It's hard to describe the feeling I get when a score hits me this hard, but I imagine it's a bit like being in the middle of some epic fantasy universe, and getting to know all its intimate details one by one.

That representation could have helped [this
guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/scsul/how_do_i_find_out_what_this_song_is/)
finding his Chopin nocturne. If you go to that search engine and just type
*UDDDDUUDUDDDDUUD you'll have that nocturne in the results.

Of course that works well for pieces in which you don't have too many grace
notes, appoggiaturas, chords, etc, and in which you can clearly identify a
melody. Still nice.

Try it with the Star Spangled Banner: *DDUUUUDDDUURRUDDDDUURDDD, the
Marseillaise *RRURURUDDRUDDUDDU, the 4th movement of Beethoven's 6th Piano
sonata *URRDURRDURRUDDDRR, etc. You find them.

The Rite is a ballet that depicts a pagan springtime fertility ritual culminating in a virgin sacrifice. The music is notable for its innovation in dissonance, timbre, and especially rhythm. It premiered in Paris in 1913; this premiere immediately led to one of the wildest music-related riots in history, though this might have been due more to the choreography than the music.

&gt; Recently Sergei Koussevitzky has performed Stravinsky's *Rite of Spring*, which has broken all records for cacophony and hideousness. It is a treasure chest in which Stravinsky has lovingly collected all sorts of musical filth and refuse. In French I would put it that ""M-r Stravinsky est un vendangeur musical."" [Mr. Stravinsky is a musical wrecker.] This ""Rite"" has been booed everywhere abroad, but among us it found some applauders – proof that we are ahead of Europe on the path of musical progress.

– [César Cui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Cui), as quoted ironically in Weiss and Taruskin, *Music in the Western World: A History in Documents*, 1984.

The piece has two parts: ""Adoration of the Earth"" and ""The Exalted Sacrifice"". Each of these contains a series of scenes, many of which continue from one into the next without pause. The total performance time is about 33 minutes.

[**Wikipedia entry**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring)

[**video**: contemporary reconstruction of Nijinsky's original choreography](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdvIRV_nwIE)

[**video**: unorthodox staging **with horses ZOMGWTFBBQ**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrOUYtDpKCc)

[**video**: as seen in Disney's 1940 *Fantasia*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gZbMOq_Ge8) - look at those fancy colors and listen to those hi-tech stereophonics! (it's the first commercial motion picture with stereo)

[**audio**: arrangement for piano four hands (those of Leonard Bernstein and Michael Tilson Thomas)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5OGUrJmvXU), recently submitted by scientologist2 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/oeibj/stravinsky_the_rite_of_spring_bernstein_and/)

No catch.,79,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1h2ojw/any_bostonian_want_a_bunch_of_free_classical_lps/,"Apologies if this type of post breaks the subreddit's rules, but hopefully somebody benefits from this. I have a bunch (100+?) of classical music LP records. Most are from the 60s and 70s and are in perfect playing condition. I inherited a family friend's collection a little while back, and I found a good home for the rock/pop/folk stuff. I don't really listen to classical music, nor do I know the worth of the records, so I figure I should just make someone happy and give them away for free. There's a lot of the major names (Beethoven, Mozart, etc) and a lot of ones I don't know. 

I am moving out of the country on Thursday, so they would need to be picked up tomorrow/Thursday in Wellesley. All I ask is that they go to a home that will actually appreciate them that you commit a random act of kindness for someone in the near future. 

PM me if you're interested, and perhaps upvote for visibility if you're not. Thanks.

* **Spotify** - [Here's a Spotify playlist with several different recordings of the work](http://open.spotify.com/user/scrumptiouscakes/playlist/0sRAostFNEEsmX5oyCjIG9), with performers including: The Emerson Quartet with Mstislav Rostropovich, The Melos Quartet also with Rostropovich, The Hagen Quartet with Heinrich Schiff, The Alban Berg Quartet also with Heinrich Schiff, The Borodin Quartet with Misha Milman, The Belcea Quartet with Valentin Erben, The Cleveland Quartet with Yo-Yo Ma, and many more. I have also included two period-instrument performances at the end of the playlist - I really recommend at least dipping into these to hear the differences.

**Discussion points:**

Piece of the Week is intended for discussion and analysis as well as just listening. Here are a few thoughts to get things started:

* Is this the greatest chamber work ever written? If so, why? If not, what is? What makes a chamber work great?
* How can we account for what Benjamin Britten called ""the most productive 18 months in our music history""? Did Schubert really have syphillis? Could his final creative outpouring have been caused by another illness?
* If you've listened to any of the period instrument performances that I've linked to above, do you think the work benefits from being played in this way? Do gut strings make all the difference?
* [Was Schubert gay? Does it matter?](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/04/arts/critic-s-notebook-was-schubert-gay-if-he-was-so-what-debate-turns-testy.html) Why/why not?
* Is Schubert's music full of self-pity? Do large doses of it make you miserable? Is it true that [he's nobody's favourite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1iqgne/very_intriguing_quote_about_schubert/)
* Does this work deserve the [very high levels of popularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_100_chamber_%28ABC%29) that it currently enjoys? Is the adagio getting too popular for its own good?
* Does anyone else love the scherzo in this piece as much as I do?
* This piece is often performed by string quartets augmented with an additional (and often [famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9dziwGRNxw)) cellist. Does this have any effect on the way it is played? Does the presence of a prominent soloist adversely affect this most co-operative of musical genres?
* How does this piece compare to the Trout Quintet? Which do you prefer, and why?
* How does this piece compare to Mozart's quintets, which use two violas rather than two cellos? How did Schubert make use of these resources? Can we see the influence of this piece on later works in the same genre, particularly [those by Brahms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy2RT1PwCqc)?
* Is Schubert's chamber music his greatest contribution, or do you think that his work in other genres is more important?
* If Schubert had lived longer, what do you think he might have written?
* Can someone explain to me what is so great/interesting about Schubert's harmonies/modulation between different keys?
* Schubert was incredibly prolific - what is your favourite lesser-known work of his?
* Is Schubert more like Mozart, or more like Beethoven?

Follow along with the Grooveshark link here:

http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/playlist/An+Intro+To+The+Violin+Concerto/41745296


Now, the word 'concerto' isn't exactly easy to define. It originally, back in the 1600s, meant something very simple - just a piece without voice. There was the concerto, just instrumental, and then there was the cantata, instruments with voice.


The violin, around this time, also began to rise to the forefront. The same era that gave rise to the diva soprano and the castrati also gave rise to the violin. Not content to sit backstage, new works began to feature this instrument. The most prominent and important composer was a man named Arcangelo Corelli.


* 1. Corelli - Trio Sonata in B minor Opus 1 No.6 - Largo

Corelli is the granddaddy of violin technique. Period. Everything comes from this guy - and for good reason. He wrote for the violin really, really well. All the patterns and string-crossing tricks discovered here were studied by everyone from Bach to Britten. Violinists and violists owe him a lot.

The core of his output was the 'Trio sonata'. You get a violin, a backup instrument, and a bass instrument. The violin, of course, steals the show.


* 2-4. Vivaldi - Concerto in G Minor Op. 8 No. 2 Summer

You've heard this piece before. Or at least the beginning set of movements. It's from the Four Seasons. Composers everywhere took to the violin, taking advantage of the amazing range and flexibility. This piece is a fantastic example of this.


If the ridiculous fingerwork wasn't enough of a hint, there was a bit of a change in the definition of 'concerto'. It wasn't just a piece for an instrumentalist to play. Now, it was an invitation to show off. The concept of the 'virtuoso' was born, and it was here to stay.


*  5. W.A. Mozart - Violin Concerto No. 5 Mvmt. 3

At this point, I'm just going through relatively famous violin concerti. Mozart loved the violin. It was an instrument that fit his capricious character. I can't think of another composer that so effortlessly (and often) changes his mood. If you like this piece, also check out Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante.



*  6-8. Mendelssohn - Concerto In E Minor, Op. 64: Allegro Molto Appassionato

This piece is the 50-cal of the violin concerto arsenal. It's the Michael Jordan of the violin concerto basketball team. It's kind of a big deal. If you're a violinist, you know this piece. If you don't, you will. It's blood, sweat, and tears for everyone. Really young kids are made to learn this piece at a young age, and I don't think people realize how outstandingly hard this piece is to play well. There's so much little detail in this piece - that opening melody is written to feature the E-string, the brightest and most piercing sound possible. Every musical idea melts into the next. Mendelssohn spent 10 years on this piece - and I think it shows. A critical piece of the repertoire.



*  9-11. Bruch - Violin Concerto No.1 in G minor Op.26

This is the other really big violin concerto. We're now sitting at the last part of the 19th century, by the way. Romanticism in full swing, a willingness to break the forms of old to make way for the affectations of the composer. The last movement of this piece is ridiculously difficult.


*  12. Brahms - Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D major, Op. 77

This is a terrifying violin concerto. It stopped being hard a while ago and started being sadistic. But is it worth it? Oh, of course. This piece in particular takes those fundamental patterns in Corelli and takes them to their utter extremes. And, hey, it's Brahms. Listen to the entire concerto if you have time - and you'll need time. The first movement is 18 minutes long.


*  13. Sibelius - Violin Concerto in D Minor, 1st Movement

If you listen to just one song on this list, listen to this one. It's like ice. This piece has a special place in a mushy heart. It was brought to fame almost single-handedly by Jascha Heifetz, the Russian monster virtuoso of the mid 20th century. Written in the early-middish 1900s, this has entered the repertoire recently, but solidly. It's also freakin' hard to play (but, hey, everything else on this list is, so what's new?).


*  14. Bartok - Violin Concerto No. 2, Sz 112: III. Allegro molto

This piece, along with the Romanian Dances, got me into Bela Bartok and changed my musical career permanently, for better or for worse. I was also foolish enough to try to learn this monstrous piece (oh god the double stops at 4:15). It calls for an absolutely mammoth orchestra, but is orchestrated so exquisitely well that the violin is always easily heard. It's a whirlwind. Listen to the whole thing if you have the time. Oh, and check out the tone row at 3:00.


*  15-17. Karol Szymanowski - Violin Concerto No. 1 Op. 35

To round off this list - a piece by a certain Polish composer. Not written too long after Prelude to the Afternoon of a Fawn, this concerto easily has the densest, most contemporary sound of anyone on the list (yes, that includes the Bartok). It's also rather obscure, but I think it has enough merit to warrant a bit more attention. Give this piece a chance - it opens up and explodes like a flower made of nitroglycerin.


I'm missing a criminal number of wonderful violin concerti from this list, but I seem to be running near the character limit. This overview gives you a general enough look at the development of the violin concerto and the terrifying beast its turned into. Please, post links to your own favorites  - I'm eager to learn more music! I've also played a few songs on this list, so if you hear something and are curious about how a particular sound is produced, I'm happy to oblige.",,False,self,t5_2qhyq,False,,,True,t3_euxch,http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/euxch/an_introduction_to_the_violin_concerto/,

Although we don't have many users compared to some subreddits, I have a feeling that we're like people who like licorice: not many people like licorice, but the people who do like licorice really, really like licorice. 

Anyway, I have a couple thoughts on the subject. As a topic that came up before, I think more moderators would be good. We've grown a lot over the past few months/weeks. I think we added some more since that one topic came up though, so we might be good.

Second, a lot of our interaction with people outside of the subreddit comes with the inevitable post that will always ask, ""How can I get into classical music?"" Usually, these people are looking for specific suggestions. I really like the ""New here? Here's a useful..."" reference thing we have to the right, but I think we should be very careful NOT to discourage people from posting their own ""Where should I start with classical music?"" posts. This is because, from our vast source of pooled knowledge of classical music, we can personalize suggestions for each user. 

Also, I think one demographic that we should be aware of is the composers, performers, etc., among us. Other subreddits, like we are the music makers or whatever, are tailored to people who make music very different from classical music. If I were to ask for opinions on my own music, I'd bring it to classicalmusic before anywhere else. Maybe we could have a posting that lists redditor's performances and concerts? Also, more people should be encouraged to post their music! I would, but none of my pieces are done yet.

These are just some ideas off the top of my head. Hopefully this sparks some dialogue that improves the above ideas, and comes up with completely new ones. It's just I think there's a lot of untapped resources here which we could use to make the subreddit even more active than it has been lately.

**edit: Findings:**

1. **LESS LURKING, MORE POSTING!** I've definitely been guilty of this, but I think we all need to make a concentrated effort to post and comment more (and realize that classical music won't have the worst of the worst reddit d-bags that are so common elsewhere...) This is easily the biggest reason. It seems like people are most interested in discussion, so make sure to add a jumping off point to your youtube links! Research the piece a little maybe!

2. **Advertise us!** Post stuff to other subreddits! If you post something to classical music, just go for it and post it to other subreddits (/r/music, etc.) It can't hurt, only some downvotes maybe. Let's try to get listed on the side of other subreddits, like music, because apparently there are people who don't realize there's a classical music subreddit. And maybe, just maybe, we can get people to see that classical music fulfills needs that popular music simply can't.

3. **More mods!** Especially if we want to get more stuff going on here. I know I, for one, would be interested in being a mod. Contacting the mod if you would want to be one as well would probably be the best way to make this happen.

Let's do this! Although we're small, we're very dedicated, and we can make this happen.

Further notes: Let's compile a list of classical music blogs/web sites/etc. (we get new york times/new yorker articles from time to time) that we can raid for articles and other interesting posts. I'll try to google some later when I can and add them here.

Now I am hearing constant doom and gloom about orchestras shutting down, musicians striking, modern music is terrible, no one buys CDs etc, and overall ""less and less people listen to classical music.""

Regardless whether all not some or all of these points are true...

I'm wondering what we, as passionate listeners can do to get more people interested. Especially young people too, in high school and college. And how to get over:

1. Classical music is harder to listen to and (IMO) requires more focus and background knowledge to fully appreciate. Where as most popular music is specifically written to be 'easy' to hear. I made a real conscious effort to get into classical music and still it took me a while, why would the average Joe bother?

2. the term classical music has so many negative connotations in many people's eyes. Like ""boring"", ""for old people"", ""difficult"" and so on... People are put off before they've heard a note.

3. Most people's idea of what classical music sounds like is limited to something like the Four Seasons, Fur Elise, Eine Kleine Nacht Musik etc. top 100 classical ""songs"" for relaxing/study.

I'd love to make a top 100 classical album and fill it with Schoenberg and Varese. 

4. the consensus on contempoary compositions seems to be ""impossible to listen to mathematics with very fancy scores"" but anything more tuneful or consonant gets labelled neo-classical.

I think what we really need, is rather than 30% of people saying they like classical music and only knowing 3 pieces they put on in the background. Is 5% of people who people who love classical music, and buy music, go to concerts, have heard a large amount of repertoire.

Excuse my blog. I don't think classical music is dying as people have been claiming for years, but I would love to hear more good news. Especially for new music, the prospects for a budding composer look terrible.
