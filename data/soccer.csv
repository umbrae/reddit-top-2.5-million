1368447038.0,2804,self.soccer,1e8ncw,Explaining the Falcao move to Monaco,5334,2530,537,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e8ncw/explaining_the_falcao_move_to_monaco/,"**Edit** This post is now [a proper blog post, edited and with more links and info](http://www.postmatch.org/5/explaining-the-falcao-move-to-monaco/)

You have probably all already seen that Falcao is destined for Monaco. There were a lot of rumors about a  potential move to Manchester United, Chelsea, Real Madrid and others - so why does he end up moving to Monaco?

The answer is because of the complicated third-party ownership involved with Falcao. There was a very similar situation with Hulk when he moved to Zenit.

To explain this, we need to take a step back and first see how third party ownership works. Those in England would have previously seen this topic as it reached prominence when Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano signed for West Ham United. Here were two stars from Argentina signing for a club in London who were struggling to stay in the top flight. The controversy lead to West Ham paying compensation  of £18M to Sheffield United, and lead the FA to ban third party ownership.

But third party ownership is still alive and well on the continent. It is most often applied with South American stars making the jump across the Atlantic to Europe. The way it works is that investment groups will purchase the registration rights of an upcoming player. This is sometimes done while the player is at a club, and sometimes as part of a transfer.

For eg. one scenario would be that a 16 year old star in South America would be approached by an agent and asked if he wants backing with marketing and making it big in Europe. These deals usually involve paying the player a better salary, hooking him up with a better agent, better management, sponsorship deals etc. If and when the player agrees, the third party owners will then go to the club he is registered to and negotiate to buy his registration rights - either all of or part of.

The player is then in the hands of the management and third party ownership group, who manage every aspect of his career from that point on. That usually involves paying him a larger salary on top of his club salary, placing him in clubs where he will get more exposure, etc.

The other way third-party ownership happens is that the investment group finances a transfer for a player. For eg. Porto want to sign a player from Brasil but don't have the funds, they would approach an investment group and have them stake 50-60% of the deal in return for the players registration rights.

The investment group make all of this upfront investment with the hope that at some point in the future the player proves himself, becomes a star, and can then exit at a very large valuation.

Some examples: Tevez and Mascherano were placed into West Ham by their investment group as a way of getting them more exposure. It worked out well in both cases as Liverpool purchased Mascherano (buying out the investment group and giving them a good return) and City eventually ended up buying out Tevez - albeit via Manchester United (who never owned the entirety of his transfer rights).

Back to Falcao. He was purchased by a third-party ownership group as part of his transfer to Porto. They bought 55% (likely more) of his transfer rights, supplemented his salary while he was paying at Porto and then moved him to Atletico for the purpose of getting him more exposure (likely with an eye on moving him eventually to Real Madrid). During the time Falcao was there, the investors were supplementing his wages again (infact paying most of them) and working on negotiating his big move which would see them cash out.

Porto's financials show the following for the Falcao transfer:

&gt; sale of 60% of the economic rights of the player Bolatti to the entity Natland Financieringsmaatschappij B.V., on July 2009, by the amount of, approximately, 1,500,000 Euro, (transaction perform under the acquisition process of 40% of the registration of Falcao)

There is another section where it is disclosed that they sold another 5% option in Falcao, and another section where it is disclosed that there is an option for a third party to purchase a further 10%.

The same filing shows that Porto only owned 45% of Hulk.

What is more interesting is who is involved in the Falcao ownership. The group is called Doyen Sports and it was founded by Jorge Mendes (most famous as Ronaldo's agent, but an infamous player agent who is involved in a lot of third-party deals) and Peter Kenyon (former Chelsea chairman).

On their website [they have a page for Falcao](http://www.doyensports.com/en/RF.html) and you can also see the other players listed. Falcao, like Hulk, ended up in a situation where there was so much invested in him that it would take a lot of money for the investors to see a return (known as being highly leveraged). They were paying his salary for a few seasons, had floated Atleti some money to keep them alive (they got some shirt sponsorship in return) and had made the initial investment when he first transferred.

Falcao ends up moving to Atletico in a 40M move - despite Atleti the previous season stating that they had to clear players out because of their 220M euro tax bill with the Spanish government. What this ended up being is a 20 + 20M deal. 20M never gets paid because its just the third-party owners paying themselves, and of the other 20M only 18M is owed by Atleti, who take an option of paying in two 9M installments (they were late on the first one, they only paid 2.5M and defaulted to the point of Porto threatening to sue and taking the issue up with FIFA). End situation is that around 60% of the rights are with the Doylen group. It also appears that while Falcao was at Atletico that Doylen took an option for a larger stake in him since Atleti were late on their payments. Something weird happen which involved Doylen taking a sponsorship. Either way, they had the majority stake and Atletico had no say or control of the player. For all purposes it was nothing more than a loan with Atletico having a small stake in his registration rights.

The president of Atletico Madrid continuously insisted that they own all the rights to Falcao, but this simply isn't true. 

Falcao is on a wage of 10M euro per year, and the return the investors wanted is 60M euro in transfer fee. This narrows down the list of potential clubs that can buy you out to very few. Atletico had no say in where Falcao goes, they had an option in the winter transfer window, but that expired. The owners needed their return and they were going to get it one way or the other.

The list can be narrowed down to PSG, Monaco, Real Madrid, Chelsea and City. City aren't making large investments any longer, PSG have their fix of strikers. Of the remaining three, it is apparent that Real Madrid didn't want to pay up the 60M + 50M in contracts for Falcao (for whatever reason). Apparently Chelsea matched the 60M clause but to pay Falcao the 10M per season in wages would involve a total gross salary of 300k+ per week, which just isn't manageable. 

Chelsea also have the issue of not being allowed to directly purchase a player from a third-party owner (apparently this is what turned ManU off a move) so it would have required a two-step sale with Falcao going to one club outright and then to Chelsea. Apparently with the David Luiz transfer on the same day he moved to Chelsea Benfica bought out the entirety of his rights from third-party owners (so you can summize that Chelsea gave them the money to buy out that deal so that they could purchase 100% of Luiz directly from Benfica, thus avoiding the third-party rule in England).

With all of these factors you end up with only one target: Monaco. They have the 60M to pay out the investors, they have the funds to pay his wages of 10M per year and better yet they have no income tax so they don't have to supplement the gross.

So in the end Falcao is moved around Europe by his investors with the only goal of making a return for them. He has little to no say in his final destination because of a deal he agreed to years ago while he was still in South America.

**edit** part that I missed which some people might not know - Monaco were purchased by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, the 79th richest man in the world. Similar MO to the Al Thani's at PSG except he is investing as an individual, rather than with the backing of a state. 

* [BBC on the takeover](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16322948)
* [His Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Rybolovlev)

When he bought the club in December 2011 they were bottom of the second division in France. He rescued them that season and has now seen them promoted back to Ligue 1.

**Edit** some more links, this time from UEFA, who have strong words against third-party ownership (but it still goes on):

 * [General Secretary: No place for third-party ownership](http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/organisation/generalsecretary/news/newsid=1931937.html)
 * [UEFA call for ban on third-party ownership](http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/organisation/executivecommittee/news/newsid=1906435.html)

This is why, as asked below, Atletico insist in public statements that they own 100% of Falcao - they don't want to risk any potential clampdown from UEFA.

Last year I made a fake picture of an Atletico Madrid kit for shits and giggles. Spanish press circulated it as the real deal. AM fans were outraged with it. I only found out now that a company that makes dodgy knock-off kits thought it was real too, and physically made the shirt I drew.


**NTL;R version**

Right, where to start…
First off, I should explain. I do a lot of photoshopping. Sometimes for flyers, others for meme-style stuff, etc. Another thing I like to do sometimes is knock out designs for football shirts. I’ve an interest in football shirts in general so it’s something I do mostly out of boredom or to try out different photoshop methods, such as drawing paths, etc. I post some of these designs on [www.footballshirtculture.com](www.footballshirtculture.com), which has a gallery section for user created kit designs.

At the start of January last year, this image appeared on the net  showing the [yet-unconfirmed 2011/2012 Barcelona kit](http://i.imgur.com/uzjh8.jpg). We know now that it turned out to be real, but it wasn't known yet at the time.

I [recreated the shirt in Photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/btDfg.jpg), just out of curiosity. Then, while I had everything open, I knocked out what an [Atletico Madrid shirt might look like using the same style](http://i.imgur.com/wNEvd.jpg). Even though I wasn't fond of it myself, I saved it and uploaded to the gallery and thought nothing more of it.

The next day I look at the site and I notice that my Atletico shirt design was getting a huge number of hits (1000 in a couple of days, while other designs uploaded around the same time were barely hitting the hundreds, which is the normal amount). I checked the comments for it and saw that someone had posted saying that the reason my design was getting so many hits was because the Spanish press were circulating my picture as a genuine leak. A quick Google search, and I found [this article](http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/nueva-camiseta-11-12-tendra-rayas/20110102dasdaiftb_39/Tes).

Here’s a Google translation:
&gt;The design of the new shirt of Atletico Madrid for the 2011-12 season saw the light in the Dutch website dedicated to footballshirtculture.com. This shirt would end up with stripes on the sleeves and incorporate a total of seven red stripes on eight other white, unlike the five traditional red. The main change would be that the red lines would lose thickness as they move toward the bottom of the shirt for the white parts. The neck, which last season was red and it was changed to white, disappear for the 2011-12 and thus give a more in polo shirts and less.
&gt;The new red and white uniform is always one of the best kept secrets as a sports brand that sponsors the club always likes to keep the mystery about how it will be the shirt. Therefore, to uncover new project now, Nike could consider a change to the model that has been discovered by this website or redesign a new model.
&gt;In addition to the shirt of Atletico, the Dutch website also uncovered the design of future zamarra of Barcelona, very similar to Atleti, but Blaugrana, the Arsenal, Manchester United or Ajax.

Another quick search then brought up [this thread](http://www.colchonero.com/camisetas_2011_2012_filtracion-itemap-1-94789-1.htm) on www.colchonero.com, which from what I could ascertain, is a major Atletico Madrid forum. Sufficed to say, feedback was pretty divisive.

Twenty-seven pages. Twenty-seven pages of Atletico Madrid fans in uproar over the shirt. My shirt. The shirt that I casually shat out in a couple of bored minutes. I didn’t even *like* it.

This was all a year ago. However, I found out today that, not only did the Spanish press believe my shirt to be the real deal, but so did a company in Asia that make knock-off replica shirts. To get their dodgy merchandise out at the same time as the official kit launch, they sometimes have to go ahead with manufacturing before the design is confirmed...

I think you know now where this is going.

So without further ado, I present to you, the [physical manifestation of a fake Atletico Madrid shirt design that I threw together in about ten bored minutes.](http://i.imgur.com/MFQVy.jpg)

I can't stop laughing.

EDIT 1: Thanks everyone for the positive feedback. Even if I wanted to proceed to take some sort of legal action, I doubt I have any grounds for a claim (it's a Nike design, after all). [Econogeek](http://www.reddit.com/user/Econogeek) found the shirt available to buy on [a UK site](http://www.ecrater.co.uk/p/13487001/best-price-2011-2012-atletico-madrid-home#). It's actually a different shirt to the one in the image above (the stripes that the crest sits on are different). You're a smart troupe, so I don't need to say if you were inclined to buy one, make sure your credit details are secure (from what I can tell, it's a legit site).

EDIT 2: I forgot to mention I found the pic of the physical shirt on [todosobrecamisetas.blogspot.com](http://todosobrecamisetas.blogspot.com/), a great site for kit news run in part by fellow redditor [EleteTSC](http://www.reddit.com/user/EleteTSC).

*  20 games on NBC, 154 on NBCSN, 22 on other NBCUniversal channels, 184 on Premier League Extra time, 10 on Telemundo, 66 on mun2.

*  What the final day of the season will look like http://imgur.com/l9L2p9a
10 games on 10 different networks

*  If you have the NBC sports channel all games will be available to you live in one way or another

*  Match of the day on NBC every Saturday (likely an American version)

*  A two-hour show Mondays with condensed Man United and City games from that weekend.

*  A two-hour show Tuesdays with condensed matches of Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham.

*  Games will be aired Saturday: 7 am and 10 am on NBCSN, 12:30 on NBC, Sunday: 8 am on NBCSN, 11 am on NBCSN and Telemundo. Midweek: 2:30 on NBCSN. All times ET

*  An example of NBC's sexy new studios for pre and post game coverage http://imgur.com/9QD2phz

*  Main NBC PL talent: Arlo White, Lee Dixon, Graeme Le Saux, Rebecca Lowe, Robbie Earle, Robbie Mustoe. Special contributor Gary Lineker. (This is a much better line up than Fox Sports)

*  A 30 minute goals show every Sunday

* Online steams are free to cable customers whose companies have authentication deals.  (This should improve online stream quality, legal or otherwise, for everyone)

*  Further breakdown of games on various NBC channels: six on USA Network, nine on CNBC, seven on other channels, mostly on that final Sunday.  (There's going to be soccer on ""E!"", lol)

*  NBCSN will pick up the EPL's produced shows: Premier League World, Premier League Preview and Premier League Review.

* Arlo White (The best MLS announcer) will be live on site for over 75 games.

*  Some new original programs coming next season that I haven't mentioned:

Premier League 36 -- An original series that follows EPL players for 36 hours leading up to a game.

Match of the Week --NBC Sports Network will re-air the best match of the weekend in its entirety Sunday night.

Premier League Download -- A weekly show featuring high-profile celebrity supporters and journalists discussing the Premier League.

Premier League Countdown -- A preview of the 2013-14 Premier League season.

*  A 10 am whip-around show is something that has been looked at. No more details yet.  

*  Just to clarify if you have NBC sports network, which is in most cable packages, you can watch every Premier League game live ether online or on TV.

* **FOX SOCCER IS DEAD** (thank god). The games Fox still has the rights for (Champions League) will be shown on the fox sports channel, which most people have.

*  Arlo White's color analyst will not be on the field. Lee Dixon or Graeme Le Saux will be in the commentary booth with White. 

*  There will be Match of the Day, Match of the Day 2, and Match of the Week, every weekend.

*  That's all folks!  The USA will now have the most thorough coverage of the English league in the world, which is a little odd...",,False,,t5_2qi58,1366128529.0,,,True,t3_1cgmua,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1cgmua/nbc_announce_their_coverage_of_the_bpl_in_the_us/,

[](//#info-big) Match Facts

- This final will be the first all-German clash in a European Cup final. 2000 (Spain), 2003 (Italy) and 2008 (England) are the three previous occasions of teams from the country meeting in the Champions League final.

- Dortmund are undefeated against Bayern in their last six league games (four wins, two draws). However, Munich are undefeated in four competitive games this season (two wins in the Super Cup and DFB-Pokal and two draws in the Bundesliga).

- The last duel on neutral ground between Bayern and Dortmund was the 2012 DFB-Pokal final. Dortmund won 5-2.

- Mario Götze will transfer to Bayern Munich this summer for a fee of 37 million euros. Only Zlatan Ibrahimovic had more assists in this Champions League campaign (7) than Gotze (5).

- Only Cristiano Ronaldo (12) has scored more goals in the Champions League this season than Robert Lewandowski (10). Bayern's top scorer is Thomas Müller with eight.

- Neven Subotic (133) and Mats Hummels (106) have been forced into making more clearances than any other players in the Champions League this season.

- BVB have kept just three clean sheets in their last 12 European matches.

- A German team is guaranteed to win the Champions League for a third time. Dortmund in 1997 and Bayern in 2001 were the previous winners.

- Bayern Munich have lost three of the four finals they have played in. Borussia Dortmund were victorious in the only final they have played.

- Bayern won all four games in the Quarter Final and Semi Finals without conceding a goal (11-0 on aggregate). They are only the fifth team in Champions League history to not concede a goal in any of their four matches in these two rounds.

- This is Jupp Heynckes third Champions League campaign as a coach. In all three seasons he has reached the final. In 1998 he won the trophy with Real Madrid and last year, he lost the final with Bayern Munich.

- Bayern could become the first German team to win the Treble (league championship, domestic cup, and the Champions League or European Cup). Six clubs have managed it previously, with the last being Inter Milan in 2010.

- Six of the 10 goals Bayern have conceded in the competition this season have been scored in the final 15 minutes of their matches.

- Just one of the last five Champions League finals has gone over 2.5 goals. However, that final was also played at Wembley (Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United in 2011).

&gt;Bolton Wanderers can confirm that Fabrice Muamba has been admitted to the Heart Attack Centre at the London Chest Hospital where he is currently in a critically ill condition in intensive care.
No further information will be issued at this stage.
The club has requested the media to respect his family's privacy at this time.


Edit number 3: Bolton Wanders have released the following statement:


&gt;Fabrice Muamba remains in a critical condition in intensive care in the Heart Attack Centre at The London Chest Hospital.

&gt;Fabrice was admitted to the hospital yesterday evening after collapsing at White Hart Lane, where he sustained a cardiac arrest during the FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham Hotspur.

&gt;Fabrice received prolonged resuscitation at the ground and on route to The London Chest Hospital, where his heart eventually started working. 

&gt;As is normal medical practice, Fabrice remains anaesthetised in intensive care and will be for at least 24 hours. 

&gt;His condition continues to be closely monitored by the cardiac specialists at the hospital. 

&gt;Bolton Wanderers Manager Owen Coyle said: ""Fabrice's family have asked me to pass on their thanks for the many, many kind messages of support from not only Bolton fans but also fans from clubs across the country and abroad.

&gt;""All our thoughts and prayers are for Fabrice and his family. The family would also like to thank the media for respecting their privacy at this time.""

The community at /r/soccer now has more than 100,000 members. While we should all understand that it's purely a symbolic number, it is a larger symbolic number than we had a few weeks and months ago, and it's big enough to make it worth noting.

As moderators of this group, we like to think that /r/soccer is about the most sensible, balanced, diverse, intelligent, and all around best place in the world for news and discussion about the game of Association Football in all its locations and forms.

Our community shows that it doesn't matter if you grew up calling the sport soccer, football, fußball, futebol, fútbol or calcio. The beautiful game brings people together, and when people come together for a common purpose, wonderful things can happen. Everyone who has helped this community become what it is deserves a big round of applause.

We also think it is entirely within the spirit of our group that we mark this milestone in a very concrete and positive way.

Because of that we are pleased to announce the launch of the **/r/soccer Let's Go Play** fundraising campaign on behalf of [One World Futbol Project’s](http://www.oneworldfutbol.com/) partner organizations around the world.

The One World Futbol is a virtually-indestructible ball designed to be used anywhere that a ball can conceivably be kicked. The ball has no air bladder, never goes flat, never needs a pump, and will go on playing even when punctured. 

Sport has the power to bring communities together and create networks of dedicated people. A network of committed individuals is among the greatest resources possible when it comes to local development. 

A ball that keeps on being a ball is incredibly helpful in building teams that can tackle issues far more serious than how to win a game. A standard ball often fails within weeks in Nairobi or Kabul. This ball is designed to last for decades, anywhere.

Please see [Campaigns](http://www.oneworldfutbol.com/category/campaign/) at One World Futbol Project for more information about organizations using the ball, and please read the recent [New York Times piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/giving/the-one-world-futbol-promises-a-lasting-source-of-fun-in-poor-countries.html?_r=1&amp;) on One World Futbol Project
for more background information.


**Here is how you can support the /r/soccer Let's Go Play initiative and  bring the power of play to
youth around the world:**

* **Visit the [/r/soccer Let's Go Play campaign](http://www.oneworldfutbol.com/campaigns/lets-go-play/)** hosted on One World Futbol Project’s
website. Through the campaign, you can:

* *Buy One Give One*. Buy a ball for yourself and another ball will be donated
in the name of the “r/soccer Let’s Go Play” campaign.

* *Just Give*. Donate a ball (or many) directly to the campaign, and One World
Futbol Project will make sure they get to children and youth served by their
partner organizations.

- **Visit the [r/soccer Let's Go Play campaign](https://reddit.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/rsoccer)** hosted on crowdtilt.com. Through this
site, you can make a cash donation in any amount from around the world to the campaign. 

All monies raised through crowdtilt.com will be applied to purchase One World Futbols. All balls
raised through the campaign will be distributed to One World Futbol Project partner
organizations using the balls in programs around the world.

We can make a very real difference in the lives of very real people with something as
simple as a ball that refuses to quit.

How big of a difference can we make?",,False,,t5_2qi58,1360633076.0,,chicago-fire,True,t3_18azgd,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/18azgd/rsoccer_now_has_over_100000_subscribers_lets_go/,moderator

EDIT Number 2: The club's managing director has acknowledged the open letter linked to in this post, and has stated that a name change is not currently on the agenda for the club. However, the interview that took place on local radio was not entirely convincing, and many fans would not be surprised to see the change occur in the future. A good summary of how people are feeling can be found [here](http://boothferrytowembley.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/mauling-tiger.html?spref=tw).

It would be fantastic if people could continue to sign the petition, as this will clearly establish the position of the Hull City fans, and football fans in general as being against this sort of rebranding.

1349147602.0,1458,self.soccer,10sqnc,Cheating in the U17 women's world cup.  ,1987,529,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/10sqnc/cheating_in_the_u17_womens_world_cup/,"**TLDR:**  The captain of the Nigerian U17 women's soccer team is atleast 10 years older than 17, how do I expose this before the tournament ends?

[pictorial evidence](http://i.imgur.com/cMspY.jpg)

I know U17 women's world cup isn't really popular here. I watched a few games on ESPN3 a few days ago then went to the FIFA website to look up stats.  Something seemed off with the Nigerian team (I am Nigerian, born and raised), my first instinct was these ""girls"" look older than i expected.  Then looking at the squad list I noticed alot of the players are attached to some of the top professional teams in Nigeria.  Though it is possible that a 13-15 year old girl is playing on a professional team it seems improbably due to significant strength difference, plus the logistics of travelling regularly in a developing country with poor roads makes it highly unlikely that parents allow minors to skip skill and travel around the country to play football.  

I got a little hint about the captain on the team and followed the electronic trails (thank you facebook).  The captain of the Nigerian U17 team has a younger sister that is 19 years old, another sister that is 26-29 years old, therefore she is in her late 20s or early 30s.  Prior to my little detective work someone familiar with the family guesstimated that captain of Nigeria's U17 team is around 28 years old.  Regardless of what her exact age is she is way over 17 years old.  Age cheating is a big deal in men's soccer, especially in African countries.  FIFA started using MRI to look at bone development to determine eligibility, the same measure is not used for women.  

I've tried contacting sports journalists in Nigeria to get some information about the Nigerian women's league and the players but it appears that most Nigerians will rather look the other way.  

How can I bring more attention to this?  How can i get bloggers and journalists from countries participating in the tourney to look at my somewhat persuasive evidence?


**EDIT**
1.  Thank you guys for all you suggestions and support.  
2.  We on TV...well not exactly TV but we on google

[Story got picked up, share the link  on twitter and facebook if you want](http://sportige.com/nigeria-cheating-09-2012-at-the-womens-world-cup/)

**EDIT 2**
Canada just lost to North Korea another team that most likely guilty of using old players in junior competition. N.Korea have been in the finals of the U17 world cup the two times it has been held, the won it once. N. Korea also won the U20 world cup and made it to the finals on one occasion. Inexplicably they cannot make it out of the group stages of the actual world cup when there is no age limit. Do North Korean players magically forget our to play football once they turn 21?

A writer for one of the major Nigerian newspaper contacted me and he'll be writing about this in the Saturday edition of the paper.  

More people familiar with Nigerian players came forward to tell me that they know players that are indeed too old to be in this tournament but most of them have one excuse or another to justify the cheating.

Many of the players remaining in Azerbaijan have seen the story. I have received msgs from frustrated players hoping something will be done to stop or reduce age cheating in the women's game for future players.

**TL;DR version**

**NTL;R version**

About a year ago, DesignFootball ran a competition where people would [redesign crests of UEFA clubs](http://www.designfootball.com/design-galleries/competitions/uefa-clubs-logo-crest-redesign-competition/). I submitted the above United crest (as well as a [Norwich](http://i.imgur.com/A64PyK2.jpg) and [AFC Wimbledon](http://i.imgur.com/IneJAiv.jpg) one), but didn't win. No big deal, but that was the last I'd thought of it.

Fast forward to today, and I see [Joe.ie](http://joe.ie/football/european-football/pic-the-man-utd-crest-could-be-set-for-an-overhaul-0037029-1) reporting my United crest as being a leak of a potential new official crest.

Thank you.,1845,482,299,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ip9cr/footballsoccer_fans_please_take_a_few_minutes_to/,"As some of you may know, but unfortunately the majority may not, my club Coventry City FC, of the nPower League 1, are in turmoil.

Attempting to sum up everything that has happened to us over recent times is a near impossible task, but I hope that reading this post and a Google search or two will help educate more people on the matter. We the fans wish to bring the despicable actions of our board to the attention of the wider footballing world, at least to show what can happen to a club who live in the hearts of many. Wall of text incoming, I'm very sorry.

To begin, some information on how our club worked:

* We are owned by a hedge fund named **SISU**, who took us over on the brink of administration in 2007, promising to clear all debts and start ""Operation Premiership"". They have failed to provide accounts to Companies House multiple times. They are owned by a woman named Joy Seppala, who has never been seen by anyone. The Cheif Executive of our club is Tim Fisher, SISU's mouth to the public.

* We played at a ground called the Ricoh Arena, a 32500 seater state-of-the-art stadium opened in 2005. It also comprises of a casino, 9000 person exhibition hall, hotel, gym and executive facilities. Crucially, it is **not owned by the club**. Coventry Council and a charity (The Alan Higgs Trust) each own a half stake. They are collectively known as **ACL**, from whom the club rents the ground. Our average attendance was far less than half of the capacity.

Last season, SISU put a part (but not the whole) of the club into administration. Huge debts (up to £70million) are still owed to various sources, and crucially, no rent has been paid to ACL for over a year. True, the rent rate was ridiculously high (£1.4million/year), but that's the deal which was signed and SISU have refused to pay. 

It was determined by the League (correctly of course) that we were given a 10 point deduction, losing out on any chance of the playoffs. Here was where many strange things started happening.

* An administrator was appointed to deal with the club. Despite the fact this should be impartial, the man was of SISU's choice alone.

* We were told by SISU that we had been thrown out of the Ricoh for unpaid rent, and that they were considering playing home games elsewhere, **outside of the city of Coventry**. 

* The ground owners ACL stated that this **was a lie**. Their doors were still open. They then even offered for us to play there **completely free** for the upcoming season.

* It was announced 4 bids came in for the part of the club in administration. The winning bid, which the administrator said ""was the highest by some margin"", **came from a subsidiary of SISU themselves**, named **Otium Ltd**. So a company put itself into administration with huge debts, then buys itself back out again. That doesn't add up to me, but the Football League cleared it with no problem.

* It was announced that the club had agreed to play its home games at Northampton Town, **35 miles** from Coventry. The Football League rules state that a ground share **cannot be more than 30 miles from the club**. But that obviously doesn't matter.

* The plan (supposedly) was to play there for 3 years, but crucially the words ""a minimum of 3"" have been added to the agreement. The talk is now that it will be 5. These shares are only allowed if the club has a clear plan to return. No plan has ever been seen.

* SISU now want to build a new ground somewhere in Coventry, despite the fact we have a high-quality ground that's only 8 years old. So they cannot afford to pay £1.4million in rent, but have the money to build an entirely new ground and its infrastructure? Yet no actual announcement has ever been made, nothing agreed, and **there is no proof that SISU ever intend to actually do anything they promise**.

* Liquidation is a very real possibility now. We almost expect it. And then our beloved CCFC will be no more.

To summarise, the board expects home fans to travel a 70 mile round trip to every home game. Due to the share, at least 13 ""home"" games have been moved to Sundays or Friday nights, due to Northampton having their own games. Season tickets were only put on sale yesterday, and no kit has been announced. So for a whole summer, not a penny has come into our club from any fans.

Clearly, we aren't agreeing with this, and the fans have protested throughout the summer. A petition with more than 20000 signatures has been totally ignored. Calls for official meetings between SISU and our Supporter's Trust, who represent the fans, have been rejected without consideration. Today, a march was held through the city, my pictures of which are here: http://imgur.com/a/EXn8a. 

The diversity in the people present today was amazing, it shows that football is part of people of all types, and our club is being ruined by heartless businessmen and women with no idea of what it means to so many.

It has been made clear to the club that the majority of fans **will not travel**. Our ""Diamond Club"", compromising fans with 50+ years of continued support, have announced not a single member will travel. For many of these older people, they may have seen their last ever Coventry game. Younger children will now not be able to see their heroes, and a whole generation of fans may well be lost. 

We had fans of AFC Wimbledon joining us today, to whom we are so grateful. They've been through an even worse situation, and their support made us so happy. I must admit, the reception their attendance got when it was announced in the first speech of the march brought a lump to my throat. Statements were read out from other Supporter's Trusts, as varied as Liverpool to Birmingham City, supporting our cause. Thank you from the bottoms of our Sky Blue hearts to everyone who has done so. Rivalries were put aside, and the love of the game united fans from across the country.

I'm fairly sure I'll have missed some crucial information, and I'm very sorry, but so much has happened that it's all so confusing. Please AMA in the comments if clarification is needed.

Thank you to all who have read my post. We're all so disillusioned that we're not sure what we can do any more, but just know that we have to keep fighting, and never give up on our club. Awareness is the key, and we want everyone to know the terrible things that can happen when sport becomes a business. Part of my life, my first love, and that of many others, is being disregarded. I hope such a thing never happens to any of your clubs, as we all know how much the game means to us.

He threw out ""not enough scoring"" line, and I got nerdy with it.  Thought some others might find the actual stats interesting.

2011-2012 regular season games only:

EPL

 * 1066 goals
 * 380 matches
 * 2.81 goals per match

NFL

 * 1259 TDs
 * 256 games
 * 4.9 TDs per game

Now factor in real time per game viewing length:

 * NFL:  3 hours, 7 minutes = 187 minutes
 * EPL:  1 hr, 51 minutes = 111 minutes

So, scoring in real time:

 * NFL:  187/4.9 = 38.16. A touchdown every 38 minutes of real time.
 * EPL: 111/2.81 = 39.50.  A goal every 39 minutes of real time.

Basically the same rate.  This leaves out field goals, but fuck those anyway.  Go ahead and throw out the ""not enough scoring"" argument against soccer.  Only difference is length of the game and giving 1 for a goal instead of 6 for a touchdown.

Footnotes:

NFL time:  ""Through the first seven weeks of the 2011 season, the average NFL game time was 3 hours, 6 minutes and 58 seconds, says league spokesman Dan Masonson.""

**What was expected of him:** After making his first appearance for Brazil at just 18 years of age, the enormous striker only had to wait another eight months before he got a big money transfer to Italian giants Internazionale. Upon leaving Flamengo he was quickly compared to the then-injured Ronaldo, who was still on Inter's books. It seemed that nothing could stop Adriano from becoming perhaps the greatest striker of his generation. His lightning quick pace and six foot three, hulking frame meant there were very few arguments. An exceptional header of the ball, and with a rocket of a left foot, Adriano was seemingly the complete package.

**What the world got:** His first six months with Inter bore little fruit, with just 1 goal in 14 games. Come January 2002, he found himself on loan to troubled A.C. Fiorentina, who would finish the season both relegated and bankrupt. However, with 6 goals in 15 games, Adriano did as much as anybody that year to try and save the team. At the tender age of 20, the Brazilian had begun to showcase his ability to the wider world. When the season ended, Parma paid Inter almost £7,000,000 to co-own Adriano. This would spark the beginning of his Golden Era, as he quickly formed a world-class partnership with Romanian team-mate Adrian Mutu. His first season with Parma saw him score 17 goals in 31 appearances, with his strike partner grabbing 22 in 36, helping the club to 5th place in Serie A, and just four points away from Champions League qualification. 

Chelsea's billions saw Adrian Mutu leave the team in the summer of 2003, and there were fears Adriano would be unable to replicate the form he'd shown during his first season at Parma without his partner. These fears were wide of the mark, as Italian forward Alberto Gilardino quickly stepped up to the mark. The Biellesi striker would finish the 2003/04 season with 26 goals to his name, but Adriano found himself back at Inter in January 2004 after 9 goals in 13 games. The Nerazzurri had decided Adriano's development was sufficient, and they bought out Parma's ownership stake for £16,000,000. He was quickly put into the starting line-up, and handed the #10 shirt. Adriano flourished playing alongside the likes of Christian Vieri, Alvaro Recoba, and Julio Cruz, helping himself to 12 goals in 18 games during the final five months of the season, taking him to a total of 21 in 31 for both Parma and Inter during the 2003/04 season.

It was around this time that Adriano really proved himself as an International quality footballer. 25 goals for Brazil in 35 games between 2003 and 2006 saw his stock rise considerably, and his performances during the 2004/05 season at club level were by far the best of his career. 28 goals in 42 games for Inter saw Chelsea apparently ready to offer £70,000,000 for his services, before Mourinho opted to bring Hernan Crespo back from Italy to compete with Didier Drogba, then later signing Andriy Shevchenko.

Adriano was rewarded for his performances with a new contract in September 2005, and it was at this point that things began to go wrong for him. After the death of his father in August 2004, Adriano spent the majority of his time drinking and partying, something which he would later be criticized for after a poor showing at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, along with Ronaldinho. With his body starting to decline, and his powers waning, the 2005/06 season was the beginning of the end for Adriano. 18 goals in 47 games for Inter wasn't good enough by his own standards, and he would only score a further 12 goals for Inter over the next three seasons, albeit with six months of that spent on loan to Sao Paulo. Adriano was released by Internazionale in April 2009, and spent the next four years drifting between various Brazilian clubs, and taking in a forgotten spell at A.S. Roma.

Now, at just 31 years of age, Adriano has been without a club since being let go by boyhood team Flamengo in November 2012. A man who was supposed to lead his country to World Cup titles, and his club to UEFA Champions League trophies now serves as a cautionary tale to young footballers.

**Match Commentary**

GIFs courtesy [/u/TomasRoncero](http://www.reddit.com/user/TomasRoncero)

[](//#whistle) **KICKOFF**

2': [](//#ball) **GOAL FRED BRAZIL 1-0** What a start! A cross from Hulk leads to a scramble in the box, and the ball falls to Fred who, though lying on the ground, manages to lift it over Casillas.  **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/ibvoTDL5sC5iBH.gif)**

6': Brazil are attacking quickly when they have the ball and pressing hard without. They look a very confident side.

7': Spain begin to settle into their passing rhythm, and a shout for penalty! Luiz fails to clear Mata's cross and the ball hits Marcelo in the hand. It was at his side, probably a good no call from Kuipers.

9': Oscar screws a decent chance wide from 15 yards.  Neither defense is looking solid, but what did we expect?

11': Paulinho attempts an audacious chip, and it is heading right for the top of the goal - Iker can only parry with one hand.

13': Spain are frustrated by Brazil's pressure, and crossing balls into the box with Torres as the lone striker.  Nothing doing.

15': [](//#yellow) Handbags! Brazil break and Neymar is tripped up by Arbeloa on the halfway line. Brazil demand a red card for denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity, but he was 60 yards out.  Lots of shoving and yelling in the center circle. **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/iNj3ZyCnwtbFo.gif)**

19': Iniesta launches an absolute rocket from 35 yards, and Julio Cesar gets down to save!  Torres heads the resulting corner just over the bar.

21': Spain settling into possession, but not quite looking comfortable.  Oscar then body-checks Busquets, but he made too much of it.  No card.

25': Brazil are still looking more dangerous and attacking fluidly.  Dani Alves finds Fred, who hooks a shot very wide.

26': Two penalty shouts in quick succession: Spain launch another ball into the box, and Torres goes down from Thiago Silva.  Nothing given, then on the counter a few more yellow shirts fall needlessly in the box.

28': [](//#yellow) Oscar goes down VERY easily right outside of the box, and Ramos is penalized.  The top comment seems very prescient.  With the free-kick in a very inviting position, Hulk launches it high and wide.

32': Spain with a few corners that come to nothing, and once again Brazil break with speed and fluidity.  Neymar works Fred into a one-on-one position, but his shot is straight at Casillas.  He then heads way off from the resulting corner - he really is much more comfortable in the six-yard box, isn't he?

36': Spain continue to work triangles and flicks, but they cannot seem to work the ball into the box as Brazil hold firm.  Iniesta's magic works a free kick at an angle, but Brazil clear confidently.

41': **WHAT A PLAY DAVID LUIZ** The Spainiards break, as Mata finds Pedro completely unmarked.  His shot beats Cesar, but the Chelsea defender sprints over to clear the ball off the line with a slide.  That speed is why he's in the side. **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/irwJ0y5vUBql7.gif)**

43': Fred crosses into the box with Neymar unmarked, but his ball is straight to Casillas.

44': [](//#ball) **GOAL NEYMAR BRAZIL 2-0** Brilliant from Neymar, who runs the ball up to the D, lays off the ball to Oscar, makes sure he's onside, and in a delayed one-two gets past Arbeloa to finish high and left of Casillas.  What a goal. **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/iyudOBAItYpmF.gif)**

---

[](//#whistle) **HALFTIME BRAZIL 2-0 SPAIN**
Spain may be edging possession, but Brazil are pressing hard, breaking up play, and wheeling away on the counter. A very intense and massively entertaining first half. Can Spain find an answer? Should Spain send Cesc or Villa on right away?  Silva, Navas, Cazorla, an injured Soldado... lots of options.

POSSESSION

41% Brazil - Spain 59%

---
**Second Half**

[](//#whistle) **KICKOFF** 

[](//#sub)As we all hoped, Azpi is on for Arbeloa.

47': [](//#ball) **GOAL FRED BRAZIL 3-0** A wonderfully worked goal, as Neymar flicks Marcelo's pass to Fred on his left, who then shoots perfectly through the legs of Azpi and around Casillas to finish at the far post.  Doesn't seem to matter who is at right-back. **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/ixmPGscTiDbU3.gif)**

52': [](//#sub) Jesus Navas is on for Mata, and Pedro moves over to the left flank.

54': **PENALTY TO SPAIN** Navas makes an instant impact, as he is brought down by Marcelo.  A poor foul to give away, as he was going nowhere.  Certainly a bit of embellishment by the Spaniard as well.

55': **PENALTY MISSED BY SERGIO RAMOS** Oh dear, it's wide left. I think if it were on target Cesar had it saved anyway.  For me Xavi takes that... **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/i7sz71fnAVydi.gif)**

58': Fred is away on his own, but Iker is out quickly and blocks the shot from outside the eighteen.

59': [](//#sub) Last roll of the dice for del Bosque, as Villa comes on for Torres.

62': Fred has Neymar in the box, but once again his angle is too tight, and his shot-cum-cross can only find the side netting.

63': It's such a cliche, but Spain need to try something else.  Kicking it about comfortably in Brazil's half of the pitch, but they are blocked or intercepted every time they try to enter the danger zone.

68': [](//#red) **RED CARD GERARD PIQUE** For the umpteenth time tonight, Spain lose the ball at the top of the box, and as Brazil counter Pique hacks down a lightning-quick Neymar as he breaks through towards goal. This was coming. **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/ibrP1c4tNoFg8C.gif)**

70' The Maracana, which has been as loud as a fighter jet all day, is already celebrating.  Spain look frustrated, and Brazil may be looking for another goal or two.

72': [](//#sub) Jadson gets a runout as Hulk comes off.

77': The match has reached a snail's pace as exhaustion sets in.  Spain are standing around the pitch in possession.  Then Neymar breaks, but Fred is too far offside to provide any help and so he is forced to take a tame shot.

79': [](//#sub) Fred won't get his hat-trick, but he won't care.  Jo comes on, as all Manchester City fans watch with jaws agape.

80': Pedro with a good shot! Julio Cesar makes a great save, diving to his left.

82': And Jo announces himself, getting off a hard shot destined for the far corner, but Casillas is well-positioned to make an easy save.  While trying to play it out from the back Spain almost invite a fourth.

86': Out of nowhere, Spain fashion a good chance. Navas launches a cross into orbit that hones in onto Villa in the box, who makes enough room to curl a shot into the far corner - but Cesar makes an acrobatic save.

88': [](//#sub) Hernanes comes on for Paulinho in the final change of the evening.

90': Brazil are finally happy to kick the ball about as the Maracana is about to explode.

[](//#whistle) **FULL TIME BRAZIL 3-0 SPAIN** 

---

**BRAZIL WIN THE 2013 CONFEDERATIONS CUP**

Brazil, who have won the tournament three times in a row, come out deserved winners in a result that few predicted.  Neymar goes straight to Iniesta at the final whistle - they're friends now, right?

1371147079.0,973,self.soccer,1ga6t8,"Footballers who were over-hyped, blew it, or lost control: #4 Nicolas Anelka",1373,400,347,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ga6t8/footballers_who_were_overhyped_blew_it_or_lost/,"**Nicolas Anelka**

**What was expected of him:** A strong, pacy, precocious teenager who burst onto the scene following his £500,000 transfer to Arsenal in 1997, Nicolas Anelka was viewed as the best attacking prospect in European football at the time. An explosive two years with the Gunners saw Real Madrid spend £22,300,000 on the French striker, who was still just 20 years old. Part of a generation of superb, young, French footballers, which included Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet, and Willy Sagnol, Nicolas Anelka was projected to be the man who would lead the line, and turn France into the dominant footballing nation during the 2000's.

**What the world got:** Nobody would ever claim that Nicolas Anelka has had an unsuccessful career, with his trophy cabinet being something most footballers only ever dream of. 4 league winner's medals, 3 FA Cups, a UEFA Champions League winner, and part of the French Euro 2000 winning side, Anelka certainly has the silverware of a champion. However, how much more could he have won, but for his attitude?

After making 12 appearances for Paris Saint-Germain between 1996 and 1997, scoring just the solitary goal, Arsene Wenger saw something he liked in the young Frenchman. He brought him to Arsenal in February 1997 and carefully prepared him for the 1997/98 season. Scoring his first goal for the Gunners against Manchester United at Highbury, Anelka seized his opportunity after an injury to Ian Wright, and established himself in the Arsenal first-team. 9 goals from 40 games in his first full season at the club, and winning the Double, gave some hint towards the player that was to come. The following year, the Frenchman scored 19 goals in 46 games, at just 19 years of age.

This was more than enough to convince Real Madrid that Nicolas Anelka was the real deal. With Anelka wanting a better contract, and fans branding him ""Le Sulk"", the summer of 1999 saw the Spanish giants purchase Anelka for £22,300,000, giving Arsenal a profit of £21,800,000. This was to become one of the first great sales by Arsene Wenger, as he would continue to make a habit of generating profit for the club through his transfer dealings.

As Arsenal quickly replaced Anelka with Thierry Henry, Real Madrid set about trying to reclaim the La Liga title from Barcelona with Raul, Fernando Morientes and Anelka in attack. Early in the season however, manager John Toshack was replaced by Vicente del Bosque, and Anelka's personal problems began to show. After refusing to train, he was suspended for 45 days, before redeeming himself towards the end of the campaign with 2 goals in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals against Bayern Munich. Real went on to win the final, beating Valencia 3-0, with Anelka playing 80 minutes, but the damage had already been done. 7 goals in 33 games for Real Madrid wasn't what Los Blancos fans had expected.

Anelka's performances were, though, enough to get him a place in the France squad for Euro 2000, and he started their first two group games. Substitute appearances in the third group game and quarter-final were followed by a start in the semi-final, as France beat Portugal 2-1 after extra-time. After failing to score in any of his previous 5 games in the tournament, Anelka was benched for the final in favour of Thierry Henry and Christophe Dugarry. France would win the final via a David Trezeguet Golden-Goal, and Anelka had another major honour to add to his rapidly growing collection.

Following the tournament, Paris Saint-Germain bid £20,000,000 for their former player, and Madrid snapped their fingers off. A return to France helped bring out some of the old Anelka, as he scored 13 in 37 in his first season back in France, playing alongside Jay-Jay Okocha and Laurent Robert. The following season, with Ronaldinho in the team, Anelka managed just 5 goals from 20 appearances before being loaned to Liverpool in January 2002.

His time in Liverpool wasn't filled with goals, only 5 in 22 games, but his work-rate and clever play allowed Liverpool's Michael Owen to have one of his best season in front of goal, and his effort was much appreciated by the Anfield crowd. Anelka helped Liverpool to, at that time, their highest ever standing in the Premier League, as they finished runners-up to Anelka's former team, Arsenal. At the end of the season though, Gerard Houllier decided not to sign Anelka on a permanent deal, instead bringing in El Hadji Diouf from RC Lens. The following year, Liverpool dropped to 5th, and many stated that the decision not to sign Anelka may have been the reason.

Once it became clear Liverpool wouldn't be signing him, Anelka instead moved to Manchester City for £13,000,000. Kevin Keegan's team had just won promotion to the Premier League, and planned to build their attack around the Frenchman. Anelka's time with City is perhaps seen as him at his best, and in his first season with the club he scored 14 league goals to help them finish 9th in the league. The following season, they finished 16th, despite his 24 goals in 43 games. By the time January 2005 had rolled around, Manchester City decided to sell up, after Anelka expressed a desire in the summer of 2004 not to return to England at all. He'd converted to Islam, and after originally deciding that he wanted a move to the United Arab Emirates, he instead got a move to Turkish club Fenerbahce for £7,000,000 after two and a half years, and 45 goals for Manchester City.

Anelka spent only 18 months in Turkey, helping Fenerbahce to a league title in his first season, and grabbing 16 goals in total during his time there. A move to Bolton Wanderers followed in the summer of 2006, when Sam Allardyce splashed out a club record £8,000,000 on the striker. Anelka quickly got back into the swing of English football, and Bolton were rewarded with 12 goals from 39 games in his debut season with the Wanderers. The following season, he'd scored 11 in 22 before Chelsea came calling during the January transfer window, paying £15,000,000 for him. Anelka's first season at Chelsea was filled with near-misses, and some would say, on an individual level, it was a complete disaster. Finishing the campaign with just 2 goals in 24 games, Anelka was also part of the Chelsea team which narrowly missed out on both the Premier League, and UEFA Champions League trophies in 2008. 

With the scores level at 1-1, Anelka was substituted onto the pitch in Moscow 10 minutes into extra-time, in place of Joe Cole. Unable to find the net, the teams prepared for penalties, and after manager Avram Grant asked which players wanted to take a spot-kick, Anelka didn't raise his hand. In ordinary circumstances, this is fine, but with the teams level after 6 penalties each, Chelsea were fast running out of willing participants. After Ryan Giggs took, and scored, Manchester United's seventh from the spot, Anelka had little choice but to take one himself. Needing to score to keep Chelsea in with a hope, he followed a short run-up with a poor kick, and his shot was at the perfect height for goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar to parry away.

Despite a bad start to his Chelsea career, the following season was Anelka's best in front of goal, as he scored 25 in all competitions, and finished as the Premier League's top scorer. He spent another two and a half years at the London club, helping them to a Premier League title and 2 FA Cups, but the majority of his playing time saw him out-wide in order to incorporate Didier Drogba. 

Anelka headed to the World Cup, for the first time, with France in 2010. After a poor Euro 2008 for the side, France stumbled through the World Cup qualifiers, and controversially won the World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. Anelka had scored the winner in the 1st leg, but it took a Thierry Henry handball to see France through the tie. Desperate for success, and hoping to go one better than the previous tournament, where they finished runner-up to the Italians, France couldn't afford any slip-ups. It wasn't to be, with almost everything going wrong for the French team. An opening draw with Uruguay was followed by a 2-0 defeat to Mexico. After the game, it emerged Anelka had reacted badly to the French manager's criticism of him at half-time, and reported told Coach Domenech ""Go fuck yourself, dirty son of a whore."" Following this, Anelka was sent home from the tournament early, sparking a mutiny amongst the remaining French players. Once the tournament ended, with France out at the group stage, Anelka was hit with an 18 match international ban, which wouldn't matter anyway, as Anelka decided to retire from international football.

After 184 games and 59 goals for the Blues, Anelka left for Shanghai Shenhua in the Chinese Super League. After Anelka and team-mate Alex apparently requested transfers from Chelsea in November 2011, manager Andre Villas-Boas banned him from the first-team changing rooms and car park, and forced him to train with the youth team.

A salary of around £200,000 a week in China wasn't enough to help Anelka settle, and after just one season and 3 goals, he left the club after an angry exchange with a fan, when he refused to bow to the Shanghai supporters. Amidst rumours that the Chinese club hadn't paid wages to their stars, Anelka moved to Juventus in January 2013, playing only 2 league games (and 41 minutes) during their Serie A winning season.

Nicolas Anelka's career took in 10 different clubs, in 6 seperate countries, but he never developed into the truly world-class footballer he was seemingly destined to become during his time at Arsenal. 14 goals for his country puts him far behind many of the French forwards he competed with during his time at the top, with Thierry Henry, his replacement at Arsenal, becoming the country's leading scorer with 51 goals. David Trezeguet scored 34 goals, and Sylvain Wiltord bagged 26. He may have a bulging trophy cabinet, but it's important to remember how good Anelka was expected to become. He broke through around the same time as Michael Owen and Thierry Henry, yet was seen by many as the biggest prospect of them all after his performances with Arsenal.

His career total is 204 goals from 646 appearances at club level, and he only ever finished one season (2003/04) with an average of a goal every two games; often seen as the mark of a truly great striker. A Premier League Golden Boot, and the PFA Young Player of the Year award, are the best individual honours he managed, and he was nominated only once for the Ballon d'Or, gaining 0 votes. The majority of professionals would be ecstatic with these accolades, and there are some who will always claim Anelka was a great player. On his day, he certainly was, but he was expected to become so much more. His petulant attitude and maddening inconsistency cost him a truly glittering career.

**1’** [](//#whistle-big) [And here we go...](http://www.elevenwarriors.com/sites/default/files/images/users/Dr.%20House/AndHereWeGo.gif) 

**7'** Reus makes a brilliant run, and López dives and saves it right into the path of Lewandowski, but the Polish striker can't get his shot away.

**8'** [](//#ball-big) **GOOOOOOOOAL!!!** [This time Lewandowski does get his shot away!!  Götze with the assist! The home side have the lead!](http://i.minus.com/iXJnlKgYE9Rkq.gif)

**8' Borussia Dortmund 1-0 Real Madrid**

**20'** Xabi Alonso is playing unlike himself, misplacing many passes. Dortmund look comfortable when Madrid have the ball, and Gündogan already having a stormer of a game, closing down Madrid quite well.  

**23'** Free Kick, quite a ways out, but Cristiano Ronaldo will have a go...... and.... On target! Weidenfeller pushes it away! 

**26'** Another Free kick outside the edge of the area. Xabi Alonso to take... and cleared by Lewandowski! Dortmund hits on the counter, but Coentrão cuts the final ball out to save Madrid! 

**29'** You can see Madrid's game plan here, as they win their 3rd free kick on the left side of the pitch. Free kick punched away by Weidenfeller, then collected. 

**32'** Błaszczykowski gets away from Coentrão brilliantly, but of all people, Higuaín tracks him all the way into the box and dives in to steal the ball and wins a goal kick!

**43'** HUGE NON-PENALTY CALL! Varane loses his footing and Reus runs into the box, and goes down, but its not given! At the other end, Higuaín sprints on to a loose ball, and CRISTIANO RONALDO GOOOOOOOALLLLLLL!

**43'** [](//#ball-big) **GOOOOOOOOALLLL** [Cristiano Ronaldo! Served on a plate by Higuaín after capitalizing on a Hummels error!](http://i.minus.com/iGR1TQpFM6WRB.gif)

**43' Borussia Dortmund 1-1 Real Madrid**

**45'** 1 minute of added stoppage time. 

**45+1'** [](//#whistle-big) The ref blows for the first half as boos ring around the stadium. Massive controversy leading up to the Madrid goal, where Dortmund fans felt they should have had a penalty seconds before Madrid's equalizer!


____________________________

**First Half Notes:**

* Cristiano Ronaldo has now scored 6 goals in Champions League Semi-finals, the most of any player. 

* Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 12 goals in this Champions League, only Messi has netted more in a season in all history (14 in the 11/12). 

* Ronaldo has matched Marouane Chamakh and Burak Yilmaz by scoring in six consecutive Champions League games. Streak.

*  That goal from Cristiano Ronaldo is his half-century of goals in the competition. Only four players have previously reached 50: Raúl González, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry. Esteemed company indeed. (Why does everything have to be about Ronaldo, today?!)

* After 17 slo-mo replays from 492 different angles, can't agree on whether it was a penalty, Best to lay off the ref.

Match Start:

10' Very lively start for both teams, no major chances yet

15' Man U starting to pile on a bit of pressure in RM 30, Jose Mourinho chants are heard throughout  the stadium

18' Nani piles on pressure, Varane cool as cucumber

19'  Evra picks up the first yellow of the match for a cynical foul 

**21' GOALPOST** hit by Man U from corner!!!!!!! Vidic hits the post, ball rebounds  and then saved by RM goalie with his nutsack right on goal line!!! http://i.minus.com/iWVhzj0WkF9qi.gif

33' GOAL! NOT COUNTED! Ramos fouls on corner with his elbow!

34' Lopez 2 fantastic saves on counter attack from Man U!!!!!!!!!!!

36' Arbeloa studs up challenge yellow

42' Di Maria looks to have a hamstring injury, Kaka is on

**Half Time:** Energetic first 40 minutes, Man U playing a deep backline, both teams having decent chances  at opposing goals, Man U having better ones

SCORE NIL - NIL (1 - 1 aggregate, Man U leading on away goals rule)

**48' GOAL MAN U!!**

!!!!!! RM leads!**

1 - 2 ( 2 - 3  agg)

72' YELLOW CARD! Kaka follows Carrick into the book shortly afterwards for a foul on Evra.

86' Valencia on....how the mighty have fallen... one of best wingers of last season is on so late

1335874396.0,917,self.soccer,t1f1k,"Why European Soccer is the Most ""American"" of Sports",1312,395,832,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/t1f1k/why_european_soccer_is_the_most_american_of_sports/,"There's a subset of American society that vehemently hates soccer. To each his own, but I have to admit that I am bothered from time to time by the level of vitriol.  I was reminded of this today when [Deadspin](http://deadspin.com/espn/) ran a story that quoted numerous tweets from people that were beside themselves that soccer was playing on ESPN (vs ESPN2 or Deportes). ESPN plays plenty of programming I don't like, especially in the middle of the day, and I just choose not to watch it at those times. But these people seem legitimately angry about it.

Not to make this political, but I think part of this stems from the disdain preached by those in the right wing media toward soccer.  For example, here is [Glenn Beck](http://www.epltalk.com/glenn-beck-hates-soccer-and-the-world-cup-20799) talking about the 2010 World Cup:

“I don’t get the baseball thing, but the soccer thing, I hate it so much — probably because the rest of the world likes it so much, and they riot over it, and they continually try to jam it down our throat… It doesn’t matter how you sell it to us. It doesn’t matter how many celebrities you get. It doesn’t matter how many bars open early. It doesn’t matter how many beer commercials they run. We don’t want the World Cup. We don’t like the World Cup. We don’t like soccer. We want nothing to do with it. You can package it any way — you can spend all kinds of money. You can force it on our television sets. We will not enjoy the World Cup.” 

Let's start by ignoring the factual inaccuracy of the above given the [ratings](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/sports/soccer/29sandomir.html) were exceptional as the USA round of 16 game vs Ghana exceeded those of the World Series despite time zone differentials, etc., There's more going on here. There's a segment of American society that I believe have probably never watched a game, but reject soccer outright because it is somehow ""Foreign"" or ""European"" or ""Immigrant.""

The point I would make is these same people continually espouse free market capitalism and rail against the ""elites,"" but European club soccer better reflects these ideals, and the ""American"" sports they love more closely resemble their view of ""Europe.""

*In American sports, failure is rewarded. The primary means by which this is accomplished is the draft.  The worse you do, the earlier you pick, and therefore presumably are rewarded with better new players. In European soccer, there is no draft and it is up to each club to develop / acquire its own talent.

*In American sports, there are a group of ""Elites"" that dictate rules and regulate all aspects of the sport: Salary caps, luxury taxes, max contracts, minimum contracts, trade exceptions, caps on cash used in trades, matching of player salaries in trades, etc. Not in Europe. You want a player? Buy him. Want to get rid of a player? Sell him. No need to work out a complex trade with another team, ensuring that the salaries are approximately equal as in the NBA.

*The NFL is socialist! (gasp!) 32 teams that all share revenue.

*Relegation. In the US, a team like the Pirates can suck for decades and still make money. Not in Europe. Europe has relegation and promotion. What is more American (in Glenn Beck's, etc. view) than that? Survival of the fittest!

**TL;DR** I find it interesting that those on the right that denigrate soccer fail to realize that its business model / regulatory framework much more closely matches their view of ""American Capitalism"" while the American sports they love more closely resemble their view of ""European Socialism.""",,False,,t5_2qi58,False,,arsenal,True,t3_t1f1k,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/t1f1k/why_european_soccer_is_the_most_american_of_sports/,

There are so many fans on this subreddit from many countries. And it's not always easy to go to the game. Sometimes you have to buy ""fan card"" you cannot buy ticket at the gate, there are some problems.

I know that most of you are either from England or USA, but it would be helpful even for you if you'd ever come to Eastern Europe etc. Cause i know that if you're not gonna meet someone nice you're not gonna get to f.e. Legia Warsaw stadium and have good seats etc. 

That's really another thing. To choose were to go on stadium. There are so many aspects of watching game live on the stadium that i am sure we could help each other out. Even if you're going cause your team is playing in Kazachstan (looking at you Celtic fans) you might get some insight from Kazach that will help you out how to enjoy your time best for those few hours before game.

What do you think guys?

EDIT: So here it is: http://www.reddit.com/r/footballtourists/  

Please subscribe. And help. Cause without you guys there's no point of doing this. I will love to help anyone buying tickets in Poland and stuff. But this do not have a point without guys from whole world working on this. If there is anyone that would be interested in helping with moderation it would be awesome if you'd write to me about that.

He became quite famous last year when, approached by a team mate who offered him 200 thousands euros to fix a match, he rejected the offer AND denounced his team mate to the authorities. The investigations on that episode resulted in the huge match fixing scandal that involved many Serie B teams and players.

At the time Simone Farina was praised in the newspapers for his courage, Prandelli called him to play a match for Italy, Blatter even game him a [special award](http://www.fifa.com/ballondor/photo/156/649/3/picture.html#1566493). Now, just 6 months later, he's unemployed. His contract with his former club Gubbio has expired and not a single club approached him with an offer.

Of course it might be that he's just not a good player, but it's quite a coincidence that after 12 years of career this is the first time he can't find a team.

Highlights from a big match will come up on the screen and the anchors will immediately shift gears into this stupid schtick where they deliberately butcher all the foreign-sounding names and make lots of dumb jokes about how they don't know what's going on or who any of the teams are. But who gives a shit, amirite? It's soccer, nobody cares about this sport! 

Seriously, they get all fired up by ""amazing"" baseball plays that get recreated 100 times a week, but when 2 great bicycle goals somehow make it into the highlights in the same day the anchors automatically deem the second one redundant. You can almost sense them making wanking gestures off-camera. Does this attitude annoy the absolute fuck out of anyone else? 

Edit: Wow, pretty massive feedback, nice to know I'm not alone. And to those of you who have gone on vitriolic counter-rants against me for watching ESPN in the first place, stop taking it so seriously, cause I'm not. When I happen to be home in the afternoon (read: most useless time of the day for TV) I either watch ESPN or a 24/7 news channel if there are no live sports on.

**Subs**:


**Injury News:**

* John O'Shea has been out since 8 May with a leg problem.

* Darren Fletcher played 90 minutes for the first time since 1 March against Blackpool. The midfielder has been suffering from a virus and has otherwise been restricted to two substitute appearances.

* Anders Lindegaard has been out of first-team action since early March with a knee problem.

**Team UEFA News:**

* Manchester United are riding a 12-game unbeaten streak in this year's edition of the Champions League.

* Edwin Van der Sar will make his 99th overall appearance in the competition on Saturday.

* The Red Devils have conceded only four goals in the tournament.

* Alex Ferguson's side have reached their third CL final in the last four years.

* United succumbed to a 2-0 defeat against Barca in the 2009 final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

Aged 37 years and 148 days, he surpassed the record of Filippo Inzaghi, who was 37 years and 86 days when he registered for AC Milan against Real Madrid CF on Matchday 4.

* Should Edwin van der Sar feature and United win, the Dutchman would become the oldest player to appear in a UEFA Champions League final victory, aged 40 years 211 days. Paolo Maldini was 38 years 332 days when AC Milan defeated Liverpool FC in the 2007 final.

**UEFA Champions League statistics**

* United have conceded four goals, the joint lowest total in the competition along with FC Rubin Kazan, who were eliminated after the group stage. AFC Ajax (1996) and Arsenal FC (2006) conceded two en route to the final.

Ajax (1971/72, 1994/95), Liverpool (1980/81, 1983/84), and Milan (1988/89, 1993/94) have also been unbeaten champions twice previously.

* Maxwell (groin, 23 April to 15 May) and Adriano (thigh, 20 April to 21 May) are back in action, as is Éric Abidal, who had a liver tumour removed on 17 March before returning for the semi-final second leg against Real Madrid.

* Martín Montoya's first start for Barcelona against Real Sociedad on 30 April lasted 14 minutes as he broke his collarbone and dislocated a shoulder. Gabriel Milito tore a thigh muscle in the same game but is back in training.

**Team News &amp; Stats:**

* Barcelona have scored the most goals in this season's Champions League (27).

* The Catalans have faced Manchester United 10 times in European play. Their record against the English outfit is: W3 D4 L3.

1373911868.0,748,self.soccer,1icrfu,[GUIDE] Mexican League.,994,246,407,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1icrfu/guide_mexican_league/,"The Mexican League (Known since 2012 as the **Liga MX**) is one of the most popular and followed leagues outside of Europe. The league is currently ranked number 11 in the world and number 10 in the last decade (2001–2010) by the IFFHS. Many players in recent years have left the Mexican League and have gone to play in Europe. In this self post I will attempt to address some of the aspects of the league that are usually confusing for foreigners and I will try to go over each team and do a little write up on each one.

The Apertura 2013 Tournament starts this Friday.

**Apertura and Clausura**

The Liga MX uses a short tournament format. What this means is that there are 2 champions every year, one for the summer (Apertura) and one for the winter (Clausura). This format was established in 1996 in order to maintain interest in the league during the winter and to have playoffs twice a year. There are 18 teams in the Liga MX, that means that teams face each other once and at the end of the tournament the top 8 teams in the Liga make playoffs.

In the playoffs teams are seeded 1-8 and face each other over two legs (home and away). In case of a tie the team with the away goal advantage goes through, if no team scored an away goal, the team with the better position on the table goes through. Things are a bit different for the final as neither the away goal advantage or position in the table counts. In case of a tie the two teams will have to play extra time and penalites (if needed).


**Copa MX**

Not much to add here, just a Cup Competition between teams in the first and second divisions, Similar to the Capital One Cup in England. The Current reigning champions are Cruz Azul.


**Relegation and Promotion** 

Relegation is way different from what they do in Europe. The Liga MX uses an average point system, what this means is that teams are rated over a period of 3 years based on a simple formula:

Points Earned/Games Played.

This system was implemented to protect teams who have a bad season and to stop them from dissapearing due to the massive payout disparity  between the first and the second divisions.

Promotion is also a bit different. Teams in the second division also play two tournaments per year, the winner of each short tournament qualifies for a playoff and the winner gets promoted to the first division. Teams that are promoted to the first division have only 1 year to bring their point average up in order to avoid relegation.

**Transfers** 

The transfer window for players already in the Liga MX is open for only 2 days during a period known as *the draft.*, however teams are allowed to negotiate with players prior to the draft. Every year after the season is over each team publishes a list of players deemed surplus known as the *transferibles* (transfer listed). Players who are transfer listed must find a team during the draft or sit out the whole season.

Players are not allowed to leave on a free, so even after their contract is up they must have permission from their team in case they want to move to another Liga MX team.

The transfer window for transactions involving foreign teams is open from July to September.

**The Teams**
Due to the character limit, the team's descriptions will be in the comments.

No, it doesn't boast the same cohesive, tactical buildup play of La Liga and other European leagues. No, it's not about to start churning out loads of international superstars that can compete on the world cup stage.

However, I must admit, certain aspects of the American game shows signs of stark improvement. The finishing, especially, is bold, inventive, and technically sophisticated. This point is evidenced by the many long-distance finesse shots, sharp precision headers, and quality long crosses.

In short, I honestly believe the US is on its way...",,False,,t5_2qi58,False,,man-utd,True,t3_wnbf1,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/wnbf1/it_has_come_to_my_attention_that_the_mls_is/,

**Match Events**

**4 USA : Germany 3**

--------------------------------------

1' [](//#clock-big) Let the Game Begin! Anpfiff!

2'  Chance for USMNT! Nice run by Altidore to run between Howedes and Mertesacker. Knocked out for a corner.

6' Germany led Ecuador 2-0 at this point on Wednesday. Good start by US or poor start by Germany?

11'  U.S. dodges a bullet there. Huge chance for Mertesacker. Beasley looked to have gotten fouled.

**13'** [](//#ball-big) Jozy with the volley! First time finish after the cross from Zusi, flawless. USA up 1-0.

**16'** [](//#ball-big) Own goal by Germany. Pressure up top surprises Germany. Ter Stegen with a terrible mistake. USA up 2-0. 

19' Schürrle with the huge run from right to left. Should have put it through. Second huge try by Germany.

20' USA on the attack again. Amazing touch by Jozy to Dempsey. Better save by Ter Stegen, still doesn't quite make up for the OG

24' Close offside for Klose, looked like an easy goal.

38' Corner for Germany, lots of possession middle play. First real chances for a while possibly?

HT [](//#whistle-big) Whistle blows for the half. Germany looking like they brought out their F team. All jokes aside, Germany looked to have better ball control near the end of the half, though not many chances. Obama coming in for the centennial speech, pretty confident statement about us going to Brazil next year.

**52'** [](//#ball-big) Westermann with a easy seemingly unmarked header from the corner kick. Germany finally capitalizes and closes in, USA still up 2-1.

53' Beasley with a great run, poor touch on the finish. Looks to be catching his breath after the head collision.

**59'** [](//#ball-big) Germany back on their heels gives up a huge amount of space. Jozy finds Dempsey on the cross for a simple yet superb one bounce finish. USA up 3-1

**65'** [](//#ball-big)  /r/soccercirclejerk just lost it. Dempsey with the amazing left foot finish from outside the box. USA up 4-1.

67' Maybe it's the humidity (65%), maybe it's the wind speed (11 kmh) but it seems like both teams are easy to let deep runs into their defense. 

**79'** [](//#ball-big) Kruse has been pestering the USA since his substitution. Puts in a beautiful shot from outside the box. USA up 4-2.

**81'** [](//#ball-big) Draxler cleans up a ball for an easy put back. We have ourselves a game 4-3. 

90' Possible penalty on Germany in the box. Howard swoops up a good try.

90' +2 [](//#whistle-big) Final whistle. In a thriller until the end USA gets a 4-3 victory.

- **Purchases**

Mourinho has brought some excellent players, despite having bad fame for previous buys in other teams,  such as Sami Khedira who has become a leading midfielder in the global scene, Essien who came on loan and was critical in surviving 3 competitions and dozens of injuries and Luka Modric who, despite criticisms, has become an integral part to a Madrid team that thrives on midfielders just as much as it does on wingers. 

- **Youth Team**

Despite reports to the contrary, Mourinho has brought about **26 Fabrica** players to debut 16 of which were in official competions (Adán, Nacho, Morata, Álex, Jesé, Casado, Mateos, Jesús, Joselu, Mejías, Mendes, Pacheco, Sarabia, Rodriguez, Cheryshev and Juan Carlos) and 7 who made their debut but were ultimately sold:

Carvajal (Bayer Leverkusen), Joselu (Hoffenheim), Mandi (Sporting), Sarabia (Getafe), Juan Carlos (Betis), Mendes (Sporting de Portugal) and Pablo Gil (Sparta de Praga).

Despite only having Adan, Nacho, Rodriguez and Morata disputing more than 90 minutes, the effort is impacting when compared to recent predecessors at Madrid. 


- **Individual Player Tactics and Extracting Potential**


If there is one player who elevated themselves in large part to Mourinho it would have to be **Marcelo**. He went from a Mourinho snub to a Mourinho favorite quickly and became a regular Brazil and Madrid starter despite having Coentrao to compete with. 

**Essien** is a player who seemingly had his best days behind him and little to look forward to before coming to Madrid, but the Ghanaian on loan has become an integral part of the squad who has been featured in multiple roles as regular *comodin* for the team as it has dealt with issues of form and health. 

**Coentrao** elevated his game out of necessity as Marcelo found himself plagued by injuries in recent times and has managed to become a balanced fullback who is able to exert himself physically in defense but also manages the occasional flash of grace as he pushes upward. 

Tactically, two players have benefited the most from Mourinho’s methods: Ramos and **Cristiano**. Finding himself drowned out in the 9 role under Pelligrini, Cristiano was placed in the winger slot once again as Mourinho determined him to be “too talented” for the 9 hole. The freedom and priority given to the Portuguese star has permitted him to be a Pichichi winner and regular scorer who breaches 40 goals with ease per season under Mourinho. 

**Ramos** came to Madrid as a CB from Sevilla but was eventually shifted to the extremity, a role he was accustomed to with La Roja. Under Mourinho, Ramos has gone from a good Right Back to one of the world’s best Center Backs. His physical dominance coupled with his offensive nature permit Xabi Alonso space to better control the naval and partner Varane and Pepe to alternate in aggressions. He has carried this over to the Roja where he has taken on the role of filling out a difficult role once ran by the mythical Puyol. His pairings with Pique, when successful, have been some of the world’s best in the back line. One could also argue that Mourinho’s clash with captain Iker Casillas has also brought out a more mature man out of Ramos as he has been forced to undertake the role of Captain in recent matches. He has shown more discipline in the area, when he crosses the line he has shown humility with his opponents (Ramos vs. Lewa) afterwards and has been a constant presence pushing the team onward as they have found themselves dozens of times behind the marker. 

- **Tactics in General**

Barcelona seemed unbeatable under Guardiola, but Mourinho managed it more than once. His methods were criticized (Xavi: “El futbol a perdido hoy” pfft) by many, but they were indisputably effective. As time has passed, Mourinho has evolved his scheme from full out defense to a more controlled and precise counter-attacking scheme that mixes both defense and physicality (http://youtu.be/LXfQO3TLfQ4). Physicality… if there is one word to describe this Madrid it would be that word (http://youtu.be/vO8ppE4uChc. 


- **Voicing the Need to Unify the Lower Division Squads Tactically**

He failed in this but he spoke out at the very least and was spot on. To survive year after year without having to rely on 11 foreigners Madrid needs to imitate their rivals and start applying tactics across the board (no Nacho at CB when the #1 asks for him at RB). Despite failing, no one can deny his wisdom in his demand and hopefully the next coach will ask the same thing. 

- **Entertainment**

I hate the fact that with Mourinho, the press, the cameras, and the fans look more at the Portuguese manager than the team at times. But that is just me. Others find it amusing (http://youtu.be/nPmDpzYO2_U), entertaining, and a reason to open up the tabloids, reddit, and the matches. Take this as you will but, regardless, it serves as the perfect segue onto the bad.

**What was expected of him:** The first pick in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft, and signing his first professional contract at the age of 14, Freddy Adu became the youngest American to sign a major league contract in over a century. After tearing apart the youth team of Juventus during an incredibly strong performance with the United States Olympic Development team at 10 years old, Adu joined the IMG Academy in 2002 at the age of 12. The world went crazy over the American soccer player, and after being selected in the 2004 Draft by D.C. United, it seemed like the sky was the limit. A Nike sponsorship deal, and knowing nods from the likes of Pele, led many to believe Freddy Adu would finally be the American superstar who could break ""soccer"" in America.

**What the world got:** The Ghanaian born American, Freddy Adu, showcased incredible talent from a young age, and was rather fortunate to move to the United States in the first place when, at the age of 8, his mother won the Green Card Lottery. Building up a reputation through various youth soccer tournaments, Adu was well on the way to becoming a household name. His performance against Juventus led Internazionale to apparently lodge a £500,000 offer with Adu's mother, who was his agent at the time. She decided, however, that Freddy's development would be best served in the United States, and declined. The very fact that Inter were willing to offer half a million pounds for a 10 year old though, goes some way to suggest what was expected of him.

Adu was selected as the #1 pick by D.C. United in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft, ahead of future US stars Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley, who were chosen 8th and 36th, respectively. Adu made his debut for D.C. in April 2004, at 14 years of age, and scored his first professional goal two weeks later. The buzz around him, however, quickly evaporated as several commentators noted his incredibly small stature and the ease at which older and larger opponents could shrug him off the ball. This was despite the fact that many had raised questions over Adu's true age, with constant speculation that his birth certificate had been faked before his move to the United States, in order for him to get a more thorough education. Whilst he was technically excellent for such a young player, his development was way behind that of his fellow professionals, and it seemed that during all the excitement about his performances against other children, nobody had realised he would be competing with 30 year old, fully-grown men once he was in the MLS. His dribbling was excellent, but there appeared to be no end product, and Adu's stock was beginning to fall. Adu spent time at Manchester United in the summer of 2006, but Sir Alex Ferguson opted not to make an offer, deciding that the American wasn't good enough for the Red Devil's youth team. After 12 goals in 99 games as a deep-forward for D.C. United, Adu was traded to Real Salt Lake in late 2006. 

Still only 16, it seemed his career was already faltering. 1 goal (a penalty) in 11 games for Real wasn't what was expected, but it didn't stop S.L. Benfica from spending £1,250,000 in order to secure his services. They too quickly realised that Adu wasn't ready for first-team football, and decided to let him mature slowly, and to develop his talent over time. Things didn't work out that way for Adu, and after manager Fernando Santos left the club just 1 game into the season, it seemed Adu's days were numbered. After just 20 games in Portugal, he was loaned to several clubs around Europe, with spells in France, Greece and Turkey. After 4 years on the books with Benfica, and unable to break into the first team, the man expected to topple Landon Donovan as the King of American soccer left Europe behind, and joined Philadelphia Union in the 2011 MLS Season. 2 goals in 13 games his first year was disappointing, but the 2012 season saw Adu have the best season of his career so far with 8 strikes from 28 appearances. The fact this is seen as success though, shows how far the American has fallen since he was initially drafted. His performances were below-par, and his selfishness and lack of work rate frustrated the Philadelphia fans. Currently on loan at Bahia in Brazil, and still just 24 years old, nobody can be quite sure what the future holds for Freddy Adu. It's pretty safe to assume though, that he'll never quite live up to being a footballing God.

Because now the game against Portugal is crucial.
But we'll beat them, so we've made up for the loss against Portugal at the World Championships in 2006 (round of 16).
Then we'll go the quarterfinals and meet Russia.
But we'll beat them, so we've made up for the loss against Russia at the European Championships in 2008 (quarterfinal).
Then we'll go the semifinals and meet Spain.
But we'll beat them, so we've made up for the loss against Spain at the World Championships in 2010 (finals)
And then we'll go the finals and meet... Germany!
And we'll beat them, so we are finally free of all the traumatic experiences we've encountered all those years (for example, the world cup final in 1974). Coach Bert van Marwijk will be remembered till the end of times and people will name their babies after him.

It goes on to report that Ibra and Monaco have agreed on wages and it is believed that a fee of €30-€35 million would be enough to get the towering striker.

I bought the newspaper this morning and thought I'd post it here. It's not on their website yet, but they're usually pretty slow.

This could be huge for Monaco. I think Zlatan could play as a 9 with Falcao coming from the left. What an attack that would be.

\&gt;Chelsea vs Madrid

\&gt;Teams walk out onto the pitch to the theme of Jurassic Park to symoblise Chelsea's dinosaurs

\&gt;John Terry is holding a black baby which he hoists into the air as he \leaves the tunnel

\&gt;The game kicks off

\&gt;Chelsea are dominating due to bizarre Madrid tactics

\&gt;Torres misses 10 open goals including one where he runs onto the line after taking on the entire Madrid team and goes to roll the ball in with his head but somehow manages to hit the bar

\&gt;Second half

\&gt;Madrid score quickly after Ronaldo falls to the floor clutching his face and a wayward Torres shot deflects off of him and goes in

\&gt;Last minute

\&gt;Can Chelsea score? They always score.

\&gt;When Torres isn't playing

\&gt;Chelsea get corner

\&gt;Cross in

\&gt;EBJT (Englands Brave John Terry) jumps 20 foot into the air and powers a header in off the post, celebrating by shouting 'FOR MUAAAAMMMMMMMMBA'

\&gt;Kick off

\&gt;Chelsea get the ball again

\&gt;David Luiz tries to be Messi

\&gt;Pepe notices and attempts to murder him

\&gt;As he fly kicks Luiz in the skull the ball trickles to Torres

\&gt;He's through

\&gt;He rounds the keeper

\&gt;He shoots

\&gt;Its going over the bar

\&gt;Suddenly, the ghosts of Fabrice Muamba, Gary Speed and Sir Bobby Robson appear

\&gt;They simultaneously head the ball

\&gt;It goes in

\&gt;Chelsea win

\&gt;Mourinho runs onto the pitch with a piece of paper

\&gt;its a contract he signed with Chelsea 2 days before

\&gt;He was Chelsea manager the whole time

\&gt;EBJT and JM embrace on the pitch",,False,,t5_2qi58,False,,borussia-dortmund,True,t3_r3ds0,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/r3ds0/the_clfinal_according_to_sp/,

Stoke is now third behind the teams from the Midlands. Newcastle are still buggered.

Of course, I can't account for where fans actually travel from but their home ground is as good a guess as any. The distances are also all one way, so double them for the return trip.

However, few are in possession of helicopters (apart from [this guy](http://imgur.com/HRXc4qm)) to fly them around the UK, so what about driving distance? Here's a table sorted by driving distance (as defined by the Google Maps Directions API):

Crystal Palace have about the same distance to travel as Manchester City, but a couple of extra hours spent driving.

**Match Events:**

* CHELSEA SUB:  (11')  Bosingwa comes on to replace injured Cahill

* BARCA SUB: (27') Dani Alves replaces Pique

* **BARCA GOAL** :  (35') BUSQUETS SCORES FOR BARCELONA! Drogba clears the corner, but Chelsea are not able to collect the resulting loose ball and Cuenca gets down the right, squares it to Busquets, and the midfielder slams the ball home!  (1-1 Agg.)
 
* **CHELSEA RED CARD**: (36') RED CARD! Terry and Chelsea were furious, but there was contact.  Apparently it was the referee's assistant who deemed it a red card, with the ref unsighted.
 
* **BARCA GOAL**: (43') GOAL!!!! INIESTA MAKES IT TWO! Barcelona are rampant now, and Chelsea's defence is threadbare to say the least. Messi and Sanchez combine, before Iniesta times his run to perfection and beats Cech with a clinical finish! Barca with 2-1 Agg. Lead
 
* CHELSEA YELLOW CARD: (44') Ramires is booked for dissent
 
* **CHELSEA GOAL**: (45+1') What a run and finish from Ramires, who latches on to a through ball from Lampard before lobbing Valdes with an exquisite finish as the keeper flies off his line! Chelsea lead with Away Goal Advantage (2-2 Agg.)
 
* *HALF TIME: Chelsea lead with Away Goal Advantage (2-2 Agg.)*

* **BARCA PENALTY SHOT** (49') PENALTY! Fabregas goes down inside the penalty area with apparent contact with Didier Drogba! MESSI HITS THE BAR! Astonishingly, Messi hits the woodwork with the resulting spot kick, and justice appears to be done with very little - if any - contact seemingly made for the penalty.

* CHELSEA YELLOW CARD: (50') Ivanovic is booked, and would miss the final if Chelsea progress

* *Terry: (52') ""I've not had one booking in the Champions League this season, and I did not do it deliberately.""* Make of that what you will.

* CHELSEA SUB: (56') Salomon Kalou replaces Juan Mata

* CHELSEA YELLOW CARD: (57') Cech is booked for apparent time-wasting as he walks off to retrieve the ball for a goal kick, and that seems very harsh indeed.

* BARCELONA SUB: (67') Cuenca is replaced by Tello

* BARCELONA YELLOW: (71') Messi is booked for a very cynical tug on Lampard in the Chelsea half, and that was a definite yellow card.

* CHELSEA YELLOW: (72') Lampard is booked seconds later as he scythes down Fabregas, and that was a poor challenge.

* BARCELONA SUB: (74') Fabregas replaced by Seydou Keita

* CHELSEA SUB: (80') Drogba replaced by Fernando Torres

* **OFFSIDES GOAL: (82') OFFSIDE GOAL! Alves is fractionally offside as Sanchez finds the far corner with a precise finish past Cech, but it will not count.**

* CROSSBAR: (83') MESSI HITS THE POST! The forward finds a touch of space in the box as he cuts inside, but his low shot rebounds off the post!

* CHELSEA YELLOW: (88') Meireles is booked for a late trip on the rampaging Alves, and he will now be out of the final as well.

* **CHELSEA GOAL: (90+1') GOAL!!!!! TORRES SCORES FOR CHELSEA! Would you believe it? What a goal for Chelsea as Torres is put clean through on goal and he rounds Valdes before sliding the ball into the empty net to put Chelsea through to the Champions League final!!! CHELSEA LEAD 3-2 ON AGG.** 

* ***The full-time whistle goes at the Camp Nou, and 10-man Chelsea are through to the Champions League final! What a performance from Roberto Di Matteo's side, who draw 2-2 with Barcelona on the night and reach the tournament showpiece in Munich!***",,False,,t5_2qi58,True,,man-utd,True,t3_spz1q,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/spz1q/match_thread_barcelona_v_chelsea_2nd_leg_cl/,

Take a divisive incident like Suarez's handball today. What was obviously going to be a controversial issue that divides opinion was represented completely one sided on here today, any posts condemning Suarez were automatically downvoted to oblivion, and all top posts were in support of him. 
It is obvious that reddiquette is not being followed, and people are downvoting because they disagree, not because it doesn't add anything to the discussion. 
We then end up with a completely one sided forum with no real discussion about an interesting and controversial subject. It doesn't make for a vibrant forum, and just feels like the 'hive mind' has spoken, and anyone who disagrees gets down voted without much discussion.

Edit: So sorry, to sum up, I think this would be a better community if people followed rediquette, downvote because it doesn't add to the discussion, not because you don't agree.

* [](//#notes) **Prematch news:** Lineups are announced. Due to the weather in Warsaw the retractable roof of the National Stadium will be closed for the match.

* [](//#notes) Here come the players. Anthem time!

* **01'** [](//#clock) Greece kick off and get EURO 2012 started!

* **02' [](//#whistle) POL** Sokratis fouled by Lewandowski

* **03' [](//#whistle) POL [](//#whistle) GRE** Karagounis fouled by Polanski; Lewandowski fouled by Gekas

* **06' [](//#flag) GRE** Gekas offside. Poland getting the early pressure, but the Greeks defense holds thanks to some good blocks.

* **08' [](//#whistle) GRE** Błaszczykowski fouled by Papadopoulos

* **09' [](//#whistle) POL** Papadopoulos fouled by Lewandowski

* **11' [](//#whistle) POL** Gekas fouled by Perquis. Yet another cheap foul near midfield; Karagounis' delivery to Gekas was flicked on, but missed the goal.

* **15'** Polish medical staff on the to treat Obraniak after a heavy but fair challenge by Sokratis. Looks winded, not injured.

* **17' [](//#ball) POL Robert LEWANDOWSKI** gets the first goal of the tournament. Cross comes in from Błaszczykowski on the right wing to the far post and powered down and into the goal. **POL 1-0 GRE [video](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/10-robert-lewandowski-poland-v-greece/)**

* **21'** Avraam Papadopoulos down injured and Kyriakos Papadopoulos looks ready to come on. But after some magic spray is applied to his left leg, Papadopoulos rejoins the action, at least temporarily

* **35' [](//#yellow) GRE** Sokratis climbing all over the back of Lewandowski, certainly a foul but nothing obviously deserving to go in the book.

* **36' [](//#sub) GRE** Papadopoulos for Papadopoulos (Kyriakos for Avraam).

* **44' [](//#whistle) POL** Karagounis fouled by Polanski 

* **45' [](//#red) GRE** A second yellow for Sokratis Papastathopoulos for a push on Lewandowski. Another harsh call. **[video](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/shocking-decision-sokratis-papastathopoulos-sent-greece-v-poland/)**

* **45+1'** [](//#clock) 3 minutes to be added.

* **45+2' [](//#yellow) GRE** Possible handball by Poland in their penalty area (**[video](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/handball-box-penalty-damien-perquis-poland-v-greece/)**) but nothing from the referee. Holebas fouls Lewandowski on the halfway line as Poland clear the ball forward.

And Tahiti begin with the traditional 'swapping of the golden necklace' ritual.

0' Tahiti currently have enjoyed 100% possession,  and play it out for a tactical throw in.

3' Tahiti have attacked twice in the opening minutes, both times down their right wing, but nothing has come of it. Pepe Reina is looking shaky in goals so far.

[4' GOAL! Fernando Torres can now add 'dream-killer' to his impressive list of achievements as he slots it past Roche.](http://i.minus.com/iAe3Z1NEsNhRY.gif)

6' Spain try a cross in and Roche manages to land a hand on it to tap it out of the box weakly.

12' The excellently named Steevy Chong Hue is taken down in the box as Tahiti break, but the referee is having none of it (obviously he didn't get his Tahiti flair like the rest of us).

13' Mikael Roche proves his tenacity by trying one of the hardest goalkeeping moves: tying up your shoelaces without taking your gloves off.

15' Torres continues his quest to make every single person on the face of the earth hate him and his stupid shaved head by seeming to catch Roche's fingers on the way through as he failed at attacking. Now the gloves are off, literally, as the medical staff are checking that Roche still has all his fingers.

24' An errant elbow from an Espanol defender ends up giving Tahiti their first free kick of the game. Unfortunately it hits the wall, and Lemaire fluffs the second attempt from the corner.

27' Somehow, with the absolute dearth of talent at their disposal, Spain are creating few chances. Tahiti's 9-0-1 formation is settling in well, and they are defending capably. Mata is now taking a free kick as Jerknando Jerkes is taken down outside the box.

30' Torres, with an open view to goal, manages to conspire with Villa to lose the ball to a Tahitian defender. Aside from the first goal, Roche is playing extremely well. He's like a male Vaitiare Bandera!

[31' GOAL! David Silva finishes neatly to provide Spain with their second goal. Not much Roche could do about that one.](http://i.minus.com/iFQzKNvShPJqA.gif)

[32' GOAL! It feels like the proverbial floodgates are opening now as Torres saunters onto a long ball in space and skips over the sliding Roche to slot home his second, and Spain's third.](http://i.minus.com/ib2BPVCdltLmst.gif)

[35' David Villa is not happy.](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1103805/sadvilla.jpg)

[38' GOAL! Del Bosque presses right on the D-Pad and sets his team to counter attack, as four Spaniards attack together, with Villa finishing it. Not even his 54th goal for Spain can bring a smile to his face.](http://i.minus.com/iFeaQvoPjMCOD.gif)

44' Something something Spaniards diving something something.

**HALF-TIME Spain 4 - 0 Tahiti**

[Why don't you check out this short documentary about the Pacific Islander experience in Australian schools.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O5U9irS3iA)

46' Substition: Navas on, Ramos off. Spain are obviously going to try to crack the double figures here.

48' goal. Spain walk in another goal, it's Villa again, who sucks his thumb in celebration. This is threatening to get rather boring.

51' Call me Torres. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely --having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me in Liverpool, I thought I would sail about a little and see the blue part of the London....

53' Like the male goat mounting the female, a Spanish defender climbs on the back of Vahirua and gives away a free kick.

53' Substitution Tahiti: Tehau in, Tehau out. I guess you can say it takes two to Tehau.

54' It's been a while since Tahiti have attacked, they've seen less box than George Michael at a nightclub.

[57' Goal! Torres with this hat-trick. He really is an odious twat isn't he?](http://i.imgur.com/lKhT661.gif)

59' Guys I just caught an Eevee in my pokemon game!!!

63' Goal! The Torres/Villa dick-measuring contest continue as Villa pokes the ball into the net after a bad error from Mikael Roche.

64' MOTHER OF GOD TAHITI WITH A GENUINE CHANCE THERE.

65' Goal! Spain score again. My stream is frozen, and frankly I don't give a fuck, so someone else tell me who it was. 

66' Who is that dude in yellow who just committed a handball? And for those asking I think I want an Espeon :D

68' Spain are entering a dangerous time now, as we all know an 8-0 lead is the most worrying.

67' David Villa with a free kick after a foul on Squirrel Cazorla, and Roche makes a truly excellent save. He follows this up with another world-class save from a volley at the counter. 

67' Substitution Spain: Mario Gomez' father on for Juan Mata.
Substituion Tehau: Tehau Tehau for Tehau Tehau Tehau.

75' Substitution Spain: Gary Coleman on for Doris Day.

76' Spain are awarded a penalty after a Tahitian handball. Now Torres and Villa will fight to the death to see who can take it. OH MY GOD TORRES HAS MISSED SERIOUSLY WHAT A DRONGO.

77' Goal. I eat my words, and they are salty, as Torres scores after rounding Roche for the 935th time this game.

80' Is it just me or is this the worst four goal performance from a striker in football history?

84' The world's most intense linesman calls offside to disallow the tenth Spanish goal.

88' Goal. Bla bla bla David Silva little magician bla bla bla. At least it wasn't Torres or Villa, amirite people?

**Spain 10 - 0 Tahiti**

Coincidentally, I was wearing a van Persie jersey (the old one..) After spending all of half time looking for his booth, we found him and decided to go back to our seats for the second half. With a few minutes left at the end of the game we headed over towards his booth to wait for the game to end and possibly get an autograph. I was waiting for the game to end, and when i turned around and looked up, I saw RvP with a grin on his face looking down at me. I took off my hat and asked him (in Dutch) if he could sign my hat, after signing my hat (http://i.imgur.com/tltrV.jpg) he told me to take off my shirt, which i threw up to him and which he then also signed (http://i.imgur.com/JHia3.jpg). To top it off, the next morning he tweeted this!

Within an hour there were Atletico Madrid fans, Tottenham fans, Inter Milan fans, Liverpool fans, etc, posting information on their possible starting line ups, form of their teams and their predictions for their games. We have an abundance of first hand sources reporting on clubs all around the world, we should be putting this to use as it presents a glorious chance to lose money together as a community.

I've noticed recently there's been some discussion over how much Barcelona does (or doesn't) dive. Now, I'd like to clarify what us neutrals mean by this. We acknowledge that everyone dives, including the team that we support. However, we recognize this as a bad thing, which is why players like Nani or Robin van Persie are often vilified.

Our criticism rests on two points:

1. Barcelona dives more than other teams. Alves dives a lot, as does Busquets and Mascherano.

2. Barcelona doesn't **need** to dive to win. Barcelona is an amazing team--probably the best in the world right now. When you guys came out against Real Madrid, we expected to see an immensely exciting game showcasing players' skills and the managers' mind games, but we ended up seeing Barcelona and Real Madrid disrupt the flow of play every few minutes.

One comparison I think is especially apt is to Cristiano Ronaldo. Although Ronaldo is perhaps the best player in the world behind Messi, his undoubted skill is tainted by the *perception* that he's a diver. I personally think he's gotten better in recent years, but nevertheless, he could be a much more respected player if he cut out diving from his game.

Barcelona prides itself on the purity of its football and condemns ""anti-football"" defensive tactics. I'd like to contend that diving and intimidating the referee is just as much anti-football. We would enjoy seeing you play and respect you as a team much more if you would follow Messi's example and stay on your feet.

Thanks for reading, and I hope this clarifies where we're coming from.

TL;DR We're holding you to a high standard because we love you.

* 2008-2009 - Barcelona defeats Manchested United, game is played in Italy.

* 2009-2010 - Internazionale defeats Bayern Munich, game is played in Spain.

* 2010-2011 - Barcelona defeats Manchester United, game is played in England.

* 2011-2012 - Chelsea defeats Bayern Munich, game is played in Germany

* 2012-2013 - Bayern Munich will face Borussa Dortmund, game is played in England.

For the last five years, whichever country has hosted the Champions League final...one of their teams won the Champions League the next year.  That trend is continuing this year as both finals teams are from Germany.
