&gt; There is a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

&gt; The players who conceive the child get to name it, so when you join, you will be given a name (expect serious names like John crossed with ridiculous names like Terminator the Third). You roll the dice when you join.

&gt; Your parents can choose to aid you or not, one thing at least is this would mean you would technically have friends from the moment you joined the game.

&gt; Each woman is limited to 15 children, families would be akin to WoW guilds (family chat etc).

The game would hereby be made exclusive, getting an invite would rely on the players in the game creating new players, should there be more babies than people wanting to join, the baby would just gestate in the womb.

Players would have all kinds if different 'needs' meters, just like the Sims, except there would be a darker twist, players would need to fulfill dark desires, be it through crime, having an affair, etc.

**Now for the good part.**

Like a modern-day Godfather, your family wants to be on the top of the city, living in the best house money can buy (cities akin to realms). You've gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelette. Guns will be attainable, but not easily, it's much easier to smash your neighbor over the head with a frying pan that you got from the stove. Prepare for the police to come and gun you down though if you're not discreet enough.

Remember house building in the Sims? That'd be here too, if you want to live a quiet life you could trade your way up the property ladder. Speaking of living your life, you're going to need a job. Employers would be NPC's, as in reality there will be more people than jobs, so some people will be forced to a life of beggarism (?) or crime.

Anyone played puzzle pirates? No? Well 'working' would essentially be playing minigames. That sounds boring as shit. Well if you want to become a prostitute there is a minigame for that (and boy would it be graphic).

You will be born as a child and be forced to undergo a tutorial, once you complete the tutorial you begin your life. Each person's looks are randomised. Fat people get hungry less often and earn more in sedentary office jobs, attractive people would be better suited to a life in the red light district.

The richest players would be able to build skyscrapers, in the end, the game world should look like a real city.

A few extra points:

* To kick-off the game, two devs would each play Adam and Eve

* They would pick who to give their child invite to (this would only be in the early stages, once the game reaches release people can sign up and randomly be assigned parents), and then some incest would occur until the game is lowly populated with alpha testers

* The map would be reset after alpha but the players would remain, forced to rebuild as the beta stage is entered, the map would then stay for release as the bugs were worked out

* Dying would cause you a lengthy medical bill

* Public service jobs such as policemen would be available to players, I've not figured out how a player would join the police force, but imagine every now and then a player decides to go rogue as a cop and shoot a few of his rivals, he wouldn't remain on the force for long, but damn it'd be realistic.

* You can steal from other player's houses, by picking the locks and such, obviously better security systems give better protection, and obviously you can get caught and be imprisoned.

* Players will have skills

* Once a realm is full the men will shoot blanks and the women's ovaries will be more barren than the Sahara. Until of course people begin deleting their characters

* This would definitely be subscription based, otherwise it'd be full of free trial babies who never return.

* Parents can petition for a child to be 'disowned', if someone plays for a month and never returns the mods can 'disown' the child, forcing it to be reborn should the player return to the game (with the same stats etc, just a different family).

* Surely the game would be named 'OH THE HUMANITY!'

* The children will look like a cross between the parents, any child born out of wedlock will not be part of a family and will essentially be a free agent (first one to name the kid Jon Snow gets a year's free subscription, while the husband gets his ass kicked by the wife's hired thugs).

**If I had the chance to play this game, I would groom my offspring into natural-born killers, we'd play the guise of a happy family, we'd make friends with other families, then form a neighborhood watch, which would involve us stealing things and pretending we have no idea who the culprit was. This would of course continue until I was cruising around town in a merc popping caps out of the window, immune from the law due to me bribing the police.**

You could theoretically earn back your color by driving safely, but, like a credit score, it would take a long time to fix.

Sensors would be placed on highways and street signs to aid in the process. Tampering with your car's color system would be punishable by permanent revocation of your driver's license.

*Notice how you only seem to want chicken sandwiches covered in pickles on Sunday when those slimy rat bastards across the street are closed?

*Moan no more! We're ONLY open on Sundays mother fuckers.

*Every Sunday is ""Super fucking customer appreciation pride great day.""

*That's right, it's SFCAPG day %100 of the fucking time.

*Wear anything festive and you get free waffle fries.

*Santa hat in July? Free waffle fries.

*American flag thongs? Free waffle fries.

*We're going to serve booze too, lots of booze! BYOB? DUH.

*Brought a keg? Free waffle fries.

*Brought a keg of Natty Light? 1 waffle fry because we're fucking generous, but we may need to discuss your future visitation etiquette.

*Compliment my sweet new short shorts? Fuckin' a. Free waffle fries.

It's going to be the Project X of chicken sandwiches. And you're invited.

Jerry is still acting as a comic, helping to boost morale in the 200 person settlement.

George enters a relationship with the female governor of the block, but accidentally offends her and is unsure if he is banished or not.

Kramer is unemployed but accidentally leads a revolt.

Elaine gets a position as adviser to the governor, but is fundamentally incompetent.

Imagine if all the brilliant voices of Reddit could be digitally mixed together into a choir?

I thought that one way to achieve this would be to have Redditors uploading recordings themselves singing various notes / sounds, etc., and then audio production enthusiasts / etc. could use these recorded samples to do something amazing with them, whether that be just manually compositing the audio clips together (in a digital audio workstation) to make a complete song, or making the choir playable on an electronic keyboard.

I've even come up with a plan to achieve this. Here's how it would go down.

##1. Crowdsourced Recording

Via /r/music, Redditors are asked to upload *high-fidelity* (no background noise, high-quality microphones, etc.) clips of themselves recording the following sounds:

**a**. Tonal Sounds

i. *High Priority Tonal Sounds*

""ah"", ""eh"", ""ee"", ""oh"", ""oo"", ""uuh"", ""mm"", ""nn"", ""rr""

ii. *Low Priority Tonal Sounds*

""rr"", ""zz"", ""v""

**b**. Atonal Sounds (only need one recording of each, not each individual note)

""ss"", ""p"", ""t"", ""k"", ""j"", ""ch"", ""sh"", ""b"", ""f"", ""d"", ""g""

(suggestions welcome on this list of required sounds)

Each Redditor would then create, upload, and submit a .zip or .rar archive with the following directory structure:
    
    &lt;username&gt;.zip
    --tonal
    ----ah
    ------A4.wav
    ------Bb4.wav
    ------B4.wav
    ------C5.wav
    ------Cs5.wav
    ------ (etc.)
    ----eh
    ------A4.wav
    ------(...)
    ----(...)
    --atonal
    ----ss.wav
    ----p.wav
    ----(...)

Of course, a template with the appropriate directory structure would be provided.

The original post would probably need to state something to the effect of ""please upvote for visibility; this is a self-post, for which I receive no karma.""

##2. Verifying the Recordings

While the above step is in progress, a small panel of music experts is amassed. Such experts might be found by posting a thread asking for people with perfect pitch or audio production backgrounds to verify that the recordings are high-quality.

All the experts would then be given access to the recordings (which would be PM'd to the coordinator of this effort, or simply posted in a thread). They would analyze each and every sample and make sure that (a) the recording is high-quality (no noise, etc.) and (b) the recording is the right pitch and desired length. 

##3. Releasing the Recordings

Once an archive has been approved in step 2, that archive will be posted to the official thread in /r/music, and it will become fair use for the public. 

##4. Usage

Any Redditor will be free to download and use the raw, recorded samples. However, I have a couple of suggestions for how they could be used in a more productive manner:

- The samples are compiled into a patch for use in the Kontakt sampling engine
- The samples are compiled into a soundsource for use in Spectrasonics Omnisphere
- The samples are combined with + without reverb into one master archive called ""choir.zip"" which features all the Redditors combined

Since their true identity hasn't been seen for many years, except for the early photograph of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo seen [here](http://www.neowin.net/forum/uploads/monthly_06_2013/post-120066-0-84007800-1370620587.jpg).
Also, the music they have been coming out with has been revolutionary, in an age when instruments were the norm, they produced an entirely electronic album: Homework. More recently, when electronically produced albums have become the norm, they produced Random Access Memories in-studio with instruments. 
The release of albums (Homework: 1997, Discovery: 2001, Human After All: 2005, Tron: Legacy: 2010, and R.A.M.: 2013) shows approximately 4 years between albums, which allows for them to sit and have jam sessions with popular artists.
Now, for this to continue indefinitely, Daft Punk may have children or even musical prodigies who sit and jam with them in between albums while they decide what *sounds* good and what doesn't. When they time comes for the original members to retire, the younger Daft Punk members could continue this until it was their time to retire as well. 
Thus, the image or brand of Daft Punk, as robots without identities, could continue forever.",,False,,t5_2snxj,False,,,True,t3_1imple,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1imple/daft_punk_can_continue_indefinitely/,

One of the problems with this idea is finding a country or city that would allow the museum to be built. The only other crazy idea I can think of to get around this is to buy an island from a country and build it there. But of course people aren't going to want to fly or boat to an island for a day to check out a museum, so there would have to be a resort on the island. In the resort there could be normal rooms for the average family who wants to stay. And for the more interesting people who are willing to spend a couple more dollars, more extravagant rooms that are themed after people who have items in the museum.

Please pitch more ideas in the comments because I'm really interested in hearing about other works and people that could be included in the museum.

I think that by making workouts more interesting, it will inspire more people to start exercising. ",,False,,t5_2snxj,False,,,True,t3_17ovxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/17ovxo/the_adventure_gym/,

iOS version is in the works, and functioning for the most part. However it costs $99 to submit an app and chances are it will get rejected from the App Store.

All the apps will be without ads of course, and no premium versions, all shall be free.

Comment on what features you want added next, I'll do them when I find the time based off the comment that gets the most upvotes.

2: $2.99(eg) paid torrent, 1080P (or 720P for $2.49(eg)), no ads.
now you might be saying that people will fast forward through the ads, people with DVRs/ Tivos (i think) do that already. The advantage here is that people can still see the adds, you can still curb the torrenting because it would be free and legal.

Gabe Newell (I think) said that you can beat piracy by offering a better service. here's how. Networks collect money from ads and paid downloads and get good metrics. People get tv for a fair price or free with ads. Everyone wins.

Like say if we wanted the government to tax the churches, we wouldn't apply for a tax break as a charity, but rather as a religious organization.  And if they take us to court over it, we insist that our religion demands we go to court in full pirate regalia.

Always make the argument that the government can't mandate we're *not* a religion without breaking down the separation of church and state.

The regular police could still detain, arrest, and charge the Meta-Police.

If they were having a pissing contest, trying to arrest *each other*, the law would be that they *both* have to show up for processing and have the facts of the matter assessed by a magistrate.  To prevent frivolous pissing contest arrests, if a counter-arrest was deemed frivolous, the offender would further be charged with [barratry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barratry_(common_law\)) against an officer.

To reduce *collusion* between forces, and because the number of needed Meta-police is not known, a negative feedback system is used to control the number of Meta-police in response to a measurable need.  Given adequate resources, if the Meta-officers are not achieving any convictions, there just are not enough Civil Police-based crimes, in which case a Meta-Police staffing reduction is reasonable.  If the entire Meta-force is overworked and *frequently* getting police convictions, a staffing *increase* is reasonable.  We'd probably need a staffing buffer available for quick response to demand fluctuation, but for skilled labour you should make a hiring commitment - these roles cannot generally be filled by temporary labour.

This would be better than the current system, where the police force investigates itself.

Any police or meta-police *convicted* of a *criminal* offense (i.e., not trivial things like getting a speeding ticket) would be deemed ineligible to serve as *any* kind of police.

Yeah, it costs more to the society to support more police officers, and corrupt police will still exist, but if we *grant* the government the right to police us and give them special legal powers over us, the cost of the Meta-police is the cost of a harm-reduction insurance policy against police corruption.

Removing the ""need"" to divorce someone if you can just wait a couple of years and save a lot of money in the process would help a lot of people reintegrate to society.

I want to see handwriting become the professional standard for the internet in the near future, as in, everyone will write each letter of the alphabet about 30 times, and then all their comments and creations, on the internet, will be submitted in their own handwriting. We could have moderation so that way people don't have penises for letters or so that all letters come out correct. And one can edit their own kerning (horizontal spacing) for their own handwriting to look as close as possible to their actual writing. It would personalize content on the internet a lot more than it currently is, and remove the unpersonal feel that the internet has. You could get to know a user a lot more from their handwriting, as you read the things that they post. People could be encouraged to focused on fixing their handwriting too, if that is really such a problem.

But as an ideal starting point, I'd just like to be able to take notes on a computer and actually not be able to distinguish it from the notes that I have on paper. That would be pretty cool.

1367423715.0,118,self.CrazyIdeas,1dhjp4,A GTA inspired open world game set in West Berlin at the height of the Cold War. You are a James Bond style spy.,133,15,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1dhjp4/a_gta_inspired_open_world_game_set_in_west_berlin/,"LA Noire and (especially) Red Dead Redemption were cool and immersive ways to tell a story.  A GTA game set in today's world is pretty cool, but most of us have firsthand knowledge of how a modern city looks and feels.  Setting the game in a bygone era offers the player a more novel experience.  
	
* The player:	

You are a spy given secret missions. You enter the game by jumping out of a cargo plane over the city.  You deploy your parachute and land on the ground with nothing but the clothes on your back, a small pistol, and a few Bond-inspired spy gadgets (given to you and explained at the last minute in the cargo plane by your CIA contact).   Your first mission is to retrieve a package in the city.  The package turns out to be a tuxedo and an invitation to a high society dinner at the Soviet Embassy within West Berlin.

During the game you plant bugs, capture former Nazis, follow suspected communists, etc.  At some point in the game you are contacted by the KGB and offered a deal to become a double agent.  The player controls which missions they take, allying themselves with MI6, the CIA, or the KGB.  The missions you take affects the outcome of the game.  And of course, you fall in love with a beautiful enemy spy and are forced to make decisions regarding her.

* The city: 

It would probably be best to change the name of the city, but have it be clearly inspired by Berlin.  I can't think of a good alternative name, but I'm sure someone could.  Overall, West Berlin has the razzle-dazzle of neon lights and gaudy billboard advertising; East Berlin is dominated by dull gray apartment blocs, shitty communist cars, and impressive communist statues.

West Berlin is totally contained within communist East Germany.  This gives the gameplay world natural borders, military check point stations that cannot be crossed.  This keeps the player contained within the world in a way that make sense within the game.  It also allows for the game world to be unlocked piecemeal.  You start in the USA controlled sector and then the French and British sections are unlocked.  Finally the communist  East Berlin is unlocked and you go deep undercover on the other side of the Berlin Wall. 

* The radio:

Propaganda Radio is played by both sides.  Of course they would both be really satirical. There is a Voice of the USA radio station that rails against the evil communists and their accessible heath care. The USA DJ is Laslow's father (voiced by the actor that does Laslow).  The USSR Radio is DJ has a thick Soviet accent and is excited that bread lines are now 30% shorter throughout the city!  There could also be a swing music radio station, British invasion style station, classical, etc...

1. Write a series of 5 basically unrelated stories. (1st is fantasy, 2nd is western, 3rd is thriller, 4th is romance, 5th is sci-fi.)

2. Characters in the stories are one-note archetypes. (The Hero, The Love Interest, The Betrayer, The Mysterious Hermit, etc.)

3. Make each book into a movie, where all of these archetypes are played by the same people.

4. The first movie is played out exactly like the first book. No changes to the plot, no signs that anything is unusual.

5. In the second movie, The Hero starts to notice that things are happening the same as last time. He's still the main character, although now he's being called by a different name. The love interest is the same, his best friend betrays him again, he meets the same hermit, etc. He intimates that he's the same guy as the last story, but other than that, he doesn't try to change the plot.

6. Now he really starts to freak out. He's going through another story again, with the same characters as last time. No one else notices the repetition except for him. This time, however, he starts to predict what will happen based off of these archetypes and change the plot of the story. When his ""best friend"" invites him over to his house, he refuses, since he knows it's a trap. His character has no reason to believe that, but he knows just from who his best friend is that it'll happen. (And it did in the original story.) Maybe he has a steady girlfriend, but he meets the Love Interest and starts to get confused. He's not supposed to start falling in love with her until later, but the story foreshadows her early on. Now that the Hero sees the foreshadowing, he makes choices he wouldn't have before. Anyway, besides a few choices, he doesn't significantly derail the plot. He still ends up saving the day or what have you.

7. I chose to make the romance 4th because it'd be hilariously easy to derail. In the original story, the character agonized over whether he truly loved the Love Interest or not; it's what made the story interesting. But here, as soon as he sees her, he knows he loves her. She's the Love Interest, after all. It's destiny. So this will probably be the movie where he really buckles down and tries to understand what's going on. Against the backdrop of the original story, he explores what he recognizes from the previous three movies. Maybe something that was supposed to happen, like a car accident, happens in a different context, so things start changing wildly.

8. This is the movie where I imagine the character just completely derails it. In the original book, the big twist halfway through was that the guy he was working for from the very beginning was secretly evil. However, the Hero would catch onto that right from the start, so he shoots the guy in the face on page 1. But the guy was a big deal, so now The Hero's a fugitive, the original plot is in tatters, and everything is in chaos. Maybe the final movie ends with him getting shot, releasing him from his continuous loops.

Some helpful redditors [EdocKrow](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1arxf0/a_toilet_that_tells_you_how_big_your_poop_was/c906uk5), [flapjackbacon](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1arxf0/a_toilet_that_tells_you_how_big_your_poop_was/c90idf0), and [Freeeshooter](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1arxf0/a_toilet_that_tells_you_how_big_your_poop_was/c91x1uu) brought this to my attention, and now I feel like a dolt. 

So the seat has springs to take your weight. There's a little digital display, and the number changes as soon the poop leaves your butt. 

There's a menu that shows you high scores, including ""shortest time spent on toilet"" (motivates you towards efficiency) in addition to the obvious ""heaviest dump"". I can't think of any other high score categories, but there's gotta be more. 

You'd have to sit without any part of your body touching the ground in order for the scale to work. There would have to be stirrups to hold the feet. This might put the body in an uncomfortable position and possibly increase risk of hemorrhoids, so the toilet would need to be higher than normal.

Password protected, in case somebody is using your bathroom and you don't want them to know your scores, let alone that you own such a device. Press a hidden button and the blank display pops up. Enter your password and  the display reads ""*welcome, ______*"" as the stirrups are deployed and the toilet rises, all accompanied by little blinking lights and ""*whirrrrr, wrrrrwwwww, weeee*"" noises from transformers.

Of course, you can already determine the weight of your poop by standing on a scale before and after a dump.

Oh, and the toilet uses your score to calculate just how much water is required to flush it, which saves water for the environment and saves you money.",,False,,t5_2snxj,1364244510.0,,,True,t3_1arxf0,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1arxf0/a_toilet_that_tells_you_how_big_your_poop_was/,

If it's cheap, then no one will care that their alarm clock broke, but if you pay good money, then you don't want it to go to waste. Secondly, no one will want to have to pick up 1000 pieces of scattered across the room. Better to defuse the clock.

To defuse the clock, I'm open to suggestions. I thought maybe a series of games or math problems. Something possible to do in under 15 seconds. Maybe the games get harder and more challenging over time so you don't get used to it or predict it.

And I believe it would genuinely work and wake a person up out of bed. It would probably be fun too. In the beginning at least. Then you might get bored and your alarm clock explodes and you get all pissed off. Then you buy another one.
