(1 year update &amp; more!),374,52,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1kd6rw/so_i_bought_a_video_game_store_1_year_update_more/,"Hello /r/GamingCollecting!!! Has it been a year already? A little over a year ago I took a crazy chance and bought a video game store at a local flea market. For those of you that do no remember my original post, you can [see my find of the week here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/txbnv/fotw_so_i_bought_a_video_game_store/) This store has changed my life in so many ways. A few months after buying the store I left my job (working for the man) and pursued this dream of mine full time. I took this dirty, run-down store and made it into the best that it can be. See what the [ store looked like one year ago](http://imgur.com/a/a6qst) and see the [panorama I took this past week.](http://i.imgur.com/cyDToEg.jpg). I am really trying to help build a local game collecting community in Jacksonville and I think I am making some headway. I have regulars that make an appearance each weekend and buy/trade. I have also built a name for myself by being the only person in town that will take EVERYTHING video game related. Video games are not the only thing that I sell at the store now. I have slowly started to add vintage toys, board games, memorabilia and other geek awesomeness. 

I love this place and want nothing more but share my passion with the world. With that being said, I am running out of room at the flea market and need to take the next step to opening a retail location. Several months ago I started taking classes about business and started meeting with a business adviser. I have written my business plan, saved a few dollars and gathered inventory. It is now time to open a retail location! /excited This will give us a lot more room and we can be open up seven days a week! YAY! I still need a little more help getting the funds needed to open the store. My adviser suggested that I start an [IndieGoGo campaign](http://igg.me/at/VideoGameRescue/x/3287807) to crowdfund the remaining funds needed. I want this post to be more about an update on my store than a plea for $. **I do not want anyone to feel obligated to donate** and I want to thank everyone here for all the support and encouragement I have received from my fellow collectors.

http://imgur.com/a/AQp5R

I am currently selling my US SNES collection. It comprises all 721 retail SNES games released in the US, Mexico and Canada; boxes for every single game; and 85% of all manuals. It does not include NFR and unlicensed games (MBR/SR, DKCC, SFSW, and SNA3D.) It was built up from individual sales, so conditions range from near mint to fair. I took pains to spend more on better conditions for the more prized pieces of the collection.

Every single game has been professionally cleaned and tested. They all work perfectly.

I built this set to obtain scans and clean verified dumps for every game, which I have now finished. The scans are appearing on snescentral.com, and the improved emulation will appear in the next higan/bsnes release. I will be using 100% of the profits from this sale to do the same for the European and Japanese sets next.

This set represents three years of effort. From scouring every used game store in my home state, to bartering purchases from dozens of vendors online, to enlisting the help of everyone willing to search around their areas to find things for me, to donations of items that are impossible to find for sale anywhere, to hundreds upon hundreds of hours cleaning and polishing everything. I've never seen a set this complete before, and it's unlikely another one will ever surface.

I am asking $24,999 or best offer for everything. The most expensive dozen games alone are worth half of the asking price. For a reseller, this is an easy profit of $10,000 or more. For the collector who likes to play their games, this set represents the best price point. Not insanely expensive for VGA graded material, yet still clean enough for display.

I would prefer, if at all possible, to sell outside of eBay. Their fees would take 10% of the sale price, which would hurt efforts to obtain more games to scan and dump.

If you are interested in making an offer, please post below, or PM me, or e-mail me at setsunakun0 at hotmail.com

Also, if you could please spread the word about this sale, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!

PS: yes, I submitted photos of the cartridges form this collection a few months back. They've all been cleaned up, and now you have photos of the boxes and manuals as well. I also checked with mods prior to posting about my sale.

1368968535.0,170,self.gamecollecting,1emmwg,Why I collect video games.,215,45,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1emmwg/why_i_collect_video_games/,"I was once asked, quite a long time ago, why I collect video games. After years of of thought and consideration I know the answer. I collect video games because they are not just video games. I grew up playing them, they helped mold me into who I am. I can remember specific moments of my life when I think back about playing a certain video game. I remember one summer when I was very young. My family was playing baseball outside, it was a hot sticky day and my dad had way too many beers for how early it was still in the day. I did something to upset him, I don’t remember what it was at all. Probably something insignificant that just set him off. The back of his hand collided with my small face and I fell to the ground disorientated, he yelled at me and told me to go into the house to think about what I had done. I ran inside, still feeling woozy with my face red, tender and tears streaming down. I didn’t run to my bed or to my room to feel safe. I didn’t hide or go to my mom. Where did I go? To the living room, in front of the TV. I pushed that small grey button in and turned the TV to channel 3, there Mario ran across the screen. Super Mario Bros. 3. One of my absolute favorite games from the NES. I was able to lose myself through gameplay and imagination. I was swept away to a different world, one where I could always depend on having fun. That is what consoled me and comforted me. I had 3 older brothers so they always got to play first, they would come home from school with tips and secrets about games that they would play with their friends. Even though I am sure they found me annoying they would show me how to beat certain levels. I still remember to this day how to get to the first warp pipes in the first SMB, I remember the first time they discovered the warp pipe in SMB 2. And I smile every time I think about how I was the one that showed them how to duck on the white rectangle so you fall to the back of the level in SMB 3 in order to get the first whistle. 

When I look at my collection of games, it is like looking into my past. Like when you smell something and it takes you back instantly. Thats how I feel when I see the boot up screen for the PS1 or everytime I hear the music from A Link to the Past. That game taught me about perseverance. I hadn't conquered many games so I was absolutely determined that I would beat this one. I kept getting stuck at the same spot, I knew I needed to get the book on top of the shelf in the library but I could not for the life of me figure it out. I started that game over more times than I can remember because I kept thinking I had missed an important detail or my save was bad. When I finally figured out that I had to sprint into it I was absolutely ecstatic. I will never forget that moment and that feeling. Moments like those would teach me to look problems in a different way and to keep trying because the answers are always just ahead of us. I got stuck in Super Metroid, it was fairly late in the game and I did not want to start all over. I ran through all the open areas so many times trying to figure out what I missed, and then I saw it. Just like in A Link to the Past the answer is there clear in the open just waiting for you to find it. Obviously if you want to knock a book down from a shelf you should try to make the book shelf wobble. Obviously if you see an open area that looks inviting you should try and blow up the glass tube which you have walked through countless times. Another a-ha moment that would draw me into video games even farther. I would use those skills not just in other games but in life as well. During the NES and SNES era games did not have voice overs, so playing text heavy games like Final Fantasy with out a doubt helped me become a better reader. 

I have so many memories about the SNES, the first time entering Dinosaur Land in Super Mario World, being absolutely blown away by Donkey Kong Country, and using the unlimited funds cheat in Sim City. I remember Saturday mornings especially well, I would go into town with my mom and sit through hours of grocery shopping just to be able to go to the video store with her. She would pick out a movie and I would get to pick out a video game to rent. This is how I got to play some of my all time favorite games. The Mega Man X trilogy, the Donkey Kong Country games and it absolutely cemented my love for RPGs. Final Fantasy 2 and 3 of course but my top 3 RPGs have been and always will be; Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG and Earthbound. I would rent those games so many times in a row that it probably would have been cheaper if my mom just bought them for me. My heart would be devastated if someone else had rented it. I had spent so many hours playing it, what if they saved over my game? As I got older and was able to actually buy my own copies of SMRPG and Earthbound, it felt like a reunion, like I had collected back a small piece of my childhood.

I could go on and on about my memories with video games, how when I first got a PS1 my parents didn’t get me a game so I played the demo disc that came with it over and over. Cool Boarders, Medievil, Spyro and Metal Gear Solid were all playable. I played the MGS demo so much that I literally was able to do it with my eyes closed. Or how during one christmas I found my presents early and tore very small holes in the wrapping paper to discover GTA3. Video games are woven into me, and my life. After my boy was born I would play COD MW2 while he slept on me, I played with the sound on mute and had to whisper into the mic. He was my good luck charm, the only times that I was able to get the nuke was when he was sleeping on my chest. Or how about when my 6 month old baby girl was going through chemo? She did not sleep well certain nights so I would get up with her. I would hold her tight and rock her but the quickest way to get her to relax and fall back asleep was to play on my 3DS (3D off of course). She would sit on my lap and watch me play, I could feel her muscles relax and her head would nod off until she was finally back asleep. Even though it was the middle of the night I would keep playing and just enjoy feeling her breathing and knowing that she was comfortable and at ease.

Video games are a part of me, I grew with them and changed with them. I have played some games while I have experienced others. Emotions from people in completely different parts of the world were conveyed to me through images on a screen. I get so excited when I am able to find new games that I didn’t get to play growing up. Hidden gems that were forgotten or tossed aside, I get to enjoy. Will I beat most of the games? Definitely not. Will I even play most of them? Most likely not. But as I write these words down, my kids are both holding a Gameboy advance in their hands, and maybe one day my son or daughter will look through my old games and say “Hey dad will you play this with me?”

TL;DR Gamer Pride

Thinking about it now, I have beaten Chrono Trigger multiple times on multiple consoles,  buteven though I own the original carts of SMRPG and Earthbound I have yet to beat them. I think it’s time to hook up my (half yellow) SNES.",,False,self,t5_2s8fe,False,,,True,t3_1emmwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1emmwg/why_i_collect_video_games/,

Two weeks ago while doing a trade with Mavgrenade, he says that someone i Minneapolis has a Nes Sharp TV, I go check it out and spot an add for a snes kiosk. It must have just popped up and I was the first guy to email him. We talk back and forth a bit and he says... his brother has three more.



He wasn't sure of what systems or if they were the full kiosks or countertops or what their conditions were, he would go look and find out. I didn't hear from him for a week, but when I heard back he had these to show off:



http://imgur.com/a/lrT1S


I have NEVER seen a kiosk pop up in MN, let alone 4 (I don't have the snes pics from the original listing anymore) in this amazing condition.



So yesterday, with the help of a local reddit friend HeavyD, we set forth on a 6 hour round trip drive and were able to pick up all 4 kiosks.



I didn't have time to set them up, we had to keep them at my parents house for now. 



http://imgur.com/a/bKRu3



They are all really nice. The virtual boy, ps1, and n64 all have their original keys. The n64 kiosk says ""its a me! MARIO"" when you turn the system on. The ps1 and n64 both have little bars that support the covers when the system cover is open and the n64 kiosk has an audio amp circuit to support two big speakers for the kiosk. I can't wait to set all of these up at once and turn up the volume.



All in all, I paid $1500 for kiosks. Each with their original systems, demo carts, keys, and couldn't be more than happy to have these.


http://imgur.com/a/msy1O


Since reddit likes a back story, i'll tell you what I know about these. All four kiosks were taken from the Brookdale Sears in MN. They were all in the back of the store in storage until the early 2000's when the sellers brother got the OK to take all of these home. Whenever a new kiosk came along, they would put the old one in back and they started to pile up. From there, these were in the brothers house sitting around until now.",,False,self,t5_2s8fe,1358717077.0,,triforce,True,t3_16xjgx,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/16xjgx/im_not_allowed_to_buy_anything_for_awhile/,

Anyhow, there was a boy there who was about 10 years old, who had his own table set up, with SNES games - .25 cents each.

I started looking through and he said he was selling his games because he wanted to save up enough money to get Sonic Generations for his PS3.  As I continued to look through the games, I found four gems - 

Chrono Trigger,
Secret of Mana,
Super Mario RPG,
Castlevania:  Dracula X

My heart almost stopped upon seeing Dracula X, and the other three.  Anyways, I knew I had a copy of Sonic Generations at home, and asked the kid if he'd hold those four games for me, that I would be right back.

I ran back to my house and got my copy of Sonic and went back to the sale.  I showed my Sonic Generations to the kid and offered to trade him the Sonic Generations for the four SNES games.  He was EXTREMELY excited and took me off on my offer.  Just for good measure, I handed his mother a twenty on the way out, and told her those games were worth well more than what he was selling them for, and to give the kid the 20 dollars later.

TL;DR - Gave a kid a game he really wanted in exchange for four rare SNES games that I wanted, which he was selling for a quarter each.",,False,self,t5_2s8fe,False,,,True,t3_vlctr,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/vlctr/made_a_kids_day_today_while_at_the_same_time/,

1369972633.0,86,self.gamecollecting,1fdui9,Just some thoughts about collecting,104,18,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1fdui9/just_some_thoughts_about_collecting/,"So lately I've been seeing many posts of people getting their first N64, SNES, etc., and it reminds me of when I was a kid and got my first consoles. I, to this day, still open new video games for my collection like I'm 10 all over again. That feeling is just so awesome.

So why am I making this post? Well, the other day I had a really cool experience that relates to this, and I guess I hope this can give some inspiration to anyone else who wants to start a collection or can relate.

I was browsing the electronics section at goodwill, and a small boy and his dad walked through by where I was looking. The boy couldn't have been more than 5 or 6. He walked along the side I was on, holding his father's hand as he examined the things on the shelf opposite him. Watching them, the boy looked strangely familiar to me; something about the way he looked and acted reminded me of myself.

 They walked along slowly and I noticed him eyeing the jungle green N64 I was thinking of buying for an addition to my N64 system collection. The boy was tugging at his father's hand as if to say ""look"".
I could hear him softly repeating, ""Papa..."" as they were going past. His dad took a look at the price tag and paused for a little, only to say, ""maybe another day, buddy."" The boy didn't contest any, but as he walked away he looked pretty disheartened. He looked back as they turned the corner, and I picked up the N64 without a second thought and brought it to the counter along with the few other games that were with it. 

I couldn't pass up this opportunity. The only reason I love gaming now is because a family friend gave us a SNES when I was 3, and I grew up playing it constantly. As an only child, some of my fondest memories are spending weekends playing Goof Troop on SNES or Pokemon Stadium on N64 with my dad.

I looked around the store for the boy and his dad, and for a minute I didn't think I was going to find them. Looking out the glass doors I saw them walking through the parking lot. I went out the door with haste in an effort to catch up. I knew what I wanted to say, but I didn't really know how to say it; I just handed him the bag and said, ""Here. This is for him. He deserves it."" 

It feels so awesome knowing that the boy might grow up to love video games like I did, and I know anyone else that grew up playing SM64 or other great titles knows the great memories these games can bring. 

**In Conclusion/TL;DR**- If you get the chance, share your collection with others who haven't been introduced to video games -- especially kids. You could be the inspiration for a fun childhood and an awesome life.


Edit: Thanks for the gold! I hope everyone can take something away from this story :) 

Edit 2: Since I sort of missed this part of the story, here's what happened with the father's reaction (copied from my earlier comment):
""Yeah, I guess that's sort of an important part I missed now that I think about it. Well when I gave him the bag, I'm certain that the he knew exactly what it was... He definitely appreciated it as a gift too and didn't seem disappointed I bought it as others might, because the way he told the boy they couldn't buy it made me think that it wasn't because it was ""another toy he didn't need"" or something. They probably didn't have a ton of money to spend, because I got the impression that he really wanted to buy it for the boy, but maybe couldn't.
I didn't want him to try to pay me or anything though, so I just smiled and walked away, but I did see that he took it out of the bag and was showing it to the boy as I was approaching my car. The huge yet calm and collected smile on the boy's face was priceless, and that was when I knew for sure that it was totally worth it.""",,False,self,t5_2s8fe,1370028137.0,,,True,t3_1fdui9,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1fdui9/just_some_thoughts_about_collecting/,

I used to be an active member of another site that grew from around 8,000 members (when I joined) to over 300,000 members.  Every community hits a point where the members have answered the same question enough times that they get sick of it and start treating new members like dirt.

Judging from the dump truck of downvotes I see applied to many harmless inquiries, I think we're getting to that point.  Take [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1bbncp/how_much_are_my_games_worth/), for example.  Nice guy.  Clearly new.  On his phone (not that anyone bothered to ask).  Just had a quick question that I quickly and easily answered.  I'm usually pretty proud of our community. ...can't say I'm very proud of the merciless downvoting lately...

I know it's annoying to answer the same question over and over, but it just comes with the territory.  Remember that you might've answered the question 100 times, but the person posting is usually asking it for the first time.

Find of the year for me and I thought I'd share.

EDIT: Like every find whether it be big or small, you can't prove how much you paid for it. I live my life being an honest guy and the act of fleecing a niche audience on a sub isn't something I have time to do. Like I said the negative feedback leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I subscribe to this sub because there are people who dig the same thing I do and that's rad. When you get sour grapes it brings you down and makes you wonder if the community you were a part of is really that great at all.
