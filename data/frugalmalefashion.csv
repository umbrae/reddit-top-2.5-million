I love this subreddit. I've found some of the best deals through it, and this subreddit exists, at least I believe it exists, to help people find good deals on fashion. That being said, there's been a pretty noticeable uptick in ""OMG look what I found at a thrift store!"" posts recently and that does nobody on this subreddit any good. I'm happy that folks have found good stuff and thrifting is definitely a frugal option, but this subreddit isn't about flaunting what you bought at a frugal price. Instead it's about sharing deals with the community.

So I guess this is a request to the mods and the community as a whole: lets stop the karmawhoring and actually share deals with members of the community. I'm glad people got a deal thrifting (I've got a pair of Allen Edmonds that testify to the perks of thrifting), but it doesn't do the community any good to make a post bragging about it. 

EDIT: Well this blew up a bit. Excellent! Thanks for the discussion. The general sentiment I'm getting is  that most people don't like the posts I was talking about. For those that want to keep them, the main reason is that seeing the finds is inspiration to go thrifting. If that's the main reason, then could we just sidebar some thrift finds or maybe have a Frugal FAQ in the sidebar that talks about thrifting, along with other things?",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,1351185124.0,,,True,t3_121vh1,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/121vh1/meta_can_we_please_stop_posting_or_can_mods/,

&gt;""I just subscribed and can't seem to be able to afford most of these deals :(""

&gt;Honestly, it sounds like you're using FMF in the least frugal way possible. Don't read the sub seeing what deals you could get - rather, decide what you want/need to buy first, then watch FMF for sales, deals and/or promotions on that.

How many times have you read someone joke about how their bank account is being bled dry by all the good deals?  There's obviously an element of truth there, and in my opinion, ""I can't afford all these deals"" and ""I'd never pay that much for something"" are both from folks who are **using FMF in absolutely the wrong way.** 

But there *is* a right way to use FMF, and I'd argue that its the only truly frugal way.  Here's what I wrote in a different comment earlier tonight -

&gt;If you were in the market for a pair of Rancourts, wouldn't you be ecstatic to find them for almost $100 off?

Likewise, 

&gt;Think about it this way - if you'd been looking or saving for a pair of Oak Street loafers (and plenty of folks are), then wouldn't you be ecstatic to see this sale? If you were planning to buy them anyway, isn't is absolutely more frugal to get them for $150 off than to pay full-price?

1356054502.0,419,self.frugalmalefashion,1579zs,A Basic Guide To Target (Xpost MFA),502,83,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1579zs/a_basic_guide_to_target_xpost_mfa/,"**I was asked by several people to cross-post my guide to shopping at Target to this subreddit in addition to MFA, as such, I have done so. [Check out the original for loads of comments and stuff.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15649d/a_basic_guide_to_target/)**

Where I live there are quite literally Targets everywhere, including one less than 2 minutes away from my apartment. [Google and Microsoft Paint help illustrate this.](http://i.imgur.com/zZyos.jpg). This works for me, since I don't have to set foot in Walmart very often, and I like their clothes.

Because of the amount of time I've spent in Target, and on their website, and items of clothing I've tried on and purchased, I have some knowledge about what is good, what is bad, and how to win at Target. I'm going to outline what you can and should purchase, what to avoid, and most importantly, when to purchase certain things.

**Brands at Target**
 
While there are plenty of different clothing brands in Target, only three are really worth noting. Most others are either confined to athletic clothing, or should be avoided- like Denizen denim. These three are Mossimo, Merona, and Converse One Star.
 
**Mossimo Supply Co.** is Target's [younger](http://i.imgur.com/dMFvQ.jpg), [brighter brand](http://i.imgur.com/gbjAa.jpg), with more modern fits. Of late the brand has become [increasingly colorful](http://i.imgur.com/3fx7y.jpg), though while [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/6eE9O.jpg) and hoodies are plentiful, the brand has less outerwear than either other brand, which is too bad. Mossimo is great for picking up some basic items, and the value for the money is great on lots of them- but not all.
 
Fit is [""athletic""](http://i.imgur.com/ZZM9v.jpg) on lots of things, which means tapered through the waist with more room in the shoulders. This means their t-shirts fit particularly well, and their button downs fit closer than Merona or Converse. Occasionally the wording is less accurate, or just wrong- like their [twill 5-pocket pants](http://i.imgur.com/k5rYo.jpg) that boast a ""relaxed fit"" in areas. These pants are not relaxed. Jackets are also a little weird, with similar items sometimes fitting very differently. Their filled windbreaker fits me fine as a small, but a similar looking [hooded windbreaker](http://i.imgur.com/GJnKV.jpg) is unattractively large at the same size.
 
As mentioned, [tees](http://i.imgur.com/PONEW.jpg) are [probably](http://i.imgur.com/30i2p.jpg) the [best](http://i.imgur.com/Twcbl.jpg) Mossimo [item](http://i.imgur.com/i2bWR.jpg). The fit is [great](http://i.imgur.com/ay5vb.jpg), the colors are [solid](http://i.imgur.com/tYOos.jpg), and the quality is very [good](http://i.imgur.com/5higo.jpg) for ~$10. Mine never seem to shrink or stretch, and I've been complimented lots of times on these tees. [Layering items](http://i.imgur.com/yGEtu.jpg), like [henleys](http://i.imgur.com/vXrdy.jpg), [baseball shirts](http://i.imgur.com/Xf1dF.jpg), and [hoodies](http://i.imgur.com/kldHR.jpg) are similar in quality and fit, and come in a wide array of colors. [Mossimo pants](http://i.imgur.com/KEYvX.jpg), including cords, are decent quality for the price, and fit slim. [Other items](http://i.imgur.com/fs0pd.jpg) like [flannel shirts](http://i.imgur.com/bHhp8.jpg) are also good, though some items stray into poorly stylized or gaudy territory. [Unique socks](http://i.imgur.com/eRuJ0.jpg) have been a staple of Mossimo for about a year now, and for ~$3 a pair you can have dinosaurs, stripes, and other awesome things on your feet. They aren't Richer Poorer quality, but they beat H&amp;M easily, and can up your sock game on the cheap. 

Other items of note: [Cords that are $20-$25, and come in lots of colors](http://i.imgur.com/KZW2B.jpg), or [this kick-ass camo shirt](http://i.imgur.com/J6BYt.jpg).

[Full Album of Mossimo Picks](http://imgur.com/a/xCXTG)
 
**Merona** is Target's more formal brand, aimed at everyone from [young professionals](http://i.imgur.com/BmPek.jpg), through [regular professionals](http://i.imgur.com/j6RMS.jpg). Fit is more generous than Mossimo, but not across the board. Merona has plenty of items in ['classic' colors](http://i.imgur.com/rWxGi.jpg), like [navy](http://i.imgur.com/NpLZU.jpg), [tan](http://i.imgur.com/Vvakm.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/kHiFu.jpg), and [black](http://i.imgur.com/vFJCz.jpg), and of late has added [brighter](http://i.imgur.com/aZnZM.jpg) [colors](http://i.imgur.com/kmWSZ.jpg) to a number of items. They provide an entry-level selection for plenty of [business-casual](http://i.imgur.com/3lZJm.jpg) [items](http://i.imgur.com/1YSM4.jpg), though they also feature a number of Target's ""avoid at all costs"" pieces.
 
A bunch of Merona items feature a ""tailored fit"", which as far as I'm concerned means that they stitched a ""tailored fit"" tag to the item. The same way my 'relaxed thigh and leg' Mossimo pants and not relaxed, Merona is generally not ""tailored"". I'n particular a pair of ""tailored fit"" chinos fit in the waist, and were baggy everywhere else. A [medium sweater](http://i.imgur.com/NLrIX.jpg) may fit too large, and be next to a [medium cardigan](http://i.imgur.com/ekoKe.jpg) that fits perfectly, next to a [medium jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tb0sy.jpg) which fits like a small. Generally *a* size will probably work, but occasionally you'll wish that XS and MS existed in men's at Target.
 
Merona [""Ultimate Dress Shirts""](http://i.imgur.com/O97sP.jpg) get touted on Dappered often, and are decent for the price. Their [peacoats](http://i.imgur.com/CN2A8.jpg) are also good for the price, and actually fit better than many other items in the line. Their [Kensington blazer](http://i.imgur.com/BHlDu.jpg) is a versatile piece that is totally unstructured, and made from decent fabric- but fit can vary color to color, and even piece to piece. There are also [Merona](http://i.imgur.com/Kdha9.jpg) [accessories](http://i.imgur.com/vCc5a.jpg) which are not bad for the price, don't buy the ties though- they're overpriced and unimpressive.

Other items of note: [Twill shirt that is thick enough to be a light jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tzBT4.jpg), [Weekend bag that is extremely attractive for $25-$30](http://i.imgur.com/t7rBv.jpg), [Unique summer belt](http://i.imgur.com/l9ydK.jpg), [$4 beanies that feel like *at least* $8 beanies](http://i.imgur.com/AmRnd.jpg).

[Full Album of Merona Picks](http://imgur.com/a/5xi5C) 

**Converse One Star** is Target's smaller, more ['edgy'](http://i.imgur.com/ImBoW.jpg) brand, pulling inspiration from the [military](http://i.imgur.com/Rr4mS.jpg) and [motorcycles](http://i.imgur.com/Zc3La.jpg). The brand is deliberately intended to be more [casual](http://i.imgur.com/G0f49.jpg), and more [grungy](http://i.imgur.com/leotA.jpg) than Mossimo, and while the styles are more [unique](http://i.imgur.com/EgWiY.jpg), the [colors](http://i.imgur.com/jl68J.jpg) are [muted](http://i.imgur.com/DH5CK.jpg). [Olive](http://i.imgur.com/HcMLx.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/Cu15H.jpg), [black](http://i.imgur.com/29wTR.jpg), [cream](http://i.imgur.com/acmsN.jpg), and occasionally [browns](http://i.imgur.com/Lblti.jpg) tend to make up most of the Converse line, which can be a bit disappointing, as [brighter colors](http://i.imgur.com/1y5RJ.jpg) would lend themselves awesomely well to some items. As with the other lines, there have been some interesting inclusions in the Converse line, most notably [$30 selvadge jeans](http://i.imgur.com/RBXpg.jpg) in the recent past.
 
Fit in general tends to be a bit big, with tees and henleys fitting larger than same-size Mossimo, and other items sharing some of the size disparity that makes trying items key. An extreme example is this [field coat](http://i.imgur.com/VWvlJ.jpg). A small is actually a little big on me, fitting less close than my medium Uniqlo mountain parka. It's also pretty long, which looks good on my 6'2"" frame, but I imagine a 5'9"" guy weighing 150lbs would be dwarfed in the thing.
 
The cloth on their [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/TDTTB.jpg) is soft and [comfortable](http://i.imgur.com/qcsyw.jpg), with more [character](http://i.imgur.com/IZ3XA.jpg) than either other brand, and the [construction](http://i.imgur.com/UsA5h.jpg) on most items is a bit better too. There have been occasional accessory items under the brand, such as this [weekend bag](http://i.imgur.com/qCIsx.jpg), that aren't bad- though I'd remove branding.

Do you guys remember the thread(s) about Woodies sunglasses a while back? I just want to tell you about my experience with them, to warn you. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I ordered a pair of the light grain sunglasses on January 29, 2013. There were issues with shipping, but after exchanging some emails, it all worked out. They ultimately got to me about two or three weeks later. Whatever, that's not a big deal, and it's not why I'm writing this. It was very obvious early on that they were fragile. They were light and somewhat flimsy. That's not why I'm writing this either.

After I got them, I had them for a very short time before they broke. I had them in my backpack, in the same pocket I had my insulin pump in (I'm diabetic). I mention that because if the pump gets damaged, I could wind up in the hospital, if that shows you how good of care I took of these sunglasses. But alas, they still found a way to break. 

I emailed the company for the first time about the possibility of returning them on February 27. I did not receive a response. I emailed again, this time as a reply to an earlier email that I had from one of their representatives, because I know they could receive emails from there since there had been an entire conversation in that thread. Still, no response. 

In the 43 days since I sent my initial email, I have tweeted to them, to which I actually got a response of ""sorry jeff, I just checked..I see your orders but no other emails."" They wound up giving me another email address to write to. I have sent a total of 8 emails to the company through all of this, and had two twitter conversations with them during which I gave them my email address. I have received auto-responses saying they would get back to me, so I know they have received some of the emails, but I have still not gotten any reply whatsoever from an actual person via email, and they have avoided the issue on twitter, repeatedly deflecting it back to email.

I want to say that I understand that others of you have probably had more positive experiences with them, and I'm happy for you. This is just my experience. But I wanted to be sure to let others know about how their ""customer service"" is, in case they were on the fence about buying their sunglasses. Feel free to buy them, but don't expect any help if they break.

Again, sorry for the wall of text. I'm just upset that a company can charge $100 for a product that is complete shit (again, just my experience) and then ignore you when you want them to make it right. I will admit I did let my emotions get the better of me at times when I was emailing them, and that is obviously my fault. But it is no excuse for how they conduct business.

They ignore their customers in private, but on public forums they act as though they try to fix the situation because others can see how they do things there. I promise you, however, that they do not actually try to fix things. Don't waste your money with these people. Their product is crappy, and so is their customer service.

Also, in case you are wondering, yes, I do have proof of the emails I have sent.

1371664036.0,269,self.frugalmalefashion,1go2jt,FMF Sale Guide: Banana Republic,316,47,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1go2jt/fmf_sale_guide_banana_republic/,"*A quick sale guide to explain the madness that is Banana Republic. If you're new to FMF, and especially Banana Republic, you may find this useful in explaining what exactly is on sale/a deal at the Gap owned store.*


Banana Republic’s popularity stems largely from their ability to hit a wide demographic, with a large range of clothes, in a variety of styles, at a somewhat reasonable price. But, like so many other retailers now, they play the “always on sale” game. This guide should help clear up some confusion about when you're really getting a good deal at BR.

***Golden rule: Never pay MSRP.*** Banana Republic has a ridiculously inflated “full price”, and that’s partly due to there always-on-sale methodology (along with attempting to position themselves as a premium mall-brand i.e. J Crew). In the last six months as a heavy shopper of BR I could count the number of days where no sale of some sort was active on both hands. This is heavily caveated however, as a large number of items are often excluded from these sales. Notably: Blazers, Suiting, specific types of shoes, some chinos, collections, etc. You’ll have to simply read the fine print of the sale to know when and what isn't included. Please note that the online often has MORE exclusions than in-store, so say you want those bright red Emerson chinos, you might have to truck into a retail location. With this knowledge, what is actually a good sale at Banana Republic? ***Normally no less than 40% off full-retail should be considered.*** Of course, if ANY sale works on the often excluded items (specifically Blazers and Suiting come to mind), it’s likely as good a deal you can get. Below are a few of the better sale-types BR puts on.


* ***The 40% Off One Full Priced Item (One day only; Online &amp; In-Store)***

   Ran weekly during some months and usually on Wednesdays, BR will offer a flat 40% off any single item at full price (usual exclusions mentioned above apply). You can often get this in your email by signing up for there mailing list This is, as said, the bare minimum one should expect from Banana Republic. It brings most shirting down to around $40-30 (a good deal if the slim or tailored-slim fits are good off-the-rack for you), and chinos in the same range. Also not bad to use on some basic essential items like socks, boxers, belts, etc.


* ***The Cookie-Driven Online Only % Off (Online only)***

   By far BR’s most annoying sale-type, is a flat % off items (again exclusions) based on a generated value in the cookie the website stores when you visit them. So while one person may only get 30% off, another could get 45%, simply based on random draw. As stupid as that sounds, it’s luckily a fairly easy thing to work around by either a) Delete your BananaRepublic.com cookies and revisiting the site until you get the maximum value or b) Altering the cookie-string with a browser add-on. As a Chrome user I use Edit This Cookie. [Here's a guide to do this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1h70tz/bananarepubliccoms_cookiedriven_sale_modification/)


* ***The Friends &amp; Family Sale (Online &amp; In-Store)***

   Held twice a year, this is by far BR’s best and most-lucrative sale. Only available to those who get it given to them by employees (of which they‘re limited to a certain number), this sale has NO exclusions. The last F&amp;F sale was held in March (normally in November again I believe) and had a discount of: 50% off up to five full-priced items in-store only and 30% flat off online. This of course, is a great bargain on the exclusion items not found in other sales. It may take a little begging to generous BR employees online or schmoozing up your local stores to get access.


* ***The % Off Sale Items (Online &amp; In-Store)***

   Another sale where you have to be willing to show some patience and play your local stores, but probably one of the more rewarding. Sometimes up to 30% off marked-down items will pop up, both online and off. If you’re a diligent store hawk, you can find some good deals in the clearance section of your local stores. Items that have hung around too long can be severely discounted already, and this code will stack. I've nabbed $15 dress shirts and $20 wool pants from these. Do note that some will be tagged as “Final Sale” and can’t be returned. Online merchandise is never marked as Final Sale to my knowledge.


* ***A word about the Banana Republic Card***

   Normally, store credit cards aren't worth the trouble they can cause. BR is one of the few I think has some serious merit of considering if you’re a frequent shopper. On your first use of the card you get 15% off, a bonus that stacks with other sales (at least, it did when I opened mine). After that, you earn 5 points for every $1 you spend at BR/Gap/Old Navy. At 1000 points, you earn $10 in rewards, or working out to $10 every $200 you spend. However, very often they'll run double and triple points day, quickly reducing how much you need to spend to earn the credit. After you spend $800 with the card, you’re upgraded to “Luxe” status, which has free shipping on all online orders and some exclusive sales (not very notable however). As always, please be financially responsible when taking out for ANY credit card. The APR on these things is through the roof and they should really be paid off every month.


As stores alter sale types and plans, I’ll aim to keep this updated with whatever newfangled hassle BR can dream up to put on us.

I have been for a long time. I've been addicted to this subreddit for a long time now, and I want to help others here enjoy frugal shopping the same way I do. This is going to be rambling, but who cares. I hope it sparks a bit of dialog.

* Whenever you buy something, check for promo codes. If you find that a promo code cannot be entered for whatever reason (site doesn't allow multiple promo codes, it has expired, promo code doesn't work for your region, item(s), or whatever) try emailing and calling customer service. They often times will apply promo codes for you that the website will not allow. I've saved a ton this way. While I do not condone fraud (I see recommendations for committing fraud all the time on here), I think as long as you are honest in what you are trying to do, and the customer service rep does it for you that is fine. I never lie to get additional promos added.

* always check for student or corporate discounts.

* I've even gotten free shipping just by calling customer service and asking if I could have free shipping.

* if an item is available for less after you already purchased it, email or call customer service to see if they will apply the difference.

* before you buy anything check ebay for coupons. you can often times call customer service and they will apply these coupons even if you dont physically have them. if they dont, the coupons are usually pretty cheap on ebay. a buck or two.

* check out the different gift card websites. gift cards are an awesome way to save because they always stack with other sales/promos. I have only used [cardpool](http://www.cardpool.com/), but there are others out there.

* fill out surveys, sign up for company's mailing list (physical and email), like on facebook, follow on instagram and twitter, and call/email companies to get all the promos you can. whenever you have a bad experience with a website or customer service, let them know. I've gotten tons of $5-15 gift cards from sites just because I let them know I was let down by   their site/service. Again, I am always honest.

* ebay is awesome! work on refining your searches to match exactly what you want and then save the search and have the results emailed to you daily. I've gotten killer deals on things when people have buy it now prices too low.

* another ebay tip is to always ask questions when in doubt. I've found sweaters listed as larges that when I asked them to measure they turned out to be the sizes of mediums (things shrink, people make mistakes listing, etc..). Dont trust sizes, trust measurements.

* another ebay tip is to check out their [Fashion Outlet](http://www.ebay.com/fashion/outlet/) that is how I found out about the killer [Hart Schaffner Marx](http://stores.ebay.com/Hart-Schaffner-Marx-Store) sales. It is still going on and they just added more! they probably will continue adding items until MSM goes out of business. I've bought over $500 from MSM's ebay fashion outlet and I couldn't be happier about every item I've received.

* another ebay tip is to not get emotional when bidding. if you get outbid be absolutely sure you want to increase your bid. I virtually never increase mine. I wait until another, better, deal comes up. If you are patient you will get really great stuff for cheap. It defeats the whole purpose if you over bid because you really wanted to win the auction.

* just because something is a good deal doesn't mean you should buy it. Only buy what you would wear (or what you are sure that you can  resell for more). If you already have some CDBs, dont go buying a cheap pair of chukkas just because they are $10 or something. Sure, everyone needs a pair of beater footwear, but dont make the same mistake I did and end up with 10 pairs of shoes you've never worn just because they were cheap. What a waste of money! I really wish I would have thought about if I would actually wear them before I bought them all. I also dont ever buy from old navy, asos, or aldo anymore. I have never gotten anything from those stores that I wear. Sure, it's cheap, but it's also shit. Why would you want to wear cheap looking clothes that look terrible? I wouldnt even wear most of their stuff if it was given to me for free.

* thrift as much as possible. if you dont know your style yet, thrift like crazy. buy as much stuff as you can for cheap and you'll figure out what works for you and what doesn't. You could save even more money if you just do research. google and read mfa to find out the styles you want to go for. Once you have your style, you can really be frugal, since you can buy things that you know you will wear.

* Only buy things that you will wear. If something is the wrong color, size, texture, shape, or if you already have a better alternative that you will always wear instead of it, or if it doesn't match your style or doesn't fit in your wardrobe, dont buy it! I have a pair of blue suede shoes that I've never worn. they were a great deal, but the color and style of the shoe is something I would never wear. I regret that purchase a lot.

* Buy things that work with your existing wardrobe. dont buy things that you hope to one day include in to an outfit. in my experience, that day will never come. Once you know your style and what colors, textures, items you need for it, you will be able to buy things that you are sure will get plenty of use. I see a lot of people in waywt posts that dont have any particular style. It must be a nightmare to know what items to buy and their items cant be very versatile in their wardrobe. This is really important. If you are stretching yourself too thin across too many styles it's going to be costly to complete the different looks. It's better to focus on one look and nail that, then to try to mimic everyone else's looks.

* learn to sew. or at least tailor everything. if something doesn't fit you probably wont wear it, or you will buy another similar item hoping that it looks better. just get the first item to fit from the start.

* when buying work boots wait until factory seconds are available. I've gotten most of my boots from factory second sales. Why would I care if there is a nick in the boot? After the first week of wearing them there will be plenty of nicks. buying new boots is like spending an extra $100+ so that they look nice for that first week. doesnt make sense to me.

* check out all of the [flash sale websites](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/12i2v2/the_flash_sales_and_affordable_shops_megapost/) and keep checking the sale sections of your favorite sites. Being early to sales is really key to getting the hot items before they sell out. check out bargain sites like [sierra trading post](http://www.sierratradingpost.com/)

* know what you want. think out the looks you want to complete and have a list of items you need. keep that list in mind while checking out sales. If you dont know what you want, then it's easy to buy tons of stuff that wont help your wardrobe. having too much stuff can easily stretch your wardrobe out too much and you will loose focus and it will become much harder to be frugal. I used to be really bad at this.

* levis are a great starting point for jeans. until you are ready to spend real cash on denim, I would stick with levis. you can find them on the clearance rack of jcpennys for $20 or often find them online for sale at around $35 a pair.

* shop the clearance racks. items who's season just ended often hit the clearance racks. if possible, buy things like coats at the end of winter, and shorts at the end of summer. you could easily save 50% or more of your wardrobe costs if you do this.

* buy wigwam over smartwool. I've gotten wigwam boot socks 3 pairs for $2 at walmart's clearance isle in the middle of summer. outside of that, I wigwam can be found for ~$5 a pair on sale. I dont think smartwool gets that low.

* all you really need to look good is jeans, tshirts, boots, and a jacket. you could have a killer wardrobe for $1000. if this is a style that interests you...

* if a company messes up, do not pay for the return shipping or restock fee. I've had email conversations with customer service reps that have lasted weeks, and which they said they would not pay for the return shipping over and over when the problem was the fault of the company. If you are in the right, you need to be persistant with these bastards. Some companies are really bad with trying to enforce a policy in situations where it doesn't make sense. If they've messed up, you shouldn't have to pay anything. even the policy stated return shipping or restock fee.

1355510856.0,239,self.frugalmalefashion,14us7h,Tip for patient people shopping shoes or apparel or anything - Regularly check Amazon Warehouse Deals,291,52,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/14us7h/tip_for_patient_people_shopping_shoes_or_apparel/,"Some of you that already troll the Amazon warehouse deals are probably cursing me right now, but you have to spread the love from time to time.  

[Link](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=1267877011)

So you hit that main warehouse deals page and search for whatever.  Sometime's there's nothing if you have a specific brand in mind (Currently Chippewa comes up empty).  The way it works is these are typically returns so they could be an open box or even worn for weeks before returned.  But you're still purchasing from Amazon so you have the same return policy as buying new.  At worst you're out the time invested in returning them if there's a problem.

For instance, after some quick searching I see: 

Red Wing 8196 boots, size 11 D for $140.24.  
Clark's Desert Boots in beeswax, size 10.5 D for $51.31
Thorogood black moc toe boots with white wedge sole, size 10.5 D for $63.12

The patience part comes into play once you realize that the longer an item is available the cheaper it gets.  Slowly (as in days between drops) the price is lowered in small amounts until its purchased.  If you find something that's not already at an incredible discount, then my advice is to determine your preferred price and wait it out.  If someone buys higher then good for them.

Happy hunting.

Amazon is a fantastic website, however clothing would definitely rank as one of its weaknesses. If you do want to go to Amazon for mfa purposes, whether it's because of convenience, Amazon Prime, or just needing to use up those Amazon Gift Cards, here are some of my most ""MFA"" suggestions.

**MyHabit**

http://www.myhabit.com/

One of the easiest places to start this is with MyHabit. This is a separate website from Amazon, but it is owned by Amazon and therefore you can use your Amazon Gift Cards here. MyHabit is a ""flash sale/sale-a-day"" type of website, with different deals from designers that will only last a specified amount of time. It works similarly to sites like PLNDR, Gilt, Haute Look, and Beyond the Rack. While it is often filled with junk not worth your money, good sales can come up. If you absolutely want to spend an Amazon Gift Card on *clothing* this would be your best bet.


**Pants**

Amazon has some of the commonly suggested ""MFA Beginner"" pant options available.

* [Levi 511](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Mens-Tumbled-Night-30x30/dp/B004PLNFES/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357500838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=levi+511)

* [Dockers Alpha Khaki](http://www.amazon.com/Dockers-Mens-Alpha-Steelhead-30x30/dp/B005PQ7R1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357500874&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dockers+alpha)

**Shoes/Boots**

In my opinion, shoes and boots are one of the best ways that you can spend an Amazon Gift Card. In addition to the importance of shoes to an outfit, Amazon can have some great deals on shoes that MFA loves. Makes sure to have read and understood the [Shoe Guide](http://redd.it/p7usf) and [Boot Guide](http://redd.it/z2quy).

* [Allen Edmonds](http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Edmonds/e/2373666011) - Allen Edmonds is an MFA favorite for dress shoes. While currently full price, sometimes they even do fantastic sales that bring many popular shoes, including AE Strand, down to $200 shipped free with prime.

* [Red Wing](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=brand_abn_6?ie=UTF8&amp;bbn=679255011&amp;rh=n%3A672123011%2Cp_4%3ARed%20Wing%20Shoes%2Cn%3A679255011%2Cn%3A679307011&amp;rnid=679255011) - One of, if not MFA's #1 boot choice would of course be Red Wings. Amazon has these, once again shipped free with Prime.

* [Clarks Desert Boots](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Boot/dp/B0007MCUTK) - One of the most recommended and most mocked shoe in the history of MFA, I'm sure most of you know all about it already. If this shoe is something you want, Amazon has it, and generally is lowest price around for them.

* [Thorogood Moc Toe](http://www.amazon.com/Thorogood-814-4200-Moc-Toe-Boot/dp/B002QQ8XRI/ref=pd_sbs_shoe_1) - Though less commonly recommended than Red Wings or Clarks, this shoe also has a good reputation on MFA. High quality and American made, with a great workwear look. Less than half of the price of comparable Red Wings, with similar (although lesser) quality.

**Watches**

Watches are another item that Amazon is known to do particularly well in. However, I don't know much about watches, but /r/watches would be a fantastic resource to learn about what you should be looking for. I can recommend two traditional MFA favorites however.

* [Timex Weekender](http://www.amazon.com/Timex-T2N651KW-Weekender-Olive-Through/dp/B004VR9HP2/ref=sr_1_4?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336676816&amp;sr=1-4) and [Timex Easy Reader](http://www.amazon.com/Timex-T2H281-Reader-Leather-Silver-Tone/dp/B000AYYIYU/ref=sr_1_1?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336704944&amp;sr=1-1) - These are the two ""MFA Beginners"" watches that are frequently recommended. They're cheap, look good, and work well. 

* [Seiko 5](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?rh=n%3A377110011&amp;keywords=seiko+5+automatic) - Frequently seen suggested to beginners as an intro or first watch with a mechanical movement.

**Personal Care**

While not technically ""fashion"", a big part of looking good is taking care of your body.

* Shaving Supplies - If you're into straight edge or double edge shaving, /r/wicked_edge has tons of info. If you're looking to get started and need to buy the supplies, Amazon can be a good source. Check out /r/wicked_edge's starter kits on their sidebar, or [search for ""amazon""](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/search?q=amazon&amp;restrict_sr=on) and you'll find some good information.

* Skin Care - Skin care is also of course super important. Read [Veroz's guide to skincare](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/t0yzd/a_guide_to_taking_care_of_your_face/) and check out the [sensitive/oily](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ton7l/alternative_skincare_guide_sensitiveoily_skin/) guide as well. Both of these guides have tons of Amazon links to products that will keep your face looking as good as your clothes.

* Hair product - Read some hair product reviews, like the ones [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf90n/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_4_product/) and find out what you need, odds are Amazon has it.

**Clothing Care**

Once again, not technically fashion, but once you've got all your clothes and shoes, you still need to take care of them.

* [Shoe Rack](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=shoe+rack) - You gotta put all your shoes somewhere, right?

* Shoe Care - Amazon is a decent place to stock up on polish, cremes, and everything else you need to keep any of your leather shoes looking their best.

* [Drying Rack](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=drying+rack) - If you have the room for one, buy one. Hang drying your clothes, particularly the clothes you care about, will make a world of difference in the longevity of your items.

* [Iron](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=iron) - Looking wrinkly is bad.

* [Steamer](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_hi_3?rh=n%3A1055398%2Cn%3A%211063498%2Cn%3A510240%2Cn%3A510248&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357500642&amp;ajr=0) - Amazon has tons of steamers, and if you can afford one I'd get one. Tons easier than ironing (although you'll still need an iron on hand for some wrinkles).

It was a non-wrinkle Van Heusen in my sleeve length and neck width, but as you can see from the [before and after shots](http://imgur.com/a/GP80g), it was made for someone huge in the arms and midsection. Also, as I found out when trying to do the measurements on the shirt, it was rather poorly constructed, so rather than measuring straight across as the guide says, I had to improvise and mark from the center of the shirt out to each side. Pretty much followed all the rest of the directions, and just did an overstitch job after cutting the excess since I didn't have any pinking shears.

All in all, it's by no means a pro job, but I'm pretty pleased with the result, especially since it's a shirt I wouldn't have worn any more after reading this subreddit and MFA and learning how clothes should fit, but now I can wear it again.

1341097293.0,202,self.frugalmalefashion,vuyb7,Simple guide to tailoring/slimming/taking in your shirt [X-post from r/malefashionadvice],248,46,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/vuyb7/simple_guide_to_tailoringslimmingtaking_in_your/,"Someone suggested I cross-post this here. [Here's the original post on r/malefasionadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/vuhd4/simple_guide_to_tailoringslimmingtaking_in_your/)

Taking in a shirt really isn't too hard to do, but I'm not a fan of the 'pinch and pin' method that is often described elsewhere on the web. It's too easy to add asymmetry to the shirt. I prefer to measure and mark how much I'm going to remove. Plus, I would try this first with a shirt that you're o.k. getting rid of; while slimming your shirts isn't hard, it does take a little practice to get perfect. Here's the basics along with some important points:

***Keep in mind that if the shoulders of your shirt are too big (i.e., too wide from shoulder seam to seam), they can't really be fixed and your shirt will never really look right.***

For demonstration, I will be taking in [this white OCBD](http://imgur.com/xFazm). It doesn't fit me awful, but [it's about 4-5 inches too big around in the stomach](http://imgur.com/jFZFK) and throughout the rest of the torso (albeit not as bad). It's also [too baggy in the arms](http://imgur.com/CUMS8). We'll fix that at the same time. Ultimate, [we are going to replace the entire seam along the side of the shirt](http://imgur.com/Qx2J4). The existing seam is called a 'flat felled seam'. It's fairly complicated to make, and trying to 'tie into it' would never look quite right, so I'm just going to replace the whole seam with a simple straight stitch. 

First put on the shirt, and using a tailor's tape (those flexible measuring tapes tailors use to take measurements) measure the circumference of your torso at your armpits and each button on the shirt below your armpits. Write these numbers down. **I use the same mantra in tailoring that I do in woodworking - measure twice, cut once.**

For a nice slim shirt, I use the following calculation to find the new width across the shirt (in inches) at each point you just measured on your body: width = (circumference+5)/2. This width will give you about 1 inch of pinched fabric on each side of you. Note that for a looser fit, just change the 5 to 6.

Based on my measurements and these calculations, the width of my shirt should be 21.5"", 20.25"", 19.25"", 19.0"", 20"", and 21"" starting at the button at armpit level and working down. 

Completely button your shirt, turn it inside out, and place the shirt flat on the ground or a table (not your bed, it's too lumpy). Using your tape, and starting at the armpit, mark the new width of your shirt. I basically move the tape up the shirt until the [width at the armpit seam equals the width you want](http://imgur.com/atgdP). Note that altering the shirt in the manner I describe will raise the armpits. Mark this spot on both sides of the shirt. I use tailor's chalk, or in this case a fabric marking pen, which you can pick up at Walmart for a few bucks. Once again, measure twice (notice I messed up the first time, hence the extra marks). 

Continue to mark the width of the shirt at each [button below the armpit](http://imgur.com/eO5kB). Keep in mind that you can always take away more fabric, never less. So if you are unsure, start with a wider shirt; you can always go back and slim the shirt some more. Finally, the width of your shirt probably shouldn't change by more than 1"" per button, so if you have a very 'hourglass' figure, you might not want to slim the shirt too much in the thinnest areas.

Ultimately, I made the width of my shirt 21.5"" at the armpit, then 20.5"", 19.5"", 19.5"", 20"", and 21"" at the last button (which is where the shirt ends at the hip).

Now, [connect all the dots.](http://imgur.com/njFe7)

You'll also have to slim the sleeves somewhat. Again, there's no way around it since we are replacing the whole seam. Measure the circumference of your bicep (don't flex) at it's widest point. The width of your sleeve at this point will be: width=(circumference+3)/2. Again, this will give you about 1 inch of pinched fabric at your bicep; change the 3 to a 4 for a looser fit or if you've got really big guns when flexed. My measurement suggests that I should use a 7.5"" width, but I'm going to use an 8"" width. 

Place the tape measure perpendicular to the top of the sleeve and such that it crosses the bottom of the sleeve about 2 inches from the armpit. [Now measure down from the top of the sleeve to your new width and mark the sleeve at this point.](http://imgur.com/K3RRk)

Connect these markings with those at the armpit and [the seam at the end of the sleeve](http://imgur.com/nVTrp). At the end of the sleeve, you want the new width of the sleeve to equal the old width. Because you'll by tying the new seam into the old seam at this point, it will look a little odd, but absolutely no one is going to notice.

[Here's my shirt all marked up.](http://imgur.com/GeALJ)

Time to start sewing. I [start at the armpit to make sure the armpit seams from both sides of the shirt meet perfectly](http://imgur.com/as6NB). Basically, using a straight stitch I start at the armpit and sew towards the end of the sleeve. Again, at the end of the sleeve you want the [new seam to meet the edge of the shirt](http://imgur.com/3yKNn). Then I start at the [same armpit](http://imgur.com/om3BG) and sew towards the [bottom of the shirt.](http://imgur.com/kQ4h5)

Do this on both sides of the shirt.

Now [try your shirt on](http://imgur.com/wqca1). At this point, everything can be undone. If the shirt is too loose, remark it and sew it again. If the shirt is too tight, you can undo the stitching with a seam ripper. I could probably take another half inch out of each side, but I want to wear it as it is for a day before I take it in any more. Plus, I'll be wearing an undershirt with this shirt (since it's a little see-through), which will take up some more space.

If you're happy with the new seam, you will have to cut away the extra fabric (otherwise the shirt won't hang quite right). However, the fabric will fray if you just cut it and leave it with normal scissors. So, you have two options: 1. you can either sew a zigzag stitch or some other stitch that prevents fraying in the fabric to be removed (i.e., between the new seam and the old seam) as close as possible to the strait stitch or I just use [pinking shears to cut away the extra fabric](http://imgur.com/X9aXr). Pinking shears cut fabric in a zig-zag pattern to minimize fraying. I will admit that pinking shears are not an ideal way to prevent fraying, but they work well enough for me, and I'm lazy.

That should be it. [Here's my newly slimmed shirt.](http://imgur.com/wboLt)",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,False,,,True,t3_vuyb7,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/vuyb7/simple_guide_to_tailoringslimmingtaking_in_your/,

There's one of these sales going online today called ""A Sparkling Surprise"".

* ***How does this work?***

   BR's website generates a random code and places it into the cookie your web browser stores. This cookie certifies a code that gives you a certain percentage off (BRSPARK40/35/ETC for todays example). [Here's a demonstration of the site giving me to different values in two different browsers.](http://i.imgur.com/T0JPqpV.png) So how do you change this to the maximum discount? Two methods: deleting your cookies and having the site re-generate for you, or modifying your existing cookie. I'll cover specifically the latter method.


   ***Note: This is written as, and for, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) users with the [Edit This Cookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edit-this-cookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) extension.***


   Edit this Cookie is a simple Chrome web  browser extension that will let us alter the values in the cookie placed by BananaRepublic.com. We start by navigating to the BR site, and then simply clicking the cookie button added in your Chrome toolbar. [It'll look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/aQPpsm1.png)


   The value we are going to change is on the very end of the ""mktUniversalPersist | .gap.com"" cookie. It is the letter at the end of ""VolControlSEG"" ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/duLm7Op.png)). This controls what % off is allotted to you. By altering this value from the ""A"" shown (30% off), to ""B"" gives us 35% off. Further, altering it to C gives us 40%, and altering it to D gives us nothing at all. [Here's a screenshot of all four.](http://i.imgur.com/7c65FXv.png) Hit submit cookie changes to apply whatever adjustment you made, and simply refresh the page.


These sales vary in their values, so some tinkering is often required. I've seen them go as high as 50% off before.

We do not have a lot of spam but referrals are definitely the most common.

My advice on the topic of referrals or rep codes and how to incorporate them so that individuals can actually use them and not break reddiquette

&gt;Your best option would be to link to the standard url, http://www.ebates.com and then leave a note 'If you want my referral code, just PM me and I will give it to you.' 

Also in that comment I explain why we remove referrals

&gt;We have strict removal when it comes to referrals because the use of referrals promotes self gain over frugal advice and can cloud a users judgement on whether or not the sale actually benefits the community. I understand you were just trying to help and it is very much appreciated, I hope this helps clarify how to illustrate rebate website sales. Thank you for your contribution

This is especially true for Amazon. You can find a great deal somewhere but if an OK deal on amazon (which pretty much has everything) will gain you referral credits, which one is more likely to get listed.


So I ask all you FMF'ers to please refrain from listing amazon referrals as well as any other referral.

1360335262.0,161,self.frugalmalefashion,184sp3,How to buy suits and sport coats on eBay,193,32,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/184sp3/how_to_buy_suits_and_sport_coats_on_ebay/,"This is a primer for those who want to buy expensive dress/business clothing on eBay with a slight hat tip to what to look for when buying.  This advice is not terribly fashion oriented as that is personal so if you match orange pants to a green jacket, that's on you.


Much of this advice can be applied to thrift or consignment stores as well, but this depends on your area.  I was inspired by http://thriftygent.com/ as he thrifts and has a great sense of style.  But he lives in an area rich in thrifting.  In my area, I have a wonderful selection of Johnny Carson jackets and suits from the Soupy Sales timeline, so I am limited to eBay.  The CliffNotes of ""thrifting"" is that you can quickly look through a rack of jackets and shoes, but shirts and pants may take time as they are usually sorted by color so you have to sift through hundreds of shirts and pants.  Try it in your area though as you can literally buy a sport coat for $3.


**Know your size**.  This is highly critical as a tailor can fix things slightly off for cheap, but some items and things way off are impossible or real expensive to fix.  Get a tape and measure yourself or go to a tuxedo shop and have them measure you.  Google ""how to measure for a suit"" and you'll get videos and infographics to help.


Pants extra help:  With pants you should pay attention to length carefully and generally rely on OUTSEAM which is the length from the top of the pants to the bottom of the cuff.  Reason for this is that pants come in different ""rise length"" AKA the distance from the crotch to the top of the pants.  If you rely on the inseam, you can end up with highwater pants.  Most normal pants you can rely on the traditional inseam measurements like 34X32, but this may not hold true with dress pants as they can be high or low rise AKA high or low waisted.

Suit length extra help:  This is where the S, R, and L come into play with say a 44S suit.  Generally, 5'6"" and under is Short, 5'7"" to 5'11"" is Regular, and 6' and above is Long.  Once you have or find a good length suit jacket, measure the length from the top of the collar to the bottom of the jacket and same from bottom of collar to the bottom of the jacket.  The reason for this is the S, R, and L sizes are not standard and Zegna's L is the same size as Lavin's R....by knowing the measurement for you, you can better size yourself which is important for people close to S/R/L lines in height.  Go to material for all suits is 100% wool.


Sleeve length extra help:  Make sure you know your jacket sleeve length and the extra material inside the sleeves when buying used.  If the jacket listed is too short, but has extra material in the sleeves, a tailor can fix this for around $20.  Not enough material in the sleeves means you have a worthless jacket.  If you happen to buy a jacket with surgeon's cuffs AKA working buttons, the sleeve length should be really close as alterations can make the buttons look goofy.


**Know how to search on eBay**.  This involves knowing brands first off.  There is no reason to buy a Johnny Carson jacket off of eBay for $50 unless you are having a 70's party.  Buy quality.  Below are my searches you can copy/paste into eBay and save.



44 (Andreas, Andrews, Attolini, Baldessarini, Barba, Barbera, Battistoni, Belvest, Bijan, Boglioli, Borrelli, Brioni, Browne, Canali, Cantarelli, Caruso, Castangia, Cesare, Cheshire, Choice, Cifonelli, Corneliani, D'Avenza, Dior home)

44 (Dunhill, Enrico, Faconnable, Fleece, Freeman, Gianluca, Greenfield, Isaia, Kiton, Lanvin, Luciano, Napoli, Nervesa, Oxxford, Partenopea, Ravazzolo, Samuelsohn, Southwick, Smith, Stuart, Vestimenta, Zegna, Zileri)

New list as of 5/3/2013 to suck up Savile Row clothing specifically:

44 (Barrie, Boateng, Huntsman, Hitchcock, Littman, Norton, Gieves, Kilgour, Amies, Anderson, Strickland, Tobias, Weatherill, ""James &amp; James"", Sheppard, Clegg, Byrne, Herbert, Comelie, Davies, Skinner, Everest, Pegg, Mahon, Manning, Mortimer, Pearse, Poole, Jefferies, Wells, Stowers, Sedwell, Powell)

Notice how 44 is by itself?  Notice how there is no S/R/L even though I'm a 44L?  Many eBay people are lazy and will not include jacket length in a listing.  The reason for the 44 by itself is that lazy eBayers will not put down 44 as the size in the product listing, so ""sorting by"" size 44 will leave many listings out.  Put your chest size alone + brand names to find your suit/jackets.


Run both these searches (split into two as there is a search length limit on eBay) in BOTH sport coats and suits sections.  Don't get hung up on suits as generally most business types have way more sport coat/pants combos than full suits and a jacket/pants combo can look as good or better than a full suit.  

Once you know that you like or hate certain brands, add and remove them as necessary.  If you are unsure of a brand’s quality, you can do what I do and google the name or search on http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/forum.php or http://www.styleforum.net/f/5/classic-menswear as they talk a lot about quality and history of brands.  And forget 90% of your own knowledge as, for example, most dudes consider Ralph Lauren to be a good brand name.  But….in suiting, MOST Ralph Lauren suiting means crap except for the expensive and hard to find black and purple labels.  Stay away from Tommy Hilfiger and Polo and learn to know Brioni, Kiton, and Chester Barrie.


**Style help**:

http://www.primermagazine.com/2012/spend/primers-visual-guide-to-understanding-common-suit-features

http://www.rsvlts.com/2012/08/29/a-gentlemans-guide-to-a-well-tailored-suit-infographic/


**Sport coat help**:  When you have a suit, you have a matching fabric jacket and pants.  When you wear a different set of pants and jacket many refer to this as a miss-matched suit or business casual.  Don't get hung up on the terms sport coat and blazer.  Traditionally a blazer has metal buttons and is a solid color.  Traditionally a sport coat is tweed and has more casual features like leather buttons, elbow patches, etc.  These days, you can wear just about any jacket with just about any pants, so don't get wrapped around the axle about the terms.  The only think I personally subscribe to is to not mix a pinstripe jacket with trousers as it kinda stands out that you are wearing a ""suit jacket"".  Go to material for all jackets is 100% wool.


**Dress Pants help**:  Pants are a little harder to find on eBay to be honest.  Also expect to pay higher prices proportionaty than jackets.  For example I routinely get $XXXX jackets on ebay for $30 to $70.  Huge savings.  Dress pants which retail in the low three digits will routinely go for $50 to $100.  This is what I've seen, so expect to pay a ""premium"" for pants vs. a comparible jacket.  Go to material for all dress pants is 100% wool.


**Get a tailor**.  Find a good tailor in your area that deals with menswear.  Remember this always:  a properly fitted suit from Kmart is 100% better than an ill fitting Savile Row suit.  A good tailor can lengthen/shorten jacket sleeves, dart a jacket (thins out the waist), fix buttons, lengthen/shorten pants, take in or let out the waist of pants, cuff or decuff pants, or even turn MC Hammer pants into slim pants.  Know that tailoring any full suit can run close to $100 depending, so the better you are with measuring and selecting, along with dumb luck, will decrease your tailor’s bill.  If you don’t plan on tailoring, just go to Macy’s and buy a sack suit like the rest of the sheep.

**Care and style help**:  Style is personal taste, but you can gain some by visiting some style forums and inspiration albums to help.  Now that you have a killer suit, you don’t want to be that knucklehead that buttons all three suit button jackets for example.  Put some effort into looking nice.  And learn about cleaning and care as your new suit will be a torn mess if you have it dry cleaned once a week or even once a month.  Based on the above you should have a badass suit.  Make sure you find matching items and style elements to make it shine and take care of it so it will last.",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,1367589742.0,,,True,t3_184sp3,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/184sp3/how_to_buy_suits_and_sport_coats_on_ebay/,

1371830051.0,157,self.frugalmalefashion,1gstbr,FMF Sale Guide: Amazon.com,194,37,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1gstbr/fmf_sale_guide_amazoncom/,"The online retail mecca. From shaving products, watches, and denim [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) has a little of it all for male fashion seekers. But, what constitutes a sale? How do I know I'm getting a good deal? Are all my purchases through Amazon? Let's answer those questions.  

* ***Understanding the three types of Amazon purchases: 1st Party, 3rd Party Fulfilled by Amazon, and 3rd Party***  

   *1. 1st Party Sales* are of items shipped and sold by Amazon.com directly. You can easily tell this by simply looking under ""In Stock"" where it will state so. Amazon doesn't always default to their own items, sometimes showing 3rd party sales when items are cheaper through the 3rd party. The benefit to 1st party sales is that Amazon is on the hook for customer service and returns, something they usually deliver excellently at.  

   *2. 3rd Party Fulfilled by Amazon Sales* are of items sold by a 3rd party (so someone other than Amazon) but shipped through Amazon. It will state ""Sold by X and Fulfilled by Amazon."" Often this is just as seamless as 1st Party sales other than the management of returns/exchanges which will be handled by the 3rd party responsible.   

   *3. 3rd Party Sales* are of items strictly sold by a third party through Amazon, and fulfilled by the 3rd party. It will state ""Ships from and sold by X"".  Amazon simply acts an interface for this type of sale. Your experience will vary from seller to seller.   

* ***Does Amazon have Sales? And [CamelCamelCamel](http://camelcamelcamel.com/)***  

   Something Amazon does extremely well is micro-management of item pricing. The price for any given product can drastically change over time. In this sense, Amazon does have ""Sales"" where they advertise price reductions on items. From my personal experience, this is very rarely a unique opportunity as Amazon is constantly discounting and changing merchandise. There is no flat MSRP in the world of Amazon (You can ignore the ""List Price"" posted above the actual cost of an item.) So how do we keep track of when we're getting a good deal on an item? CamelCamelCamel is a online service that does just this. It tracks and graphs prices for items across Amazon.com, along with some other retailers. This is EXTREMELY valuable if you're interested in buying an item when it's at its cheapest. You can set it to notify you via email or twitter when your given item is the price you desire. One thing worth noting is that since CamelCamelCamel must pull this data from Amazon, it's not always completely up to date. The benefits of passively monitoring an item for drastic changes in its price however is worth this small drawback.   

* ***20% Off with Email Subscription***  

   Amazon does offer a flat discount code of 20% off (with some exclusions; read the fine print) by signing up for there two email lists: [Shoes](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5637565011) &amp; [Clothing](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2678052011). This can save you a bundle on expensive items like boots, or is good for Levi's denim and other common purchases. To my knowledge these are one-time codes tied to the email address associated with your Amazon account. You can gain multiple of these codes by creating multiple emails (try temporary email boxes like [Guerrilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/)) and Amazon accounts with them. Note: The code they send is not required to be used by this new ""spoof"" account. You can use it with your regular Amazon account.   

This is about the extent of my knowledge of shopping with Amazon.com. Please feel free to add your own tips in the comments. Happy shopping!

Here is my attempt at this. I'm posting it as its own post rather than a comment because it's large, and because it turned into kind of a lot of work and I could use some link karma or whatever that's called (I'm new to Reddit and have only ever commented so far).  
   
Some disclaimers first... I only searched a handful of the usual suspect low-price stores (H&amp;M, asos, forever 21 men) that sell their own brands, I didn't search kohl's or any department store, or any of the flash sales (I did check Jack Threads and they didn't seem to have any of the right items at the moment). Also, I can't speak for the quality or fit of anything listed here. But then again, to me frugal style is about buying as low as possible, tailoring, and repairing. Ok here we go, the stuff:  
   
**KNIT SILK TIE**  
It's hard to beat $25, but do-able!  
+ Tie Bar squeaks in there at [$15](http://www.thetiebar.com/tie-bar-product.asp?pn=22528&amp;orderPageReturn=%2FcategoryPages%2FAll%5FTies%2Easp&amp;pg=4&amp;categoryIds=31,62,22&amp;optionValueIds=). Supposedly good quality, but I have no experience with them.  
   
**CORDUROY PANTS**  
Lands End usually is among the frugal choices. In this case, $55 is the number to beat.  
+ Assos has a handful on sale (only certain sizes available) for [$24](http://us.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Slim-Cord-Chino/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1876609&amp;SearchQuery=corduroy&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=3&amp;clr=Tobacco), [$28](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Slim-Cord-Chino/xertz/?iid=1876561&amp;SearchQuery=corduroy&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=3&amp;clr=Navy&amp;mporgp=L0FTT1MvQVNPUy1TbGltLUNvcmQtQ2hpbm8vUHJvZC8.), [$30](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Slim-Cord-Chino/xeryp/?iid=1876610&amp;SearchQuery=corduroy&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=3&amp;clr=Bottlegreen&amp;mporgp=L0FTT1MvQVNPUy1TbGltLUNvcmQtQ2hpbm8vUHJvZC8.), and [$38](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Skinny-Fit-Jeans-In-Cord/x4e2y/?iid=1765682&amp;SearchQuery=corduroy&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=3&amp;clr=Tobacco&amp;mporgp=L0FTT1MvQVNPUy1Ta2lubnktRml0LUplYW5zLUluLUNvcmQvUHJvZC8.). Keep in mind that many of these have slash pockets (like a chino) rather than jean-style pockets.  
+ H&amp;M clock in right at [$30](http://www.hm.com/us/product/98833?article=98833-E)  
+ 21 Men is the most expensive at [$33](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=21men&amp;Category=m_bottom&amp;ProductID=2017873205&amp;VariantID=)  
   
__CHUNKY SWEATER__  
Sweaters are often quite expensive, so just what counts as frugal is wide open to debate. In this case, I tried to beat Metacarfre's $55 Lands End pick.  
+ H&amp;M lists an interesting shawl collar cardigan with toggle closures for [$35](http://www.hm.com/us/product/01648?article=01648-B#article=01648-A). I saw this one in the store and I quite liked it--very puffy and soft. Will it fall apart if you look at it wrong? Maybe...  
+ H&amp;M also have a boat neck pullover with some textured knitting for [$35](http://www.hm.com/us/product/02958?article=02958-B#article=02958-A). I get the sense that boat necks might be risky choice, but I don't know too much about it. I think it's interesting, though, and it seems fittingly chunky.  
+ Again from H&amp;M, a shawl collar pullover for [$35](http://www.hm.com/us/product/92377?article=92377-C#article=92377-C) (notice a trend?). Be warned that some people think that shawl collar pullovers have the appearance of a vagina giving birth to your head. I like the way they look, and this one is chunky and cheery.  
   
**TWEED JACKET**  
For me, a good jacket has been hard to find on the super-frugal, and this is especially true of tweeds. Asos appears to be a good place to look for this. In spite of letting me down on the other categories, they had an unrivaled selection of sub-$150 tweed blazers. There were a couple more that popped up on their search that I didn't include here because they were just too weird (who wants a tuxedo-style shawl lapel on a tweed blazer?)  
+ Brown, 2 buttons, peak lapel--[$145](http://us.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Slim-Fit-Suit-Jacket-in-Fleck-Herringbone/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2174455&amp;sgid=4703&amp;cid=5678&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=3&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Brown)  
+ Light grey, 1 button, notch lapel--[$145](http://us.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Slim-Fit-Suit-Jacket-in-Tweed/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2175424&amp;sgid=4661&amp;cid=5678&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=3&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Grey)  
+ Navy, 2 button, notch lapel--[$145](http://us.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Slim-Fit-Tweed-Suit-Jacket/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2175574&amp;sgid=4791&amp;cid=5678&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=3&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Indigo)  
+ Dark grey, 3 buttons, notch lapel--[$145](http://us.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Slim-Fit-Suit-Jacket-in-Herringbone/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2175708&amp;sgid=4781&amp;cid=5678&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=4&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Grey)  
   
__SUEDE SHOES__  
The $150 Meermins that Metacarfre picked already seem like they might already be one of the best deals going, given the good press they've been getting [1](http://putthison.com/post/27986276299/we-got-it-for-free-meermin-shoes-exaggerations), [2](http://dieworkwear.com/post/16011578554/affordable-european-shoes-meermin). Less expensive options can be had, though. Namely, the suede Bass shoes that people loved as white Bucks in the Summer are also offered in Fall-friendly colors.  
+ The Brockton for [$69](http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1278886-5116142/Bass/Dark+Brown+Suede/Men's+Brockton.aspx). For some reason, not at all on sale right now so not eligible for the code.  
+ The Stockton for $85, though right now there's a %25 off sale shoes code going, which puts it at [$64](http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1301263-5171256/Bass/Coffee+Washablenubuc/Men's+Stockton.aspx)  
+ The Barret, a suede wingtip. Normally [$80](http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1221727-5128142/Bass/Dark+Brown/Men's+Barret.aspx), it seems, certain sizes available on Shoebacca for [$46](http://www.shoebacca.com/bass/barret-barret-201.html?utm_source=froogle&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=froogle)  
   
   
   
And that's it for now! Hope this is helpful, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other people find.

1356313943.0,157,self.frugalmalefashion,15cowe,A Guide To Buying (Mainly Used) Men’s Clothes on eBay ,203,46,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/15cowe/a_guide_to_buying_mainly_used_mens_clothes_on_ebay/,"I figured I’ve taken advantage of some great deals, and I thought I’d pass them along. I’ve been buying and selling clothes on eBay for about a year and a half now. I first started just buying clothes mainly from the thrift shop. They were decent clothes, but the selection was limited and I don’t have some of the more popular sizes that are more frequently found on the racks. I decided to pick up some of the nice clothes that didn’t fit me and sell them on eBay for extra money, as I was about to go to college. I thought it was going to be a small summer income, but I ended up making almost 1500 just casually selling, and I also invested (note invested) in some clothes. Here are some of my tips to get some great deals.

For starters, if you’re extremely frugal like me, you want to get the nicest clothes for the cheapest price. The best way to get nice clothes for the best price is to buy used. Now, I know some people may be turned off by buying used clothes, but honestly over time you won’t even notice. 

You can go to your local thrift shop for awesome deals, but eBay is still your best bet. Buying used clothes at thrift stores run a risk in terms of condition. It’s hard to check out the item you’re buying at the thrift store, and sometimes you’ll miss something (such as tiny rips, missing buttons, a stain that you couldn’t see) that detract from the quality of the item. I have picked up some very nice pieces of clothing at my thrift stores (Barbour, Brooks Brothers, J Crew, Vineyard Vines, Ralph Lauren, etc.), but I’ve also picked up nice clothing that has been destroyed and disgusting (I have horror stories...). This is why I like to buy off eBay. You’re covered by buyer protection so if the item does have defaults with it, you can just return it. Shipping should be paid for by the seller if there is something wrong with item. If you have any trouble with the seller, contact eBay and they should handle the situation.

Research, then set a price line. I’ve learned the hard way with this one. I’ve bought items for way too much that I now could get for much less. Look for the item(s) on eBay that you are looking for, and add them to your watch list. Unless there is some amazing deal that is obvious, wait for the auctions to close. Figure out what the average selling price is, and base your limit off that. 

Check the tags. Tags are often a tell-tale sign of the age of an item. If there is no picture online of the tags, email the seller asking for them. Some companies such as Lands End and J Crew put the seasons that particular items of clothing were released. 

Pictures matter, but the description matters more. I’ve found that auctions that display nice pictures of their items tend to gather a better price. I’ve honestly gotten some of my best deals off items. If you see an item that you’re interested in, read the description without judging the picture. Some people take pictures with too much shade, not enough light, or some other way that makes the item seem not as good. If the description seems to check out with no faults, go for it. If you really want to see some pictures, ask the seller nicely to send you some. 

Know what type of person you’re buying from. There are two different sellers on eBay: those who sell their own clothes or their family’s, and those who sell clothes for a profit. I tend to try to buy from sellers who sell their own clothes. Most of the time, they are looking for a little extra money, and don’t expect to make much of their clothes. Also, it can be easier to be pick up multiple items from the same seller because they usually list more than one article of their own clothing, which can help you save on shipping. 

Develop a connection between someone selling their own clothes. If you buy from someone who is selling their own clothes that are your size and you have a good transaction with them on eBay, contact them telling them that you were happy with the transaction and that you would be willing to do business of eBay in the future if they’d like. On eBay, sellers get hit hard with a 9% fee on the price of the item and the shipping off the item, and also by Paypal with a 2.9% + $.35 transaction fee. Tell the seller that you would be willing to deal directly on Paypal for transactions, which will save them a ton in the long run. I now have several people who I stay in contact with about their clothes, and I am able to get prices better than those on eBay because 1) they have gained my trust and know I will pay, 2) they don’t have to deal with the hassle of listing an item, 3) because I’m helping them save money by taking away those damn eBay fees. 

Newly listed is your friend. This is the search item I do 90% of the time. Some of the best deals can be buy it nows by people who do not know they can get more for their item than what they listed it for (e.g. I bought a $20 Brooks Brothers Shirt, shipped, off eBay and sold it on eBay within a week of buying it for $42. I was able to do this because I used the Newly Listed feature to find the item within 2 hours of it being put up). 

Negotiate, Negotiate, Negotiate. Half of my transactions on eBay now are probably negotiated. Negotiating with auction styled listings can be hard, as you’ll have to negotiate a selling price early if the price is much lower than what the item will sell for. Negotiating for a buy it now will be much easier. I’ve negotiated with people selling their own clothes and those looking to make a profit selling other people’s clothes, but negotiating with people that sell their own clothes is much easier. They tend to not want to deal with the auction length and hassle, so if you reach out to them with a price that’s attractive, they might bite. That being said, never go over your limit that you sent with POINT 3. As a side note, although you CAN get suspended for it, I like to reach out to some sellers and tell them that I’d be willing to work a deal off eBay if they would like to maximize their profits. I’ll often get the item for cheaper, but I’ve heard that you can get suspended for doing this. 
 
Ask about combined shipping rates. Combined shipping can really help you save on multiple items. When I’m selling shirts, I’ll usually pack them in a flat rate envelope, but I can fit another one in if a buyer buys two shirts, so they get the same price due to the flat rate of the packaging. 
 
Be wary of loaded lots. Buying clothes in lots can save you a ton, but it can also make you lose big.Loaded lots are lots with a couple pieces of nice clothes, but are also made up of cheap clothes. Divide up the lot by price of each item, not by the average price of each item (e.g. set a limit of $15 for a J Crew shirt and $5 for a Converse one in the same lot).
 
For the best deals, be very vague in your search. What this means is that if you’re looking for a new J Crew shirt, type in “J Crew” in the search. Make the “Men’s Clothing and Accessories the only category to search under. There will be a ton of items that pop up, which will be time consuming, but people sometimes miscategorize their items or do not put the proper title or enough description to tell what their item is (e.g. I once won a J Crew lot that did not have any sizes listed in the description. I won a lot of 24 items for $78. I later sold 22 of those items for $400. Cha-Ching...)

I hope this helps! I was able to expand my wardrobe immensely for college with these tips, while also staying way under budget (more beer fund money!). Ask me anything else about buying or selling on eBay!

**Searching**

You really need to know your exact shoe size. It's important, because there are many different widths to a shoe. You could unknowingly purchase a 10EEE instead of a 10B, and then you'd be up shit's creek with a pair of shoes that don't fit. Go to a shoe store, even Payless, and use their foot-measuring tool to find your exact size.

Redditor /u/Julianos94 provided a fantastic link with all the higher quality brands. [Click Here](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Mens-Shoes-/93427/i.html?LH_PrefLoc=2&amp;_nkw=%28%22edward+green%22%2C+peal%2C+%22brooks+brothers%22%2C+alden%2C+lingwood%2C+lobb%2C+vass%2C+testoni%2C+edmonds%2C+mcafee%2C+church%2C+hermes%2C+crispin%2C+zegna%2C+santoni%2C+faconnable%2C+ferragamo%2C+sutor%2C+mantellassi%2C+%22shell+cordovan%22%2C+%22purple+label%22%2C+trickers%2C+grenson%2C+crockett%2C+gravati%2C+kiton%2C+tramezza%2C+sargent%2C+weston%2C+lattanzi%2C+heschung%2C+balint%2C+scafora%2C+valextra%2C+branchini%2C+bontoni%2C+bemer%2C+aubercy%2C+corthay%2C+Dinkelacker%2C+%22paul+stuart%22%2C+asprey%2C+tods%2C+etro%2C+sander%2C+carmina%2C+albaladejo%2C+%22paul+smith%22%2C+martegani%2C+altan%2C+artioli%2C+barrett%2C+bestetti%2C+stefanobi%2C+borgioli%2C+cheaney%2C+cleverly%2C+ducker%2C+donegan%2C+gaziano%2C+guyot%2C+klemann%2C+loake%2C+maftei%2C+melkersson%2C+moreschi%2C+materna%2C+meier%2C+myhre%2C+pape%2C+peron%2C+petrocchi%2C+reiter%2C+scheer%2C+schneider%2C+stanislas%2C+suzuki%2C+crisci%2C+ugolini%252). However, I usually just type in the brand of shoe, or style, and my shoe size:

 ""Allen Edmonds 12 D""

 ""Penny Loafer 12 D""

 ""Alden Chukka 12 D""

Once the search is returned, sort the results by ""Price+shipping. Lowest first"". I find it easier to stay under budget when I sort them.

There are a couple things to look for when inspecting a pair of shoes. Of course, the style is the first thing you'll see, but when you click on it, inspect the pictures a little further.

**Inspection**

There are a few standard shots that seem to be provided, and for good reason. They give the best angles to exactly what you want to see:

- [Top Down](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Allen-Edmonds-Montgomery-12-D-/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/JhUAAOxyhlJRfUqu/$T2eC16V,!zoE9s5ne+WIBRfUqtl4KQ~~60_57.JPG). Be on the look out for any scratches, any stray stitches or damages to the leather. Also, pay attention to how deep the creases are. Dark, deep creases usually means that the upper has a lot of wear. [What a good used upper looks like](http://i.imgur.com/vbVOgcf.jpg)
- [Side Shot](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Allen-Edmonds-Players-Shoe-Wingtip-Oxford-Black-Leather-12-D-335-/00/s/NDAwWDcwMg==/z/55wAAOxyoA1RXQXv/$T2eC16h,!zUE9s39!eUFBR(Q(uVV5!~~60_3.JPG?rt=nc) Again, look for creases and any damages, discolorations, water spots, etc.
- [Rear Shot] Here's where you really see just how much wear the shoe has gotten. The heel wears out on the outside half, [like so](http://i.imgur.com/YOOJw6K.jpg). Here is a [good heel](http://styleforum-testing.s3.amazonaws.com/a/a0/a0c78f2d_vbattach27086.jpg).
- [Soles](http://i.imgur.com/mCJ0cdc.jpg) This is where you really get to see the age of the shoe. If it has the original leather sole (or even a recrafted sole), you can gauge the wear on the sole based on a few factors: Number of shades of color on the footbed, the stitching condition, the divot, and the heel detail. [Example of a very worn sole and heel](http://i41.tinypic.com/3495pg9.jpg). Notice the different shades of color on the footbed and the lack of detail on the heel. [This is an example of a nice sole](http://i40.tinypic.com/90byi9.jpg). 
- [Closeup of Damage](http://i.imgur.com/3CCAXqW.jpg) or [This one. Ouch!](http://i39.tinypic.com/2dov8p.jpg)

If the seller does not provide you with all of the pictures that you want, feel free to send the seller a message and request it. They will *always* do it, and within the day. They want you to buy their shoes.

**Bidding**

You might ask, ""well, how much should I pay for these Strands?"" and then I'd ask, ""well, how much do you have budgeted for one pair of shoes?"" You need to have an idea about exactly how much you're willing to spend on a pair of shoes. Obviously, the more you spend, the better condition they will usually be in. I usually keep my ceiling at $140. 

There are three ways to win an auction: highest bidder, buy it now, or best offer:

- *Buy it Now*. The easiest way to purchase a shoe. If it's an option that's available, the shoe is in a good condition and it's a style you like, for a really great price, go ahead and buy it. Got a pair of AE Breton Penny Loafers for $50 that way.
- *Best offer*. Often, sellers who use a Buy It Now option will also include a Best offer option. You usually get three chances, so start low and then come up twice. If the BIN option is $99, offer $60, $75 and $80. You could just get a nice steal.
- *Win The Auction*. The best way to do this is to use a sniper. [GIXEN](http://www.gixen.com) is a website that will make last second bids on your behalf to your auction. This is how people win auctions. It's not some guy sitting at his computer hitting refresh. With Gixen, you put in your EBay information, locate the [Item ID Number](http://i.imgur.com/J9w8Jji.jpg), put that number in the input box and then list your absolute highest bid. Effective sniping involves knowing about what price the shoe should sell for, and offering bids ending in $_2 or $_7. Why 2 and 7? Because there might be 10 other people watching this auction, and most of them are going to bid in round numbers, like $100, $115, $120. So, again, why 2 and 7? Because there's a second group of people that *know* about this round number bid and will bid $1 more, so $101, $116, $121. Submit the auction and just let it run. You will get an email from EBay if you won or lost.

So, there ya go. 

**Also, I will also be happy to review anyone's watched item and give my assessment on the condition of the shoes. Just link the item in the comments.**

I was fairly skeptical. Even if they were making quality OCBDs for $25, there is no way the fit was going to be decent, especially when it wasn't even advertised as slim fit. Then, it came out that the [Wooster](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0FjPCtl8nPY/TCJoYOvkezI/AAAAAAAAIYI/eld4hb1250c/s1600/tumblr_l4dkv2Uqzt1qboamso1_400.jpg) was behind them. Well then.

So I checked these out on Sunday, and I have to say I was impressed. The material is not great, but no embarrassing (better than J Crew Factory Oxfords, I would say) and the fit is impressive. I am not as svelte as some on here, but the medium fits a 6' 190lb man well, and I would say it was snugger than a J Crew slim (but not quite H&amp;M slim). The length is not too long to be worn untucked, and I was especially impressed by the sleeves, which is where so many slim fits screw up (either the size or arm whole placement). There is even a little contrast stitching in the bottom button slot as well as on both forearm buttons.

The are a few cons I can think of. First, the second button is too high, which sucks for such a casual shirt. The next button is nipple level for me, which is too low in my opinion. You can see this on the picture of the model. He has the top two buttons undone, but it seems they were careful about keeping the collar together. While the shirt is thick, it's not thick enough for a hairy man such as myself to wear without an undershirt. Kind of a bummer, but not a deal breaker at this price. Lastly, there were a lot of loose threads that needed snipping.

Overall though, I found this tough to beat. While I think that having a great OCBD is a must, having a cheap beater one (or a starter) is certainly fine. In fact, I picked up one in white and am wearing it at my desk.

Lastly, I was impressed with the entire JCP brand mens section. In addition to the Oxfords, they had a good selection of lighter material ginghams in multiple colors. It seems like the pants haven't quite gotten the slim memo, but they weren't boot cut at least. If I were starting a frugal wardrobe, this would be one of my first stops.",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,1348492183.0,,,True,t3_10e247,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/10e247/25_jcp_slim_fit_oxford_cotton_button_down_review/,

I'll be honest: I've become pretty discouraged with MFA lately. I got up the balls to post on my not-so-throwaway account what I thought was a fantastic outfit, and they tore it apart, then tore ME apart for defending it, calling me pretty much everything in the book.

I'm starting to get the feeling that they look down on everything that doesn't fit a very rigid hivemind mindset as for the plebians, adjust their glasses and harrumph, and just click the downvote. It's sad, because people need more encouragement than that, and I'm one of 'em. But they're pretty fucking quick to circlejerk over street fashion, which I just don't get.../sigh

My complaints with MFA have led me to say thanks to FMF for *not* being tremendous dicks, and even more so, some of the most helpful people I've seen on Reddit in a **long** time. And that means a LOT to me. 80+ replies for a small hopeful question = AWESOME.

**tl;dr Thanks. I'ma give you guys some clothes fo' free. Give me a reason to, they don't fit me well. I got them in high school when I thought being freakishly tall meant buy large. I wear a small :$**

~~- Alfani White with Silver Pinstripes Button-Up (16/32-33)~~
~~- Kohls Black With White/Grey Pinstripes Button-Up and Light Green Small-Checked Button-Up (both XL)~~

~~Top rated 3 posters get them, in order. I'll cover shipping to CONUS.~~

*edit: First come first serve. Looks like the Alfani is spoken for, if things don't work out I will update accordingly. Still will cover shipping to CONUS. 

**edit: looks like they're all accounted for. sorry all. PM me some addresses, dana87, Shimokurasaka, elmetal. There was a flurry of last minute desire for the sweater vest, but I think Shimokurasaka, being a new guy could use it the most, get a good start to the group just as I did.**

1342978906.0,122,self.frugalmalefashion,wz1nq,Tailoring your pants,146,24,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/wz1nq/tailoring_your_pants/,"There's a handy sidebar guide on tailoring your own shirts.  I have followed that with great success, even tweaking his formula and further slimming (a few times over slimming) shirts.  It's the best way to revamp a wardrobe without spending a lot of money.  If you haven't read it yet, do it. 

Now, I don't know about the rest of you, but just as I had baggy shirts buried in the back of my closet, I also have baggy pants similarly neglected.  They fit well enough in the waist and inseam, but were way too big everywhere else.   

The great thing is that it's actually easier to alter your pants (assuming waist and inseam fit) compared to a dress shirt. Rather than me explain the simple process, why not [watch Clark Kent in his red socks and undies show you?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwE_trccirk)  I personally used a pair of Dockers Alpha Khakis as my template pants because I like the taper through the leg.  After your new seam is sewed, try them on and make sure everything feels right, adjust if necessary.

He's happy to leave the excess fabric so that it's reversible, but I found I didn't like leaving all that.  What I did was leave 4-6"" on each side of the crotch and trimmed away the rest. I left it alone in the crotch because my sewing machine has trouble chomping through those stacked factory stitches right there. Also, I gain security blanket assurance against some kind of catastrophic blowout. 

**A hopefully obvious note here: If your pants rise/seat fit how you like, don't sew around the crotch and alter it.  Instead, bring your line to evenly terminate at or just before the crotch.** 

If you do cut away the excess you want to leave around 1/4"" and [sew a zig-zag stitch to prevent fraying.](http://i.imgur.com/jMupJ.jpg)  This is a very basic stitch that about any cheap sewing machine can do.  [Here's a video that explains the process.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egdZHT17H7Q)  

There's really not much more to it.  In my case I've converted baggy pants I paid anywhere from $3-8 for into great fitting Alpha Khaki clones.  And, true to FMF's spirit, it means that I never *need* to spend much money on pants (or shirts) when there's an unending supply of clearance rack/thrift store finds out there that are easily altered.  **Fit is more crucial to how you look than paying for any specific brand .** As Mr. Kent noted in his video, even on cheap clothes you'll find that they're constructed well enough, with durable enough materials.  It's the proportions that aren't right, and that's easy to change. 

A few notes to end on: 

As of last week I had not operated a sewing machine since taking a home economics class in high school over ten years ago.  There's probably a lot of you with doubts about being able to do this (my doubts kept me off getting a machine for most of this summer), but it really is easy.  When I finally took the plunge I spent 30 minutes setting the machine up and figuring out how to thread it. I then messed around sewing scraps of fabric to get a feel for the foot pedal and different stitch settings.  

For simple alterations it's really all about prep work.  Mark clean lines, double check for symmetry between the pant legs, pin the fabric together to keep it from shifting as it's sewed, and that's it. If it's not right, you can always rip the new seam out and get it right.  It's always reversible until you've cut away the excess fabric. 

And lastly, sorry for the dirty mirror pics, but here's a quick before and after of a pair of Dockers D3 classics with a really rough jean like fabric: [Original](http://i.imgur.com/plH6k.jpg) |||  [Tapered](http://i.imgur.com/eAAGV.jpg)

High-quality, American made dress shoes for often sub $200 prices. And the flaws that make these shoes ""seconds"" are sometimes very hard to distinguish or are similar to the regular wear you would end up putting into them anyway.


* ***Finding out the current inventory.***

   Allen Edmonds sells its factory second quality shoes, along with some closeout model firsts, in its chain of outlet retail stores. You can find one near you using the store locator. If you have one of these near you, great! All you must do is simply walk in, find/ask for what you're looking for and they'll see if they have it in stock in your size. If they don't they're able to do a look up of the inventory across ALL the outlet stores, along with the central warehouse; dubbed the Shoe Bank. If one of these options has your shoe, they can have it shipped to you relatively cheaply. 


   But what if you're not close to a Allen Edmonds Outlet? You're not left out of the loop. You can email any of the stores with there storename ahead of @allenedmonds.com. A popular one is the Freeport store address: freeport@allendmonds.com. Alternatively, you can email the Shoebank directly at shoebank@allenedmonds.com. They'll email you back a inventory [readout similar to this.](http://i.imgur.com/ubw3FgP.png) Note the ""S"" at the end of the Style value for each shoe. This denotes it as a Seconds quality. Those without the S are first quality, and usually a closeout model no longer being produced. A little googling of the shoe names so you can determine what they look like (Because who could memorize all these shoes?) and you're set to give any Outlet store a call to place an order over the phone. ***[Please remember that if ordering by phone the correct sizing is your responsibility. You can learn more about sizing here.](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/TheFitRightView?langId=&amp;storeId=1&amp;catalogId=40000000001)***

* ***Sale Types - Standard Sale &amp; 2 for $$$***

   The outlet/shoe bank sales follow a similar path to regular store sales, occuring on common sale days (Memorial Day, Fathers Day, etc.) and specific events (Soles4Souls, Tent Sale, etc.) Prices in these sales will fluxuate shoe to shoe without any real consistency of what goes on sale and what doesn't. But what I find to be the best deal are the 2 for $$$ sales. This is where out of a select set of shoes, you get two pairs for a flat price. Some recent values for this include 2 for $250, 2 for $300, and extremely rare (May of 2012 was the last I recall) 2 for $200. Being able to knock out two pairs of fantastic shoes for a Benjamin each is hard to beat. These type of sales seem to occur every few months. Oftentimes these are not announced beyond word of mouth. 

* ***A comment on AE's crafted for third parties.***

   When you look at your inventory printout, you may see a few types of shoes listed with a store name appended to the front of the shoe name. An example is ""Brooks Strand"". These shoes are made by Allen Edmonds for other retailers (in our example: Brooks Brothers). Often times they have unique or changed attributes from the standard version of the shoe. It's worth looking into these to see if any changes are to your liking. You may find them just as enjoyable, and often they are discounted further than there regular model.

1363818657.0,116,self.frugalmalefashion,1aoyyp,Frugal Shopping Guide: Shoes and Boots,136,20,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1aoyyp/frugal_shopping_guide_shoes_and_boots/,"I've decided to put together a series of guides as a reference for those who come to FMF seeking advice on where to buy frugal clothing and footwear.


This guide is intended to provide a couple frugal sources for commonly requested shoes and boots.  My guides will not attempt to give an in-depth discussion of styles or what's appropriate for what situation.  Those questions can be answered by using the search feature or posting to MFA.  For an in-depth guide to footwear styles and brands see [the MFA shoe guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p7usf/shoe_guide_v20/) and [the MFA boot guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/z2quy/mfa_boot_guide_20122013/).


Remember, do your research before purchasing anything.  Sizes can vary wildly among different makers.  The least frugal purchase is one you never wear.  Additionally, always search for promotional codes before confirming your purchase.  [Retailmenot](http://www.retailmenot.com/) is my preferred source for discount codes.  Finally, eBay often has brand new items for cheap, and you can see the market value by searching completed listings.


**WHERE TO BUY**

*Allen Edmonds Shoebank* - Widely considered by many to be one of the best values around.  The shoebank offers ""factory seconds"" which are AE shoes that did not pass the factory's quality control due to a cosmetic defect.  Note that this defect does not affect the construction of the shoe and is often unnoticeable or repairable.  The shoebank runs sales every few months which discount seconds to $150 or under (including the 2 for $300 sales).  When these sales occur, there will be a post on the FMF front page.  To take advantage of these sales, know your shoe size in [AE's different lasts](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/AllAboutLastsView?langId=&amp;storeId=1&amp;catalogId=40000000001) then e-mail your size to 
shoebank@allenedmonds.com for a list of what's available.  *Notable footwear: [Strand](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/product_6478359_1_40000000001_-1); [Park Ave](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF270_1_40000000001_-1)*


*Amazon and Amazon Warehouse* - Amazon occasionally runs sales on popular shoes or boots making them very affordable.  [Amazon Warehouse](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sv__img?ie=UTF8&amp;node=1267877011) carries products that were returned to Amazon and can no longer be sold as ""new in box"" but may have only been tried on or had the box opened.  *Notable footwear: many Allen Edmonds; [CDBs can get to $60](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Beeswax/dp/B000WU8SBG/); [Chippewa Apache can get to $80](http://www.amazon.com/Chippewa-20065-Handcrafted-Lace-Up-Chocolate/dp/B0036VN8N6/)*


*Revolve* - [Revolve](http://www.revolveclothing.com/) offers designer clothes at average prices.  However, they offer a deal to first time customers which allows you to make a purchase and then e-mail customer service to ask for a 30% which is later credited to your card.  Be sure to check with customer service beforehand that the discount will work with the brand you want, as several brands are excluded.  *Notable footwear: [Redwing, Beckman and IR](http://www.revolveclothing.com/brandpages/RedWingShoesM.jsp?&amp;d=h); [Wolverine 1000 mile boot](http://www.revolveclothing.com/DisplayProduct.jsp?product=WOLV-MZ3&amp;c=Wolverine&amp;d=h)*


*6pm* - [6pm](http://www.6pm.com/) is essentially an outlet for Zappos and tends to offer very good prices on less popular models.  Additionally, 6pm occasionally runs great sales that put decent shoes at $15-$25.  6pm tends to be best for getting cheaper/lower quality shoes at dirt cheap prices.  *Notable footwear: [PF Flyers often get to $15](http://www.6pm.com/pf-flyers-center-lo-re-issue-bright-white-canvas?zfcTest=mat%3A1); Clarks (including CDBS) are often on sale, [Sperrys](http://www.6pm.com/sperry-top-sider-leeward-2-eye-sahara?zfcTest=mat%3A1) get to $45.*


*JCP* - Has begun to aim for a younger and more fashion-conscious demographic.  They've technically done away with sales, but they still occur - the best is 20% off.  Furthermore, shoes go on clearance fairly quickly.  *Notable footwear: [Stafford Wingtip](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/stafford-ashton-mens-wingtip-dress-shoes/prod.jump?ppId=1b9aceb), they also make a boot version that is unavailable at the moment; [Cutter boot](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/stafford-cutter-mens-boots/prod.jump?ppId=pp5001521714); [Suede wingtip](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/shoes/mens-shoes/dress-shoes/claiborne-gaylord-suede-oxford-dress-shoes/prod.jump?ppId=pp5002301337)*


*DSW* - Frequently offer significant sales and they carry many popular brands.  *Notable footwear: their house brand is Mercanti which is a good deal when at or under $100, [Cap toe is here](http://www.dsw.com/shoe/mercanti+fiorentini+men%27s+cap+toe+oxford?prodId=225006)*


**SHOE CARE**

Quality shoe trees can be purchased on the cheap at [Jos A Bank](http://www.josbank.com/menswear/shop/Product_11001_10050_101593) during their many Buy 1 get 2 or 3 free sales, as well as their 70% off sale.  [Sierra Trading Post is another option](http://www.sierratradingpost.com/cedarbrooke-by-woodlore-combination-cedar-shoe-tree-for-men~p~94022/?filterString=s~shoe-tree%2F&amp;colorFamily=05) and frequently runs sales or sends promotions to their e-mail list.


[Allen Edmonds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/cati2_Shoe+Care+Products_1_40000000001_-1_1_image_0_N_216_216__subcategory) is a great option for brushes, daubers, laces, and more, since they ship everything for free.


Good luck finding some quality shoes at the lowest possible price.  Fellow FMFers, feel free to add your favorite places to get footwear and keep the list growing.


*Note 1 - deals on footwear and shoe care items can often be had at outlets such as Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, etc.  However, these outlets are total crapshoots.  You never know what you'll get or how good the deal will be.  A more extreme example are thrift shops, which can often have great shoes for under $10, however you will strike out much more often than you'll score big.*


*Note 2 - the prices listed are typically a best case scenario.  Your preferred size or color may not be available at that price.*

Then AE gave me a free belt and tie because I'm a student and their sales associates are thoughtful and helpful.

I had been jonesing for a pair of stands for 6 months or so before I saw a deal on here for new Strands from Amazon for $195. Sweet! I finally got Strands. BUT when they came, they turned out to be factory seconds. I called Amazon and the customer service rep offered 20% off the price ($39) to keep them, or I could exchange them for a new pair. I chose 20% off. However, a couple days later, I changed my mind, called them up and asked if i could exchange them and give them the 20% back. The guy said I could exchange them, but he wasn't going to worry about taking the 20% back(merry christmas, right?). So I get the new shoes in a couple days, but I wasn't happy with the fit (too narrow). I figured since they're new, I'll try to exchange them for the proper size at the AE store (I hadn't actually been properly fitted before). When I go in, the sales associate happily offers to exchange them, measures my feet, and gets my the correct size (turns out I'm an 11EEE, not a 12D). Then, when he was about to check me out, he asked if I was a student. I told him I was, then he told me to pick out any belt and any tie in the store for free(what?!). It turns out they are having a promotion for students where you get a free belt and tie with the purchase of any shoes. Apparently the exchange qualified. Good thing too because I probably would have spent $100+ on the belt in the near future. So, all in all, I got $495 worth of AE swag for $156

An album will be available at the bottom of the post. Thanks for reading in advanced, and I hope this helps some of you on the fence about them.

**Fit:** I am 6' tall and ~145-150lbs, and generally wear Levi's 514 (slim straight.) I ordered [These Jeans](http://20jeans.com/shop-mens-jeans/jeans-by-fit/mens-slim-jeans/victorious-checkered-stripe-denim-pants-152-brown.html#.UNIvCW-0J8E), labeled as ""slim,"" and even under the slim section of the site. The fit is quite a bit more on the ""skinny jean"" side of things for my taste, but hey, they'll suffice.

**Quality:** Well, they're $20, you get what you pay for. They feel VERY thin, at least for jeans, and the fabric isn't you're standard denim. They feel kind of papery, if that makes sense (think of like a paper towel) and the pockets are VERY thin, and feel like they'll rip should I put a pen or keys in them. They also seem to stretch a bit when I bend my knees, but the site does say they are 3% spandex.

**Experience:** Okay, so I ordered them last Thursday and they arrived today in a USPS flatrate box, so it was a pretty quick shipment, especially during the holidays. The Website was very easy to use and there was no hassle ordering like some of the higher end sites seem to experience from time to time (ex: ""Okay, where do I put the coupon code? Why is there 5 screens just to buy something? etc.) Overall I'd say the jeans are worth the $20 I paid for them, granted I wasn't expecting much for $20 and I got what I paid for, and they're getting new items in all the time, so I may shop with them again.

So a recent thread asking about good thrift stores in Dallas got me thinking: Why don't we make a list of thrift stores in each city, complete with pricing (general - sort of like how yelp does with their $ scale), reviews, hours, etc. I think this would be a great tool for all of us to use. It could be very well that there is a great thrift store in your own city that you don't even know about. 

Of course this would require a lot of collaboration and input. I can make some reviews of thrift stores in Portland and Eugene, but that's about it. I imagine it's the same for most of you. It would be great if we could come up with a good way to organize this (allow users to search by city, price, etc.) as well. I imagine this taking a few months before we have a good enough amount of content, but i think it will be worth it in the end. 

So.. yay or nay? I'd like to get some input before starting this. ",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,1365389658.0,,,True,t3_1bu7mn,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1bu7mn/meta_thrift_store_list_by_city_including_reviews/,

You can find it in the bead/necklace/bracelet/dangly-shit aisle.

They will replace your damaged jeans, all you have to do is contact them (levistrauss@levi.com), then pay for shipping the pants to them. 

I did a quick web search and found forums where others confirmed the policy (found comments from as recently as 2012). The only reason that I've found they wouldn't honor the warranty was if the pants were 'too old', again according to comments on web forums.

So if anyone wants to try this out and confirm, or if you've done it before and want to confirm, let us know.

1355014354.0,99,self.frugalmalefashion,14ivtb,My 20Jeans.com first impressions (spoiler alert: pretty favorable),130,31,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/14ivtb/my_20jeanscom_first_impressions_spoiler_alert/,"**EDIT: TLDR:** Cheap and fast, but scattershot sizing due to brand cycling. My personal experience was good. YMMV.

I heard about 20jeans.com on this subreddit, and I figured I'd give you guys some impressions on what my experience was like.

**PRICE**
This is why we're at /r/frugalmalefashion, right? Well I've got good news. It's frugal as all get out. 20 bucks for each item. Oh yeah, except for the hoodie I ordered, which had a 5$ surcharge for the size. That is, if you want it in a size (any size) it's $25. Still very reasonable, but it's a little funny having the actual price come out on the sizing page. I am not bothered by this.

~~Shipping was a flat $15, so it seems like getting more in one order is the way to go.~~ EDIT DUE TO DERPS: Shipping is $5 an item, but free shipping over $100. Many thanks to /u/LegalPirate for pointing this out.

**SHIPPING** Like I said, flat $15 for my order of 3 items. Also, my order was processed really fast. I ordered late Wednesday night, early Thursday morning, and my package showed up on Saturday. Awesome. If only the package I ordered from Newegg had shown up at the same time, I'd be busy playing games and not making this post.

**FIT** This is where we come to an interesting point. See, 20jeans doesn't make their own stuff, they get items from other companies. This means you're going to have a wide variety of different fits. I am a large gentleman (6'5"", 300 lbs, bit of a belly but not outrageous) and as such I tried to order the largest items for what I was getting. I got an XXL Navy Plaid Pearl Snap shirt, an XL Armin hooded sweater jacket, and a pair of Natural High raw denim jeans, 42 x 33.

The hoodie fit better than I expected! When I lose a bit of weight, it'll be perfect, maybe slightly short in the sleeves. Great for $25! Also, the hood actually fits normally on my oversized cranium. Bonus.

The jeans fit PERFECTLY. Not the skinniest cut, but I really wanted a nice raw denim jean. This might be a problem when I lose a little weight, but for $20 I can get some more.

The shirt? HILARIOUSLY SMALL. I even doublechecked that it was XXL. I could only snap a couple of the snaps, which promptly gave out when I breathed. Remember, this is purportedly an XXL, and WAY smaller than the hoodie. This will probably look good when I lose a LOT of weight, though the arms will likely be awfully restrictive. Then again, I'm a bulky dude. YMMV.

**OVERALL CONCLUSIONS**
Am I happy with my purchase? Pretty much. Though I wish I could at least pretend to fit in that shirt, as I really like it. (That'll happen with time, though, so it's not a total wash.)

What was the best part about ordering? The original tags left on the items. Seeing what they would cost at a store is fantastic.

What was the worst part? The shirt size, obviously. I wish I'd known that brand of shirt runs hilariously small.

Would I recommend 20jeans to others? Absolutely. I'd mention that the sizing can be a bit scattershot, though. *Caveat emptor* and all that.

**EDIT: PHOTOS** These aren't the greatest quality, as I apparently don't have a full-length mirror in the house. Also note, I gave the jeans a soak and hung them to dry overnight. The fit was tighter, but not uncomfortably so. http://imgur.com/a/ynmF7",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,1355086841.0,,,True,t3_14ivtb,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/14ivtb/my_20jeanscom_first_impressions_spoiler_alert/,

1352562376.0,101,self.frugalmalefashion,12ys0w,"Frugality isn't just about finding sales, it's about how you care for your clothing. Details inside...",136,35,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/12ys0w/frugality_isnt_just_about_finding_sales_its_about/,"1) Wash your clothes as infrequently as possible.

Why? Your clothes get most of their wear in the washer and dryer, not on your body. If you wash/dry them less, they will last much longer. Furthermore, doing laundry costs money (electricity, detergent, dryer sheets, etc.) that you could otherwise be saving.

How? You should always wear a tee (one that covers your armpits!) under a button up shirt. This allows your button up to go through 2-3 wearings before it needs to be washed. It is the analogue of wearing underwear under your pants; it allows them to be worn multiple times without being washed. Essentially, it is better to soil and wash (and thus wear out) cheap underwear and tees than expensive pants and shirts.

Bonus: Use the “delicates” setting if none of your clothes are very dirty (just casual use). This puts less strain on your clothing with no change in cleanliness.

note: I can’t stand feeling that I’m wearing dirty clothes, but this method even works for me. I used to wash all of my clothes after just one use, but I find that my clothes are no dirtier using the washing schedule recommended here.

2) Don’t put your clothes in the dryer.

Why? It puts unnecessary wear on your clothes. In fact, this destroys your clothing more than anything else they regularly encounter.

How? Hang dry your clothing. You can get a wheeled clothing hanger for $10-$15 at your local grocery/all-purpose store.

I love the look of these brands ([example](http://hypebeast.com/2011/02/norse-projects-2011-fallwinter-collection-lookbook/), [example](http://www.penfield.com/us/fall_winter_2012_lookbook#p0/)), but lack the money.  To emulate the look, here's what I've sort of figured out:

**Outerwear:** 

*Technical Parkas:*  This is gonna be pretty costly no matter what you do.  Uniqlo has a [""mountain parka""](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-mountain-parka/072931-67-004), but from what I've heard it's pretty thin.  Surplus stores might have some yellow heavy duty rain jackets if you're bold enough.  You can always scour sites like Etsy and Ebay for vintage 60/40 parkas.  Otherwise you kind of have to bite the bullet and pay up for something from [Sierra Designs](http://www.sierradesigns.com/p-445-mountain-parka.aspx), [Fjallraven](http://www.fjallraven.us/p-14-mens-greenland-jacket.aspx), or [Norse Projects](http://www.norseprojects.com/store/aw_2012/outerwear).

*Down Vests/Jackets*: Uniqlo has a whole down section.  [Gap](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=61883&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=239729002) has some good looking down vests this year as well.  [J Crew Factory has a few](http://factory.jcrew.com/mens-clothing/jackets_outerwear/cotton_nylon_outerwear/PRDOVR~90461/90461.jsp).  Then there are the slightly more expensive, but reliable outdoors brands like [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/us/product/mens-down-sweater-jacket?p=84673-0-961).

*Other:* I sort of hesitate to include this because it leans a lot more outdoors than streetwear, but Penfield's lookbook includes toggle coats.  [Here is a cheap alternative to such coats](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=5286&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=329234002).


**Sweaters:** Patterned sweaters are pretty important to this look. Fair Isle is pretty commonplace this year, so you can find frugal alternatives at [Target](http://www.target.com/p/merona-men-s-crew-sweater-heather-gray-navy-stripes/-/A-14107256#prodSlot=large_1_3), [Lands End](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-lambswool-fair-isle-crewneck-sweater~246603_-1.html), [H&amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/product/05287?article=05287-A), [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-fair-isle-crew-neck-sweaterlong-sleeve/073367-32) etc.

For plain colored sweaters, Uniqlo has some [$20 lambswool](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-lambswool-crew-neck-sweater/069381-31-007), but they need to restock.  [LL Bean Wool Rag sweaters](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/75169?feat=594-GN1&amp;page=ragg-wool-sweater-crewneck) are $50 but are thick and warm as fuck.

**Shirts:**  Shirts for this look are mostly button downs.  Fabrics like [Chambray](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-chambray-shirt~246599_-1.html), [Flannel](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-flannel-check-long-sleeve-shirt/072899-58), [Chamois](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/22611?feat=589-GN1&amp;page=bean-s-chamois-cloth-shirt), and Denim all have their place.  However, you need to be careful not to look too ""work wear"" ish, as there is a distiction between the two looks.  This look can easily be combined with streetwear elements, so different patterned shirts (microfloral, camo) can be used as well.

Basic (horizontally) striped long sleeve tee shirts work too, especially for warmer days, and can be found almost anywhere.

**Pants:** Norse Projects doesn't seem to use jeans.  This is one of the major distinctions between the outdoorsy streetwear aesthetic and more the traditional outdoors workwear look.  Instead, heavy chinos and slim fitting cargo pants can be used.  Some cheaper options for the slim cargo pants include [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-perfect-shape-cargo-pants/070768-57-030), [Lands End](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-slim-fit-cargo-pants~244552_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::JA1&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men&amp;origin=index), and Dockers Alpha Cargos (which don't seem to be stocked anywhere currently).  For other pants, go for chinos in dark navy blue, dark brown, dark grey, or just plain old light khaki.  Of course, colors like dark green and dark red are not off limits, they're just harder to use.

**Footwear**: This look can use all kinds of footwear.

Penfield loves Danner hiking boots, but they do cost quite a bit.  [Here](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-montrose-alpine-boot~237742_-1.html) is an alternative.  In their latest lookbook the guy is wearing filson boots not unlike [these](http://www.shoesontheweb.com/store/product.asp?itemnumber=MB73061&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;utm_medium=datafeed&amp;utm_content=MB73061).

Another part of this look is a basic, white canvas sneaker.  I'd lean away from chucks though, as they're too iconic.  Some basic lo top such as [pro-keds](http://www.keds.com/store/SiteController/kedspro/productdetails?catId=cat700172&amp;subCatId=cat610295&amp;subCatTabId=cat610291&amp;showDefaultOption=true&amp;stockNumber=PMC44091&amp;skuId=***5*******PMC44091*M095&amp;productId=5-174900&amp;&amp;subCatId=cat610295&amp;productId=5-174900&amp;stockNumber=PMC44091&amp;subCatTabId=cat610291&amp;catId=cat700172&amp;productdisplayName=Royal+Lo&amp;subcatdisplayName=Lo's&amp;skuId=***5*******PMC44091*M095&amp;pageIdentifier=productdetail&amp;catdisplayName=Products&amp;showDefaultOption=true), [jack purcells](http://www.zappos.com/converse-jack-purcell-cp-white-white?ef_id=azhPX7z2SAMAAIT9:20121103020247:s), or generic surplus would work well.  Sockless of course.

Other non-hiking boots are also acceptable, though this look prefers chuncky, light colored soles.  Vibram soles are a pretty common look, and they can be part of everything from wingtips to desert boots.  You can have a cobbler resole an existing boot, but i'm not sure how well that will work or how cheap that would be.

**Accessories:** I honestly don't know enough to do this category.  A lot of places have fair isle patterned scarves, which are great for the look.  For hats, basic knit hats can be found almost anywhere.  I have no idea about the other types of hat though (like 5 panels), somebody else may have to write up their own mini-guide.


I'm by no means an authority on this subject, but this is what I've figured out over a few weeks of browsing and research.  Hope it helps!

I saw this in the store and it got my attention.  I like the way it fit but I've read some not so good things about this brand on MFA, so that's making me a bit hesitant.

You won't find any good deals except on small up and comers, not very different from the artisans at the local farmer's market / swap meet.

I recently became addicted to Flash Sale sites, unfortunately couldn't find a good list of them on here so I figured I'd jot them down as I go along. I'll also be adding my favorite, and your favorite (post them!) online stores to order from. If you post a recommendation, do me a favor and let us know as much technical info as possible- like, do you recommend sizing up/down, shipping times, thread quality, you know, your general experience with that vendor.

I'm only going to post a couple of one-a-day sites as I'm not really a fan of them. It's super rare that I like what I see and then I'll just wind up forgetting the site even exists.

### Clothing!

[JackThreads](http://www.jackthreads.com)- I love the stuff on here. I've only ordered once but it came in about 6 days and everything was in new condition. Very happy with everything except I think the color was a bit nicer on the website for some things. I get a lot of expensive looking Chambray button ups here. This made me a flash-site guy! My favorites are the Nucos and 191 stuff. Items can be held in cart for 15 minutes.

[Frank &amp; Oak](http://www.frankandoak.com)- Discovered this tonight and haven't had a chance to try it out yet. They design and manufacturer all of the items sold. $6 shipping, free at home try on (if you join the free Hunt Club). Prices fit just under Lands End stuff

[Plndr](http://www.plndr.com/)- Pretty big mix of stuff, huge shoe selection.

[No More Rack](http://nomorerack.com)- Flash sales start at 12pm EST. Shipping is $2. 8 Sale Items a day. YMMV here, the site looks pretty generic although I see some somewhat-discounted Raybans. It has everything, cologne, jewelry, electronics. I've never ordered here. Items can be held in cart for 15 minutes.

[Rue La La](http://www.ruelala.com/) – Flash sales last for 1-3 days and open and close constantly. Rue la la has sales on designer clothing and accessories. Shipping starts at $9.95. They have a huge selection of designers- but not a lot of items. Looks like a great place to get Kenneth Cole, there's a sold out Peacoat for $69. I've never ordered here.

[Ideeli](http://www.ideeli.com/)- Flash sales start at 12pm EST. Flash sales last for 40 hours or until the sale items are sold out. Most items ship for $9.95. Ideeli sells clothing, housewares, travel and more.

[Beyond the Rack](https://www.beyondtherack.com)- Flash sales start at 11 AM EST and last for 48 hours. Shipping is $9.95. Beyond the Rack sells designer clothing and accessories. Crazy deals on Clarks and Outerwear right now!

[MyHabit](http://www.myhabit.com)- MyHabit is a designer flash sales website. Flash sales start at 12pm EST and last for 72 hours. Shipping is FREE and fast (returns are free too!)- generally orders arrive within 4 days. MyHabit is a flash sale site started by Amazon and they sell boutique and designer fashions. This is AMAZONS own flash sale site.

[Gilt Groupe](http://www.gilt.com/)- Gilt Groupe is one of the most popular flash sales websites. Gilt offers 36 hour private sales daily at 12pm. They offer flash sales on everything- designer clothes, housewares and gifts. Shipping is only $5.95. Items can be held in cart for 10 minutes.

[Belle &amp; Clive](http://www.belleandclive.com/)- Belle &amp; Clive is a designer fashion flash sale site. Belle &amp; Clive offers private sales on brands like Prada, Gucci and  Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Sales start at 12pm EST. Belle &amp; Clive used to be called Envite. $25 referral credit!

[Editor’s Closet](http://www.editorscloset.com)- Editor’s Closet offers private flash sales on designer brands for men, women and children. They offer FREE same day shipping on all orders placed before 2pm. Some of the brands they have offered include Valentino and Oscar de la Renta. They have some killer deals on Creed cologne right now!

[HauteLook](http://www.hautelook.com/)- HauteLook offers sale events for women, beauty, home, kids, men and travel. Some good stuff under $100- 7FAM jeans, Earnest Sewn, Diesels, Ghurka. $7.95 shipping.


###Next up, some online stores that I thoroughly enjoy-


[Lands End Canvas](http://canvas.landsend.com/)- It's like an affordable Brooks Brothers! Not to mention 30% off sales fairly frequently.

[ASOS](http://us.asos.com/)- This is a pretty popular one around here but I've never used them. Free shipping both ways! I'm digging their watch selection.

[Bluefly](http://www.bluefly.com/)- 100% Designer wear. I don't really order from here because I still can't afford any of it. C'est la vie.

[Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/)- Not to most exciting patterns, but damn it's affordable and slim!

[6pm](http://www.6pm.com/)- I'm sure everybody knows this one, awesome place to get shoes. Owned by Zappos (who I don't need to mention here)


###JEWELRY, ACCESSORIES, LEATHER GOODS


[Maxton Men](http://www.maxtonmen.com/)- This is pure #man stuff here, move along ladies! Wallets, shaving kits, Colonel Conk soap! It's like a Thinkgeek for Archer! Wait, where are the guns?

[Chrono Shark](http://www.chronoshark.com/)- Part of the http://www.sharkstores.com group of one a day sales. LOTS of Invicita and Victoronix. It's pretty rare that I see something I like, but I've bought a few Citizen Eco drives on there. Beware, the brands sold on there (Invicita, Citizen, Victoronix) tend to have models that are of a very different quality from one another. For instance, one Invicta might feel like it's worth the $200 you paid for it and another model of Invicta might feel like a dollar tree watch. Look at reviews elsewhere before diving in.

[House of Sunglasses](http://www.houseofsunglasses.com)- Want some cheap vintage goggles? Here you go! Buy 3, free shipping! They're all $9.99!

[Dollar Shave Club](http://www.dollarshaveclub.com)- One of my favorite startups ever. $1, $6, or $9/mo and they deliver your razers to you every month. Quit having to feel like a scammed sap every time you 


###OTHER
[Opensky](https://opensky.com/)- Opensky is a flash sale site where you “follow” celebrities like Molly Sims, Kristen Cavallari and Bobby Flay. They feature products on sale. You can earn a $10 credit just for joining off your first purchase. There are all kinds of different celebrities you can follow, so they have clothing flash sales, food flash sales, health flash sales and design flash sales. 

[Massdrop](http://www.massdrop.com/)- This is a group buy site. Seems like it typically winds up being car stuff, but I recently grabbed a One Star wallet off of it for a great deal.

[Seshday](http://www.seshday.com/)- This is like Jackthreads but for Xgames type stuff. Wakeboarding, surfing, snowboarding, etc.


###FOOD/DRINK


[Gilt City](http://www.giltcity.com/)- Gilt City is a division of Gilt Groupe and is a great way to get local deals on restaurants and services. Currently only 14 cities. Not sure how they were chosen.


###HOUSE STUFF


[One Kings Lane](https://www.onekingslane.com/)- These guys have some killer vintage/rustic looking furniture. I love their ""Industrial Home"" designs and Asian imports.

I've recently found that reddit tends to have its stand-by's in terms of its staples. We get it: Mossimo V-neck's from target, OCBD's from Uniqlo, , Docker's Alpha Chinos, CDB's etc.

I feel like we should have a thread devoted to clothing staples that aren't necessarily on sale, but provide a good consistent value regardless.

Onto my contribution to this thread:

I absolutely love American Apparel Tri-blend Track T-shirts. They're made from a mixture of cotton, polyester, and rayon. They're basically my go-to in terms of a base-layer. I've tried T-shirts from BR (Soft-wash), J-Crew (Broken-in), and the usual suspects (hanes,gildan) etc. but none of them provided in my opinion any comparison in terms of comfort/looks/durability.

My favorite point about these shirts is they never wrinkle, my shirts from BR and J-crew consistently need to be hang-dried or ironed for them to look presentable. These guys I just throw in the dryer and they come out perfect. They're also form fitting, I'm not the most muscular guy but these guys hang and cling just the right amount to look great (also helps that they basically feel like baby ocelot skins). I've had 5 of them for about 2 and a half years now, and they still wear and feel as if they're basically brand-new.

1335660793.0,92,self.frugalmalefashion,sxj88,Thrifting tips &amp; tricks!,100,8,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/sxj88/thrifting_tips_tricks/,"I noticed that FMF rarely touches on the fine art of thrifting.  In my opinion thrifting is absolutely essential to the development of personal fashion sense, because it allows you, on a tiny budget, to be able to experiment with an incredible amount of different styles and colors.  Here are some personal tips that I've found useful when thrifting.

* I think many people's reservations against thrifting is the fact that the found clothing may be dirty or tattered.  In my experiences 90% of the clothing I find is in almost perfect condition.  Think of it as buying a used car; if you can get over the fact that someone wore it before you, you realize that after a clean wash, it's as good as new, and a massive saving.

* Missing a button?  Be a man, buy a sewing kit and fix that shit yourself.  Bitches love a guy that mends shit.

* The advantage of thrift stores is that the clothing is cheap.  The disadvantage is that most stores do not sort by size, the most useful parameter for most people.  However, thrift stores do tend to sort by color, which is almost as good.

* At $5/dress shirt and $7/designer jeans, you have the freedom to be silly.  Get a bright red blazer, a crazy plaid button up, or salmon shorts.  As long as it fits well and isn't stained or damaged, it's interesting and useful.

* Thrift stores tend to have an abundance of button ups, suits and blazers, shorts, khakis and work trousers, and standard jeans.  They tend to be weaker at skinny jeans, skinny ties, cardigans, stylish vests, GTH pants, and form fitting Ts.  Often times the shoe selection is tawdry; I've never found a good pair of shoes while thrifting.  But it is obviously dependent on the stores in your area.  Shop to the thrift store's advantages.

* Know generally what you're hunting for when you go.  Set targets: Pink polo, black button up, 32/30 waist jeans.  Execute like a (frugal) bawss.

* The method of fitting your forearm, elbow to fist, inside the pants waistline works wonders if you can't find the waist size and have no fitting room. 

* Thrifting is all about efficiency.  Going through every article in every rack is going to be demotivating and a waste of time.  Often times you can get a much better yield ratio if you're actively checking tags for size and brand; personally, every Express Small button up that I've nabbed on a first try has had a near-perfect fit and color.

* Contribute to the store!  If you're planning to make a trip to buy, think about bringing some of your old clothes for donation and save them the trip of picking up at your doorstep.  One man's trash is another man's treasure.

* All it takes is one trip home with a pristine $5 Express 1MX fitted button down that retails for $60 in store for you to realize what you've been missing out on.  I don't find thrifting embarrassing at all, and I think people who do need to get off of their pedestal. 

* I should mention that I live in Boston.  Big cities will obviously have better selection.

This is all I have.  If anyone else has any tips, please comment below and I will do my best to compile them in real time!

Edit: commenter's tips:

* Steal from your dad's wardrobe!  Also gives you a chance to make fun of his stupid hawaiian shirts.

* Ask your store when they restock, they usually have particular days.

Please be sure to include what color you chose, as ""Rust"" and ""Brown"" can look pretty similar to folks like myself. I'll throw up my photos of the Cordovan No. 8's once I get off work and can pick them up. Hope everyone is pleased!

[The original deal post can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1g7qk5/wolverine_1000_mile_addison_boots_seconds_for/)

For those curious about the leather used in these boots, here's [Horween's 101](http://horween.com/101/chromexcel-2/).

EDIT: As promised, [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/O6THv).

 Most notable flaw I can tell is some slight scarring on the boots in areas, nothing deep or what I would call a ""gash"". In fact i'm pretty sure this was in the hide to begin with, not after. I'm a happy camper. I did notice that the tongues have a small hole in them. Does anyone know what this is for? Or is this Wolverine's way of marking 2nd's? 

A word on sizing: I went down from my usual 9.5D (tho I'm closer to a C, I go a tad larger due to my immense body heat) to a 9D. Honestly they could probably be a little smaller in the toebox, but if I went any further the sides would strangle me. A half-size down seems about right.

$15 for a few styles of the wool sport coats, and $35 for a khaki or blue blazer.  Online prices are around twice this price.  I also had a 20% coupon that brought the prices down even more.  These are not a summer coat but still a heck of a deal.

1364219534.0,92,self.frugalmalefashion,1az0s8,[DISCUSSION] Moving requests to self posts only,116,24,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1az0s8/discussion_moving_requests_to_self_posts_only/,"I think many of us find the informal request system a little bit flawed.  Requests typically consist of a title with something along the lines of ""where can I find a cheaper version of this?"" and a link.  These posts do little to generate discussion and often are just filled with FMFers asking for clarification to help find a suitable replacement.  Many times, OP never even responds to these posts asking for more info.

[Recent Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1arphv/any_cheap_lookalikes_to_these_cranes/)

[Recent Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1auyjf/where_to_find_this_jacket_any_cheaper/)

[Recent Example 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1aw5o3/similar_sweatshorts_for_less/)


I'd like to see us go to a self post only system for requests and here's why:

1.  It would eliminate links with no clarification.  The poster would be required to fill in some kind of text and may, in the process, provide more details about what it is he's looking for.

2.  Building off #1, we could come up with a quick guide to making requests.  We'd ask the poster to include budget, what characteristics he likes (fit, style, color, etc), where he's located, if he has a tight timeline, etc.

3.  It makes the poster actually think about what he wants.  Too often someone posts a picture of a good looking guy in less-than-stellar clothing and wants to mimic the look.  The standard FMF/MFA response is to ""be as good looking as that guy.""  If the poster has to think about cut, fabric, color, and style, maybe he'll realize there isn't anything he particularly likes aside from that specific person's looks.  Furthermore, OP will be more invested in his post and be more likely to truly be interested in what he's requesting.  I always get annoyed when I see a request, spend 5-10 minutes tracking down the last place I saw something similar, and then OP doesn't seem to care anymore.

4.  This isn't a main concern, but it would eliminate anyone making posts for karma.  I could care less about karma, and this hasn't necessarily been an issue, but there's no reason to ""give karma"" to someone just for making a request.


[This poster made it pretty clear what he's looking for](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1avnxy/request_a_frugal_alternative_to_these_striped/) and, I think, is a good example of how requests should be made.

I also like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1aqgyx/retro_short_boardshorts/) as the poster articulates specific features he wants.  We would never know he was looking for those features if he had just posted a picture.

I purchased 10 silk ties from the new guy for $42 shipped through paypal.  Shipping was pretty quick for China and only took about 10 business days though this can vary....shipping to me from China seems to be hit or miss in terms of speed.



Ties are great quality though can arrive a little rumpled from shipping.  They are silk and are normal heavy weight ties, not wimpy thin no weight ties.  Brands are D&amp;T (never heard of) and Georgio Armani (real or fake I don't know) .



If you want to get a great deal on quality ties, this is how you do it:
Visit http://stores.ebay.com/goodmakers/_i.html?_nkw=-Bow+Tie&amp;submit=Search&amp;_sid=1002155559 and find the ties you like.  Write down the item numbers (each listing starts with the item number).

Send him your paypal address and he will invoice you.



If you are scared to do this off of eBay like me, his ties are still darn cheap at like $6 a piece.



Contact him through ebay or through cbbhbb_mq2825rfo@members.ebay.com.hk directly.  I gave him my paypal address and he sent me an invoice.  I paid and he shipped the same day.

Personally, I find that some sales just aren't worth scrolling through hundreds of items to find the few gems that are a great buy at the price. As of now, when a sale gets posted I generally browse the comments to see what people are buying. With the upvote system, we could see what are the most popular sales/deals/coupons on specific items for that day. At the end of the day, the post would fall further down the subreddit and hopefully disappear to give rise to the next day's sales/deals.

first please don't downvote me, I'm not trying to promote my website as there is nothing here to promote, I'm just trying to get some suggestions for my year long project which as I suggest in the title, it will be a frugal fashion site supplying cheaper replacements for popular products.

My goal is to gather info on what type of product people really want but cannot afford, and contact manufacture overseas to have them produce a similar product for a cheaper price , thus selling them here for a cheaper price as well. So you can be in with the popular fashion without shelling out big bucks. 

I know there are copy right laws, I'm not trying to copy a product but find a similar replacement, talking to a lawyer tomorrow to see the details

Currently I'm looking through malefashioadvice to see what's popular and getting some ideas and notes down, but I'd really like your input as well.
All I need from you all is to pm me, mail, or post below what type of product you would like to see, and I'll look for similar products and hopefully sell them here in the states. It would be awesome too if you have any suggestions or questions for me. 

I would also love , in a later date, for some of you to test out the products for quality assurance, so your help is really appreciated!!

TL;DR: Op is college entrepreneur student, starting a frugal fashion shop, and love your input on what types of products you would like to see!

**Edit**: Thanks for everyone's input, It was very helpful, going to organize the information, but feel free to keep posting suggestions, I will try to keep everyone updated the progress!

**Update 10/2/2012**: After reading comments and taking advises from others, I've decided not to sacrifice quality for price by purchasing from Alibaba, Instead, I along with another friend who is also a redditor here, are accumulating a list of  potential retailers from the USA, mostly smaller retailers and some large chains. When the list is adequate, I will send out a survey gauging the interest of these companies to provide their products for a group buying website as a promotion like groupon for a cheaper price, or even provide their fashionable seasonal inventory that they need to sell for a much cheaper price. It's decided that if 10% of these companies are interested, I'll go ahead and further invest in this startup. So if you know any local retailers with amazing items or retailers you are interested in seeing, please let me know, so I can add them to my list, thank you very much!

Ships from Luxury Lane and there aren't a lot of reviews online for either the company or the coat, but at $109 (I got it for $99 a few weeks ago) you really need to snap this up. Mine is fantastic, it comes in where it needs to for the slim fit, the material feels great, it's warm, etc. I got it in charcoal.

My one complaint is that some of the (decorative) buttons on the front are sort of droopy due to excess thread length, but seeing as to the fact that I can fix that myself with a needle and thread, it really doesn't bother me too much. Get it.

Edit with info that you can find in the comments: 

It's a slim fit, as you can tell from the link, and that seems to be the deciding factor in making a peacoat work on my build. If you have my build it'll be great, if you're bigger you might want to go with a normal peacoat.

I got a lot of Visa gift cards for Christmas. They make great gifts for people that are difficult to shop for, or you don't know their size. However, after my post-Christmas-sale shopping, I was left with 4 cards with about $6 each. Amazon, however, will only let you pay with *one* card, and $6 clearly will not buy you much. 

Solution? Buy a $6 Amazon gift card. You can apply as many Amazon gift cards as you want to a purchase, and there is no processing fee. I was able to use up 100% of my gift cards, and managed to drop those [Clarks Desert Boots](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Beeswax/dp/B000WU4T0A/) posted yesterday down to $40 out of pocket after the 20% off coupon and gift cards.

**So general consensus is that:**

Shirts and pants are around $10-20

Coats are around $25-40

This, of course, depends on what kind of alterations need to be done. And there are a couple outliers that charge a bit more.

It took me awhile until someone turned me on to reddit in general, and even longer until I found my way over to /r/frugalmalefashion, but boy am I glad I did.

From reading this subreddit, I've learned of Uniqlo and purchased two of their incredible casual long-sleeve buttondowns, a very classy $26 Timex watch, a pair of brown work shoes from ASOS, a merino quarter zip sweater, dark washed Levi 501s, and a pair of Stafford Camlins, which I intend to polish as mentioned by another redditor.

1361331916.0,82,self.frugalmalefashion,18v58x,Make the Most of Your Money: A Guide to Selling Your Used Clothes on eBay,95,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/18v58x/make_the_most_of_your_money_a_guide_to_selling/,"A couple months ago, I wrote up a review of how to buy clothes on eBay. I figured I would just drop some more knowledge on how to take advantage of selling your clothes.For most of my clothes that I buy used and new, I am able to make back all the money I’ve spent on acquiring them, and often times a little extra. Here are some techniques to get the most money possible. Note: I don’t deal with suiting, but I know some guy posted an awesome guide on how to buy suiting on eBay so I am sure you can use those techniques in reverse for your own auctions. Also, I will often reference J. Crew as a model because this is one of the frequent brands that I sell. 

Do Your Research: Search eBay for your article of clothing that you are trying to sell. Search by your size if possible. eBay has a feature where you can look at auctions that ended with a bidder, and make note of what price they sold at. Look through current auctions and watch a couple of them. Observe their bidding patterns, what the auction started at, etc. Another important feature is distinguishing between colors, types of shirts, etc. Some colors sell better in others of the same exact shirt. 


Strategic Pricing: There are several different methods of selling your item. 

The “high roller” is setting your auction at .99 and letting the market determine the value of the item. I don’t quite have the guts to do this as often now as I have lost money a couple times this way. The only time I would use this model is if your item is HOT and attracts large bidding amounts in the auctions that you’ve seen. For example, I had a Chubbies tank tee that I never wore. I saw that they were garnering quite a bit of attention so I put mine up for .99. After 7 days and a plethora of bids, my auction ended at $102.50, a full $40 higher than the last sold shirt (High scarcity combined with a massive demand for these fueled this price as well).

The auction type I list at most is the “I’m happy with this, but more would be nice”. This involves listing at a price you’re willing to sell at. For example, if you would be happy with selling your J Crew shirt for $18 (and that’s about market price for a typical used J Crew shirt), list it at that price. I also usually add in a Buy It Now option with this type of auction. This presses people beyond the market demand price, and lures them to pay a little more to snatch if before the auction ends. 

The last type of auction is the “long timer”. I really don’t have time for this one, but I’ve seen it in practice. This involves looking at the market price and raising it way beyond what the market demands. For instance, there was a pair of Brooks Brothers 346 pants that seemed attractive to me on eBay, except the seller was selling them for about $75 (market demand ~15-30), which is probably more than full retail for them. I offered to go lower, but the seller told me someone would eventually buy them at that price. It took a couple months, but the item sold (for $65). This type of auction could last for a while, possibly never even selling. 

Old Clothes are Old: When selling your used clothes, it will almost be obvious just how old the clothes are. Tags change, and this is often a tell-tale sign of how old a piece of clothing is actually. Older clothes will sell for less 90% of the time, so deal with it. Sell your clothes within 3 years of buying new (varies if you bought the item used) if you want to maximize your profits. 

Make clothing lots of the same size/style: Having multiple of the same size item in one auction can actually save you money with shipping fees that you would have to pay for each individual item. Also, some lots go for even more than single items due to the fact that people don't want the hassle of dealing with multiple sellers and auctions. Don't mix different sized items in lots! (E.g. Small shirt &amp; 30/32 pants shouldn't be combined because you're limiting your potential market)

Seasons: Selling your clothes at the right time can make you a much more substantial amount than other parts of the year. Do what Marshall’s and TJ Maxx do: list your clothes at the beginning of the age appropriate season. Honestly, who wants to buy a parka when there is a heat wave hitting the country during the summer? People begin looking for clothes at the beginning of the season (or right at the end of the preceding season) and retail stores have all those season’s clothes at full retail, so prices generally go up on eBay. 

Title: This is what gets people to see your item. Include as much description as you can. Take this title for example: J Crew Tailored Fit Madras Lightweight Shirt Medium. Make sure you list the brand, the article of clothing, the subtype of the article of clothing, and the size. You CAN add other things (colors that are in the item for instance), but the ones I gave to you are the essentials to obtain the most traffic. DON’T get a subtitle. This is for chumps, whom eBay loves to take advantage of. 


Photos: This is simple: take good photos. eBay now gives you 12 photos for free to add to your gallery. Make sure you have good lighting and good angles when taking the picture. Another important thing to make sure of is that the coloration of the picture matches as closely to the actual color of the item. Take pictures of any spots or damages to the shirt.

Categorizing: For God’s sake, make sure you put your item into the right category. This may seem simple, but I can’t tell you how many times people have entered the wrong sizing info. 

Description: Don’t overcomplicate the description. Don’t tell us how you just wore it your girlfriend’s sorority function and never wore it again. Why? Because I have a feeling that most of these types of stories that I read for items that I want to buy are complete bull shit. I’m not saying that everyone is lying, it’s just that I see it so often that it gets to seem unbelievable. Just list what the item is, what condition it’s in, and the size. When describing the condition of your item, make sure to note of any blemishes, stains, etc. and make sure the details of these “defects” match the severity of the actual defect. Don’t make your item seem like it is in better condition than it actually is.  For sizing, a good added measure would be to include the measurements of the garment. I don’t do this as much as I should, but it really does help buyers out (I’ve gotten asked for measurements many times in the messages). Make clear what your return policy is as well. This is important in case there is a discrepancy between you and the buyer. Usually if there is a stain, hole, etc. that I make note of in the auction, I will almost always put a no return policy on it. 

Shipping: Make sure your shipping is less than or about equal to the price that you actually pay. I’ll charge 5.50 to ship out most shirts, but most of the time I can ship them priority in a flat rate envelope for 4.90 (I typically charge a little higher for a reason which I will get to in short time). Don’t list your normal shirt at market price with shipping at $10. If you don’t have a scale or anything to weigh your packages, try to use flat rate envelopes (don’t know if you non-‘Mericans have those). I don’t have much experience shipping internationally (I stick to US only), but from the two times I’ve done it, the worst part is filling out the customs form which only takes a minute or two. I have heard bad stories about shipping to certain countries (I’m looking at you Putin..), but I have not really had enough experience to back any of my claims on this matter. Add a tracking number as well to protect yourself from the buyer scamming you. 


Fees: As you keep selling on the site, you’ll realize that eBay sucks away your profits. For auction style listings, eBay will take away 9% of what your item sold for + the shipping costs (a reason why I raise my shipping fees a little, which eBay states is against their policy). Paypal also takes 2.9% + $.30 from every single transaction before eBay fees (FYI: eBay owns Paypal; highway robbery at its finest). Buy it now fees are a little more complicated (see website for more detailed description; I’m pretty sure if you list a auction styled listing with a BIN and someone uses the BIN, you will only be charged with auction style fees). 

Offers: Buyers will often message you with offers to lower the price of the item. If you have room to negotiate and you want to just sell your item, by all means work with them. Another technique that I use is offering the buyer to go off eBay. While this is against eBay’s policies, I have never gotten caught and I’ve used this method at least 15 times in the past year. I have heard of people getting Paypal accounts frozen and eBay accounts suspended for violating this policy so do this at your own risk. 

I hope this is helpful for you guys! Add anything you think that I forgot, or just add an opinion.

Whenever I see a store with a BOGO sale going on (Men's Wearhouse is a great store for this), I take a friend with me and if we each find something from the same department that we like, we get it and split the cost. So instead of spending $40 for two new sweaters, I get one new sweater for $20.

I'm 5'11/160 lbs/Size S. My [build*](http://i.imgur.com/PmhIr.jpg)
is with broad shoulders/thin-ish waist.

* 
[Heritage Chambray](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-the-heritage-chambray-workshirt~236482_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::PWY&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men): I have owned the gray and blue. [GQ](http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201004/best-chambray-shirts-budget-gray-chambray) likes the gray. The blue is far closer to the swatch image than the picture of the model guy. Worth buying if you want a light chambray shirt for absurdly cheap.


* 
[Brushed Flannel](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-brushed-flannel-workshirt~236827_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::AQ5&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men): Winter sky/burnt plaid. Nice shirts, but they billow at the waist and are too long for my height. I would recommend them at this price only if you are into tucking in flannel shirts. 

* 
[Heritage Oxford Shirt](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-the-heritage-oxford-shirt~238511_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::QJ8&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men&amp;origin=index):  Do you need a yellow oxford shirt on the cheap? Then this is worth it. It's not the most substantial, but it is worth $12 for sure. Works well with a brown blazer.

* 
[Large Plaid Poplin Shirt](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-large-plaid-poplin-shirt~238525_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::WRO&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men&amp;origin=index): My favorite shirt. It works well with my skin tone (olive-ish) and eye color (green.) Contrasts well with tucked-in dark jeans.

* 
[Men's Plaid Poplin Shirt](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-plaid-poplin-shirt~240624_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::NPL&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men&amp;origin=index): These shirts were too conservatively-designed for me, but fit well. I say conservative because the plaid reminded me a bit too much of the stagnant design sense of rat racers.

* 
[Men's Lightweight Brushed Flannel Workshirt](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-lightweight-brushed-flannel-workshirt~236493_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::KH5&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men&amp;origin=index): These had a dumb tab collar thing that I think ruined the shirt. It hung off when unbuttoned and bothered me deeply. 

* 
[Men's Slub Patterned Shirt](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-slub-patterned-shirt~236494_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::PK5&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men): I got the Malibu Teal. I love it.  A go-to summer shirt that fits excellently -- tucked or untucked -- with a nice, breezy feeling to it.

* 
[Garment Dyed Straight Collar Shirt](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-garment-dyed-straight-collar-shirt~236498_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::BSK&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men&amp;origin=index) Blue and green. Great shirts, but the blue one stained in the wash, so I'm now scared to wash the green one. I really love the deepness of the hues of the shirts, but with the wash problems, I would recommend this only if you have a nearby Sears if it doesn't end up working out.

* 
[Men's Salt and Pepper Shirt](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-salt-and-pepper-shirt~238003_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::SGY&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men) Seemed like a good idea at the time, but has annoying epaulets and those shoulder buttons which remind me too much of an over-designed Express shirt.

* 
[Crosby Moc-Toes](http://www.landsend.com/pp/canvas-mens-crosby-moc-toe-lace-up-boot~237743_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::BLA&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-canvas-clearance-_-men&amp;origin=index) I have the brown ones. Deluged with compliments whenever I wear these. Isn't the world's best boot, but looks nice with dark jeans/chinos and will be appreciated by non-boot snobs. I only wear them when I'm in ""dressy"" mode, because I'm not sure about their durability.

* 
[Classified Sections -- Men's Poplin Workshirt](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-poplin-workshirt~241544_-1.html?CM_MERCH=CANVAS_OTC) I am a big fan of the dark charcoal heather shirt with dark jeans. I completely stole this look from a musician...Also, if you decide to go with the pewter heather shirt, be warned that the buttons are not black as in the picture, but are the same color as the shirt.

* 
[Bonus: Men's Heritage Striped Oxford](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/the-heritage-striped-oxford~211460_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::XM1&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_men-_-shirts-&amp;origin=index) How these are 11.99 is a mystery to me. [Beautiful shirt](http://i.imgur.com/MFWrZ.jpg), and again [GQ approved](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cSN6RucfvE&amp;feature=relmfu).

What are my best options?,91,20,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1dxyq8/i_need_a_suit_cheaply_and_quickly_what_are_my/,"I recently decided to look for a new job (hence the throwaway), and I just got my first bite. I have an interview in two days, and I need something to wear.

I've lost quite a bit of weight since the last time I wore a suit (5 years ago), so nothing I had then fits. It's ridiculously too big on me, so I need to get a new suit.

Obviously, I need something quickly. Herein lies my problem: I'm on a budget, and I likely won't be able to find pants that are exactly my size. (I'm still a little too round for my height, so my pants typically need to be hemmed.)

I'm also on a budget. I don't think I want to spend more than $150-200 on the whole outfit. If I get the new job, I'll have an excuse to buy lots of new clothes (it's a lot more money than I make now), but right now I want to limit myself, to avoid sinking money into a search that doesn't pan out.

Where can I get a suit relatively cheaply that won't look terrible? I'm not looking for GQ here, just something serviceable that I can wear to interviews for the next few weeks or months.

Also, what colors and fabrics should I be looking for, with this purpose in mind? I'm planning to buy a jacket, pants, one or two shirts, and one or two ties. Maybe shoes, if I have to, but I do have a pair of decent black shoes at home that could look great with a proper polishing.

EDIT

**Other relevant info:** I've lost about 60 pounds since I last bought a suit, so tailoring is probably not an option. This interview is for a database-related job at a CPA firm in Indianapolis. The other places I'm looking (including the phone interview I have somewhere else next week) are in manufacturing, construction, healthcare/insurance, and sales. 

ULTRA-LATE EDIT

**Final result:** I ended up going with Joseph A. Bank. I went there right after work and found a suit that I really loved. It was marked $895, but I ended up getting it and a great tie for under $300. Obviously that's more than I wanted to spend, but I got a much better-looking suit than I would have sub-$200. I'm really thrilled.

The jacket is absolutely perfect, and the pants only need to be hemmed. That's being done today, and I'm picking them up at 11 tomorrow morning after I get a haircut and buy a new shirt.

I'm looking for a light spring/summer jacket that I can get for below $100,  although I would be okay with going a little over $100 for something I really like.

My style right now is pretty Americana/workwear, but that is getting harder to pull off as things start to warm up. I want a jacket that is light, so I won't be dying of a heat stroke, but is still resistant to some of the elements (rain). I don't think bright colors will work really well with my current wardrobe. 

So what are your recommendations? I already own a denim jacket, so I don't need another one. I would also consider a field jacket--I just think that one would look a little out of place in spring and that field jackets are better suited for fall. I might be wrong though.

I've also looked at a couple Harringtons, but I always find myself worried about the fit. The cheaper ones seem like they may run a little boxy. 

Summary/important details:

* Budget: &lt; $100
* Location: upper midwest, so it gets pretty warm (70-90 degrees)
* Height: 5'7''
* Weight: 140 lb
* Style: casual/Americana

They are (cheap) metal, so they provide a more rigid look than do the plastic ones that come with most low-mid-end dress shirts. They do sometimes come bent, however they're easy enough to straighten out unlike plastic.

If you have shirts with extra long or short collars, they might not work, but they seem to work find for a standard ""mall store"" dress shirt with your basic point collar. I tried them out with my shirts from Banana, Perry Ellis, a European brand called Springfield, and a handful of others and they fit great.

Thoughts: 

-Construction feels very solid, shoes are substantial and have a decent weight to them. Crepe sole is sturdy, unlike my suede CDB. Interior has reinforced construction which cups the heel nicely.

-I went TTS with a 9 (also a 9 in New Balance, Yuketen, Cole Haan, Bass) and they fit perfectly. Not too large to cause slipping and after a day of wear there are no rubbing points.

-Are a larger profile shoe, not as slim as CDB or high-end suede chukkas (Alden, etc.) and might be hard to dress up but should look great with denim.

-Only small issue is the weird triple stitch over the corner of the vamp (see pics)

Overall: Can't wait to wear these hard, construction feels very quality and the chocolate suede is of great color and feel. I think I would take these over CDB, was a no brainer at $30. 

Feel free to ask any questions.

I recently bought both the Stafford wingtip boots and Ashford(?) shoes for ~$95 out of pocket, and I'll get another 5% on top of that.

First, buy a discount gift card (electronic GC if you're shopping online). I got mine from cardpool for 28% off face value. Additionally, you can purchase them through topcashback to get another 2%. It came within 24 hours.

Next, check evreward.com. It'll tell you what sites offer what cashback options for shopping JCPenney through their portal.

**TRUE WORK BOOTS**

[Thorogood Round Toe w/ Vibram Sole – Tobacco - $100 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Thorogood-American-Heritage-Plain-Toe-Boot/dp/B002QQ8XB4/ref=pd_sbs_shoe_1 )

-A wonderful boot and one of the best deals I got. This is a true workboot and the color of the Tobacco leather is VERY versatile and looks good with white. Only shoe I chose with a marshmellow sole and vibram. 

[Vintage Shoe Company Hammond – Chocolate Brown - $140 – Last Call]
(http://www.lastcall.com/p/Vintage-Shoe-Company-Hammond-Lace-Up-Boot-Chocolate-Shoes/prod12710024/ )

-These were some of the last boots I bought. Very stylish and kind of a throwback to old school hiking boots. A rugged look, yet modern. Chocolate leather is slightly grained. This one has an interesting toe cap. Very padded. Leather was better then expected. Commando soles.

[Red Wing Iron Ranger – Hawthorne Rough Leather - $200 – Nordstrom] (http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/red-wing-iron-ranger-boot/3169385 )

-Gorgeous boots. They will change a lot over time, but RW has the most ridiculously thick leather out there. I mostly like these because they are unique. Look fantastic with jeans. Rubber soles.

**HYBRIDS**

[Red Wing Beckman – Black Cherry - $230 – Revolve](http://www.revolveclothing.com/DisplayProduct.jsp?product=REDW-MZ17&amp;c=&amp;d=h )

-A classic for a reason. Very versatile, and the black cherry is RICH. An excellent mix between work and dress. Commando soles look solid and classy.

[Wolverine 1000 Mile – Rust - $200 – Amazon](http://www.freshestgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wolverine-1000-mile-boot.png )

-Ordered seconds in brown. Got Rust. No defects. I AIN'T EVEN MAD. Chromexcel is ridiculously beautiful and these shoes flourish with them. I personally love the leather sole. It's a very simple and elegant work boot hybrid. 

[Land's End Canvas 8-Eye Boot – Brown - $50 – Land's End Canvas](http://www.freshbornmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lands-End-Canvas-Boots.jpg )

-I bought these because there is no way I can FIND Alden's affordably. You know what? They are great. Not exactly the best leather and I lost a lace hook already...but for less then $50 out the door? A great alternative. If anything, they turned me on to the Indy's design. I can see why it's legit. Ironically get the most compliments with these.

**DRESS BOOTS**

[Allen Edmonds Dalton – Walnut - $300 – Allen Edmonds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF0111_1_40000000001_-1 )

-Pure sex. Walnut is often imitated but never duplicated. AE has UNDERRATED boots. These are no exception and would put them against Church's and Tricker's any day. Most expensive boot so far. Nearly impossible to find a second and on sale.

[Allen Edmonds Long Branch – Grey - $270 – Allen Edmonds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF6021_1_40000000001_-1 )

-May be buying these in a few months. I want a grey boot and something wingtipped I can wear in the winter. These seem to fit the bill. Very unique without seeming pretentious. **Have not bought these yet**

[Allen Edmonds Ashbury Chelsea – Distressed Brown - $115 – Allen Edmonds](http://www.gordonshoes.com/productimgs/large/Allen-AE%20Ashbury%20Boot.jpg )

-I'm not a huge fan of Chelsea boots or pre-distressing, but I quite liked this one. $100 dollars on the seconds sale and I still can't find any flaws. Wearable in winter and very casual. Has almost a vintage quality to them. Break in was mean, but I have high arches. Now extremely cushy.

**CHUKKAS, HANDSEWNS AND DB'S**

[Sebago Fairhaven – Brown - $50 - Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Sebago-Fairhaven-Boot-Mens/dp/B0046G3SMG )

-In many ways like the LEC boot I bought. A hold over until I can afford Oakstreets or Quoddy's. These however, hold up fantastic on their own and were an even better value then the LEC boots for $50. A camp boot style...it's good to have one. I think these shoes look good on anyone.

[Allen Edmonds Malvern – Brown Calf - $150 – eBay](http://i.shoebuy.com/pi/allen/allen385104_96387_jb.jpg )

-Classic dress Chukkas. What's not to like? A versatile color, refined style, dainite soles (highly recommended for this shoe in particular). A bit more grownup then DB's and can be worn very casually or formally.

[Clark's Mali Boot – Black - $110 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Desert-Mali-Boot/dp/B004K6TOZW )

-One of my favorites. I avoid black but loved the matte thin leather on this shoe. They just work...Outstanding summer boot and frankly just very stylish. You must get these if they are on sale. I paid nearly full price and it was worth it. Can't say that about a lot of these boots.

[Clark's Desert Boot – Beeswax - $65 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Beeswax/dp/B000WU8SBG/ref=sr_1_1?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348937356&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=desert+boot+beeswax )

-Hivemind didn't lie. Probably one of my most versatile boots. Put rawhide laces on them.

[Clark's Desert Boot – Olive Leather - $65 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Desert-Olive-Leather/dp/B0040FOHOQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348937417&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=desert+boot+olive )

-I tend to avoid suede in boots and the CBD's were no exception. I felt like the leather had more character and it was nice to pick up something with that subtle green. Rawhide laces. Browns with these too.

[Clark's Desert Boot – Grey Leather - $65 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Desert-Olive-Leather/dp/B0040FOHOQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348937417&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=desert+boot+olive)

-More gray! Versatile in a grey way...like the beeswax. Great with Jeans. I like these shoes when I want a boot but want to keep it low key. Once again always put rawhide laces on if you can.

[Tretorn Strala – Brown/Black - $25 – Sierra Trading Post](http://www.amazon.com/Tretorn-Mens-Strala-Vinter-Boot/dp/B003CYL3CU )

-Solid rainboot at a cheap price. No need to spend assloads on these. 


Let me know if ya'll have any questions.

**edit: Stereotypical edit. I totally halfassed this and you guys deserve better. I will try to get pics and take a good look at all the leather. I want everyone here to find a good deal and everyone to get the shoes they WANT at an affordable price. That's what FMF is all about. I'll do some reviews ASAP.**

Anyways it is what the title says free apparel every Tuesday. I am almost certain it is **U.S. only**. Granted, Sears does not carry an abundant amount of decent clothing, but you might be able to find some gems there. Land's End is their if you look for it. Also, some Dockers and some Levi's, but Levi's are excluded in the free apparel Tuesday deal. I have found that Arrow clothing has somewhat nice fitted button up's. I mainly go for the button up's, polo's and pants, they don't have much else.

Steps to receive free apparel every Tuesday

Step 1: sign up for [Shop your way rewards](https://www.shopyourway.com/secured/rewards/join) you  might already be signed up if you signed up on Land's End website.

Step 2: Like them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Sears.Outlet.Stores) or you could just go to their Facebook page every Tuesday to get the coupon. 

Step 3: Print the coupon. [Today's Coupon](http://i.imgur.com/RbL6L.jpg)

Step 4: Enjoy!

To find if there is a Sears Outlet near you here is a [Link](http://www.sears.com/shc/s/StoreLocatorView?storeId=10153&amp;catalogId=12605&amp;lid=IExTrans_FindStore&amp;rioptype=SC&amp;sid=IEx20120515TransactionalSRSDigitalReceipt2011&amp;eml=) Make sure you click Sears Outlet Stores only as that coupon only applies to Sears Outlet stores.

Remember, to read the fine print on the coupon. Levi's can not be free. However, they are cheap, I just never find anything other than relaxed fit though. Treat Sears Outlet as a thrift store some of the items are damaged, but most are just out of season or something along those lines. I have been going every Tuesday for the past month and have never had a problem.

I hope this benefits someone out there.",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,1337127218.0,,,True,t3_tp3ll,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/tp3ll/free_apparel_every_tuesday_at_sears_outlet/,

First off, these looked terrible when I first received them and nothing like the pictures on the Asos site. They were really light colored and I was pretty bummed. I decided to see what they would look like with a couple layers of brown Kiwi polish and was actually pretty impressed with the way they came out after a few more wears and polish applications. Now they look better in person than they do on the website. Definitely worth the $57 in my opinion. The quality seems decent, nothing special, but I'm not crazy about how one of the shoes has creased on the toe. I think this has more to do with the way I walk though because all of my leather shoes seem to do that on the left foot. Seems like a pretty good deal overall though so I figured I'd pass it along.

In descending order of priority of what I would shell out the $$$ for, here is my take on the Frugal v BIFL exchange.

1. **Shoes.** You wear them everyday, and they can be a major expense. I like leather shoes, and I have found $40-$80 pairs will fail due to cracking, etc within 6 months to a year, causing a cost per year of about $40-$80. In comparison, a pair of $200+ shoes will last about 3 years maintainence free, and can last over a decade with a $60 resole. That comes out to about $66/year without resoles, $38/year with resoles if you get a good pair.


 **With shoes, it is a mistake to buy them when your feet are still growing.**

2. **Belt.** You probably wear it everyday. Same reason as shoes, except your belt can last even longer without maintainence. Even a cheap belt made from bonded leather can last a couple of years, while a full grain leather belt should last a lifetime. 


3. **Coats.** This may be climate dependent, but where I live I wear a coat daily for over about the year. If warmth is your goal, you can easily be frugal here, but researching quality matters. I have had winter coats only last a season, and I have a jacket that I have worn for three winters that shows no damage and shows almost no wear. I expect this $550 coat will last more than 10 years, whereas a less expensive $100 coat may last anywhere from one winter to ten. 

4. **Jeans and Pants.** I like Raw Denim, and historically wear a pair for 15-30 consecutive months before retiring them at $200-$300 a pair. The cost per year comes out to around $120/year. But you can be frugal here: A pair of Levi's will last a comparable amount of time for under $90.

5. **Shirts and Undershirts.** OCBD's are great, but regardless of quality, I find that they typically last about the same amount of time.

About a month ago, I found a pair of brown shoes at the thrift store. I thought they were cool, so I picked them up. This is what they [looked like](http://imgur.com/a/kyGGG#3) when I bought them for $6. The sole was very thin (It almost felt like my finger could push through the leather) and there were many scratches on the uppers. When I got home, I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/10rur1/how_to_revive_thrifted_leather_shoes/) to MFA to gather some advice as to what I can do to them to bring em back to life. It didnt seem like there was much hope for them but I learned alot about conditioning, polishing, and new soles/heels. I took them to the cobbler and had him put on heels and a sole protector, this ran me $65. He also painted the edging for free (IDK if this is typical). When I got home, I conditioned and polished them several times. A little elbow grease and some TLC can go a long way. I also bought some new laces. In the end, I have put about $80 into the shoes, including the original price. This is what they [look like](http://imgur.com/a/Vbsd1#0) now. 

I dont know if it was worth the money, but they look really good now. I've even got some compliments. I have done research into the shoe and cant find the original retail price, so for all I know, I put money into a black hole. BUT I figured Id let all of you know, at least if you find some high end shoe and think they look bad, its totally possible to bring them back to life. Thrifting can be totally worth it!

TL,DR: Shoes that look bad can be brought back to life, just takes some elbow grease and maybe a trip to the cobbler.",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,1353186412.0,,,True,t3_13d6za,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/13d6za/those_who_have_considered_thrifting_mens_dress/,

I'm looking at basically some of the stuff mentioned in the MFA Fall guide (and vests, which aren't listed there). Already have a peacoat.

EDIT: I forgot to mention my style. I like the preppy look, but a little more casual and not so obviously put together. So basically somewhere in between fratty and preppy. Thanks again!

EDIT2: I want nice looking jacket just to layer well to go with my button-downs and cardigans/sweaters.

**RULES:**

1. Post a description that accurately describes what you are selling.

2. Update your thread when something gets sold or is no longer available.

3. Post item condition and any images of the item (if available). Be as descriptive as possible when posting an item for sale or trade.

**NOTE: Please refrain from downvoting posts. The last few weeks has seen a big spike in postings, but an equally large spike in random downvotes on listings. Everyone deserves an equal shot, so let's try to be fair and only upvote good deals, not downvote the competition.**

Suggestions:

- 99% of us use Paypal to facilitate these transactions. Gifting is fine, but understand the limits and liabilities of sending an unprotected ""gift"" to a seller. You'll save a bit of $, but it does leave you exposed if there is a fraudulent seller. So far though, in almost a year of this reoccurring thread, I haven't heard of **any** fraudulent transactions. But just try to be smart about things.

- Please try to evaluate the ""fair market value"" of your items. No use in overpricing things and having them not sell. Check what the current selling price is on eBay to get a decent sense of FMV. Also know that retailers like JCrew, Banana Republic, Gap, etc. have biweekly sales, so their MSRP is not the ""true price"". Adjust accordingly.

- Feel free to ask for answers or pictures about an item you are interested in. A good seller will always be willing to answer you in a timely matter.

- On the other hand, be a good buyer. Respond to the seller's communication, and be truthful about your intentions. Nothing is worse for a seller than answering a bunch of questions about fit and details, and then the potential buyer dropping off the map.",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,False,,,True,t3_1j087o,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1j087o/weekly_buytradesell_thread_072513/,

1350396230.0,52,self.frugalmalefashion,11kj1a,[Review] Meermin in store. The best (risky) value in shoes. (x-post from MFA),73,21,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/11kj1a/review_meermin_in_store_the_best_risky_value_in/,"(In case anyone is not subbed to MFA, I thought those looking for the best sub $200 or sub $300 shoes available would appreciate this)

So I took a quick jaunt over the Atlantic to check out Meermin's Madrid store in person (can't leave anything to chance, you know?) and eat some Jamón. I was expecting something similar to the Uniqlo of shoes. Solid quality basics at affordable prices. I was wrong.


I will preface this that I am no shoe expert. I don't own dub monks yet. No one has ever made a mold of my feet. They don't even know me by name on Saville Row (by face...of course, but not by name). With that said, these shoes were amazing quality, and by my eye better leather than Allen Edmonds.


So let me start at the beginning. They offer a **basic line of shoes** (Classic Collection), for 160 Euro. You have to pay the shipping cost on top of that, but if you are purchasing from outside the EU, you don't pay the 20% tax that is included in the 160, so they end up being about $150 + shipping (so probably a bit less than $200).


The details on the classic line are that they use full-grain leather (calf from Annonay and Weinheimer Leder if you care) and are Goodyear welted (basically meaning they can be resoled multiple times). 


The classic line in store was quite impressive, and had some options not listed online (boots and a bunch of suede options). I took a ton of pictures which then got deleted, so my bad. 


The **suede** was what stunned me most. Apparently they use the same suede as Alden, and it really shows. I am hesitant to pay over $100 for suede, because it is so fragile, but they had a pair of blue suede double monks that were just crazy sauce.


Anyway, I was impressed with the leather as well. It seemed a bit softer than AEs, which I'm told is good. The only real ""con"" I could see was that the toe was less rounded and more ""bezeled""? You can see this on the website pictures, so it should come as no surprise. In fact, [here](http://meermin.tumblr.com/image/20983395357) are all their lasts.


The real gem of the lower priced models (after everything suede) are the **double monks**. Less than $200 for high quality double monks is just absurd as far as I can tell. Both the [brown](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5l044gzUc1qb0bszo2_1280.jpg) and the [black](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzahsxY0fr1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg) were gorgeous. Of the leather oxfords, the [12153 - S](http://www.meermin.es/ficha_articulo.php?id=2339) were fantastic.


**Sizing** is a tad strange, as it is British sizing, which is generally a half size down from US. I usually wear a 10.5, but I was a 9.5 in the ""Hiro"" last. This requires a bit of work, but apparently you can email them what size you wear in a last (like an AE last) and they will tell you how they correspond to their sizing. What I found was that the sizes were similar to CDBs, so size down .5 to 1.


After the classic, they have their **""Linea Maestro""**, which features a line with higher materials and hand welting. At 260 Euro, you can expect to get these shipped for under $300. I must have stared at [these](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5466hhWWd1r3fk48o2_1280.jpg) and [these](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwrxj7DOEW1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg) for 15 minutes each. Their light and dark brown are just everything you would want. This line also featured double monks with medalions, which I'm not sure I liked, but seemed unique at least (and not in the ""try too hard"" type way).


They have a [Norvegeese](http://www.meermin.es/catalogo2.php?id=8) line, which is **360 Euro**, and seemed to mostly feature more unusual models (like [pony hair](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m02katxpKc1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg) and [tan double monks](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsi7pffMRo1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg) and whatever [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8pb66unJn1r3fk48o1_r1_1280.jpg) is.


They do have a small selection of [Shell Cordovan](http://www.meermin.es/catalogo2.php?id=9) models, for the downright reasonable (in Shell Cordovan terms) of **320 Euro**. I liked the leather quite a bit, but wasn't crazy about any of the designs, which seems to be they way with me and cordovan leather.


They also offer **women's shoes**, just in case you want your lady in double monks. They had some bags in the store, but they don't seem to be online. Nothing as classic as saddleback, so don't sweat it too much.


Lastly, apparently they offer **MTO** (not to be confused with made to measure) shoes, starting at 50 Euro more. Here are some examples from their tumblr:

- [1](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1fx7t45z41r3fk48o1_1280.jpg)

- [2](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbcaxkQM1K1r3fk48o2_1280.jpg)

- [3](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mba9bpTusm1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg)

- [4](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mba8aehJ7N1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg)

- [5](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8gcr11nuU1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg)

- [6](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8eb27y5f51r3fk48o1_1280.jpg)

- [7](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8eb27y5f51r3fk48o3_1280.jpg)

- [What is the sweet lord...](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7mpu5YRnv1r5ng2yo2_1280.jpg)


So to sum up, with some legwork and a little risk (being on the hook for shipping if you screw up the size hurts) you can get some incredible value here. Also, I was told that the shipping for two pair is the same as for one, so you could get two amazing pairs of shoes for the price of one pair of AEs (just over $300). Or you could split an order with someone. Note that their customer service is a tad slow (and via email only), but apparently good.

[Edit] Thanks for pointing it out, /u/tehmark, but if the 40% codes are gone then the code GAPFRIENDS will save you 30% off of your order.

Friendly Gap employee here. I just got my stack of of F&amp;F coupons and since I have no one else to share the online codes with I'm giving them out to you guys! These codes will work from Thursday, March 14 to Sunday (11:59 PM) March 17. Unfortunately, these codes **only** work online as the in store discount relies on either having the physical coupon or convincing a staff member that you forgot it at home / that we should be kind and give you the 40%.

Because I'm so committed to my job, I'm going to give you just a few things that I recommend.

* [Lived-in Slim Khaki](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=42976&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=243639063). I love these pants so very much and wear mine all the time. There are a few colours that are already selling for more than 40% off but, honestly, they are atrocious colours (we haven't sold a single pair of our orange ones and that's not surprising). The regular khaki/camel colour is my favourite, but the grey is also very nice and versatile and the blues will basically go with whatever jeans go with. I probably don't need to point this out, but a lot of guys are wary of these because they think they will be like skinny jeans because of the word slim. They are not. I'm not a skinny guy at all, but they are more tapered in the leg and look great. Also they are ridiculously comfortable. Seriously consider these.

* [Ribbed Shawl Cardigan](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=87272&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=350832003). This one may be a matter of taste, but I think this is honestly one of best parts of the Spring line. I think it's beautiful, is a fantastic colour (navy goes with so much, obviously), and is so soft and so comfortable. Also it apparently looks like something Daniel Craig once wore (according to a friend) so that has to be something, right?

* [Slim fit Jeans](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=70024&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=350486003) and [Slim Fit Canvas Jeans](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=70024&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=349812103). If you can fit into the Slim Fit jeans comfortably then you will look great in them. These are definitely skinnier than the Lived in Slim khakis. Full disclosure, I'm a 36 waist and can't comfortably do a 36 in these. If you're a skinnier guy, though, then you should be fine. The canvas fit the same and can make for some pretty awesome casual looks with the right tops.

* [Straight Fit Jeans](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=33182&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=243690003). These are my favourite jeans and if you aren't skinny enough to feel comfortable in the slims and don't need the extra thigh room in the Loose then consider these. For Gap jeans, I find that besides the Slims that the straights make for the best fitting jeans in the leg. As an anecdote, this wash has been my go-to jean for many months now and they've held up incredibly well, even more so than some of my other Gap jeans. I also think the colour is a bit nicer in person than on the site.

* [Lived-in Wash Shirts](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=42838&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=350759003). These aren't all that exciting, since they are very similar in fit to the Modern Oxford (which is pretty comparable to every oxford shirt ever made), but that 'special enzyme' they are washed in does make them pretty soft. Honestly, Gap shirts, while nice, probably aren't as exciting as pants, both in finding a great fit or exceptional quality for price. I do own and wear a variety of the Oxfords and like them, but they can often have that effect where tucked in they look fine but kind of 'dadish' and untucked they feel too long. 

* [Army Jacket](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=48872&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=351279013). I bought this when it came in as a Spring jacket and I'm seriously loving it. I don't like the picture of it at all on the site, because I think it looks a lot better with the hood and the drawstrings done up and unnoticable, but it's a great spring jacket and with a hoodie under is surprisingly warm. I do think that at $100 it's too much for what it is, but is worth considering at $60.

* [Boxer Briefs](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=15077&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=351259023). I was a very stringent boxer guy until I tried some of these. Seriously, I'm replacing all my boxers with these because of how comfortable they are. That said, if you have a Gap in town and want to see if I'm right, go there. For one thing, there will probably be sale pairs kicking around for ~$4.97 (they are exactly the same in every way just last seasons designs and, seriously, who cares about that when it comes to underwear?).

I put a lot more effort into that than I thought I would. I hope someone finds any of that useful! Anyway, here's how I'll do the codes. I'm just going to post them all here and if you do end up using one just send me a message / leave a message here and I'll take it off. [**Edit**] 12 new codes! Also, the reason I'm doing it like this and not over PMs is because I want these codes to be used! I'm worried that if I did it through PMs people might feel pressured to grab them as fast as possible, even if they don't end up using them. Hopefully this is enough for everyone! I'll try to grab any extra ones I can after my Sunday shift for some last minute sales!

**Boring stuff about online returns:** In case you were wondering, online returns are stupid easy, especially if you have a Gap in town. You can return anything you buy online to a Gap store (even if it's something we never get in the store) within 30 days or, if you don't, all online purchases come with a prepaid postage sticker that you can just slap on a bag and drop in a mailbox.

Mostly I wear Dickies, they're not too comfortable but I can get a pair for $20 and they usually last 6+ months.  Also they dont show dirt as  much and dry quickly. But I still wear them out quicker than I'd like, usually in the ass or knees. (I get the regular not double knee kind because I am super skinny and the double-knee ones only come in wide cut that looks ridiculous with my body type.)

I havent found any cheap jeans that last at all, usually the crotch goes first, then the knees.

I've investigated carhartt's, they have a double-knee straight fit but they are $50, too much to buy let alone as an experiment. They look sturdy but also like they'd suck in the rain. I've been checking on ebay for a while but even the wide leg ones are rare and go for a decent amount of money.

I have a feeling I'm not going to be able to do much better than Dickies but does anyone have any suggestions for other/off brands that are cheap and long lasting?

I think it would be useful to know the types of sales different companies tend to have and when. That way, people can tell how current deals compare historically, if they can wait a little longer for a great sale, or if they want to know when in the year they start poking around their favorite stores.

For example, I always pick up a brooks brothers shirt or two when they have a big sale. It would be great for me to know if they tend to have a summer sale in july, labor day sale, etc. Or that the most J Crew goes is 30% off.
Or that the lowest Allen Edmonds goes is $200.

1340298273.0,44,self.frugalmalefashion,ve0tu,[Review] Lands' End Canvas Jackson Chukka Boot - now $28.50,54,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/ve0tu/review_lands_end_canvas_jackson_chukka_boot_now/,"The [Lands’ End Canvas Men’s Jackson Chukka boot](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-jackson-chukka-boot~203389_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::DRC&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-men-_-shoes-accessories&amp;origin=index) is clearly ‘inspired’ by the MFA staple, Clark’s Desert Boot, and other similar desert-boot style chukkas. The [cut and styling](http://imgur.com/aus1G) are almost identical.

**Construction:**

The LEC chukka is rendered in soft suede. The suede used is of reasonable quality, especially considering the price. It clearly has a few small blemishes, but poorer-quality suede is generally easier to pass than poorer-quality calfskin.

The soles are in [soft crepe rubber](http://imgur.com/luBae), which has a nice springy texture and good grip. The upper is joined to the sole by glue and a sewn seam around the perimeter of the boot. The cutting and joining of the suede and rubber is comparable to a CDB, which also has a few finishing blemishes.

With some trepidation when ordering I noted that the boot has a ‘cotton lining’; I was worried because for me, in other shoes, the heel will break down easily if it is cotton-lined. Fortunately, in this boot, the [cotton lining is restricted to the forefoot portion](http://imgur.com/F3pgr) of the boot, and not the heel. Yes, this means it will break down with time; but not as quickly or as noticeably if it had been fully lined as such.

Another drop in quality between this boot and a CDB is the insole. The insole is a clearly [glued-in construct](http://imgur.com/N35Q5) of paper with a veneer of cotton on top. This will likely break down with time.

**Styling:**

The LEC chukka is an almost carbon-copy of the iconic Clark’s Desert Boot, what more can be said? It would be great worn casually with jeans, biz-cas, and even a casual suit. A very versatile piece.

**Sizing:**

These boots definitely run large. I am normally a classic 13 and occasionally 12.5 with some manufacturers, and these boots (in 13) are just a touch large. If possible, consider sizing down ½.

**Pricing:**

These boots is/were normally $95. However they have been [discounted to $37.99]( http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-jackson-chukka-boot~203389_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::DRC&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-men-_-shoes-accessories&amp;origin=index), and with this week’s 25% off everything deal, that takes them down to $28.50! If you are looking for some cheap beater boots for the summer, you could do a lot worse. Note; the ‘sand’ colour I purchased is no longer available, you are restricted to ‘dark chocolate’ or ‘taupe’.

**TL/DR:**

**The Lands’ End Canvas Men’s Jackson Chukka boot is an excellent, if less durable, and inexpensive alternative to the CDB. Get ‘em while they’re hot! $28.50!**

Edit: Thank you all for the help, I never thought this would get so far up on the FMF page. I have found some really nice shoes so far, and I think I will be headed to J.

Bragging aside, I still have this deal till the end of the year. The work and the pay might have been shit, but I have easy access to 50% added to any deal I find at hilfiger and Calvin Klien because of it.
