Anyone please feel free to add/correct anything I might have overlooked.  Lets start at the beginning and jump right in.  

* 1995 - [Master P Returns to New Orleans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_P#1995.E2.80.932000:_Return_to_New_Orleans_and_mainstream_success)  This is historically significant as a starting off point because Master P was the first artist from the south (and as far as I know in hip hop) to independently go platinum.  The sound we know today hasn't started to quite evolve yet, but the work of Master P, UGK, and Geto Boys are starting to take the already developed west coast g-funk sound and turn it into something more unique and regionally based.

* 1997 - [Hot Boyz is founded and Cash Money Records receive $30 million deal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_Money_Records) Most likely influenced and motivated by the success of fellow NO artist Master P, Baby and Slim get Cash Money Records off the ground and into a major distribution deal.  This is one of the bigger and more notable advances in the genre at any point because two very important pioneers of the scene get their start right here; Mannie Fresh and Lil Wayne.  The success of [400 Degreez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_Degreez) establishes Mannie Fresh as a mainstream hit maker, driving his new sound comprised of 808s similar to what we know today.

* 2000 - [DJ Screw passes away](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dj_Screw) This opens the flood gates of the new sound, also taken from west coast g-funk hip-hop and southern influence, and takes it to a larger audience.  Many of the early [Swishahouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swisha_House) freestyles are slowed down versions of Cash Money Records songs, so the sound continues to gain notoriety with new crowds and develope/evolve.

* 2003 - Jay Z retires, prompting Lil Wayne to declare himself 'Best Rapper Alive'

* 2005 - [Young Jeezy and Mannie Fresh release And Then What](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XhOKIHGH7Q) This is the first time (that I recall at least) that the 808 descending pitch snare roll is used in a mainstream song.

* 2005-2007 The rise of Lil Wayne and Mixtape/Trap Culture.  This is the period of time Wayne took to releasing new material every week, which required the help of several different promotional DJs.  This is where we get the 'Damn son, where'd ya find this' sample as well as a lot of other small technical applications that are slowly making their way into edm trap. I wrote briefly about that [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/trap/comments/148dol/im_not_sure_if_this_a_stupid_question_but_where/)  During this time Jeezy, Gucci Mane, and other similar artists with backgrounds in drug dealing (Jeezy was allegedly a member of the Black Mafia Family, and Gucci Mane beat a murder charge scott-free) began gaining popularity and working the term 'trap' (a drug house) into rap vernacular.  This established a musical genre for a culture/population (poor, southern, drug dealers) which somehow crossed over a lot into mainstream hip-hop and eventually kinda took over the rap game.

* 2008 - Dubstep happens in America.  I could talk about this at length but I'd prefer to just say this particular style of music got popular and changed a lot of perspectives on dance music.  Also it established the 140bpm set which is a lot easier to mix with 70-80 southern rap than the previously popular dancefloor go to, 128bpm house.  Now dance DJs who are also fans of this popular rap movement can marry the two sounds without train wrecking or fader slamming, again, bringing the southern rap sound to a new audience.  For example, sometime in 2010(ish) I saw 12th Planet play an incredible set featuring tons of unreleased dubplates (Bass Canon being one of them) then end his set with the Ace Hood - Hustle Hard Remix (which also wasn't released at the time) and it went over phenomenally well with the crowd. 

* 2011 - [Post Dubstep/Future Garage arrives](http://www.liveforthefunk.com/spreads/post/unearthed-post-dubstep/)  This leads to what we now refer to as Future Garage, but the importance to trap is this strips down all the wobbles and heavy distortion that were running the dubstep scene, while preserving the 140 bpms and leaving a somewhat clearer canvas for producers to focus on percussion and sub-bass (two major defining factors of edm-trap).  Also in 2011, Hudson Mohawke releases the Satin Panthers EP, driving his normally 'Wonky' style beats towards a [more 'trap' oriented sound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_6j2A630_Q)

* 2012 - This is where it gets kinda fuzzy.  Harlem Shake and Original Don (Flosstradamus Remix) both erupt as wildly popular songs, TNGHT is formed and their debut release sets a lot of bars for standards.  Shortly after that, the foundation is laid for tons of producers to try their hand at the new sound, creating archives of songs available to share over the internet, making hour long all trap sets a possibility.  

I'm gonna leave this kinda open ended for now, as I have to get back to work, but I'm hoping you guys can contribute to some things I may have left out/ over looked and we can update this later.

1346839938.0,169,self.trap,zdxjr,"R/Trap, let's make a list of the best Trap tracks out there. I'll start.",204,35,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/trap/comments/zdxjr/rtrap_lets_make_a_list_of_the_best_trap_tracks/,"Hey R/Trap. As our subreddit approaches 2,000 subscribers, I believe it is time to form a comprehensive list of the best Trap tracks. This would be beneficial to the subreddit for two reasons. First and foremost, a compilation would most likely introduce new tracks to the most seasoned Trap veterans, and would most certainly be a great starting platform for any listener new to the genre. Everyone likes new, good music. Second, an agree-upon master list of 'Essential' tracks would improve the quality of this subreddit (which I love as is). If a list is formed via this post, it could be added to the sidebar (I have seen this in other music subreddits), serving as an effortless reference and as a list of familiar tracks not to post to the subreddit. More knowledge and less reposts.

*""Damn son, where'd you find this?""* On the r/Trap Essential List, of course.

I would love to see a list effect the subreddit, but honestly I am mostly curious because I would like to expand my Trap repertoire. Below is a list of my favorite Trap tracks (obviously with some omissions and in no particular order).

There's a lot more of y'all now than there were even a few months ago, so I think it's timely to go over some rules and shit.

* Starting with the first one: **All submissions should be [Artist Name] - [Track Title] (Remixer [if applicable]). (Doesn't apply to self posts, lineup announcements, interviews, etc).** There's a reason for this: titling a submission as ""OMG THIS IS THE SICKEST TRAP BEAT IVE EVER HEARD"" makes it *impossible* to search for, increasing the chances of reposts substantially.  Beyond that, it makes things messy as fuck to read through.

* Similarly, feedback posts need to be addressed, as there are more and more of them every week.  You are not only allowed to post your own music here -- you're encouraged to do so; **however;** the title format should remain [Artist Name] - [Track Title] (Remixer [if applicable]).  If you want to let everyone know anything else about the track, do it in the comments.  Also, /r/edmproduction has weekly feedback threads which you may find useful.

* Memes are banned.  Take that shit to Facebook.

**ALBUMS**


-**Frozen EP**:


*Released February 28th, 2011*
His very first release. A mixture of future-bass leaning music and crackling sample work, it can be a bit hard to listen to for the average music fan, but there is definitely much to appreciate with the synth progressions. Not gonna lie, it reminds me occasionally of aquarium music. Then there are wobbles galore sneaking their way through the EP, as well as a drumstep record. Not entirely trap, but noteworthy for a general fan of the recent bass-music revival since 2009-2010. Favorite songs here are **Smacked** and **Oil!**.


-**Melodies, Vol.1** :


Released on December 5th, 2011.
His second release far, still back in the mists of late 2011. Who can even fucking remember two years ago? Seriously though, this release is good. Not amazing, definitely room for improvement, but still that same soul and confidence. Here his synth work is miles ahead of the bass work, but still doesn't feel uneven. The unusual percussion also comes into play, rounding out the songs. Probably listen to this one the least, but still has some great songs, with my favorite being **Headache**, a song that reminds me in no small way of Justice's song Stress, off their first album. A song that induces its own title, none too shabby.

-**Vibes, Vol.2** :


*Released on July 30th, 2012.*
His third release, about half a year after Melodies. Far more confidant and ambitious, he moves into areas of stronger drum samples and vocal twisting. Favorite two tracks are the spiraling trap stomper **Cross the Dancefloor**, a refix of a disco song by Treasure Fingers from 2008, and the amazing opener, **The Next Morning**, which spirals up out of nowhere and explodes around your brain. The synths sound like a trap-influenced Sonic The Hedgehog soundtrack outtake. His work with the bass frequencies has also far improved from his first album, as seen in the more well-known of his tracks on this album, **Roller**. There is also some amazing sampling done in **Free** and **Charms**. All in all, a very impressive second release, with all play-worthy tracks. 

-**Blu EP** :


*Released on November 21st, 2012.*
To be honest, I find very little of this EP memorable. Still good musicianship, still the same attention to detail and sound quality, but the construction of the songs is bland, and not even because the energy levels of the album are lower. He has plenty of downtempo tracks on other records that sound much better than here. Just doesn't do it for me. But never fear, because coming up, we have something amazing!

-**Bang, Vol. 3** :


*Released on January 5th, 2013.*
Sit down, take a deep breath, and turn those speakers the fuck up already. This release is not fucking around. There is not a single half-hearted track on this entire album, no cop-outs, no prisoners taken. Step by step, it annihilates the competition. **Bang** starts out distractedly quiet, and as you turn up the volume to hear it, the spiraling sample of Danny Brown's song ""Grown Up"" and the wobbling floor-shaking bass grab you by the fucking collar and pull you right up to the speakers. Next, **Fire (No Payroll)**, a song that gained a lot of exposure for being in RL Grime's Essential Mix, makes it progressive trap slide down the red carpet. **Drop (Get Silenced)** straight does not give a fuck, and blows through high pitched squeaks and low-end tomfoolery. And just when you are begging for some oxygen and a bottle of water, because the club has dehydrated your entire body and soul, the next 5 songs wrap your body in a warm cocoon of synths and skittering snares. **Lucra** and **Rogue** are my two favorites from this segment, and remind me most of driving through a thunderstorm alone down a deserted highway. **Grind (Lex)** is also an amazing song, with a sample of Lex Luger, original trapster, talking about his work ethic. But then those songs have ebbed away most of your energy, and you want a little rudeness. That is when **Pay (For What)** kicks in the door. I'm sure I don't have to introduce this song to anyone here, with its sirens, Waka Flocka samples, earthquake bass, and *gasp* well-done laser synths. Then, just when you though it couldn't get any better, my favorite song arrives, with a swirling vocal sample that gives away to simple handclaps and building hooks. **Muney (Gimme Dat)** has, truth be told, literally the best drop of any trap song I've ever heard. The attention to bass quality, starting on the higher bass, two-steps with a mid-range bass, and then dropping it to the floor level, is just staggering to me. **Rembrandt** **Dilemma**, and **Red Sky** close out the album with some more nighttime rainy music, and at last the experience is done. My favorite work of his, bar none.

-**Life/Death EP** :


*Released on January 27th, 2013.*
If you're paying attention to these album releases, you'll notice that this EP comes exactly 22 days after his last (read: best, most ambitious, soul-exploding) album. That is an insane turnaround, and even with a simple 3 song set, it still manages to be an amazing creative effort. Favorite track is the first, **Death**, a fucking clinic in downward spiraling synths and drums, but still manages to show emotion and power. The rest of the EP flows well, and the dual structure of the title is reflected in the feeling of the music. You'll enjoy this one if you like listening to an entire project straight through.

-**Reality EP** :


*Released on March 5th, 2013*
His most collaborative release so far, Carmack calls in fellow Team Supreme squadmates Great Dane and Penthouse Penthouse for two of the tracks on here. Sound quality is great, especially on the Miko Da Gawd redux he does, called **Beez**. My favorite track is probably **Cocaine, with Great Dane**, for the choppy vocal sample and the basswork. A great release, although not on the same level as Bang.

-**Mad Decent Release (Birth Control &amp; Hopscotch)**:


*Released on April 11th, 2013*
He really out here now, with releases on Jeffrees, a label print of Diplo's Mad Decent record label. I really like MD's description of it, so I'll just paste it in rather than try to be clever myself.
""Jeffrees presents two brand new tracks from Mr. Carmack, ""Birth Control"" and ""Hopscotch"". ""Birth Control"" leads the way with twerk'd out hand claps over a jerky squeaky ass beat that shifts gear into a wavy yet compressed early 2000's Neptunesque synth line. ""Hopscotch"" follows that up with Mr. Carmack's own pitched up Sugarhill-like vocals over the most sloppy head knocker we've ever released.

AND those are the albums! Of course, Carmack, being an overflowing  fountain of ideas, not all of them can fit in albums. Here are my favorite side-released or unreleased or lost-to-the-void-of-the-internet songs of his.

**SINGLES**


-**Goooo Kind Of**: An irritatingly-hard-to-find music file that is an amazingly skillful reimagining of TNGHT's song Goooo, which replicates the melody, but adds in so much as to make it an entirely different feeling song. Only copy I can find is in the BBC Essential Mix.

-**Ego** (also known as 49ers): A swaggering bass monstrosity, with awesome vocal sampling and a panic inducing progression.

-**Gibberish**: An amazing rainy-mood song, with vocal work bordering on the incredible. Follows through on the title, but still sounds like a cohesive musical output.

-**Say Yes or Say No**: Aaliyah flip, as he calls it, samples from her song ""Are You That Somebody"", and treads that fine line between rainy mood and throwback R&amp;B styling. Amazing song.

-**ODB Shimmy Shimmy Ya Remix**: Y'all saw this a few weeks ago, no reference needed. Swaggering and slinky, not to be messed with remix work.

-**Brazilian Blowjob**: His most viewed video, picked up by the awesome YouTube channel called Majestic Casual, a smooth builder beat, which seems to evoke the feel of the beach and boardwalk. 

-**Felt Nothing Today**: A swirling glitchy, yet surprisingly emotional song, with beautiful basslines and a tearjerker of a synth pattern. Definitely bangs, but also brings out all of the feels.

There it is, hope you guys enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed researching and writing it! Hopefully this is something our community can continue to run with, bringing out the more artistic side of this amazing genre. Please, if you can afford it, [buy his music](http://mrcarmack.bandcamp.com), because he definitely deserves it, and it is very reasonably priced! 

Sincerely (without sincerity),

kidding, seriously tho our community is growing every day and this is great!  But with more traffic and users comes more moderation.  As some of you may have noticed (and you haven't listen up cuz this is important) cc132 has left us :(.  This is the guy who took this sub-reddit over when it was still supposedly an abandoned transgender porn board, and helped shaped it into the credible and thriving place it is today.  There's a lot of cool shit going on here and everyone who seems to be heavily involved and invested in it all want it to continue in that direction.  There's a (very valid) fear that as our sub grows, it faces the same issues that crippled the /r/dubstep boards and made something like /r/realdubstep a thing.  I don't want that to be a thing here, because this IS real /r/trap shit, and it will continue to be so as long as its well moderated.

What does that mean?  Well firstly, cc invited me to mod before leaving, so for the time being I'll be helping to keep the rules he's already put in place for us and regulate them as we continue to grow.  Off top the very first thing is

All submissions should be [Artist Name] - [Track Title] (Remixer [if applicable]). (Doesn't apply to self posts, lineup announcements, interviews, etc)

this in non-negotiable.  From now any post not adhering to this guideline will be removed.  As a sign of good faith, I even deleted my own cheeky post from a day ago Rick Rolling everybody and like a 1/3 of my overall link karma with it, so I don't wanna hear complaints from you goobers.  If you message a mod asking why your post was removed you will be sent a link to this thread.  We don't have time to keep telling everyone this over and over. Same goes for number 2 

Don't repost. Search for something before submitting it.

That's pretty straight forward.  Instant removal for reposts.  Please help us with this by flagging without prejudice anyone repost or mis-labeled post.  ANY. Doesn't matter if it's good, or getting upvotes, or people like it... nah.  If you don't play by the rules the post is removed.  Repeat offenders may be subjected to banning.  Pretty simple stuff here, its been in place since we started and its kept everything in good order.  I'll add for the new people (although we usually don't have a big problem with this, good job on that guys)

Link to the artists' actual Soundcloud/Bandcamp/etc page whenever possible.

remember to delete the 's' from https in the url or your song won't stream from the front page.  If you are linking to one of your own songs, on your own soundcloud page that's good, but please still follow the [Artist Name] - [Track Title] format.  If you wanna add something short like 'feedback appreciated' or 'free download' that's fine, but if you cross over into 'hey I just made my first track and i think its pretty good and i played it for my friend and he said i should put it on here' your post will be removed.  We don't need your backstory in the title, if you wanna add anything put it in the description or comments.  Next,

No memes.

This is a newer one, and for the most part seem to be doing ok with it, but as our community grows, so does our understanding of what this means.  The Harlem Shake videos:  First one, not technically a meme (yet), it was a video and I'm pretty sure I speak for all of us when I say, its 2013 and video on the internet is an excellent way to share ideas so we're not gonna ban videos.  This is a music board, and yeah we like to have fun, and no one wants a front page of straight soundcloud links to Baauer and Floss and Diplo etc, so from time to time dicussions, videos, feedback threads, whatever are all encouraged.   But the second, third, fourth, Peanuts remix, and every other run-off of these videos is a meme, so they're out.  That's how we're gonna do things for the time being.  If your video/post/whatever is dumb and circlejerky and meme-y we'll remove it at our discretion.  If you need any follow up on this point see [here](http://i.imgur.com/Ertm6XJ.gif)

Finally

Don't be a dick

It's neat-o that it has grown as much as it has, but it's also quickly becoming my least favorite kind of music sub: a platform for self-promotion. 

I'd never suggest banning self-promotion, because I love that shit, but we've got to figure out a way to balance things back out.  A few ideas:

* /r/DNB has a rule that all submissions have to be [Artist Name - Track Title] and nothing else.  I'm into this.  
* Potentially banning mixes.  Not that I want to shit on beginner DJs or anything, but at times it seems like half the front-page is mixes of the same Flosstradamus/Baauer/Clicks and Whistles tracks.
* Redirecting all threads requesting feedback to /r/edmproduction.

Of course, all this is open to discussion.  Have at it.

I mean it WAS a ""Trap Night"" so why are the neon clad, panda girls looking so confused when Gucci Mane drops? Start leanin' and cooking' dawgs!

2- There still exists DJ SkinnyWhiteDubstepGuy who thinks that tossing in a Lil John sample into his triplet 808's makes him tough. When you have to pay girls in hot pants to dance to your music, you can't shoot finger pistols in the air every time a snare trills.

3- ""Bweep bloop bloopbloobpblob BWABWBABWBA ticktickticktickticktickticktick HMMM HMMM HMMMMM HERE'S YOUR ONE-LINER BWAAAAAAAAAAAP"" cannot be named the same genre as OJ Da Jucieman and Rick Ross. It's like saying Slipknot and The Beatles are the same because they both have guitars.

4- TNGHT, MOD, Djemba Djemba, are some of the tightest producers in the game-- but they definitely shouldn't be considered trap anymore. I hate to get all sub-genre specific, but sometimes a line has to be drawn.

2) Every single trap show I have ever seen, including this one, the DJ has played Karate Chop by Future. Not complaining, though.

3) HE DIDN'T PLAY FRAZZLE OR SAWDUST. HEART BROKEN.

4) He did, however, play out the new Rachet remix he did, as well as his alter ego songs he made as [Smiddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0yWelXwSfk). They went OFF live, I really appreciate the happy trap.

5) Slasherr was the biggest hit of the night with the crowd. Close second was when he played Backseat Freestyle, another trap DJ staple. Again, not complaining.

6) Played out R U READY, and a mosh pit actually opened up for a minute or two. Never been involved in a serious one before (5'9"" is not a great height for moshing) but it was great.

7) Had no idea who the opener was, but they played out a song that has now become my absolute jam. Holy actual shit, [Djemba Djemba](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2SaFh3His).

8) Rustie is the only show I've ever seen that combined dubstep and trap successfully in the same set. Songs like Cry Flames and Globes were slid in and the crowd switched seamlessly from trap elbows to the deepest of wobbles. Great, great set, would absolutely recommend seeing him if you ever get the chance.

Trap is a genre that is often overlooked by most sites and blogs, so we would like to plug that gap. We did a post on /r/deephouse that was super successful, so I figured we could try the same thing here.  

To give you the basic stats, 

&gt;Maximum users: 5,000
Enabled users: 1,439 Details
Users active today: 305 (21.20%)
Users active this week: 738 (51.29%)
Users active this month: 1,283 (89.16%)
Torrents: 9,754
Releases: 10,644
Artists: 18,889
""Perfect"" FLACs: 2,709
Requests: 43 (58.14% filled)
Snatches: 89,452
Peers: 50,541
Seeders: 50,086
Leechers: 455
Seeder/Leecher ratio: 110.07

We're looking for new users to help the site, grow, it's invite only, all new users get 5 invites and 5GB of upload credit, as well as 50 Freeleech tokens to be used on the site, to download stuff without it counting toward your ratio.

Also all new releases are freeleech for 48 hours. This is a great way to expand your music collection. 

To anyone who is on the anti piracy bandwagon, every release on the tracker comes replete with links to buy every song on beatport, which whilst it is not perfect, is far better than what anyone else is doing on the market. 

Please message me with your email if you find this of interest.

Some of you might’ve seen me post around here I visit r/trap a lot! I’ve been working hard lately on a Yellow Claw remix for a competition and wanted to share with you guys.  I’m often a bit hesitant to post my music but I’m happy with how this remix turned out and I really want to win this competition. There’s two prizes, of which one is ‘most plays’ on soundcloud so all plays help.

Hope y’all like it!

* Link to the artists' actual Soundcloud/Bandcamp/etc page whenever possible.
* All submissions should be [Artist Name] - [Track Title] (Remixer [if applicable]).  If you want to tell us anything else about the track, feel free to do so in the comments.  Good submissions won't be removed for not following this, but it will make searching a lot easier if everyone follows the same format (obviously this doesn't apply to self posts, lineup announcements, interviews, etc).

I have teamed up with /u/JXEYES to collect as much trap music as possible. For the past two weeks we have been filtering 15-20 GB of trap from the last 2 months and have picked out 400 of the best tracks for the compilation. We hope to continue doing this and now that its summer the wait between compilations wont be as long. If you want the raw data we may be able to work something out but its gonna be a while to upload 20 GB of music. Anyway, hope you guys enjoy it.

1370497671.0,28,self.trap,1frwit,Why trap is not the new dubstep (Interested to hear your thoughts),42,14,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/trap/comments/1frwit/why_trap_is_not_the_new_dubstep_interested_to/,"*edit: I am completely aware of experimental dubstep artists such as james blake and burial, this post was specifically talking about more pop/dance orientated sides of trap/dubstep. The music in any genre made in the pop scene and the underground scene will sound completely different and are marketed to two completely separate audiences.*

I hear the argument repeated a lot that trap is the ""new dubstep"" and like dubstep it will phase out like a trend(even though dubstep is not really dead but that is another argument), however I think there are some significant distinctions to be made not only in terms of how each came to be introduced in the dance music scene, but also in terms of the actual way the music is produced that make it so this is not the case.

1)Availability of variety in mainstream trap music production 

One of the things that lead to the ""fall"" of dubstep is that the lack of distinction in production and instrumentation. Literally every wobble and bass drop in mainstream dubstep sounds the same. Rarely is there a distinct melody to be heard, and the production is based upon the aggressiveness and harshness of the sounds and bass-lines being produced.

Although there were a variety of sounds in the dubstep scene which had its origins with artists like Coki,Skream,Rusko,&amp; Mala whose sounds ranged from ambient to more agressive. Because it was such a new genre starting in mid 2000's when Skrillex cameout with his music and popularized the genre he completely changed the musical landscape of dubstep to the point where everyone had to mimic the ""bro-step"" sound to become popular.

""Trap"" beats are just really just hip hop beats formatted for a club scene which include bigger house inspired build ups and quicker transitions. Because there is so much variety which can be done to hip hop club beats there is much more room for creativity in the sound since hip hop club beats have been here since hip hop's conception in the 80's .

The tracks ""Yaow""-Baauer vs ""Goooo""-TNGHT vs ""Uppers""-Stooki Sound, all fall within the trap genres but have very distinct instrumentation and melodies all from popular artists in the trap genre.

Granted there is another side of trap music , which are from producers who come from an EDM backrgound and then have started making ""trap music"" which (I as a hip hop producer making ""hip hop edm music"") sounds 95% the same most of the time, this doesn't represent a lot of other trap music (which I think would just be better off being called hip hop edm) like from the previous artists I just mentioned.

2)Origin of the genres

This is somewhat a continuation of the previously mentioned point, but because ""trap"" originates from hip hop party music, and there will always be a market for hip-hop party based trap music, although again edm based trap music( as in edm producers who jumped on the trap trend) might be different sense it is marketed towards the edm crowd which is seemingly more committed towards electronic music trends as opposed to specific genres.

TL;DR: Two types of trap music ""edm based trap music"" which is mainly edm producers making trap music (which is more trendy and formulaic) vs hip hop edm based ""trap music"" (trap music based on hip hop party beats mainly coming from hip hop producers entering the edm scene which there has always been and will be a market for and has more variety and is less formulaic). The later will never fade, while the former is more based upon what is trendy to the edm crowd.

BTW,here is one of my tracks, I come from the later category of ""trap producers""-

I felt like sharing this story with my fellow trap lovers. At Hard Summer, I waited beside many of the stages, begging many security guards to help me go get the autographs from particular artists backstage. Begging didn't suffice, and they denied any of my requests. Luckily, there were Artist Signing Sections, and I came out with this:

http://imgur.com/Ep7nXGO

Although it fell very short of my goal, I'm happy with what I received (I even managed to get a picture with Grime and Floss). I lost the shirt several times (dropping it, leaving it beside crowds, etc.), I also happened to find it *every* time. As you can tell from the picture, the shirt has been through some shit. I'm pretty sure the trap gods destined for me to have it. I still wish I would have gotten gLAdiatior's and Ryan Hemsworth's, but I guess I just have to wait 'til next time. Thanks for your time, here are some of my favorite trap songs for reading my story:

I first heard music by TNGHT, Flosstradamus, and some other not-so-big names who did remixes of popular songs like ""Gangnam Style"". I heard ""Flosstradamus"" say their name in a track, and I promptly texted myself what I thought the name was (I got it right). Since then, I've been listening to a lot of Floss, TNGHT, gLAdiator, and Major Lazer. I was already listening to Dillon Francis. Didn't know he made trap...

I have compiled all the best songs from TRAP COMP 1-5 and made one nice playlist that you can share with friends or just enjoy yourself (although it will all be duplicates if you have already downloaded 1-5). There are 250 songs in total so there is a wide variety from hard-hitting bangers, chill vibes, bootlegs, a few mashups, and a few Trap Muzik style songs. All of the music is available for free online so I wouldn't classify this as THE BEST of all trap music but it is all very good to listen to. Most of the very best songs you have to pay for so I cannot offer them to you. This does however include a few amateur producers that may not be seen on very many blog sites so that is the trade off you get.

------------------------- 

Unfortunately I dont have my own server to host the Compilations on so Ive been using 4shared because I can get 15 GB for free. However, this limits me to files under 2 GB. The TOP TRAP COMP is over 2 GB so I had to split it into two parts. The songs are all under the same album name though so it should be pretty easy to organize:

[PART 1](http://www.4shared.com/zip/BcmxvXXJ/TOP_TRAP_COMP_VOL_1_-_PART_1.html?)

[TRACKLIST 1](http://imgur.com/a/9JZ7m#0)

[PART 2](http://www.4shared.com/zip/Fif6YIk7/TOP_TRAP_COMP_VOL_1_-_PART_2.html?)

[TRACKLIST 2](http://imgur.com/a/WEAxW#0)

EDIT:

--------------------------

Anyway that is all for now. If you have any questions Ill try to answer them in the comments. If you want to send me your soundcloud page/song feel free to PM me and Ill check it out. Im kinda behind on my music but I should have TRAP COMP 6 ready in not too long. Ive loved watching this subreddit explode over the past few months and its great to see how involved everyone gets so keep up the good work. Although I would suggest searching for songs before posting as the number of reposts has also skyrocketed. Anyway enjoy the compilation and make sure to support the artists you enjoy.",,False,self,t5_2qx81,1359674093.0,,weed,True,t3_17n1qc,http://www.reddit.com/r/trap/comments/17n1qc/øᵽ_яᵽ_ͼømᵽ_vøɫ_1/,
