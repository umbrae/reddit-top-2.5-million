Please make sure this stays on the front page this time.,161,29,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/v3d5o/message_from_the_mods_please_make_sure_this_stays/,"I have already made two posts on the subject and they have both been downvoted in their prime to prevent the information from being on the front page.**Please don't downvote mod messages because they are important for the community to see and for the community to participate in**. In fact, it's better to *upvote* messages from the mods so everyone that comes to this subreddit can see.

It has come to my attention **some people would like the downvote button to return.** I haven't gotten that many complaints about the current system but I feel it is necessary to have a vote on whether or not you think it's a good idea to regulate this community with downvotes. Many of you have already figured out how to downvote posts regardless, as exemplified in the post above. I will leave it up to all of you to decide. Vote in the comments bellow if you want them to be brought back or to keep things as they are. If I am somehow downvoted into oblivion again, the community will go without changes and you have an anonymous subscriber to thank for it. *Please please please make sure this issue is voted on so we can work together.*

As for **possible spam**, I'm looking into having a description of why we use the tags on the sidebar. If you have not seen these two before, here are links to explain why we use the tags:

http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/sxfvc/just_as_a_reminder_possible_spam_links_explanation/
http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/svmh5/from_the_mods_first_inaugural_rbeauty_logo/

 If you have any other concerns or suggestions or ideas, feel free to PM the mods. Thanks guys! 

**EDIT 1:** Thank you guys so much for your feedback! To make people better understand the benefits of for/against downvotes, please describe it in your posts.

**EDIT 2:** There are two great posts I want you to consider when voting that give good reasoning for both sides of the argument.

For Downvote:

[–]kezzie87 5 points 4 hours ago (5|0)
I help moderate another sub, where we removed the downvotes button, then people wanted it back, so we brought it back, then people complained so it was removed again.
I found the worst trolling occurred without the downvote button, as this meant trolls were more inclined to send hurtful an hateful messages instead of simply downvoting. It also made more work for the mods as the sub users were no longer self moderating junk and spam posts with downvotes.
I'm FOR the downvote button, bring it back!

Against Downvote:

[–]MichelleyMarie [+1] 2 points 9 minutes ago (2|0)
I think people tend to use it freely to downvote anything they disagree with or don't find pleasant instead of responding and adding to the discussion. For commenters like me, it can be very disheartening to see those little downvotes, especially when they're uncalled for.
So those are my reasons...it is an abused tool and it can discourage open discussion.

**EDIT 3:** It seems like downvotes are in the lead by one extra person as of right now but I'm leaving this up one more day for additional votes before changing it. I'll keep downvotes on here for a week and if everyone is still happy with them we'll keep the change.

I do not get extra karma for self posts. This is purely for the good of the community. Warning: This may be lengthy. TLDR at the bottom.** 

I'm not sure if you all have noticed, but the moderator wakatopatopa has been absent from this community for some time. I have been trying to get in contact with her or anyone that might know what happened to her but I have come up unsuccessful. She hasn't been on reddit for 4 months which worries me. She was very active with this community and others until she abruptly stopped coming on reddit all together. I know this is a long stretch, but **if anyone has any idea about what happened to wakatopatopa, please message me!**

While she's been gone, I have been trying to respect her rules, however, sine the community has grown a lot during her absence, I feel it necessary to change some things. Wakatopatopa has been the main moderator for this subreddit up until her mysterious absence. Up until then we have made decisions together, and I have not wanted to stray too far from what we agreed upon. I have already restored the downvote button despite her wishes, but have kept the ""possible spam tag."" I have also kept the sidebar rules and description the same for the most part.

Seeing as how there is no sign of her return, I will be making changes without her according to the growth of /r/beauty. **First change will be the removal of the ""possible spam"" tag.** I find it far too unnecessary when we have the downvote system working effectively. With a bigger community, it has become much easier to regulate the posts that slip past the spam filter. 

Since the tag will no longer be used, I urge all of you to use your best judgement and simply **report a link** if you feel it is spam, violates any rules, is rude/offensive, or has nothing to do with this subreddit. 

This subreddit in particular is a magnet for a lot of spam for beauty products and procedures, therefore we still will be relying heavily on the spam filter. It does a very good job weeding out the spam, including the posts that were considered for the ""possible spam"" tag. Therefore, **any posts that are ""possible spam"" will be *considered* spam unless and until the poster contacts the mods.**

I cannot put enough emphasis on this. *Contact the mods.* Be sure to check the new queue and **message the mods if you do not see your post  at least 20 minutes after submission**. When I receive a message, your post will *most likely* be approved. This is especially important for those that submit links.

**For those that want to promote blogs, products, etc,** I *again* strongly advise that you contact the mods. I appreciate when I am contacted rather than have this subreddit plastered with self advertisements and spam. Chances are, most of your posts are stuck in the spam filter or downvoted to oblivion anyway. Some get past and do actually get positive feedback. Rather than take those chances, contact the mods and I will try my best to work with you and see if your content is worthy. If I find your blog or product truly beneficial, we can work together and possibly set up contests for subscribers of this subreddit. This subreddit should not be filled solely with advertisements and blog promotions, but if yours seems beneficial, we can work together. **Warning: if I see that subscribers do not agree with this section of the post, this option will no longer be available to bloggers/product promoters.**

Lastly, I think it's time to make this subreddit more visually appealing. **Comment below and give ideas on how we can make this subreddit stand out.** I will work on a logo when I get a chance, but I would love to see any ideas on color scheme and what you want the reddit alien to look like.

I'm so sorry this was such a long post. I know some of the things I mentioned are obvious, but with the current changes, they had to be stated. I hope we can work together and make this subreddit the best it can be. Thanks for reading!



**TLDR; The possible spam tag will be removed. The sidebar will have an updated description. Report spam links and rude comments as much as possible. Contact mods for any and all problems: post not showing up in new queue, promotions, concerns, suggestions, etc. Comment below for any ideas for the subreddit and how to improve the look of /r/beauty.**

Update: 

Forgive the horrible pictures, but they were the two that showed the biggest change. Note the freckles and redness in the first pic.

Sorry, removed because of troubling PMs.

Here are the products that are outshining everything I've tried from the U.S. and what they have done for me:


http://i45.tinypic.com/1zq5z75.jpg

Tony Moly Tomatox Brightening Mask, 70g $9.45 Amazon


I'll admit, I didn't think this was doing its thing at first, but then I had some photos taken on New Years. I can't think of any other adjectives besides the one provided in the product's title. My face was *bright.* I didn't initially see it because I look at my face every day, but I glow. 



http://i46.tinypic.com/1h3383.jpg

skin79 BB Vital Cream Triple Functions, 40g, $12.50, Amazon

This ""foundation,"" if you will, has replaced and eliminated the need for concealer (with the exception for my dark circles, but those are going, too.) I only need 1/4 of a full pump to cover my entire face. And when I'm tired, I do a little extra under my eyes and the bags are hidden. I chose this brand because of the coverage and the lightness. I'm pale and flawed, but I feel as though in the future I could tone back on the coverage because I only see improvement. Oh, and I don't powder either. This BB cream is good for all my face base. The best thing about all of these products I've been trying, nothing in there is really bad for your skin. They pack it full of natural goodies. Compare that to some 24-hour tube from where I'm from? Gunk in my pores before.




http://izakkaya.com/images/appletox0.jpg

Tony Moly Appletox Smoothing Massage Peeling Cream, 80g, $12.99, Amazon

I just tried this. I put it on my clean face and massaged it in for a good five minutes, and by then I couldn't take it (in an entirely good way.) All the product bunched up on my dead skin and dirt, as its intended to do, and pieces of peel and skin were falling off my face. Now, I have very sensitive skin, but I didn't feel pain or burning. I can't stop feeling my face. I feel like I forgot what truly naked skin felt like.

If you're looking for some additions to your routine, I truly recommend these.

Another one: Neem paste. You can buy neem powder at any Indian grocery store. Mix a table spoon or so with some water and maybe a bit of honey and/or yogurt, slather onto your face and it works wonders for ance.

[That's really awesome!](http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/jezebel/2010/10/lucilleexcited.gif) But with a growing community, it's time for a little housekeeping.

We get *a lot* a lot a lot a lot of spam. I've brought on jen_wexxx to help me manage the queue and [she's doing a fantastic job.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lribm3aoPY1qk8rvb.gif) I actually have time to reddit for fun again!

Also, as the community gets larger, we'll start seeing more unpleasant people. And here's the deal: I am not willing to tolerate anyone being mean, hateful, hurtful, or bigoted. It's that simple. If I see comments like that, [I will remove them.](http://th1090.photobucket.com/albums/i368/camzemong/GIFs/th_tumblr_lbelt1glAk1qbkjs7o1_500.gif) If you see comments like that, please report them. I know it's mostly ladies on here (although you dudes are so totally welcome) and that our appearances are a sensitive subject. It's hard enough getting by without jerkwads seeing a picture of you and being all ""fat bitch"" or ""7/10 would do"".

Bad bad bad bad bad.](http://cache.jezebel.com/assets/images/39/2011/10/medium_dontwanta.gif) There are very few times when hydroquinine creams are medically necessary, and then treatment should only be administered under a doctor's supervision. I will remove any posts promoting their use, spam or not, and not just because they're dangerous - because the message they send is dangerous. Fair skin, especially throughout Asia/South Asian Subcontinent/Pacific Islands is valued very highly. I see it as internalized racism, just one more narrative of ""brown people = bad, white people = good"" in the world. Dark skin is lovely. If you hate the color of your skin, I'd much rather see you [post here for help learning to love your skin and take care of it](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m23ajo2W2A1qe2ch3.gif), not abuse it.

It makes SUCH a difference to my face, I actually don't need any other makeup as long as I've got my brows. I know I'll never be able to get them to look like they do when they're filled in naturally, but I hope there is a way to get close to that.

I'm a college student who is out of the loop on how to make my hair look great all day and all night! I have long-ish brown naturally curly hair. 

My hair routine is wash it every other night, after the shower I apply Dove nourishing dry ends serum (which actually is working!!) to the ends of my hair, then I apply Dove frizz-free shine cream-serum (which USED to make my hair really soft to the touch) and finally I apply Not Your Mother's Beach Babe texturizing sea salt spray. Then I throw it up in a half pony tail during the night and the next morning it has a little bit of volume from being on top of my head and is in it's normal state of curliness.

The sea salt spray during the summer gives my hair a nice beachy look but I don't want that look all year, every year! Also, when I try to stop using the spray, may hair looks ""different"" almost flat and lifeless and makes me embarrassed to wear it like that all day.

So I've been trying some youtube techniques and nothing is working! The sock bun just tangles my hair and any curling techniques just don't hold. When I try curling my hair for those ""big and sexy curls"" the ends of my hair curl and eventually fall while the top portion of my hair just straightens... ugh!!

I love the effect that I am already wearing eyeliner at the base, and then sort of a feathery, voluminous look at the tips. To give an idea of what I'm kind of used to, here is what I use currently:

Either [covergirl lash blast](http://www.drugstore.com/covergirl-lashblast-waterproof-mascara-very-black-885/qxp318539?catid=183542) and [l'oreal voluminous](http://www.drugstore.com/loreal-voluminous-carbon-black-mascara-carbon-black-335/qxp179656?catid=183541) added on top of that or [organic wear]( http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=340325&amp;catid=183541) with the lo'real voluminous over it. 

For a solo mascara, Iv'e found that if I wipe a lot of formula off the brush, [l'oreal extra volume collegen](http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=223055&amp;catid=183541) works well with a few coats.

 [maybelline define-a-lash](http://www.drugstore.com/maybelline-define-a-lash-mascara-very-black-601/qxp167031?catid=183541) gave me the opposite effect of what I like. No volume at all! 

I think there are good finds at the drugstore, but I have tried more high end brands from sephora, and think they are great as well! Any suggestions appreciated and I'm excited to hear what you all love on your lashes.

Some updates, considering we've gotten 500 subscribers in the last two weeks! 

jen_wexxx and I have been making some improvements to the sub lately, some of which you may have noticed, some not. downvotes are now gone: we're hoping that this will encourage you to explain why you disagree with someone's advice, rather than simply downvoting.

Soon you will start seeing link flair on posts. We deal with a lot of spam every day. Some of it is really obviously spam, and some of it is a little harder to identify. In particular, we get people who submit nothing but their own blog posts and don't seem to participate in the Reddit community at large. I do understand, though, that sometimes you want to keep your online-professional identity separate from your say-whatever-the-hell-I-want Reddit identity, so I'm sure we've marked some legitimately good content as spam - and that's not good for the community here. 

We will be applying link flair to posts that we're unsure about, asking you for feedback on whether you think it's spam, or if it's stuff you want to keep seeing here. Please continue using the Report button and leaving feedback in the comments on this stuff. Blogs that are advertisement-heavy and content-poor will continue to be removed immediately: [this is not the forum to get revenue from ad impressions.](http://rgifs.gifbin.com/2yu3sw37748.gif) 

If you're one of the people posting nothing but your blog posts here, please try to engage with the community for two reasons: one, so we know you're invested in it, and two to let us gauge your expertise. No one's going to be turned away for not knowing everything, but just a few comments make it pretty clear whether this is something you're genuinely interested in or if you're someone being paid to SEO a blog. 

As a reminder: please keep it civil! I know I say this all the time, but in the past week we've had to ban several people for being major jerks. I don't like doing it, but we will to keep this space a pleasant one.

***now to the fun stuff!***

I'm planning some major changes on the backend to improve the looks and functionality of the sub. To that end, I thought a custom logo would be a nice touch! The colors of the sub will be designed around the new logo, so the winner will have a major hand in shaping the look and feel of /r/beauty. *[...and I'll be sending the winner a $50 gift card to Sephora!](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzl20bbqEL1r50pfh.gif)* 

Here's all the details:

* The logo must a maximum of 250 pixels wide by 150 pixels high. Larger-resolution versions are welcome to help me pull colors to set backgrounds, link colors, etc., but the image must be created to display clearly at 250 X 150. Smaller is fine, but larger is not. 

* Please send the file as .jpg or .png, preferably with web-optimized colors. 

* Entries are due June 1st, 2012 by 5 PM CST. At that point, I'll put them all together and set up a page where subscribers can go vote. Voting will be open for one week, with the winner announced Monday, June 4th. 

* jen_wexxx and I reserve the right to disregard inappropriate submissions. We're not going to disqualify anything because we just personally don't like it, but anything offensive will be thrown out. If you send in an image that's the wrong size or the wrong format or something I will try, within reasonable limits, to work with you to get it to where it needs to be to be considered. 

* to enter, send your entries to: beautylogocontest@gmail.com. Both jen_wexxx and I will be monitoring that account and one of us will confirm that we've received your entry. 

If you have any questions, please comment here so the answers can be helpful to others. Of course, as always, if you don't feel comfortable asking something publicly, please message me and jen_wexxx.

I airdry and often leave it naturally straight or wavy. Sleeping in rollers or rags can be annoying and sometimes I don't have time to just wait around my dorm while I have my hair in pin curls. Instead, I either put my hair in french pigtail braids or in twist pigtail braids. To get more wild waves, french is best. But to get softer waves, twist braids are best. Last night I kept in twist braids. If you don't know how to make them, check this link out:

http://www.dreamweaverbraiding.com/braids/Twist.htm

Do the same thing as described by the link, instead in 2 braids on each side of your part.

You can either put them in when your hair is slightly damp or when it's dry. Keep them in as long as possible. When you're ready to take the braids out, finger comb and tame them with coconut oil and/or aloe vera gel or any hair gel of your choice. They're really pretty and natural looking. I recommend using aloe vera gel so you don't get flakes or that crunchy feeling but still enough hold.

I've been desperately searching for a high SPF sunscreen that will hold up under these conditions without making me an oily, sticky mess, but so far I've had very little luck, despite consultation with a number of chemists, and a wide range of formulas. 

I've read a million reviews, spent way more than I ever intended, tried physical and chemical sunscreens (and combinations), oil absorbing powders, blotting papers, and nothing is working for me. The thing is that I normally don't have oily skin, but I seem to have a funny reaction to sunscreens. Spending the days oily and changing products once a week is also causing me to breakout.

I started to think that nothing is going to help my hair except to cut it, and after three years of growing out my hair I would have sold my soul to the devil to avoid cutting it. But then I was saved!!

Organic Virgin Coconut Oil. I swear on my life that this will SAVE your hair!! Last summer I dyed my hair twice with blonde box dye, a few months later I dyed it DARK brown, and a month after that I highlighted my hair TWICE to get rid of the brown. I straighten my hair at least twice a week, and I take a shower every night. Now as all of you probably know, dying your hair, washing it frequently, and using heat appliances on your hair will dry it out and damage it. You might see me as a HAIR HITLER. But if you miss the softness in your hair use COCONUT OIL! I swear on my life! Please don't spend money on hair products that say if will repair your hair, because they won't! I got my coconut oil for only $6 and I will never use buy another hair product ever! Please hear me out, this is a wonderful, wonderful product. Any questions just ask me!! Try it out, you won't regret it!

I think I've found the correct subreddit for this, please direct me elsewhere if not. 


To start, I know I'm not ugly, this isn't a shameless praise-me post, but I need help. I'm just average in general. Not my face, I like that. But hair, clothes, etc. It's just blah to me. A lot of it has to do with body confidence, and I tend to hide as much as possible.


Some backstory. Between 9 and 16 years old I managed to gain weight until I was 210 lbs. From 16 to 19 I developed bulimia with anorexic tendancies. I dropped to 120 within the first year.  Got help, got into real heath and fitness with long term goals. All the good stuff. So, I have a skewed perception of my physical appearance in general and I tend to not trust myself when I look in the mirror. I can look at photos from that time now and can see hip bones sticking through my coat (I'm fairly tall as well), but know that at the moment that photo was taken I had just thrown a fit because I didn't want to go out because, to quote myself, ""no one needs to see someone as fat as me"".  So, even now I can't look in the mirror and trust that what I see and perceive is what's really there.  


I'm at a much healthier place now and I want to move on and be happy with how I look. 


During my recovery I gained 70lbs. That was fine, my body needed to do it's thing. Now with the help of my doctor and zero restriction or binging, focusing only on eating whole natural foods and controlled fitness (as in I follow programs so I can't over do it), I am now down to about 150-160. I don't weigh myself, just going by what I looked like when I knew that's how much I weighed. I don't care about size or numbers, but I am uncomfortable, which is why I am happy that my body is settling into a healthier weight. 


As anyone who has recovered from an ED knows, weight just settles funny on our bodies. I've got rock solid legs from cycling, running, and squats, etc. No doube chin and can see my collarbone. But I've got about 15lbs of puff just on my stomach. I can't lay down without my ribs or hips digging into the floor, but I've got three massive round rolls on my tummy. it's just comfortable. And funny. 


So far I have adjusted by just wearing dark, baggy clothes alllll the time. 


When I made the choice to get help I cut off all my hair. It was about boob height length, and I cut it to only an inch long. I needed a shock. It's been growing out for years but is still only just at shouder length, the most awkward length for my hair type. I have thin hair, but a LOT of it. It's weird and wavy and goes frizzy and kinky at even the mention of humidity. 


So I usually straighten it, which is why I keep having to get hair cuts to get rid of  dead ends, thus slowing down the growing out process. I have been wear the same knitted cap for yeaaars to cover it up. 


See [here](http://i.imgur.com/sZroR.jpg) . if I straighten it it looks ok and I feel much more confident, but within a month it looks dead and crappy. This was taken about six months ago, it's now about an inch and a half longer. And yes, natural colour. I don't want to dye it again, I'm finally happy with my real colour.  


[Here](http://i.imgur.com/ICnJv.jpg) is me without straightening or make-up. This was a year ago, when I was still about 170lbs.


and this was a [few days ago](http://i.imgur.com/B662u.jpg). 


That fucking hat! It's a crutch.


I need tips on how to just manage myself. How do people control their hair without straightening? Since I cycle to work it's pointless straightening it, so I just do these twists and bun it up in the back (divide hair down the middle, start from behind my ears and twist back to where it meets at the nape of my neck, then pin it).  I have these little 2-3 inch hairs right in the centre of my hairline that drive me insane. Nothing I have done works to manage them, so they're always frizzy. 

For clothes, in my head I want to wear bright flambouyant clothing. Like hot pink short shorts with a robin's egg blue sweater. or knee length fluffy skirts, little vests, and hippy head bands and hair beads...That kind of thing. But I have worn nothing but black yoga pants, with a long black tank that I can pull down to cover my butt/upper thighs, then a baggy t-shirt over that, and always some sort of hoody over that...no matter how hot it is.  

I want to have that natural easy appearance. I want to look like a willowy hippy girl. I am on the inside. I feel I look too hard. 

Where should I start people of reddit?

To combat this, I've been wearing false lashes for awhile. When I don't feel like going all out, I stick on a few individual lashes in the sparse areas, but 90% of the time I wear strip lashes. I don't wear much in the way of eyeshadow, and I never wear eyeliner because I like the look of long, full lashes on a very natural eye - on me anyways. I cycle a few different pairs usually and can make one pair last weeks, I clean them with a q-tip and remove the glue build-up and they still look great after quite a few wears. 

One of my friends suggested eyelash extensions and said the lady in her salon charges $80 for the first appointment and then $55 every four weeks (or as necessary) for touch-ups. I've seen examples and they all look great but the photos are always right after they've been done - I want to know if they hold up well if they are taken care of well? Or should I just stick to what I do? I should mention the reason I'm thinking about it is because I'm a very busy mom of a one-year-old, working full time as well as a part-time cake decorating business from home. It's mostly for the convenience of not having to apply lashes daily and pack glue around, etc.

I have always had thin hair. It's a very fine strand and not very dense. Over the past 2 years, I feel like it has been getting thinner and thinner. It has gotten especially bad this past year. It is lifeless and you can see my scalp especially when I pull it back. It seems like I have bald spots. It's not exactly bald, but you can see way more of my scalp than before and even when my hair is down. 

Right now I am using Bosley hair products which are supposed to help with thinning hair. I'm also taking their supplement which has biotin and a bunch of other vitamins. 

I went to the doctor to see if it was a thyroid problem, and it's not. I don't know if it could be a different hormonal problem though, so I might go and get other bloodwork done to make sure. I recently started trying to eat really healthy. I try to eat a balanced diet and work out when I can. (I even lost about 10 lbs over the last month and a half.) 

The only thing I can think of is that I have lost a lot of it due to stress. I have really bad anxiety, and I am constantly stressed even when nothing particularly stressful is happening. I'm wondering if I have just gotten more and more stressed over the past couple years as well since I'm transitioning into being on my own and worried about money and school. 

It may be that there are several contributing factors. my real question is, if I try to reduce my stress levels, be healthier, take supplements etc... Will the hair eventually get back into a regular growth pattern? I mean it will probably take a lot of time and conscious effort, but does anyone know if it's possible to nurse it back to health?

With so many new subscribers, I felt it was time to see what changes everyone thought was best for the community as a whole. I'd love some suggestions on how to make this a better subreddit over all. 

Some of you may be wondering what happened to the subreddit logo contest. As you may know, the contest ended a while ago, but unfortunately I do not know who the winner is and I was not in charge of the prize. I have not heard back from wakatopatopa in about 2 months, so I don't know what's going on when it comes to the contest winner. **However**, we can have a second competition if you want. Perhaps it would be a good opportunity for any members, that make their own products and need a small advertising opportunity, to team up with me to provide the prize. Or you guys can give other ideas to make this work.

Anyway, I just wanted to give an update and let you all know I'm open for any input that's for the good of /r/beauty. Please comment bellow your thoughts on anything mentioned. Thanks guys!

He must have done some damage to the root of the toenail because it grew back horribly - part of the toenail was really thick and then the other half of very thin, brittle nail. The surface of the nail wasn't smooth at all and it still looked quite damaged. It had grown out over the winter so I've been getting by so far this summer by painting it with nail polish so it doesn't look too awful. However the brittle part broke off the other day, which left me missing a large square corner of my toenail. It was already ruined so I decided to just cut off the rest that didn't grow back properly, in the hopes that it'll grow back nicer this time. Problem is, now I have a very short toenail and it looks gross. Actually, it's not even the toenail itself that looks that bad, it's the shit that's happening underneath where the toenail used to be that's weird.


Any suggestions on fake toenails (or some other solution?) that I can use to make it look better? Or is it too short at this point to bother with a fake toenail?

I currently have dry skin in the areas that were once very oily (cheeks, nose, and lower forehead) and if I dont moisturize every day they become red (really glad I solved that problem already). Since my pores aren't genetically big how can I get them back to normal? It seems I can always squeeze them and get, sebum I think it is to come out, but I never really get acne. 



My current cleaning routine is to shower in the morning and 

1. cleanse with neutrogena extra gentle cleanser 
2. pat face dry with towel
3. dab thayers witch hazel with aloe on my face
4. let dry
5. Use neutrogena pore minimizing moisturizer
6. Exfoliate with face cloth twice a week.

There has to be something I can do. I have gotten a facial but I don't think this will really help me because the pores just fill back up with stuff in a matter of days.

I have tried oil cleansing method and didn't yield any different results. Unless you can give me very specific step by step amounts and procedure please don't suggest this.

TL;DR My pores are large and filled with sebum, my skin sucks, what the hell am I doing wrong? Also when I sweat I get black almost navy blue specs on the upper parts of my cheekbone, no idea what these are. They are shown in the last two pictures of the album below.

All three bottles boasted sulfate &amp;amp; silicone free ingredients and hair strengthening qualities that would reduce my hair breakage.

I have long considered trying sulfate-free shampoo, since I have frizzy, curly/wavy hair and silly superman cowlicks, with Shirley Temple ringlets (amusingly, only at my temples) and an annoyingly straight crown. I was previously using olive oil shampoo and conditioner from random grocery stores, chock full of sulfates, plus chi silk by the handful. My hair looked great! All I had to do was pull it back in a long braid when wet, let it dry, and voila! The only problem was breakage. I felt like my hair was breaking all the time, hence the switch.

Now my hair is frizzier, and it gets greasier faster (I used to be able to go without a wash about 4-5 days, now have to wash every 3 days or wear a hat, and I hate hats). The breakage doesn't seem to be down at all, although my hair does seem to be growing faster. The most annoying side-effect is tangliness. Even though the leave-in-conditioner is supposed to be a detangler, I develop baby dreds daily. I have to comb out my hair 3-5 times a day to keep it knot-free. It looks worse, and I feel like my transition period shouldn't last a month and a half. I'm about ready to abort the mission and revert to previous habits. Has anyone else experienced this kind of failure from the sulfate-free trend? Any thoughts?

TL;DR my hair is frizzier, tanglier, and greasier 1.5 months after switching to sulfate-free shamp/conditioner. Now I am sad. :(

1333724020.0,17,self.beauty,rwbkg,from one of your mods - on dark circles and your health,20,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/rwbkg/from_one_of_your_mods_on_dark_circles_and_your/,"hey, guys. We see a lot of posts coming through here asking about how to deal with dark circles under the eyes, and I just want to throw this out there.

Dark circles, while generally not serious, can be an indicator of real health problems. A brief list of things that can cause dark circles:

* Allergies

* Atopic dermatitis (eczema)

* Stress

* Smoking

* Chronic alcohol use/abuse

* Nasal congestion

* Sinus infections

* Sun exposure

* Melanoma

* Malnutrition

* Kidney deficiencies

* Unhealthy glucose levels

* Iron deficiency all the way to pernicious anemia

* Liver disease

Dark circles are also a side effect of many drugs. Again, you'd want to check with your doctor there that the medication is working correctly and that you're at the right dose. 

Keep in mind that some darkness under the eyes is natural; that skin is the thinnest on the body (as thin as half a milimeter!) and very translucent. Because that skin is so delicate, it's also important to be careful with it. When applying concealer, pat, don't rub - being rough can make dark circles worse, as it's easy to cause mild bruising. I like the [stippling method](http://thegloss.com/beauty/video-stippling-the-best-way-to-apply-foundation-833/), it works for concealear as well as foundation. If you do use your fingers to apply, pat it on, don't rub! And use your ring finger. Usually that is your weakest finger, so it will pat the most delicately. 

I've also seen mentioned that tanning helps fade the appearance of dark circles: this is a bad, bad, bad idea. Adding more dark pigmentation to the area will *not* help long term. 

To sum up: Dark eye circles? ***See your doctor.*** No medical cause? Drink lots of water, get more rest, and use concealer gently.

I have been struggling to keep up with myself recently, instead focusing on everything else. So here is to appreciating my body! ANY Suggestions, even if it is how you handled something similar is greatly appreciated. No matter how small it will help and if not, I will learn something new!

* I bite the skin around my nails subconsciously. I don't even realize I do it, but it looks disgusting once it is done. I have tried the thumb sucking stuff but I am immune to the taste. Any suggestions to get me to stop?
* I have REALLY dark and corse hair on my arms (Got to love the Italian genes) and in mass quantities. I am a bit self conscious about it, because it is what I see as a masculine feature. I have no desire to shave it off, because my skin is very sensitive and I feel it will cause more problems than anything. I tried bleaching kits in the past but they end up changing the color of my skin, and I'm not feeling to good about that lol. Any products that you have had good luck with? Any other suggestions?
* Cuticles! My cuticles are atrocious on my toes and fingers. Just need basic help on how to keep them in control.
* Also my nails are very very weak, to the point where they cant grow much longer than the end of my fingers because they snap off, or separate or both! Any suggestions on how to strengthen/thicken them? (I am allergic to dairy)
* I have large green/grey eyes. I have been using a light pink bare minerals glittered eye shadow most recently, because anything dark on my lids is too much. I want to find something without glitter that would be light, but still stand out (for business/work related events where glitter is not as welcomed). [reference](http://imgur.com/4NMHw) [pictures](http://imgur.com/XCClD)
* Anyone have any idea how I could bring out the shape of my eyes more as well? They have a very distinct shape that I would love to accentuate, but I know very little about makeup. 

I also posted some questions in the fancy follicles but i'll post them here as well:

* I have very fine hair [only picture I have to truely show how little hair I have](http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/281277_10150249896134221_533294220_7498598_654567_n.jpg) [this is from the front and that is all of it](http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/268704_1740018753952_1643160094_1362759_4652093_n.jpg) there are places on my head where you can see my scalp directly it is so thin,
and I like to keep it long. Cutting it shorter doesn't really look the best on me. Especially anything shorter than shoulder length, so that isn't an option. So what can I do with it? It doesn't hold a curl, it normally won't stay pinned with any type of clip, there is no volume to it. It is always in my face and it sheds EVERYWHERE. Headbands have been a big thing just because it is the only thing that will actually hold it back other than a band. I just want to know if there is anything I can do with it that I am missing!?
* My hair gets very greasy, VERY easily. I normally can't go past 2pm (shower at 9am) without having it get gross. I do not condition my roots. Any other suggestions? Any shampoos or anything else I could use to cut down on this? (I have psoriasis and severe dandruff so I have to use those shampoos as well)
* Is there a way to condition my hair to not need to be washed everyday? I've tried, but I end up looking unhygienic after the first 12 hours. 
* Last, does anyone else have a problem showering before bed? I have never in my life been able to shower before I went to sleep. When I wake up in the morning my hair is greasy as anything, and I have to end up taking another shower for it to even be manageable. 

Because I have so little hair when it gets greasy it starts to get very piecey and is extremely noticeable. So any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Lastly, are my skin questions. I will also be posting this in skinadvice, but I figure it is technically beauty.

* How often should I moisturize my body? And what is the best lotion you suggest? I have extremely sensitive skin.
* My scalp is really dry and really oily all at the same time. I have psoriasis and get little cuts on my head that flake frequently. I also have severe dandruff. However, my hair gets oily within a few hours of washing it? Any ideas?
* I also have combination skin on my face. My t-zone is a hot mess all the time and the pores are so big at this point I can swim in them? Any pore minimizers actually help? Because I am getting serious acne in this area.
* I have a ton of blackheads all over my face. They never come out when I try to remove them (even facialists have a hard time) although I drink at least 8 cups of water a day. They are causing me to have cuts all over and it is really unpleasant.
* My eyelid area is really sensitive and most facial creams are a bit too strong to handle. I have been using cortizone to keep it healthy. Any ideas?
* My lips are chapped NONSTOP. I carry chapstick with my at all times but it doesn't seem to work. 
* Cuts on my body take crazy long times to heal. As in months for a simple scratch. Any creams out there that can help them? I use neosporin, and am thinking about starting with Vitamin E cream. 
* The feet on my skin is so rough and thickens grossly overtime. I have tried everything. Ped egg, pumus stones, etc. The only thing that cleans it off is this one cheese grater looking thing that my pedicurist uses. However I cannot find one anywhere! Does anyone know how I could possibly make my heels less gross?
* I have had spider veins in my legs since I was about 15 (20 now). Any ideas on that to do? They kind of just look like clusters of veins that are not attached to anything.
* I need a new spot treatment. The toothpaste/benzoyl doesn't work anymore. I have been looking into Eradikate. Has anyone used this? Good reviews/bad reviews?
* Finally, last question. I know this has been long. I have uneven skin on my face. It is very red in my nose/tzone area. Ive been using some Aveno stuff that is supposed to even it out, but it has not done this.

1363274665.0,15,self.beauty,1aadvj,High Tech Eyeliners and How to Go Liquid,19,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1aadvj/high_tech_eyeliners_and_how_to_go_liquid/,"For the last few seasons on the runways a lot of makeup artists have started experimenting with hectic, high-tech liquid eyeliner looks. The traditional, heavy cat eye was still everywhere to be seen, but so was squares, triangles, single lines in the crease and even mini artworks that really made me think of a 1980's video game. Check http://thefeelingofsummer.blogspot.com/2013/03/get-look-high-tech-eyeliners.html out for some of my favourite images from the runways. 

Of course runway is runway and not all the looks are realistic for real life. But there are some cool elements you can incorporate in your everyday wear. 

It does seem, however, that a lot of girls still steer clear of the liquid liner, for some reason maintaining that it is more difficult to navigate than a pencil. It really isn't. Liquid liners create a more precise result and it is much easier to get a neat line. So unless you want to go smoky, I would say liquid is the better choice. 

If you're just starting out, get yourself a liquid eyeliner pen with a nice thick felt or triangular brush tip. If you're going for a felt tip, check that it is flexible. Test the line out on your hand. You should be able to draw an even, dark line with little effort. Wait for it to dry and then run your finger over it. The colour should not come off or flake. 

To apply, first put your finger (of the hand that won't hold the liner) at the outer corner of your eye and pull the skin up slightly. This will take out little creases and make application easier. Starting in the middle of the lashline, hold the tip of the eyeliner flat, length wise, against the lid. Dab the eyeliner to the outer corner. Then start at the inner corner and dab towards the middle. Go over the line again to even it out. 

Doing a cat eye is a bit trickier. A great tip I recently heard was to shape the cat eye with a light brown eyeshadow first. That way, if you make a mistake you can just rub it out. Use the outer rise of your lower lid as an indication of the angle the flick should be. Work on both eyes at the same time and keep comparing while you go to make sure they are even. This is actually pretty difficult so have patience. Once the angles are the same, trace the line with your liquid liner. Now draw a straight line from the tip of the flick back to the lid and fill it in. 

To soften a cat eye, I like to apply a little brown eyeliner at the outer corners of the lower lash line, blending inwards slightly. 

Eye makeup is a lot about experimentation. Play around with it a lot and see what works on your face. The aim should always be to make your eyes look brighter and bigger. 

Do you have any other tips? ",,False,self,t5_2qlac,False,,,True,t3_1aadvj,http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1aadvj/high_tech_eyeliners_and_how_to_go_liquid/,

-Shampoo (Currently using **Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo**...not a huge fan)

-Rinse

-Condition; clip up hair and let sit

-Wash face with face wash and, occasionally, face scrub (**Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser** and **St. Ives Apricot Scrub**)

-Body wash from the top to bottom; neck, arms, chest, etc., down to legs, feet, toes (**Olay Silk Whimsy Moisturizing Body Wash**)

-Use pumice stone on bottoms of feet

-Rinse full body

-Shave legs and pits (**Skintimate cream shave**)

-Rinse

-Rinse out conditioner

Then, get out and pat dry and immediately apply lotion all over (cocoa butter for body, **Neutrogena Healthy Skin** for face). Carefully Q-tip the ears. Spray on leave-in conditioner (**Aussie Hair Insurance**) and let hair air dry. Spritz on perfume (**Dolce and Gabana Light Blue**) and get dressed. Voila!

Special occasions include: occasional body exfoliation (homemade scrubs), in-shower body lotion (**Olay In-shower Body Lotion**), and skipping the hair washing every third day or so to keep scalp happy.

So, I'm a senior in high school (this year) who's really torn on what to do. I think I want to go to beauty school (for hair styling), but I'm also really good at typical school stuff. I've always been encouraged to go to a 4 year college, but I don't think I could ever work in an office. Ever. I've tried it with a summer internship and I absolutely haaated it. HATED it. When I worked retail a little bit ago, I actually liked being on my feet and talking to people and helping them out, so it makes me think my dream job would be working around and with people, but for a little bit more pay than a minimum wage retail slave.

ANYWAYS. I live in the Southern US, and I'm a gay guy. This also kind of sucks. I've always dreamed of moving out to Cali, and I know there's a bunch of amazing beauty schools out there. I've really wanted to work in the movie industry too, so working in the hair-industry there would be awesome. 

Here's the problem... I've never cut anyone's hair and I'm not sure if I'm even good at it, and I'm scared to skip out on a 4 year university. Is going to beauty school a good idea with someone with as little experience as me? I'm really not sure what to do.

Please avoid suggestions of brands, and instead go for the actual product type (pick the shampoo instead of BRANDXSHAMPOO, as an example.

That does not mean you can't discuss brands, or techniques, but that I ask you to distinguish it within your post so I can add things quicker. When it seems we have everything listed, we'll go onto the next topic: natural makeup, which will be the basics of makeup and cosmetic application.

Ever since I was young, I've had very thin eyebrow hair. The width of my eyebrows is wide, but the individual hairs are very fine. This may come from my Mom's side, as her eyebrows are similar to mine while my Dad and sister's eyebrows are normal. 

I recently learned that eyebrow grooming/makeup can have a huge impact on one's face, and this is done through shaping and drawing in eyebrows.  However, because my eyebrow hairs are so thin, drawing them in makes the brow-liner/eye shadow really obvious regardless of how light/dark it is, and the overall effect not so great. If I shape them before fixing this issue, I fear that my eyebrows will look too feeble.

I need a heavier moisturizer than what I'm using now (Neutrogena oil free moisturizer), but I'm terrified that if I switch to something heavier I'll break out in a major way. Does anyone have suggestions for a serious moisturizer that won't clog my pores? Thanks!

EDIT: Update, now that the weather has changed and my winter experiments in moisturizing are over. I ended up getting a jar of Pond's dry skin cream (http://www.ponds.com/product/detail/95796/dry-skin-cream), which did help with some dryness issues and didn't make me break out. It is heavy and a little greasy feeling, so I tried to use less during the day. I'm not totally in love with it, but the jar was $5 and I still have a decent amount left even after slathering it on for months. I tried a million different products around my eyes, including various oils, but nothing really worked until I broke down and bought a jar of L'Oreal Revitalift eye cream, which has been a godsend. It finally helped my eye area look like it did a few years ago, before my fine lines started to get really noticeable.  

Now that we've got some moisture back in the air I'm using the CVS knockoff version of Olay All Day moisture lotion with spf 15, which I LOVE. Super effective and not at all greasy.

I've been using Loreal's Nature Therapy for a while and it does help with how dry my hair feels but what other shampoos from my local store with help with the frizz and dryness better? Maybe Pantene ProV or Tresemme? 

I don't know if this makes a difference but I have medium length hair and it's naturally wavy. I'm caucasian so that may explain the general texture.

UPDATE: 
Hey everyone! So thank you all for your great input. It was really helpful. A small update here, about four days ago I put coconut oil in my hair over night and washed it out with my new shampoo Nature's Gate: herbal shampoo and conditioner from my local Sprout's market. That morning I let my hair air dry hoping that it wouldn't look the usual, dry and frizzy ends, and I was blown away. My hair has been so soft and feels so moisturized (still!) it's unbelievable. I recommend the oil treatment to try at least once. AMAZING results (: the coconut oil was about $10 and it's well worth it.

I've also started drinking nothing but water and can really notice small changes in my body. I love it.

I *think* now would be a good time to go through with this (it's something I've always had an urge to do).  

Reasons for: 
*  I'll be embarking on an eight week archaeology field school this summer in the entirely too hot and humid Southern Ohio
*  I'm currently in college- prime time for experimenting with potentially dumb decisions
*  I have absolutely no instinct on how to style/manage my hair when it's longer
*  It would be cheaper than regular salon haircuts.

Reasons against: 
*  I'm not sure how I'll be perceived.  I know the whole fuck what everyone thinks gag, but I'm socially anxious as it stands.  Cutting my hair off into a pixie cut was ballsy enough and I eventually became really comfortable with myself and gained an unbelievable amount of self confidence.  I'm not sure if shaving it off would lead to more of that or just give me daily panic attacks.  
*  The question of if I'd be taken seriously, professionally and socially, lingers.
*  I haven't had long hair in three years, it's always been in an on and off pixie style, usually hanging around in the awkward growing out stage which it's at now.  
*  It would also be an experience to have long hair again. 
*  My boyfriend is also eager for my hair to grow out.

And the big one, would it look good?
I've been told that I have a very striking resemblance to Carey Muligan, minus the adorable dimples.  I suppose I'm a bit waif-ish.  I'm just hoping I wouldn't turn out to look like Sinéad O'Connor.

Anyways, any suggestions are welcome, any chicks that have shaved their heads and have thoughts/feelings about it, etc.  I've been debating this for awhile and thought I'd turn to Reddit for some help.

Sidenote: not skinhead bald, more like [this](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1rnveteYz1rrnm1lo1_500.jpg)

TL:DR Decision to either shave my head or keep growing my pixie cut out is tough. Reasons to do so: this summer I'll be in the Southern Ohio heat every day for nearly 8 weeks.  Reasons not to: self conciousness, the quest to finally having long hair again after three years of pixiedom will be defeated.

Ninja edit: just formatting issues.

Edit: Conclusion, I shall grow it out until either field school comes and my hair is an issue or until my hair gets annoying and requires a shave.

I look and feel so much better without makeup - hope it works for other ppl too!!! :)

I've heard of a few kinds of lasers, but I'm sure there are others.  When I google, it seems to all be propaganda from the companies and/or reviews that are unable to separate a good/bad technician from a good/bad laser.

[UPDATE and a review!]",15,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/19xf70/i_want_to_wear_sunscreen_but_all_of_them_break_me/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/18hsxz/i_want_to_wear_sunscreen_but_all_of_them_break_me/)

Firstly, thanks so much for all of the feedback and product recs! 

The most valuable things I gleaned from everyone's comments were that 1. Chemical sunscreens break me out, so go for a physical sunscreen, and 2. I should try a standalone sunscreen, not an anti-aging product that includes spf. 

As it so happens, CeraVe just put out a line of sunscreens that include InvisibleZinc without chemical sunscreens, and I happened to see it on the shelf at my local Walgreen's right after making that post. Here is the one I picked up: [CeraVe Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Face Lotion](http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=84841)  

I made myself wait a couple of weeks before updating here, because I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to have any other reactions, but I could tell within the first day of wearing it that it would work well for me. Namely: my face was not an oily mess by the end of the day, and no immediate breakouts! It actually has more of a matteifying effect on my skin. The two cysts on my chin from the last sunscreen I used have dried up, and I am happy to say that there are no new ones.

It does leave a bit of a whitish cast on my skin after applying, but I've gotten around that by using a very light application of bronzer on top. (I am pretty confident that the bronzer is not making me orange, because my SO has no reservations about telling me things like that, and he hasn't mentioned it.) I have noticed a few more blackheads/blocked pores than usual, but nothing painful, and TBH that usually happens when I use any kind of moisturizer/lotion on my face in the morning. I do have to make sure my skin is well exfoliated and moisturized before hand - I applied it one morning when I was a little flaky, and it made it more noticeable. 

I may check out some of the more high-end recs when I have the cash, just to see if any of them work better for me, but I'm pretty happy with this one overall - it cost me between $10-$15, and is available at the drugstore.

I want to replace it with a minimal, quality collection which can be stored a slightly less anti-social manner.

* Face - base, foundation, concealer, powder, blusher
* Eyes - shadow, liner, mascara, something eyebrow related (currently I'm using Brow-Zings by Benefit)
* Lips - a few lipsticks and glosses

I will also include tips on how to care for your hair in general, which especially helps if you're growing your hair out long.



* First, if your hair is not damaged, try to prolong your haircuts for 12 weeks minimum rather than 8. Extra growth never hurt anyone as long as there are not too many split ends.

* If you are not sure you can last the minimum 12 weeks, do a bimonthly Search and Destroy. Search and Destroy means you search for split ends under good lighting and cut ONLY the spit hairs to a point above where the split begins. This will make your haircuts last longer without the need to go to a salon.You need to use hair scissors for this which can be found at any CVS. Salon visits should be for people that need to get their hair shaped after it grows out of the cut a bit, develops fairytale ends or has uneven ends, and has too many dry/split ends for S&amp;D to really be effective. Over all, if your hair looks and feels bad when you run your fingers through it, get the cut if you need it. 

    Here is how to search and destroy:

http://shine.yahoo.com/8-tips-improving-search-destroy-trimming-technique-175100406.html



* Protect your hair in between cuts. Here's a list of things that can cause damage:

flat irons
curling irons
blow driers [if you must, put on cool]
HOT shower water
excessive brushing with non boar bristle brush
brushing/combing from root to ends [it should be ends to roots]
wearing your hair in VERY tight ponytails and other **tight** styles
snags from metal accessories
over-washing your hair, especially if you use sulphate shampoo [this is VERY common]
Sleeping with loose hair

Obviously, you're human and in modern society and cannot avoid absolutely everything. But limiting certain things can drastically improve your hair's condition. Just air drying your hair and washing it every other day can help. If you have to chose the flat iron or blow drier, pick one, but not both. You can straighten with a blow drier actually, which could be less damaging than a flat iron, or you can air dry and risk less damage with a flat iron and heat protecting spray. I personally, gave up heating my hair all together and learned to love my natural texture, which happens to be mostly straight anyway. That's actually the best option health-wise. If I want it straighter,[ I just wrap my hair](http://www.dominicanblowout.com/how_to/how-to-do-a-doobie/).  If you like to curl your hair, there are so many easy alternatives to a curling iron. Try curlers, rags, pin curls, or even paper bags if you like Michelle Phan's idea. If you want waves, try sleeping in braids, which is better for your hair at night anyway. You can try all sorts of heatless updoes or half updos as well. If you prolong heat styling to once a week minimum, your hair will be better off.



When it comes to brush damage, try to use your comb more, and a **boar bristle brush** when your hair has more oil in it. Become a fan of finger combing as well. I use my fingers, a widetooth wood comb, a rattail comb, and a boar bristle brush.



When it comes to showering, try not to use scolding hot water. Instead, massage hair for two minutes with warm water to open cuticles and shampoo/condition. When you're done,  use as cool/cold water as you can stand to close cuticle. This will make your hair a lot shinier and less frizzy. Try to switch to sulphate free shampoo, or if possible, [conditioner only washing](http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/rdqmm/the_basics_of_conditioner_only_washing/). Sulphates are really bad for your hair and your hair will thank you if you switch to something less harsh. Also, try to avoid silicones in your shampoo/conditioner as they tend to ""fake"" healthy hair and cause a LOT of build up. Try to prolong showers to every other day at least because the natural oils, or sebum, produced by your scalp is actually good for protecting it. To protect split ends, use a small amount of virgin coconut oil on ends and up the length. This also makes hair shiny, but don't use so much to the point you look greasy.



A good tip for the overall growth and health of your hair is to take vitamins. Try biotin, folic acid, and/or hair, skin, and nail vitamins. Warning: biotin may cause a little breakouts if you do not drink enough water.



* Before you go to the salon, make sure you know what you want. Since you'll have an extra month under your belt, you should aim to sacrifice a maximum of 1/2 an inch, which is the average amount of hair growth per month. Do you want to grow out layers? Do you want to grow out bangs? Do you want to keep them? Do you want a style you used to have? Print a picture of the hair style you want. If it happens to be a picture of yourself with a certain style, it may even be easier. When making the appointment, tell the stylist these things over the phone to get him/her prepared. If you don't want much length off but your hair is uneven and needs to be reshaped, let him know. The more information the better. If you're not sure about layers or face framing or bangs and what not, look up what best matches your face shape, but make sure to make it clear you want to keep your length as long as possible. Plan this at least a week in advance and be sure what you ask for is what you want.

* When you go to the salon, be prepared to be asked if you want your hair shampooed there. Yes it feels amazing, but their product has a lot of sulphate. If you can, bring your own sulphate free shampoo and have them use that on you instead. If you do conditioner only washing, tell them you want to wash your hair right before you get there and just have it rewetted. they should understand. Try not to use product before you get to the salon, since the purpose is to arrive with clean hair. 

* The stylist will ask if you want your hair blow dried. Say no. Let it air dry or put it in a braid after you leave. This may actually save you an extra 25 dollars as well at certain salons. The less damage the better. The most damage you will probably get is if they towel dry your hair. At home, you should try towel drying with a T-Shirt [*The more you knowwww*].

* The stylist will ask how much you want taken off. Tell him you are growing your hair out and only want a trim. Tell him to trim your existing layers, and if you're trying to grow them out, trim off a little extra on the length to help the transition. If you want minimum taken off, tell him to take off between 1/8th of an inch to 1/4th of an inch. The maximum off should be 1/2 an inch, and that's if your hair splits up further than you thought or is drier a little further off the shaft. If it happens to be more than 1/2 an inch, get ONLY the damage cut off. I'd rather have 2 inches off than have severe split ends. Warning: stylists do tend to be scissor happy so don't be surprised if they cut off a little more than you ask for, especially since hair is cut while it's wet; wet hair stretches, so whatever is cut, it will look even shorter when it dries. 

* If you want to save salon trips only to get your hair reshaped and you  trust yourself, you can try doing half of your haircuts. This will save money, prolong salon visits, and will protect you from scissor-happy stylists. Be sure you can handle it though, because you'll end up with short crudely layered hair if you mess up. Remember, cut off as little at a time as you can and FOCUS. This is only for the *daring*.

* [Here's me after my hair cut](http://imgur.com/zefQx) . I've been following this advice for the past year and a half. When I started, my hair was a short shag cut with the longest layer brushing up against my shoulders and thick side swept bangs. [This is how short it was when I started growing it out](http://imgur.com/qJhmZ). My hair is now healthier than it ever was, it's mostly my natural color now, and It's getting noticeably longer.

I am the OP of this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/190eyw/21_year_old_male_with_awful_dark_circles_seeking/

I've been losing weight the last 4 months, and I've lost over 2 stone in total. I still have a few more stone to go but I'm much better for it.

Anyway, I'm really pre-occupied with my facial skin atm and It's really bad. I've known my complexion was awful for years, but now that I'm doing the whole re-invention thing - It's all the more obvious to me that my skin is basically shit.

I've taken a few pictures lit by natural sunlight as it betrays the flaws in my complexion much better than any flash could:

I know it's hereditary, but must I look this ""rough"" at 22? To be fair, I do work permanent nights and I always liked to stay up late anyway - but should my facial skin look this bad? Literally all my other body skin is in pretty good condition. It's just my face that has the enlarged pores - dark deep set eyes and ""bumpiness"". 

In image 2, 3 and 4, you can see the effect lighting has on my complexion, it makes odd looking ""fuzzy"" shadows drop on my face.

At the end of shower when your pores are sufficiently steamed, gently massage the enlarged pore areas with a fine granular cleanser, for no more than 10-15 seconds.
1. Rinse. After shower, pat dry.
1. Apply a very small amount of glycolic acid 5-10%, or salicylic acid 2% to the area.
1. You should start to see smaller pores in about 2 weeks.

It seems that at least on Amazon, salicylic acid 2% is more available then glycolic acid 5-10%. So salicylic acid is what I use.

A few years ago my dependency was much worse, I would never be seen by anyone but close family members without a full mask as well as fake tan, but things have improved since then. I have given up fake tan, I will be seen without makeup by close friends and often will leave the house with just eyebrow pencil and mascara, which is a huge step forward for me. 

However, I've been seeing someone for the past four months and when I know that I will see him I apply full makeup, as in full coverage foundation, concealer, powder, blush, contour, highlighter, lip pencil, eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara. 

It tends to get smudged off when we kiss so when we're in public I'm always rushing off to fix it and sometimes cut the kissing short. When we're alone I worry about it too and regularly apply more when it gets smudged off and feel ugly when he looks at me after sex or kissing when I know its been smudged off. 

The worst thing is that it goes all over his face and as I'm quite a bit paler than him it looks weird. He's asked me not to wear it because he wants to be able to kiss me in public, and I really want to be able to not wear it for both that reason and because I want to feel less dependent on it. 

I'm been considering just wearing eye makeup and highlighter when I meet up with him next but I'm just really unconfident about my bare skin. I'm really, really pale so I have red areas and very dark circles under my eyes. I'm also quite freckled which I don't exactly dislike myself but I just think I look quite different bare faced. 

tl;dr So, while I try to adjust, are there any products you can recommend that will be less messy smudging off while kissing and that can help ease the transition from full coverage to bare skin?

I've been dyeing my hair (at home, not at a salon) since last summer. I naturally have light brown hair and I've been dyeing it slightly darker/redder. Yesterday I decided to try a more intense red and I don't like it at all - it turned out kind of okay, but very maroon, at the bottom but a brighter red at the roots and my scalp is still a little pink in places. (I think I assumed that since my dyed hair was fairly dark I could use hair dye for dark hair; specifically this

Will I ruin my hair if I go and redye my hair tonight? I'm just going to dye it back to a brown color since I'm presenting my research at a conference this week and then I'm graduating and I don't want this crazy reddish color in my hair for that. If I can't do that how long do I have to wait before redyeing? (The conference is on Friday so I have a little bit of time). My hair is in excellent condition; dying it somehow hasn't destroyed it and my friends always comment on how impossibly soft it is. I don't really have the time/money this week to go to a salon so that's out.

Also what specific shade of brown will counteract maroonish red? A quick google search tells me an ash brown? Is that correct?

I was only able to get about 5 sessions done, but the results I've seen for most areas are fantastic.

The hair on my legs, armpits and bikini region are finer, and not as dark. I used to see ""blackhead"" like spots where the hair was about to grow in because it was dark and semi-course. I've also seen an improvement as far as how long hair takes to grow in. What would have come back in a day now takes several days or even weeks to show or get long enough to be a problem.

However, I have had a lot of difficulty with shaving. Whatever lasering does to the hair has made it nearly impossible to shave my legs and crotch region without ""missing"" spots that I know I for sure went over.

I've tried both men's and women's razors, disposable and not, varying numbers of blades, and it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. I've also tried both men's and women's shave cream, dry shaving, soap... etc. Some hair shaves off as it normally would, and in other areas I'll run my hand over the area and there is still some hair left over, like it cut off some of the hair, but not as close to the skin as other areas.

I have even had some issues when waxing my legs. I suppose it could be because I'm not a professional, but I feel like even a beginner with no waxing experience watching a tutorial on youtube and using all the right supplies should at least be able to wax with no issues on the front of their legs and get the desired results. I would say I'm at an intermediate level when it comes to doing at home waxing, so I can only guess that it's because of the laser treatments.

Have any of you experienced this issue? I have sensitive skin, so I am not able to use depilatory creams. No idea if they would work anyway. Aside from getting more treatments done, which I can't currently afford to do properly, I'm not sure what else I can try to solve this.",,False,self,t5_2qlac,False,,,True,t3_14m0pc,http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/14m0pc/difficulty_shaving_after_laser_hair_treatments/,

I need some advice on shampoo, conditioner, and hair products in general. 

I blow dry my hair about 3 times a week (and then maybe straighten it) and let it air dry on the other days. It's about 3 inches past my shoulders. 

My hair is definitely greasy at the roots and has been my whole life. I figure I wash my hair about 5 times a week and use dry shampoo on the off days. On the off days I feel pretty gross cause dry shampoo just doesn't seem to do enough. 

However, at the ends of my hair it's a different story. The last two inches of my hair are brittle and split and extremely dry...which hasn't really been an issue until maybe a year ago (side note: I did go on birth control about a year ago so I wonder if that had anything to do with it?). I know getting a trim will help but I just did that about 3 weeks ago so I'm surprised I'm seeing split ends already! 

I've tried lots of different shampoos-- from herbal essences to professional shampoos to sulfate and paraben free shampoos and have had varying results. Shampoos that are supposed to be super moisturizing make my ends happy and my roots sad. I think my hair has probably done best on the Organix Moroccan oil shampoo. 

For conditioner, pretty much the same story--but Organix conditioners don't seem to want to ""stick"" to my hair / my hair doesn't want to absorb it (note: I only apply it to the middle and ends, not the roots). At this point NOTHING seems to be working! Even the ""intense"" ones you leave in for 20 minutes don't help my ends and I spend awhile trying to detangle without killing my hair. 

Some ""after washing"" products work better for me than others...right now I'm using a volumizing mousse and a Moroccan oil product for the ends of my hair. 

So help me, reddit! Let me know what advice you have :) 


EDIT: Thank you guys so so so much for your suggestions! The general feeling here seems to be that I should shampoo less often and only use sulfate, silicone, and paraben-free products when I do need to wash my hair. I actually tried the ""no poo"" thing last summer and gave up after a month, but I think I'll try again! This time, instead of completely cutting out shampoo I'll try to wean myself off of it.

I have a bit of trouble and some questions at the moment, surprisingly hard to find out on the Internet too. Basically, I've been thinking for some time now to set up a Korean cosmetics online store in the UK. I have contacts directly in Korea to buy the items from but have just thought of some walls and possible law trouble I may come into.

I totally forgot that all cosmetics and skincare products currently on the UK market have to go through rigorous testing and quality assessments to make sure they are fit for use, contain no harmful ingredients, etc. and realised that Korean standards will not apply to the UK? I found some info out from the Cosmetics Standards Regulation saying that cosmetics from outside the EEU have to have a label on in English with the ingredients on, and all the ingredients checked and stuff.

So would I have to take every specific item to a chemist or regulator to get a UK standards stamp, or a go ahead on them? Or would I need to procure documents from the Korean sellers to make sure they're legit and contain nothing harmful?

They obviously have to go through some sort of quality assessment to check everything is okay, ingredients are not harmful, etc in Korea but I take it this isn't covered in the UK. I know in places like China, they can put almost anything in cosmetics but I can't imagine Korean standards differ much from our own.

And also, it's a little hazy regarding the above. Say I'm not allowed to import and sell them to other UK consumers because of the above. What if I bought them to use on myself, so whatever reactions I got from different standards, the Korean sellers would be the direct sellers and liable (even though it's usually not their fault and I'd probably just leave it to be honest.). But what if I didn't use those cosmetics at all for a couple of months, then eBayed them, brand new and unopened, to sell to someone else?

Not really sure about any of this but I figured someone may be in the know-how here. Any input would be great, thank you!

I don't need to heat style or use any products anymore and it's honestly not expensive to keep up with. It works really well for curly hair, but it definitely works with straight hair. I have thick straight hair and I do just fine. Those with thin hair may have to use lighter conditioners for this to work well for them. 

First, check the link to understand the concept and to see if it's right for you:

I'm a guy and was looking for help on reducing under-eye bags and puffiness. They've only really hit me over the past 3 years (I never had them through high school).

I get that it's more complicated than a cream. I try to get good sleep. I do need to drink more water and a more healthy diet wouldn't hurt. I wash my pillowcases/sheets/linen weekly. I take an anti histamine now to stave off hay fever (which may have been an early trigger of it all). I do sleep on my side unfortunately (on my back gives me sleep paralysis).

I'm not into wearing makeup so a BB cream or concealer is a no go, but is there a really fantastic under eye cream that helps prevent it to an extent? Currently I just use moisturiser and that's it. It sounds like all the good ones have retinol and caffeine but which ones are the real deal?

Sorry if this is the wrong time or place to post, I've never been here before. I'm a bit scared to ask my girl mates since its a bit embarrassing.

EDIT: Thank you so much everybody. You all were unbelievably helpful. Under-eye products are so expensive but I'm going to give a few of them a go - I'll start with the Origins Ginzing and the Avene OTC retinoid cream recommended at that /r/skincareaddiction thread, and I'll also try the (thankfully much cheaper) cold teabag thing at nights.

Now that i'm earning enough to get more than just basics I'm looking for product/technique/magic that will give more volume without making the hair feel unnatural or particularly textured. what products would help to increase volume of the hair on my head while not turning it into a huge textured/oily mess?

It started about 2 months ago, and it's just getting worse.  
  
* I'm not using any new products.  
* My diet has changed slightly, but for the better.  
* Because of the fact that I've been eating better I've lost 20 lbs. (not that it really makes a difference for the face issue, I'm just happy that I lost 20 lbs lol)  
* I use, and have always used, astringent 2x per day, and wash my face with Neutragena grapefruit scrub in the am and pm.  
* I am not exfoliating any more or less than I used to.  
  
The only thing that changed is that I moved to NY from DE, and I left my boyfriend.  Does my face hate the city?  Is my face upset about the breakup?  I don't know.  Any other possibilities I haven't thought about?  I know this is pretty much impossible for you guys to tell me, but I will take any advice I can get.  And since I've never dealt with an issue like this, what is the best way to cover this?  I use smashbox concealer and loose powder.  Any product suggestions?

For my entire life I can remember not having very defined -or even good for that matter- eyebrows. I'm blonde, so they are very light where there *is* hair. They are also thin, and basically are bald right in the center of my brow where hair SHOULD be, so I have tiny little hairs dotted on the very top of my brows. It's so frustrating! I've been shading them in every day for the past 3 years with a brow pencil and some powder but most days they look kind of... off. And it doesn't help that if I sweat, go swimming, or take a nap the makeup ends up wearing off sometimes. It's so much maintenance. I feel like they are such a bad feature I never leave the house without at least doing my eyebrows, I'm very self conscious about them. 

So I was wondering, beauty gurus of reddit- is it possible to grow these suckers in so I can finally have some natural brows? I skimmed for answers online but a majority of sites I found suggested having a healthy diet (I already do), take vitamins (I already do) or to ""lay off of the tweezing"", which I've never done because I have no eyebrows to tweeze!

The folks from FabFitFun asked the celebrity photographer and FFF team member Angelo Kritikos on how to be more photogenic. Check out his tips to looking picture perfect!

Put that Hand on Your Hip: It creates a slender pose and makes your arm and body look extra lean.

Find Your Angle: Try not to stand squarely to the lens. It is so much more flattering to have your body angled so one shoulder is closer to the camera. This angle will give the illusion of having a leaner and taller body.

Raise and Push the Chin Out: It feels a little awkward at first, but by exposing your neck, you will look taller and help to camouflage any signs of the dreaded double chin!

Practice Makes Perfect: Have a friend photograph different smiles and angles of yours, then review the pictures to see which expression and pose look best for you. The practice will also make you feel more comfortable and confident.

Choose the Right Colors: Find colors that flatter your skin tone. Think pastels and bright berries for fair skin, saturated colors and earth tones for medium/olive skin and brighter jewel tones and corals for darker skin.

Vitamin E Oil: Apply sparingly to arms and collarbone for a healthy glow that will enhance skin highlights when photographed. Be very careful not to overuse this product because it may appear like sweat on camera.",,False,self,t5_2qlac,False,,,True,t3_16nifh,http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/16nifh/strike_the_perfect_red_carpet_pose_for_pictures/,

We should share what we do and why! Sorry if this is a re-post, but some women update their routines monthly so it's not so bad, right?

My routine:

I take off any make up I have on, usually using a baby wipe for my face and Extra Virgin Olive Oil for eye make up. I use EVOO because it's super gentle on the sensitive skin we have on our eyes, and conditions the eyelashes.

Then I use my Clarisonic Mia 2 and face wash. The Clarisonic was expensive, but my skin has never been more clean and smooth. If I were only allowed to have one beauty item for the rest of forever, I choose this. I got mine for $160.00 at Ulta, but the original Clarisonic is $119. I alternate between Aveeno face wash and Biore's exfoliating wash. 

Pat dry, and then I moisturize EVERY single night. Every old woman I know that has amazing skin says moisturize every day. 

Then I apply self tanner to my face and neck. I only apply it to my face and neck because it's winter, and I live in Michigan so I am always bundled up. I use St. Tropez Mousse with the mitt from Sephora. It's about $40 for the original color, but it's amazing. Seriously. I will only ever buy the mousse version though, I am on my 3rd bottle of it. Let it dry over night, wash it off in the AM. If you have hair on your upper lip, apply very sparingly, it will make it more noticeable. 
Also, Jergens has a self tanner made for the face, I think it's about $10 :)

The self tanner just makes my life so much easier if I am short on time or don't want to wear a ton of make up the next day or two. I don't look like pasty white death anymore. I just use moisturizer with SPF, concealer under my eyes and mascara and I feel pretty good. If I don't want to wear any make up, I put some Vaseline on my eyelashes and curl them. Good to go.

As for my hair at night, I only wash it every few days. I do use dry shampoo daily though. I use the Generic products from Sally Beauty Supply, they do work well! As well as their Ion conditioner. (The white and red bottle smells like Creamsicle!)

So, tell me your routine and why it is what it is, I might need to steal some tips and tricks!

Unfortunately, after a haircut my hair is usually good for a day or two and then eventually devolves into this rat's nest of split ends and horrible, fizzy half-curls.

Any suggestions on how to take care of my hair when I get all the split ends cut off?

Also, I tend to get blemishes and acne from simple things like gentle soaps or toothpaste. I change my pillowcase once every five days. I don't overwash my face and I try my best not to pick, but they still show up. In winter it gets worse what with the scarves covering your face and junk and the cold weather really seems to set it off by drying my skin.

I don't want to try random chemicals without knowing much about them, so any suggestions? Natural, sensitive skin things would be the best.

I sent away for it about a two months ago and have been using it for one and a half since the day I got it.

There are 3 steps total, plus I've got about 3 of their other products for moisturizing and oil suppression, thinking I'd give it a shot as my ""last ditch effort"" to get rid of this seemingly life-long plague.

I doubt anyone really knows I've got acne issues right now, because I mostly post about music and my Printables Shop, but it's true, and it's been driving me NUTS! I’m 24 now and I’m pretty sure PUBERTY is over for me, so my acne should be gone too. No one has had it this long or this bad in my family and I’m just sick of dreading people seeing my face without any cover-up on.

(WHO DECIDED, by the way, to have acne on the FACE of all places?? This is one of those things I’m going to bring up with God when I see him. Couldn’t he have put it on the feet or lower back – somewhere a little more discrete than the FACE? I mean would it have been that big a deal to put it somewhere else? Erg – enough ranting)

I've tried every ""drug store"" option I could find, and every ""natural healing"" method in the health section of the store. I've done the GAPS diet, meditation, EFT, Healing Code, and exercise. I've done everything I can think of, and my last effort was the dreaded, and seeming inevitable Proactiv. Well, I can't say I've had the best experience with it so far. It's downright depressing actually because I've fought so hard to get rid of it, and the best I can do is cover up with makeup, which is WAY more than I could say half a year ago… But that’s another story entirely.

I used proactiv exactly as instructed for about one and a half months now, with opposite results from what I was hoping for. Instead of getting better, I've got flaky, itchy, red skin. It slightly got better for about 2 days before getting worse, but it usually does that between those “times of the month"", so I can't say it's all that much of a surprise or even related to my using this stuff.

The worst part of it so far is when I use the ""Step 3 - Benzol Peroxide"" stuff on my face and it stings for the next hour or so. Allergic reaction much? I don't know for sure, but either way it's NOT working for me.

To say I'm disappointed is understating it. I will be returning the product for a refund, and going back to the drawing board. Bummer.

Anyway, about a year ago I was painting my nails and removing the polish very frequently, maybe about once every week.  Me not knowing anything about nail care I pretty much destroyed them. Part of the problem was an orange staining but that went away eventually.  On the nail of my ring finger I developed this very large white area that started at the very tip and extended halfway up my nail.  It was also very...sensitive almost, like when I pressed on it I could feel the sensation much more strongly on the area underneath the nail compared to my other nails.  I laid off the polish and hoped that it would just grow out eventually.  It's been a year and the white spot grows and decreases every so often and I've never been able to get rid of it.  Does anyone know what the problem is?  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated because I'd love to start taking good care of my hands now.

Here are some photos about the white area I'm talking about.  You can see the white spot is much larger than the actual white tip of the nail that I'm talking about.

I'm 21 and have had dark circles under my eyes since I became a teenager. I'm pretty sure it's hereditary as my father has some pretty bad ones too. Mine have always been only sort-of bad, I've always been able to cover them up fine with concealer.

However, in the past year, they've just become horrible. Concealer helps a little a guess, but it's still noticeable.
 Just recently I've developed a hollow look under my eyes as well. I'm not sure how to explain it other than that you can see the outline of my eye socket, especially when I turn my head to different angles. No makeup will cover this as you can still see the indentations of my socket no matter what color the skin is. 

I've been researching both of these problems and pretty much can't tell what will actually work. Has anyone had the same problems and found something that actually helps?

Currently I'm drinking 70+ ounces of water a day to try to cure myself, and rubbing prep h. under my eyes for the darkness.....

A live exchange is a place where you can bring all of your new and gently used beauty products and swap for things you actually want. Bought a foundation in the wrong color? Shirt a size too big? Conditioner too heavy for your hair? Polish too cool for your skintone? Swap it! These exchanges are mainly done online through websites such as MakeupAlley, but this causes a lot of worry about authenticity of traders and actual quality of products. At a live exchange, you can see the product for yourself.

We've also created a subreddit devoted to planning such events. Check it out! http://www.reddit.com/r/beautymeetup/

It's already pretty straight and a little bit past my shoulders. I don't have bangs, and it's really not layered enough to make a difference.

My current hairstyle repertoire is: straight, scrunched with spray gel, side fishtail braid, back french braid, and ponytail. My only two criteria are that my hair has to be off my face and I have to be able to do it with minimal help.

What is a good hair removal for upper lip hairs?  
I have super dark and thick hair, everywhere, head, legs, arms, face, lady areas, and even a damn happy trail. -.- (Italian) But my skin is so sensitive and pale. (Irish, Polish)  
I am afraid of going to a salon to get waxed because my skin freaks out to everything.  I have tried everything from Nair (bad idea) my skin did not appreciate that.  I have tried [Nads sensitive skin wax strips](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/nad's-facial-wax-strips/ID=prod6057887-product?ext=gooPersonal_Care_PLA_Waxing_Bleaches_ampersand_Depilatories_prod6057887_pla&amp;adtype={adtype}&amp;kpid=prod6057887&amp;sst=018e5e32-102d-b428-a35b-00005271a61a) and this caused redness and swelling, even though I held a cold wash cloth on the upper lip after.  Then after a day-ish little white bumps appear(like a tiny army of pimples going to battle), even when I don't wear makeup on my skin to let it heal after waxing it myself.  I have also shaved it... I did this throughout highschool and I haven't done this in a long time...  
I have resorted to plucking the dark hairs and letting the lighter hairs stay until they grow more.  This doesn't hurt that bad since I do it after I shower and exfoiailte my face.  But this isn't a good way because you can still see the ladystache. :(

Just wondering what people's thoughts are on eyebrow tinting?

Naturally I am a very dark blonde/mousey brunette but for about 7 years I have been dying my hair dark brown. I have hazel eyes so can pull it off, but my eyebrows are a medium brown colour. I'm considering having them tinted a shade or two darker so it matches my hair.

Has anyone had this done before? I know it usually lasts 4-6 weeks. I'm in Australia so if anyone can recommend any particular places that would be great. Most places I've checked out charge around $15-23 for eyebrow tinting.

I colored my hair with the red dye today, and in the ""virgin"" hair I really don't see a color difference, but the part that was bleached is really, really unnaturally red.  I know in a few days it will fade, but for the time being I'm embarrassed to leave the house.

* No breakouts

* Friendly with oily skin

* Product line with a range of SPF: 5-10 for me, 30 for my GF

* Price reasonable:  I saw a bunch of recommendations on here for goofy-ass concoctions costing $20-40 for a 1-2 oz bottle.  I'm not poor, but that's simply not gonna happen

* **Zinc Oxide - not sure how to feel about this**.  What are the ups and downs?

Add these moisturizing beauty tricks  to your daily routine to stave off dryness during the cold, dry winter months. 

Avoid hot water – Even though taking extended hot showers seems like a good idea when the mornings are frigid, the hotter the water the drier the skin and hair.Avoid using hot water directly on the face which can cause further dry patches. If possible shorten the duration of your shower and use warm, not hot water. 


Use sunscreen – If you are spending any time outside during the winter months your skin can experience burning from a combination of sun and wind. Use a sunscreen with plenty of moisturizing ingredients like shea butter to help act as a barrier from the elements. Don't forget that your hair needs protection too, before you blow dry, coat the ends of your locks with a serum or oil like Morrocan Oil.



Exfoliate – Using a gentle exfoliator a few times a week will help remove dry patches on the face and body while helping the skin absorb serums and moisturizers more readily. Try a microfiber cloth like the ones from Nufolia which can be used everyday if needed.



Amp up your moisturizer- Now is the time to switch to a heavier, richer formula that will keep skin hydrated longer. Reapply more often than normal, and be sure to use a night cream or a facial serum like Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery.



Use a humidifier – Indoor heating, especially overnight, can cause chapping of the skin and lips. If possible, use a humidifier while you sleep to put the lost moisture back in your skin.

Wear lipstick – Exfoliate lips and apply a lip balm before bed. Then reapply lip balm in the morning before applying lipstick. I love Dianne Brill because it’s loaded with vitamins and doesn’t feel dry on the lips.Whatever you do not wear long lasting formulas during dry winter months as they are actually formulated to dry the lips.

I am acne prone, but mostly of the blackhead/congested pore variety, and I don't get whiteheads very often so it's very obvious that it's the sunscreen component that's causing it. Here's a list of the ones I've tried:

A couple of other non-anti-aging Neutrogena ones for the face which I can't find online anymore

And the latest one: [Oil of Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle SPF 15](http://www.drugstore.com/olay-age-defying-anti-wrinkle-daily-spf-15-lotion/qxp163583?catid=100604), which I am super bummed about because I've only used it three times and was broken out within hours each time.

I've tried washing my face before applying, not washing my face, washing my face as soon as I get home from work...it doesn't seem to matter, I can actually feel the breakouts happening and the pimples are already there when I wash the sunscreen off.

Everyone I've talked to says try waxing. Well I have, 4 times now. All four times, despite following aftercare treatment instructions to a T, I have broken out with masses of ingrown hairs and a painful rash. The rash actually stays with me for a few months afterward, and causes even more embarrassment than the hair itself. I have tried 4 different professional salons, and bought creams and sprays and solutions for aftercare, and every time ends up the same. So I'm extremely reticent to try waxing again.

What I'm wondering is, do I have any other options that are a) fairly cost effective and b) easy on people who break out easily? B is by far the most important here. I just want to be able to show off my beach body without a bunch of back hair taking the focus away.

Anyone with GHD 5 do yours touch all the way down when hot?
Or just at the top like a less extreme chevron &lt;

Long ago I borrowed my friend ghd, probs mark 2 or 3 that long ago. 
They were perfect and I always said when I had the disposable income I would get my own ha!
Anyway last week I finally got some of the new GHD gold collection in pink (http://www.ghdhair.com/limited-edition-ghds/ghd-v-pink-diamond-styler) from the official site so I know not fake.

The plates don't touch apart from at the very end when cold, or even when heated up and left a few mins.
To get them to touch enough to straighten a thin section of hair you have to clamp really hard, then the hair snags at the top where the plates are forced too much together.

It only works with big sections of hair which doesn't straighten properly.

GHD support have been pretty useless at telling me if this is a fault, or by design and if by design how am I meant to use them?

I don't want to faff around returning and waiting for replacement if i find out they are all like this now.

I go back to school in about three weeks. Though I feel like I do not lack self-confidence, I definitely could have more. I feel with the right makeup tricks, some at home teeth whitening, and some general face and hair care, I could be truly as beautiful as I could be. 

I have always had barely any acne, with a pimple here or there, but my nose stays constantly covered in blackheads, and I have yet to find a good blackhead remover. I had an allergic reaction to ProActive (benzoyl peroxide), so I use Simple now, and it works really well, my pores are visibly smaller, but no luck with the blackheads. 
I have just recently started wearing sunscreen regularly.
My eyebrows are naturally REALLY thick, but I tweeze them down to what I believe is reasonable. 
I have a nose on the bigger side, so contouring tricks would be helpful.
As far as lifestyle, I eat relatively healthy and drink plenty of water; I could get more exercise, but I'm also not sedentary. 

Some specific requests, but anything is welcome:
•Contouring and highlighting for round faces
•At home teeth whitening (I will buy strips but prefer not to.)

I would straight my hair frequency, dress nicely, and does my make-up everyday for school until half an school year. I guess I just got off the track and stopped do my regular routines and went to my lazy side. I would tie my hair in ponytail and won't wear any make-up. I would come to school in my baggy sweater with t-shirt. 

I've been called an man because of the way I look without make-up. 

This is me being lazy without make-up- http://imgur.com/a/55J3z

This is me while I'm not lazy with make-up and hair-do (style)- http://imgur.com/a/vtJ8c

I don't want this to be my 4th year to be off the track. I do understand that I could be exhausted from gym/after school classes/school and I would appear next day being lazy but that doesn't mean I will be lazy for the rest of the year. I'm going to be senior this fall at my high school. I want to look amazing =) Any advices about how to stay on my beauty routine for rest of the year?

However, it's kind of pricey (well not really since a 4 oz jar lasts a while) and I heard there might be a cheaper alternative called Sweet Blessed Bee Magic Cream which almost the same thing.

There aren't many reviews for Sweet Blessed Bee Magic online except for Amazon. I don't want to waste money on a product that doesn't work as well.

Has anybody had any experience with both of these products?

After using it my roots turned a bright red, exactly the color i wanted, but my strands were still a dark brown only with red tints to it. Then i went and tried using one n' only color fix corrector to remove the unwanted permanent hair color (used only step one and 2 since i heard the processing lotion may darken the hair) and my hair turned a orange like brown color. I asked a cosmetologist for advice on preventing my hair from turning back to a darker color when i dye it the red i wanted to in the first place and her responce was to mix 20 volume with a little bit of conditioner and or water and apply and rinse.

What could be wrong and what should I do? I stopped using everything for a while but the acne came back and the skin felt quite well after exfoliation.
