Tomorrow morning (Saturday) around 10am PST I will post a thread regarding pick-up, and link it here. We will be doing pick ups all weekend with just a couple of breaks for us.**

**EDIT: Pick ups [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/15ad9r/5th_pickup_info_for_250_legendary_event_and_shiny/)**


--------------------------------------

Greetings, and Happy Holidays! In the spirit of the season, /u/Chill84, /u/Perhapsso, and myself have combined forces to put on a massive giveaway! We have about 250 legendaries, shinies, and events to give away! These have all been pokechecked and are not hacks or clones. Please read the instructions completely to ensure that this goes as smoothly as possible.

____________

**General Overview**

Here's a basic rundown of how this will work:

* Sign ups will run for a max of 3 days. Starting when this post goes up, and ending on Friday the 21st at 7pm [pacific,](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/) or when we run out of pokemon. Whichever comes first.

* Pick ups will be Saturday and Sunday the 22nd and 23rd. Anything not picked up by Sunday evening will be forfeited.

* On Saturday morning we will make a new post with a spreadsheet that lists who you are trading with. You will contact them before sunday evening for a pickup. This will be further detailed in the Saturday post.

* What you get will be random. The person trading with you will put up 3 random pokes, you can choose one of the three at that time.

* If you get something you didn't want, we highly encourage you to visit /r/pokemontrades and see if someone else might be willing to swap with you!

_____________________

**What we're giving out**

Here's pokecheck boxes with some of what we're offloading:

* [Box 1](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=2&amp;u=aunna)
* [Box 2](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=5&amp;u=chill84)
* [Box 3](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=27&amp;u=vegadoo)
* [Ribboned Event Album](http://imgur.com/a/0jioB)

(Note: This is in no particular order. Things will be given out randomly.)

(Note 2: Some of the shinies are RNG'd. This does not mean hacked or cloned. They are still unique and will pass any tournament checks.)
_________________________

**RULES**

* One per person.

* Include both things listed in the ""how to enter"" section.

* Don't ask for something specific.

* Anything not picked up by Sunday evening at 7pm [PST](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/) will be forfeited and saved for another giveaway. No exceptions, sorry.

_________________________

**HOW TO ENTER**

Leave a response to this post including BOTH the following things:

* Your Friend Code. FLAIR DOES NOT COUNT. This is incredibly important so we can have you already added ahead of time. We need the one off your Pal Pad in game, not the one from your DS.

* Share a story with us about Pokemon from your childhood. If you didn't play when you were little, what was your first experience with Pokemon?

I have the dream radar and already looking to give away some pokemon, not a lot but some, and I was wondering what everyone meant by the room. Is it one of the rooms in the pokemon center. I used to think it was through the IR but then I traded with one of my friends through that and it doesn't seem like the right thing because there is no room you just go to the trade menu. If someone could take the time and explain it thoroughly then I would be very happy. Looking forward to trading with people soon.

I just want to clarify on some rules that I see are not being followed.

&gt;Be reasonable. **We shouldn't see any requests for shinies, foreign dittos, or legendaries here.**

This rule is followed pretty well, though I do see the occasional person asking for a mew or foreign ditto  or something like that. The foreign dittos especially are being requested. If you see a post askinng for a shiny, foreign ditto, or legendary, please report it or send the mods a message with a link and *why the post is breaking the rules.*

&gt;Any true trades should be in /r/pokemontrades.

and 

&gt;If you are running a giveaway don't ask for anything in return, that defeats the purpose.

I see these a bit more than the rest. Please, please, please use /r/pokemontrades if you are going to want something in return. You'll both get a much fairer deal that way.

And the two rules I see broken the most that would make this subreddit infinitely easier to use and just make it look better over all.

&gt;Include in the title of every offer or request the generation game that you are trading on(4th or 5th).

and

&gt;*Also include in the title whether you are Looking for Something or Giving Away (LF or FT)

The rest of the rules are followed pretty well, but if you are new or have not seen the sidebar yet, please read it. Its a few base rules most of which were covered here.(The rest are important though)

Again, report anything breaking the rules using the report button or messaging the mods.
Thanks

If you made it down here, you are awesome :D

Edit: An example of a good title for asking 
&gt;[5th] LF: Mudkip! 

/u/dragsharder posted that. Thanks! Its perfect. Simple and conveys everything.

For giving away

&gt;[4th] Giveaway: Eevees

Thanks /u/ALXND3R for that post. Its perfect just like the last one.

BAD examples for asking (don't do this)

Going to school now, I'll be back at 4pm GMT until 11pm GMT
IMPORTANT: Everyone who see's this, add me on pal pad and then go into the wifi room. Odds are that I added you already, and then we can trade


Going to sleep soon, il try seeing if I can catch you.


im waiting
Iv added nearly all of you on my pal pad, iv got all 4 pages full. So now I'm just camping inside of the room. Make sure you add me first.


IMPORTANT: IM being overwhelmed with all these trades, It was my mistake to make the thread and watch the movie. So Iv reserved all the pokemons you want, and now im adding all your FC's. Im going to add all the Fc's right now, and then keep my wifi room open, and hopefully we will catch each other. Also you might need to remind me what pokemon I need to give you through the mic system on the DSi. Sorry bought this.


Hey guys and happy early Christmas. 

Im thinking of doing another giveaway, but it's really hard to do such big ones. This is a giveaway, so you are not forced to trade back good pokemon, but in the interest of future trades it would be great if you could trade back Exotic pokemon such as starter pokemon that I dont have. Also looking for a seviper!


IMPORTANT READ: All I ask for is a upvote, so more people can see this. Also every person is limited to 2 pokemon max if you are choosing from the 'x10' pokemon. If you want a 'x5' pokemomn, then your only allowed to have that. So to sum it all up ,you can either have 2 'x10' pokemons or 1 'x5' pokemon.
In the comments write the NUMBER of the pokemon you want, also tell me what time you want to have a appointment, times in GMT only please.



Here's the lineup for this giveaway:


Torchic x10: Each Torchic knows; Scratch and Growl.


Bulbasaur x11: Each Bulbasaur knows; Tackle and Petal Dance.


Squirtle x10: Each Squirtle knows; Tackle. Surf and Ice Beam.

Backstory: It took me 2 weeks to breed the first 50 pokemon, then I took a 1 week break. After the Break it took me 4  days to bread the next 51 pokemon. It was tough, and I had to stay up very late, I finshed of the breading today. Starting for 11 am to 2 PM. Then I ate, and started working on the document, which took 2 hours.

She's been training her pokemon and trading them up from game to game since she was in middle school. She has all the legendaries from every game, 25 shinies and all the starters from all the gens.

Yesterday she had her backpack her 3DS XL and copy of White 2 stolen, she had JUST moved all of her pokemon onto that game too. She cried for like 2 hours and a little bit more today. She had no friends in school and she spent all of her time in those games and now there all gone.

EDIT EDIT: Thanks to Minca94 We got alot of the team back but I still need a few more! thanks so much!



She still doesn't know that reddit is helping get everything back for her, She thinks im working on a card with her favorite pokemon and her team on it! So I got her to text me what her main team is, this is the exact text!

""I switched my team up sometimes. My team was shiny hydreigon, honchkrow, ~~Charazard~~, ~~Blastoise~~
Shiny ~~Ivysaur~~, Serperior, mew, tyranitar, blaziken, Shiny ~~Rapidash~~, ~~Perisan~~, Shiny volcarona, Shiny ~~zozoroark, there's too many! I switched up a lot so people couldn't find my weakness.

I recently picked up a used copy of HeartGold after finishing my Black run-through and decided to check out the previous owner's save file to see what he had. As you can see from the title of my post, it was the motherload. After transfering most of the good pokemon to my Black file, I realized that it felt kind of cheap to luck into all of these rare pokemon without really doing anything. So, my fellow traders, I'm offering them to you. Here is the list of all of the pokemon that I have. I'm not asking for anything in return, but there are a few pokemon that I'm looking for, so I'll leave a list below in case you want to help.

**edit: Since this is a big giveaway, its first come first serve. If someone below you asked for it, assume it's taken unless otherwise stated. Limit 3 per person**

**edit 2: Patience is much appreciated. This is a HUGE giveaway and I'm trying to get to everyone as fast as possible. Thanks so much!**

As the title suggest I'm giving away some shiny Pokemon to some lucky new trainers today. There's 17 shinies and 1 event. Now here's how it's going to work. 13 of these Pokemon are legit, 2 I'm not sure, and 3 I'm pretty sure they are hacked. 

Here's the list (All of them are shiny except for Celebi):

* ~~Mew (1), Nature: Timid. Level 30 http://i.imgur.com/BW7KAQk.png~~ 
2. ~~Celebi (2)(Gamestop Event) Nature: Modest. Level 50~~
3. Aerodactyl. (3) Nature: Hasty. Level 100
4. ~~Eevee, Sassy Nature, Level 1 (DWF)~~
5. ~~Eevee, Gentle Nature, Level 1 (DWF)~~
6. ~~Eevee, Modest Nature, Level 1 (DWF)~~
7. ~~Charmander, Modest Nature, Level 1 (Infected with PKRS)~~
8. ~~Ralts, Adamant Nature, Level 1. (Male) (DW)~~
9. ~~Ralts, Modest Nature, Level 1. (Female) DWF)~~
10. Ponyta, Adamant Nature, Level 1 (DWF)
11. ~~Riolu, Adamant Nature, Level 1 (DWF)~~
12. Absol, Adamant Nature, Level 1 (DW)
13. Azurill, Jolly Nature, Level 5

These 2 like I said, I'm not sure if they are legit.

* Mewtwo, Modest Nature, Level 70 (Infected with PKRS)
* Starmie, Modest Nature, Level 100
 
~~The last 3 are just level 1's shiny Staryus. If you want one just request it. You won't have to win if you want one.~~

I've always hated the first come, first serve concept so I'm making a game out of this. I have a list of my 15 favorite Pokemon and you have to guess one of them correctly to win. HOWEVER, the Pokemon listed from 1-3 you have guess the correct number of my list. So, if you want the Celebi; for example, you have to guess my 2nd favorite Pokemon. If you win 1 of the 3, but DO NOT want the Pokemon you won, just let me know and ask for something else, I'll gladly give you another Pokemon listed. If you guess, let's say, my 5th favorite Pokemon correct you can ask for anything other than 1-3. 

**You have 3 guess!**

**Let me save you the trouble, my 15 favorite Pokemon are NOT any of the Pokemon listed above. Best luck to you all!**

Edit: Totally forgot my FC. 1077-9912-8798

Edit2: **Since it wasn't very clear. It's not one of the Pokemon listed OR any of their evolutions.**

Edit3: I have to leave. I'll be back in 30-60 mins. ALL Staryus have been claimed! Guys please make all 3 guesses in 1 post, it'll make my life and yours easier!

Edit4: I'm back and ready to trade!

Edit5: **OKAY THIS IS TAKING TOO MUCH TIME. PLEASE PLEASE CTFL+F THE POKEMON YOU'RE GOING TO GUESS. IF YOU DO NOT AND GUESS A POKEMON THAT'S ALREADY BEEN GUESSED YOU WILL LOSE THE GUESS**

Edit6: **To the people that won and haven't claimed their Pokemon. You HAVE to pick it up by tonight OR PM me to let me know when you can pick it up. If you don't it will be given away by Midnight (Central Time) So you have 5 hours.**

Edit7: **IF ANY OF THE POKEMON ARE NOT LEGIT. PLEASE PM ME WITH PROOF AND I WILL MAKE UP FOR IT. SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.**

Edit8: **The Mewtwo and Starmie are now up for grabs. Just ask if you want it and it's yours.**

So far the Pokemon guess correctly:
1: Pichu
2. Kingdra
3. Bulbasaur
4. Scyther
5. Arcanine
6. Jirachi
7. Vulpix

Anything that wasn't picked up will just be used in a later giveaway. Thanks everyone, this went really smoothly and we enjoyed it a lot!**


----------------------------

Thanks for the stories everyone, we loved reading them! Now that signups are done, it's time to pick up your pokemon. Again, **please read the instructions very carefully** to ensure this goes as smoothly as possible!


You will have from when this post goes up until 7pm [Pacific](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/) Sunday evening to contact someone regarding pickup. No exceptions. We will try to finish remaining trades that have contacted us before taking off, but you must be ready to trade before 7. Obviously earlier is better if at all possible.

-------------------

**Step 1: Find who you are assigned to**

~~* Check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgDhiI0miLhcdEJBRFZYRkljcURLT0luNThUd2h4a3c#gid=0) for your reddit name. Ctrl-f is your friend. Also, please make sure the friend code by your name is correct.~~

~~* The colored name at the top of the column you are in is who you are trading with. Add the friend code up there. It should be /u/Aunna, /u/Chill84, /u/perhapsso, or /u/nbomber.~~

**Step 2: Contact**

~~* We will have some friend codes pre-added. Before trying to contact us, please check the wifi room. If you see your assigned person in there, you're good to go. Just skip down to the ""trading"" section. If not, please finish reading this section first. I believe perhapsso and chill84 already have everybody added, and I will be posting who I have added in the comments.~~

~~* It is your job to contact the person you are assigned to. You can send them a message directly from their user page linked above, or respond to a comment they made in this post. Don't just respond to the OP unless you are trading with Aunna, since it only messages her.~~

~~* When you contact them, please include the row number by your name to let them know who you are. This will speed things along since we added friend codes using numbers as names.~~

~~* Our online status will be posted in comments below. If you could throw an upvote at those for visibility, it would be appreciated. Our time zones are mostly [Central](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/central-time/) or [Pacific](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/), so please don't expect us to be around at 3 am.~~

~~* nbomber has graciously offered to assist us with distribution, but will have to leave before the giveaway is over. When he is out of time, we will assign his remaining trades to one of the other three. I'll post an announcement and update the spreadsheet at that time.~~ 

**Step 3: Trading**

~~* When we are ready to trade with you, please enter the wifi room, go to the computer, and select ""trade"".~~

~~* Please be patient and wait for us to try to connect to you. **Do not try to connect to us unless we have contacted you first.** Use the PC. We have a large amount of trades to do, so some patience is necessary.~~ 

~~* Please don't trade us eggs. A patrat is totally ok.~~

---------------------------

**Troubleshooting/Connection Problems**

* If the connection is saying ""Failed to respond"" please leave the trade room and re-enter. Upon re-entry, go back to the pc and select trade again. We may try to trade with someone else while we wait for you to re-enter. This is a common problem with the Nintendo wireless.

* If we leave the room without trading with you, we are either re-connecting or adding new friend codes. We didn't forget you, the nintendo wifi and pal pad limit of 32 people is just a hurdle.

* If you frequently Pokecheck things, please make sure you set your DNS to auto obtain. It still sometimes works with the pokecheck DNS, but it's a lot more likely to work right away with it set to auto.

* Still having problems? Try hopping into the chat linked in the sidebar of /r/pokemontrades. Chances are one or all of us will be hanging around there and it is much faster than reddit messages.

----------------------

Please remember that this is a random giveaway. You will be shown 3 pokemon and can pick from that, but we are not taking requests. If you don't like what you got, we highly encourage you to head over to /r/pokemontrades! We have deleted all the pokechecks so nothing should show up in the database twice.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**[ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER STATUS FIRST](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/home.twofiftyeight.com)**.

*I enter the GTS and nothing special happens.*

&gt; Make sure that you have edited the right connection number and that you saved your settings on the way out of the menu.  You can also try setting both your primary and secondary DNS to the distribution IP.

*I enter the GTS and get an error code.*

&gt; Make sure that the DNS address is correct.  If you are still getting an error, either post or PM me with the error code and I will try to help.

*Are these Pokemon legal/legit?*

&gt; Yes.  All distributed Pokemon are able to be used on WiFi and at any Nintendo sponsored VGC tournaments.  I have personally had the ""hack check"" ran on my RNG's by Nintendo officials on multiple occasions and have never had any issues.

*I missed last weeks distribution, what now?*

The rules are fairly simple, tell me your pokemon story!

Tell me a great story about pokemon and how it has impacted your life and why you deserve the one true dragon. I will pick the story that has the most upvotes using RES. The winner will not be publicly announced but rather contacted in private.

The contest will run to Saturday at 1 PM GMT.

EDIT:

I'd still like to hear from the mods so I know if this is okay?

Otherwise the giveaway is going on as planned.

**The rules are still the same but I have yet to see anyone answer both the questions, the one with how Pokemon impacted your life is fine, but I haven't seen anyone mention why they deserve the Rayquaza.**

Since I'm really bored, I wanted to start a ""Starter giveaway"". But you'll only get eggs. I'm not bored enough to also hatch them. But you won't get your favorite Starters that easy. You'll have to **choose** between 3 eggs. One will be the Starter you wished for, the other 2 will either be Rattata or Zubat. Your favorite PKMN, right?

Just post here if you're interested &amp; tell me which Starter you'd like to get.

Edit: I'll send you a message, as soon as I'm ready to trade/giveaway!


Edit2: Sorry to say this, but I'll have to limit your wishes to max. 3 **Starters a time**. It takes quite a bit to breed all of them. Especially a Zubat &amp; Rattata for every starter. Sorry!


Have a nice day.

Forgot to add: My ingame name is **Crial**!


EDIT4: I'll add pictures of my boxes as soon as I can so you have proof, that I actually have the starters.


EDIT5: Don't give me eggs please. D:


**The Giveaway will stop at 3 PM (CET+1), everyone who posted their wishes until then will get their pokemon!**


**IF YOU DON'T RESPOND 'TIL WEDNESDAY (05.08.) 18:00/6 PM (CET+1), YOU WON'T RECEIVE YOUR STARTER ANYMORE.**

PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR ANYTHING!


Ok so I'm restarting my pokemon white game for a nuzlocke run(because I'm probably not getting x and y when it comes out for I don't want to buy a 3DS just yet). I've collected quite a bit of pokemon and items on my trip through unova and I'm proud of my collection(although it's not every single pokemon). I don't just want to delete this game and get rid of them all. so here's what I'm going to do. on 1/14-1/16 I will be in my public library(which is the only place I can use the internet since ours is stupid) from probably noon to 5pm. If you want ANY of these pokemon or items just ask. If someone has already asked for it shucks for you. I will also be giving away my team if anyone wants that. Here are the pokemon I'm giving away(no levels or natures unless asked). Also I'm jst listing ones that are hard to get or impossible to get in either of the games(or its pre-evolved form needed a stone or something). if you need another pokemon that is not listed and I may have just ask.

MAJOR EDIT: LOOK FOR YOUR NAMES BESIDE THE POKEMON YOU HAVE ASKED FOR. IF IT IS THERE THEN IT IS YOURS TO GET IN TRADE. IF IT IS NOT AND SOMEONE ELSE'S IS THERE THAT MEANS THEY HAVE ASKED BEFORE YOU. SORRY AND HAVE A NICE DAY! ALSO IF I DID NOT SEE YOUR REQUESTS FOR POKEMON I'M SORRY. THERE WERE PRETTY MUCH WHAT FELT LIKE A HUNDRED APPEARING EVERY TIME I HIT THE MAIL THING. SO IF I DIDN'T SEE YOUR REQUEST I'M SORRY.

 The reason I made this sub is because Contests and Events tend to fall between a gap created by /r/Pokemontrades and /r/Pokemongiveaway so by having a place where contests etc can be - people can avoid breaking rules in either sub by giving away pokemon, but asking for something in return. 

 Events are fun. Contests are fun. Pokemon is fun, so why not?

 If this sounds like something you would be interested in - check us out over at /r/pokemoncontests and see what weekly, and daily contests are going on for chances at winning Pokemon you might not see here or in trades, and even your plain janes too! :) 

 **Edit(TL;DR of sorts) - New sub called /r/pokemoncontests that is where you should head if you are trying to create a contest/event to give away pokemon. Contests *can* include legendaries/shinies/foreign pokemon/IV bred pokemon, so the possibilities are endless for those willing to start events and for those taking part.**

 **Hacked Pokemon are NOT allowed in any fashion on this sub. Generated, Edited, and Pokecheck pokemon are NOT allowed in any fashion on this sub either. Sorry if this is a problem, it is probably not the sub community for you.**

 Thanks as always for being an awesome community and let's hope this makes us even stronger as a whole. Pokemon subs have only things to gain from the inclusion of subs like giveaways and contests.

 Boom.

 **Secondary Note: In case people are still curious about the sub, or worried about it taking away from this sub - please regard rules # 1 and 3 of this sub - in Contests those rules are satisfied so they need not be broken here. Just one of the many ways issues can be alleviated by allowing for there to be a place for things of this nature to happen. Hope people understand!

Okay, doing my second shiny giveaway that I had planned to do on Christmas (White 2 ended up forcing me to cancel that idea though). So! I will give away 30 (RNG) shiny Pokemon!

**Rule 1: No repeats!** If someone already asked for a shiny Charmander, unfortunately you'll have to ask for your 2nd favorite! This applies to anything in the evolution family.

**Rule 2: Also no repeats!** (on the receiving end) If I already traded you a shiny in the last giveaway, I'm sorry, but you can't get one this time! I may have giveaways in the future without this requirement.

**Rule 3: FCs!** I need to know that you've got 'em at the ready, so make sure they are either in your flair, or in your comment! Don't register the FC in my flair, since I will likely be transferring your Pokes to a different game before trading them to you!

**Rule 4:** No specifications other than species and gender will be guaranteed! Other preferences may be indulged, but this will only be at my convenience. Feel free to post 'em, though, and I'll try my best okay


In regard to timing: I will first get all the requests. All of them! I will then breed all the Pokemon. Again, all of them! And then I will alert whoever I'm trading each individual Pokemon to.

**Here's the rules**


1. There's **absolutely no reservations**, because some people reserves a Pokemon and then they don't pick it up, and other people miss the opportunity to get them. (If you really really really want a certain Pokemon and you happen to miss it, PM me and i might breed you one)


2.The Giveaway doesn't start until ~~1:00~~ 11:00 AM Mountain Time so don't freak out yet.


3.You may get up to ~~**3**~~ **5** starters per person (I will increase the amount if i have any left overs)


4.Since the giveaway doesn't start until 1:00 PM Mountain time, and I don't do any reservations, **starting now you may post** the pokemons you want, it's nature, gender and your FriendCode (**Must put FC in the comment**). What i will do is, starting at 1:00 PM i will start contacting the first 10 people that commented on the post, and if they don't response quick enough i will go to the next 10, to speed up the process.

Hopefully I will build up a reputation as one of reddit's most loved breeders.  
To begin this, I am announcing the rules and details of this **Xmas Eggstravaganza**   
**HERE IS MY FRIEND CODE BTW =&gt; 2795-8493-8495**

**NOTE A** - CHANGE OF RULES. This is necessary as my Pal Pad suddenly filled up and exploded. Please specify WHICH pokemon you want when you post. This way I add the users of the give aways of THAT hour. Thank you. 

**NOTE B** - Pause and rinse. In order to make sure that the eggs are with who they are supposed to be, I shall restart the Egg timer. I'll begin at 8am with **MORE BULBASAURS** tomorrow. More rules have been added so that everyone can enjoy and get your favorite pokemon better. Be sure to tell your friends. Thank you for your understanding.
 
**NOTE C** - It is getting harder for me to coordinate the eggs due to Family stuff and cooking for X-mas and all of that. I don't want to bother you thinking that I will give out eggs and then not show up. Are you ok if I move it to the 30th? We'll start at 8pm PST.   I also want to have a ""poll"" thread to know what's up with your eggs. Did you get a shiny? The correct Nature? Was your DW pokemon hatched WITHOUT the ability. This will help me in my feedback as I become **THE GREATEST BREEDER OF REDDIT**  

**NOTE D** - HOLY SHIT, I almost thought today was 29 and not 30;;; But I am here. I shall be adding the FCs of the people who want the pokemon per hour. This means that if you want a specific pokemon and you don't find yourself in -&gt; [THIS LIST HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArKCKvtoWSwEdFVxYWNpanpGbmZaaDg0eW1QRXpHcmc) &lt; - do please tell me. Stand by in 15 minutes to start with Bulbasaur and then Chikorita. 
*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*  
**HOW DOES THIS WORK?**

Starting ~~*today***TOMORROW**~~ **DEC 30, PROMISE!** at 8pm PST, I shall start breeding pokemon. Every hour, a specific type of egg will be given. If you want to get the 'egg' of the hour, just get inside the Wi-Fi room and you'll be given eggs.
There is a **LIMITED** amount of eggs, however, if proven to be successful, I shall make a second round **JAN 6**  

  
The cycle will go from Grass type starters to Water. This means that at 8pm I shall start with Bulbasaur eggs. Then, Chikorita, and so forth. Upon reaching the last pokemon per element, I will give away pokemon eggs breed with Hidden Habilities.   

    
  
v The cycle is as follows  V   
 
- Dec 30th  
[8 pm] Bulbasaur  
[9 pm] Chikorita  
[10 pm] Treeko  
[11 pm] Turtwig  
[12 am] Snivy  
[1 am] DW Riolu **AND** DW Elgyem

~*SLEEP*~  
  
- Dec 31st  
[8 am] Charmander  
[9 am] Cyndaquil  
[10 am] Torchic  
[11 am] Chimchar   
[12 pm] Tepig  
[1 pm] DW Vulpix **AND**  DW Drifloon
  
~*Resting and/or cleaning or something*~  

[3 pm] Squirtle  
[4 pm] Totodile  
[5 pm] Mudkip  
[6 pm] Piplup  
[7 pm] Oshawott  
[8 pm] DW Tentacool **AND** DW Poliwag    
   
**OH, BTW**   
On **JAN 1st** there will be a thread where you can give me your feedback on regarding to the event and the result of your hatched egg.   The link will be up as soon as the give away ends, so it might be as early as **DEC 31st*  


*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* 
  
**RULES**  
  
- You can get up to 3 eggs in this giveaway. However, you **cannot** get 3 of the same species. If you want to get another species, you **MUST** wait until the hour of that species begins.  
- When you post, **YOU MUST SPECIFY WHICH SPECIES YOU ARE GOING FOR**. This way it helps me breed the necessary eggs, keeps my Pal Pad from overflowing and everyone can get a chance for better things. Yes. This affects all trades starting from Chikorita and onwards.
- Any pokemon is fine. Won't judge you if you throw me Patrats or Rattatas.  
- The Starters have been breed with a **GERMAN DITTO** (I have a US cartridge). If the Matsuda method works in your favor, you *may* end up with a **SHINY** starter : D  
- I will fill my box with eggs. That means there will be **30** eggs of each species. If there's no more, **THERE IS NO MORE**.
- If you'd like to thank me with something, let it be Power items as I'm training teams : P ~~orthatelusiveShinyCharmtomakeMOARshinies~~
- I will keep track on each FC to see how many pokemon eggs you get. Any attempt to get more than 3, will have your name put in the naughty list.    
- **NEW** On regards to DW Pokemon, there will be 15 of each MAX. If I see more requests of one, I'll dedicate to breed that one instead.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**[ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER STATUS FIRST](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/home.twofiftyeight.com)**.

*I enter the GTS and nothing special happens.*

&gt; Make sure that you have edited the right connection number and that you saved your settings on the way out of the menu.  You can also try setting both your primary and secondary DNS to the distribution IP.

*I enter the GTS and get an error code.*

&gt; Make sure that the DNS address is correct.  If you are still getting an error, either post or PM me with the error code and I will try to help.

*Are these Pokemon legal/legit?*

&gt; Yes.  All distributed Pokemon are able to be used on WiFi and at any Nintendo sponsored VGC tournaments.  I have personally had the ""hack check"" ran on my RNG's by Nintendo officials on multiple occasions and have never had any issues.

*I missed last weeks distribution, what now?*

&gt; Download the .pkm file using the links above and use http://www.pokegts.us/ or [ir-gts-bw](http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/downloads/list) to transfer it to your game.

*The Pokemon I downloaded is fainted and has 0 for all its stats, is this some kind of cruel joke?*

&gt; You ~~didn't read the rules~~ forgot to make sure you had a full party before entering the GTS.

The bold Eevees would make good Vaporeon while the timid would be good Jolteon.

All of these shinies are legit. These are **not** clones or hacks. I use RNG to obtain them. Pokecheck only flags pokemon as RNG'd if they have four or more perfect IVs. 

------------------------------------------

**Important information:**

* **Post your FC in your reply or you will not be entered in contest. Flair does not count. I must see your FC in your reply!**

* At 3:00 PM [CST](http://www.happyzebra.com/timezones-worldclock/currentlocalusa.php) on Friday January 4^th I will stop accepting entries.

* Winners will be chosen at random.

* Winners will be posted in this thread around 5:00 PM [CST](http://www.happyzebra.com/timezones-worldclock/currentlocalusa.php) the same day. Winners will also receive a PM.

* Winners my choose their pokemon from the box. First come, first serve.

* If you win you have 7 days to collect your pokemon.

* If I get 50 entries I will add three random shinies to the box!

-------------------------------------

I have decided to not go with a theme for my shiny giveaways. It takes much less time for me to RNG six of the same pokemon than it does to do six different pokes.

Same deal goes as before though. Suggest a pokemon for next Fridays giveaway. **The first person to suggest the most popular** (according to upvotes and comments) **pokemon for next weeks giveaway will get an RNG'd shiny of that pokemon!**

Also, let me know if you guys prefer perfect IV'd shinies or if you like some random IVs better.

Please, upvote for visibility. I get no karma for this post.

**Mudkip will be next weeks shiny!** Don't forget to upvote comments that suggest shinies you would like to see next week!

I’d like to get in on this giveaway action. I am giving away one WIN2011 shiny Raikou and one GAMESTP shiny Suicune. Since they have classic ribbons, I can’t upload them to pokecheck, but I did a battle video, so their stats/info pages are [here](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=search&amp;vid=&amp;bid=67-49390-24481). Make of that what you will.

This’ll be a simple guess that pokemon contest, split between [r/pokemongiveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongiveaway) and [r/pokemoncontests](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemoncontests). I’ve picked two pokemon, one per subreddit, using a random number generator and you have to guess what they are. You get one guess per hour, per subreddit—as in, there must be an hour or more between each of your guesses on each subreddit. If you are the winner and have a previous post marked as less than an hour before your winning post, you will be disqualified and I will hold the contest again.

I will be giving out hints every hour on the hour.

For clarification: the pokemon you need to guess is different for each subreddit!

I will respond to you if you have gotten the correct pokemon. So don't think I'm ignoring y'all!

This post is for the Raikou. Head over to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonContests/comments/1btk3y/5th_beasts_event_contest/) for the Suicune! **Suicune has also been won.** Thank you all for a fantastic contest! Nobody ever expects these things to last as long as they do, haha. 

**HINTS**

HINT 1: It is not a fire type.

HINT 2: It is not a steel type.

HINT 3: It is not a flying type.

HINT 4: It is not a water type.

HINT 5: (I'm back!) It is not a rock type.

HINT 6: It is not a normal type.

HINT 7: It is not a fighting type.

HINT 8: It is not a ghost type.

HINT 9: It is not a bug type.

HINT 10: (Good morning!) It is not a psychic type.

HINT 11: It is not a dragon type.

HINT 12: It is not a poison type.

This means that this pokemon must be electric, grass, ice, ground, or dark type, or a combination of two of those.

Here are the rules:

1) You get one guess per hour, starting at 4pm EST.

2) I will post a clue every hour, but should I be late you can still guess. For example, if I don't post a clue until 5:10pm, you can guess again 5-5:10, but you don't get another guess at 5:10.

3) Do not comment on your thread or edit your comment to add a guess. Just post a new one.

4) If you guess twice in one hour, your banned for the hour. If you edit your comment, your out of the contest. If you misspelled a Pokemon, I should be able to tell what you meant. You can also comment bellow clarifying. But it should be close.

~~***Clue 1:*** This Pokemon is not a starter (or it's evolutions), legendary Pokemon (Phione will be counted as legendary for this giveaway), or Kabutops (the pokemon from my last giveaway).~~

So, I got an app that lets you choose anything about Pokemon.

-FC
-species of poké
-Nickname of poké
-shiny or not
-held item
-ability
-moveset
-iv's
-ev's (max of 255 in every stat)
-OT ID

-OT gender
-Poké's gender
-pokéball it was caught in
-where it was met

Post your FC in the comment.

If no one guesses right I'll go by whoever was the closest or has the funniest name.

Any form of one of my favorites counts.


My FC is 4814 3432 0852. All three will be RNGed to have near perfect iv's and a good nature. I'll also nickname them if you want too. I'm starting to RNG them now so it could take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours for each one so please be patient if I don't have it ready right away. I think that's all so good luck everyone!

Edit: All three have been guessed. The first one was Ninetales and the second is Flygon. The last one is Accelgor. Im in the process of rnging them now I'll contact the winners when I have them and post the pokechecks here.

I have a plethora of starters from all generations to giveaway, looking for a good home. I'll update this as I trade away but eggs can always be made (if you ask nicely!). All Pokemon are level 1, freshly hatched. My FC is **4728-5751-7710** . Let me know if you would like your starter to know any HM's. I will randomly add Pokemon to the Misc section, just for fun. **Please don't ask for ALL the starters, it takes a while to repopulate.**

**How To Trade**
It's pretty easy. You add each other's Friend Code to your pal pads (open your pal pad, click on [name]'s friend code) and go upstairs in the pokemon center. From there you talk to the lady in the middle and go into the wifi room. When you get inside you talk to your friend and start a trade. in there it says you can select three pokemon, but you can only TRADE one at a time. Select the Pokemon and click the pink pokeball and its easy from there =) You can pick from all your boxes so they don't need to be on your team.

Basic Rules:


* Be reasonable. We shouldn't really see any requests for shinies or event legendaries here.

* Stay classy. There is no reason for rudeness here.

* If you are running a giveaway don't ask for anything in return, that defeats the purpose.

* Any true trades should be in /r/pokemontrades.

* Any Giveaways of hacked Pokemon must state in the title that they are hacked.

* Include in the title of every offer or request the generation game that you are trading on(4th or 5th). 

I am sure that I have left somethings out but that is what is in place right now and all input is appreciated.

I want this to be a fairly easygoing reddit but rules will always be needed so if you think something needs to be addressed please make it known. I am well aware that changes or clarifications will be needed.

I feel a bit guilty for not being able to help people as much as I did before.

But, nonetheless, I will try to host a giveaway tomorrow for you guys, and I wanted to let everyone know so that they may have the opportunity to look for it. No matter what, it won't be hosted before 1 pm PST, and if it gets later than 7 pm PST, I probably will cancel it and wait until a later date. I will provide updates tomorrow on the status of it.

The giveaway will be in the same fashion as my previous one, split into four parts:

* Just like before, part one provides a giveaway on pokemon I have.

* Part two is mystery eggs.

* Part three is the same breeding offer for starters or Phione.

* Part four will be a question like before, but instead of winning a DWF Eevee like last time, it will be for a DWF Bagon!


Some pokemon in part one will include:

* More eevees (both DW and not, leftovers from last time.)

* DW Relicanths

* DW Pachirisu

* Regular Bagons

* Regular Abras

Edit: Between Summer work and watching my 5 month old brother, I don't have much time to keep breeding for a lot of DWF. Don't worry, I'll do my best in getting a few of each! Also, can I ask you to reserve **3** different Pokemon?

 I prefer a first-come-first serve basis, but I know some people can't be lucky enough to get on when I am. The date of the giveaway will be determined. Thank you!

Updated Edit: Based on the amount of Pokemon I'll need, I have some already complete. Hopefully I can hurry and get some of them fast. Most of the very popular ones will probably be last, so everyone is aware. As of tomorrow I will be breeding more Poliwag! If I can make it through Poliwag!

I'm a long time Reddit lurker and recently got back into Pokemon (after getting my Pikachu 3DS XL!). I finally decided to make a Reddit account after checking out /r/PokemonTrades and this sub reddit. I'm a long time Pokemon fan and so is my daughter as a result I own most of the U.S. releases for Pokemon. I am mostly sticking to W2 however, I play my B2 on occasion. I like to collect and battle for fun, I recently really started getting into EV/IV training and I'm starting to dabble in it a bit (working on a Scrafty!)

So, if you've read this far awesome! I'd like to offer any assistance with getting you guys any Pokemon that I can (excluding legendary, shiny, event, ETC) from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HG, SS, B/W or B/W 2. I took the time to learn how to use Pokecheck tonight so you can check the authenticity of any Pokemon if you have any questions about them, but most Pokemon would be caught in the wild then traded unless you needed a starter then I would hatch the egg. My starters don't really know any fancy moves other than moves learned from leveling as I only recently really got into breeding.

Any ways feel free to drop any requests and I will be happy to fulfill them as soon as I can. If you need Pokemon from R/S/E it might take a while depending on the time of day. I recently had to replace the batteries on those games and unfortunately each ones day/night cycle is really off from my PST time zone. 

EDIT: This is for 5th gen games mostly (I do have some left over eggs, etc in other gens)  as I have migrated most of my Pokemon from 3rd and 4th gen over to White 2.

EDIT 2: I'll check back on this thread as often as I can you can also PM me any requests.

EDIT 3: I'm usually on after 9 PM Pacific Standard Time if you don't catch me on during the day.

**This giveaway is over! Thanks to everyone who participated. Watch out for part 2**

This is my first giveaway and I wanted to do something that a lot of people would like! So I asked the community what they wanted to see RNGed, and I chose a few winners from those! The pokemon that won were: ~~Adamant~~ Jolly Technician Scythers (I screwed up on these so expect to see an adamant giveaway too), Any Natured Misdreaveus, Timid Eevee, and any natured Trapinches! All are **SHINY** with perfect IVs!

**What I have:** ~~4 Scythers~~, 3 Misdreaveus (Rash, Impish, Bashful), 3 Eevees, and ~~3 Trapinch~~ (Will be in part 2, could not get shiny for some reason).

**Now for the Rules:**

1. In order to receive a pokemon, you must guess one of my top 10 pokemon (Exact pokemon, no evolution lines).

2. You can only receive one pokemon, but are allowed **TWO** guesses. (If someone gets both guesses correct, I will just go down my list of favorite pokemon, IE, 11th will then be correct).

3. Post your friend code in your comment. It makes things a lot easier on me.

FC: 5329-9275-6023

All of the Scythers are gone! I have all misdreavus and 1 Eevee left.

If you guys have suggestions/themes for another giveaway leave them in the comments, and if I use that suggestion/idea you have a guaranteed pokemon I will RNG for you.

I will be checking and trying to respond to everybody about every 10 minutes. That's all! Hope you guys enjoy it! Upvote for visibility!

Watch out for Part 2, which will consist of the Adamant Scythers and the Trapinchs.

**Correct guesses:** Metagross (Dragoknight99), Alakazam (Squirtle_Squad97), Crobat (justpaul95), Dugtrio (ActionFilmsFan1995), Gallade (Chambeastly), Scizor (Pokiemonman), Luxray (LFRL1996), Empoleon and Starraptor (pol2412), Dewgong (myakyu). Since there was a both correct, Drapion was number 11, guessed by deadeyex15.

1. There is one pokemon in gen I left, and 2 in gen IV.

2. The types are water/ice, water/steel, and flying/normal

**I won't be giving ""one of each"".** You can select max. 3 Pokemon.

I'm not specifying how many Pokemon I have because I'm 99% sure I have enough, at least for this giveaway. (Except for Larvesta, Dratini and probably Sneasel)

I'll be doing the part 2 of this Giveaway on Sunday [In a better time, of course, adding DWF Abra, DWF Poliwag and probably other Pokemons (Hopefully I have enough time!!!)]

Hello! I have some shinies I don't need or want, and I figured I would make someone happy and give them away!

But, there is always a catch. Instead of you having to guess one of *my* favorite pokemon, I want you to tell me *your* favorites!

Here is how it works:

- **You submit your top three favorite pokemon, and if one of your favorites match any of my shinies (or it's evolutions), you can have it!**

(Just one hint: I don't have any starters or legendaries.)

I have 15 shinies, and some of them are of the same pokemon, so even if someone got your favorite already, it doesn't mean I don't have one for you as well. 

And once you win, I will show the pokecheck to assure you that they are legit.

I caught it last Friday in the Desert Resort whilst looking for a Moxie Sandile.

It's female, and Adamant natured. I'm not sure how its IVs are, but I haven't battled with it ever.

All you have to do to recieve the Sigilyph is to guess my favourite (non legendary) Pokémon. My favourite Pokémon is Zekrom- you just have to tell me what my favourite non-legendary is. If nobody is getting it, I'll start to give clues.

Second prize is a choice between the following shinies (I think they may be hacked or cloned as I got them online, which is why I'm making them the second place prize): Umbreon, Absol, Eevee, Bulbasaur, Squirtle. 

Third prize is Pokérus- along with an item of your choice!

You have three guesses. If you guess my favourite non-legend, you get first prize, if you guess my second favourite non-legend, you get second prize, and if you guess my third favourite non-legend, you get third prize!

OK, **Time to give some clues!**

**The three Pokémon are all from different generations.**

**Two of them share a type, but have a different secondary type. My favourite non legendary's secondary type is weak to my third favourite non-legendary's secondary type. They have the same primary type.**

For some reason, I got into my head I should try and get one too! Only, some weeks later, I realize I don't care enough for Phione or its shiny form. So, I have 40 (non-shiny) Phiones who need new homes!

[Here is the GTS box of them all](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=1&amp;u=nelleak).
Please name the one you want (yes, they all have individual names). They have varying natures, stats, and some have egg moves and others don't.

One per person, as I want as many people to have one as possible! And since this is a giveaway, there is no need to feel obligated to give something major in return. If you feel so inclined, feel free to ask because I do need to complete the Unova Dex still. But you're perfectly allowed give throwaways, in fact I encourage it.

Things I expect to see in your post:

* Name of the Phione you want

* Your FC, according to the game you're going to be trading with (if not listed in your flair)

* The name of your in-game Character (so I can make sure to give the right Phione to the right person)

* (Optional) The question of what I'd like in return

This giveaway ends when they're all gone! I need space for all the Charmanders I'm going to be breeding for my perfect shiny female. So, tell your friends!

**Disclaimer:** *Phiones are considered legendary, but they aren't that special since they are breedable. They also cannot evolve into Manaphy, no matter how hard you try. They are pretty useless, other than collecting for Dexes or gathering favorites.*

Check here for my online status: **Online** | *Offline* | *AFK*

*Phiones still available: Pharce, Phick, Phlight, Phlipper, Phyrr, Physe, and Pryd. Reservations not claimed after 12 hours will be void.*",,False,,t5_2ub11,1361906575.0,,,True,t3_19605m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/19605m/5th_phione_giveaway/,

I will be giving away ***1 LEGIT KELDEO***. I do not have a Pokecheck for it (as it has the ribbon), but I assure you that it is 100% legit. Here is how this will work.

-You may guess 2 Pokemon every hour as new clues are released. 

-I will release a clue every hour. 

-I will respond to you even if you are wrong. 

-Keep your guesses in the same thread. As I will be responding to you, reply to my comment after the first hour. This will make it easier to keep track of.

-***IF YOU GUESS MORE THAN TWO, YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED FOR THE HOUR. IF YOU EDIT YOUR COMMENT, YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED FOR THE WHOLE CONTEST.*** Even if there is a spelling mistake, simply comment on your original comment with the right spelling. It has to be close though, no ""I put Dito but meant to spell out Charizard"".

-If your FC is not in your flair, put it in the comment. Your guess will not be considered if you do not follow this. 

-Finally, I'm not going to tell you if your pokemon was already guess, use ctrl f to see.

I was planning on doing an RNG giveaway (I will RNG ~5-10 of ~3-5 different species) and was wondering what some favorites are. Whichever comments get the most upvotes/are most frequently posted will be the ones that I will do. Specify what you would like.

Ex: I would like a shiny bidoof with perfect IVs and an adamant nature (I mean, who wouldn't?). These need to be breedable, so no legendaries.

If you have posted one of the pokemon that I will be RNGing, you will get that RNGed pokemon. This will only be for the FIRST person to post the pokemon, so if you already saw the pokemon you want in the comments, don't bother posting it again. I have seen it once, I don't need to see it 25 more times.

I will leave this post up for 2 days (Until December 28, 2012, 11:35 EST), then start RNGing.

All of these pokemon are RNG'd. Some have egg moves, some have dream world abilities, some are just basic shinies. These are **not clones**.

Each pokemon has been given a number (1-6) according to how they appear in the box in the link above. I will draw names from one hat and a number from a second hat to determine who gets what.

**Important information:**

 * **Post your FC in your reply or you will not be entered in the drawing. Flair does not count. I must see your FC in your reply!**

 * At 3:00 PM [CST](http://www.happyzebra.com/timezones-worldclock/currentlocalusa.php) on Friday December 14th I will stop accepting entries.

 * Winners will be posted in this thread around 5:00 PM [CST](http://www.happyzebra.com/timezones-worldclock/currentlocalusa.php) the same day. Winners will also receive a PM.

 * If you win you have 7 days to collect your pokemon.

 * ~~If I get 50 entries I will add the fifth gen starters (all RNG'd) to the giveaway!~~ Fifth gen starters have been added to the box.

Please, feel free to **leave suggestions for themes for future giveaways**! If I use your suggestion for the next giveaway **you will be gifted an RNG'd pokemon of your choice**. If more than one person makes the same suggestion I will be going with the first person to suggest it. Don't be afraid to suggest something different!

Greetings, fellow trainers! So I ended up with too many legendaries for one giveaway this week, so in addition to the one I'm planning for this upcoming Thursday, here's another little one! There will be 10 Pokemon in this one. Please be sure to read the rules all the way through, and good luck!


**[Box of Giveaways](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=2&amp;u=aunna)**  (Checks will be deleted once the Pokemon is gone, and note that any held items have been removed)

**Here's how this will work: (All times are in [PST](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/))**

* For raffles, I will sort the thread by oldest, number the posts in the order I received them and run it through a random number generator.

* To enter the raffles, just leave a reply to the OP including your FC, and your favorite pokemon! Flair does not count, I will be bouncing between mobile and my pc. 

* You do not need to enter each raffle separately, extra entries will be ignored. I am limiting it to one win per person.

* Winners will get their choice from the box. However, I will not hold up everyone else for you to choose. If you are not around when you win, that is totally ok and I will hold something for up to a week, but each winner will be given the opportunity to pick out of the box right after they win. If you know you will be away from the computer a lot today, leave me an ordered list of 3-4 preferences with your entry.

* I often see people getting downvoted in giveaways, downvoting people will NOT help your chances. This will be based on sorting via time.

* Please do NOT trade me an egg when I give you your legendary. I don't want to hatch it.


**Schedule**

For review, the prizes that can be won here are:

**1st Place:** A 6 Pokemon, breedable, shiny dream team of your choosing!

**2nd Place:** 3 Shiny RNG Breedables of your choosing!

**3rd Place:** 1 Shiny RNG Breedable of your choosing!

**Bonus Prizes:** Shiny [Landorus](http://i.imgur.com/gpKQS.png) and Shiny [Volcarona](http://i.imgur.com/bBWJZ.png) 

Juubey from /r/shinypokemon will be helping me with these prizes! 



**RULES**

As I said in the announcement, this contest will require you to answer trivia questions to earn points. Point values for questions will fluxuate.  

The top 3 scorers will win the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place prizes respectively

New questions will appear every 10 minutes. **The Current question will be in bold** and ~~Previous questions will appear like this~~ 

I will keep track of the points in the main post.

**I WILL ONLY BE REPLYING TO THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED CORRECTLY FIRST**

 

**POSTING RULES**

1. You may only answer each question ONCE. **EDITING OR DELETING YOUR POST WILL DISQUALIFY YOUR GUESS.** 

2. **DO NOT** reply to your own comment to answer another question, create a new comment so I can be notified. I repeat, **DO NOT REPLY TO YOUR OWN COMMENT TO ANSWER A NEW QUESTION**

3. If you answered the previous question correctly first, you **MAY NOT** answer the next question. This is so 1 person can't monopolize the whole contest with their vast pokemon knowledge. **YOU CANNOT WIN POINTS TWO QUESTIONS IN A ROW** 

**EXAMPLE: Juubey answered the 1st question correctly and now cannot answer question 2. Juubey can however answer question 3, so on and so-forth**

 4.  **INCLUDE THE QUESTION NUMBER WITH YOUR ANSWER** IF we are on question 14, your post should look like: Q14- *Answer*

Also this should go without saying, but be civil and be a good sport.

In honor of these and the fact that this subreddit has been so awesome to me, I'm giving away starters from each gen. These are hatched (no eggs), and I'm limiting you to 3 per person. Also if you could live without nicknames that would be great. If your friend code is not in you flair, please put it in the post. Also don't forget to update your flair to reflect B2 and W2. I will be doing this for a couple of hours and picking it up again tomorrow. I'm also not breeding for natures, I'll post the natures I have but if I don't have what you want sorry. Also if possible (not a requirement) I would really love some Gen 2 pokemon, but like I said this is not required, I would give you starters even if you gave me 3 Pidove. Now here is what I have (6 of each):

~~-Bulbasaur: All males: Natures: Lax, Timid, Calm (Inferno), Quirky, Mild, and Rash~~

-Chikorita: All males: Sassy 2x, Gentle, Adamant, Lonely, and Jolly

-Treecko: 5 males: Natures: Serious, Modest, ~~Naive~~, Gentle, and Hardy. ~~Female: Calm (Snake)~~.

-Turtwig: All males: Natures: ~~Bashful~~, Serious 2x, Mild, Quiet, and Calm

-Snivy: All males: Natures: Relaxed, Lonely, Naughty, Calm, Bold, and Gentle.

In addition I will have a giveaway for a Phione, just guess a number between 1 and 151. Person who gets it wins (unless I gave it to you last night in the other giveaway contest).

Edit: Also I will contact you in the room.

Edit 2: Ok I'm  PAUSING  this to complete the trades already posted and to properly take off what isn't available anymore. I'll pick it up in a few minutes. 

Edit 3: Ok, I'm trading again.

Edit 4: Ok a lot of people are telling me to hold the pokemon. I will do this, but the pokemon must be traded by 9 pm Tuesday night (EST) or set to be traded at a set time.

Edit 5: Ok guys that's it for tonight. All trades stand and will be finished shortly, but no new ones will be taken until sometime tomorrow. 

Edit 6: A lot of people commented when the giveaway wasn't going on. As I stated I wasn't taking any new trades. I'll comment on each and see if they are online but I'm ignoring them unless I get a response from you, and people who comment now when the contest is open get priority. If I don't hear from you by a certain point I'm completely ignoring the request and you will have to post another. Also I'm trading again. 

Edit 7: I'll trade with anyone I'm talking to now but then I'm taking a break for a little bit. No new trades are being accepted at the moment. 

Edit 8: Ok, last call for pokemon. I'll be doing this for a little bit longer, but when I end it it's over.

Edit 9: It's over. Thanks everyone for participating! Enjoy the new pokemon games!",,True,,t5_2ub11,1349742628.0,,,True,t3_1142vv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/1142vv/5th_massive_starter_giveaway/,

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**[ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER STATUS FIRST](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/home.twofiftyeight.com)**.

*I enter the GTS and nothing special happens.*

&gt; Make sure that you have edited the right connection number and that you saved your settings on the way out of the menu.  You can also try setting both your primary and secondary DNS to the distribution IP.

*I enter the GTS and get an error code.*

&gt; Make sure that the DNS address is correct.  If you are still getting an error, either post or PM me with the error code and I will try to help.

*Are these Pokemon legal/legit?*

&gt; Yes.  All distributed Pokemon are able to be used on WiFi and at any Nintendo sponsored VGC tournaments.  I have personally had the ""hack check"" ran on my RNG's by Nintendo officials on multiple occasions and have never had any issues.

*I missed last weeks distribution, what now?*

I'm not someone that is very demanding for my birthday, so i usually end up with nothing. What i really love with birthdays is being surprised.

I don't care what it is, a Bidoof with a funny name, a Patrat holding a mail, an egg that i have no idea what it contains or your favorite pokemon named after you to give it some spotlight. I'll be making a wallpaper of the ones i get (If i get any) with their name stated if they're named something funny and mails included.  
It would really cheer me up today (Didn't get any presents, everyone on vacation, the waffle place i was going to closed, the friends that are still here going to meet up and roleplay and I'm not invited) since I'll most likely be playing all day, it'd be the perfect thing.

Hey guys! So it turns out my used HeartGold had a lot more to offer from its previous save file than I thought. No more legendaries unfortunately, but a bunch more starters, eeveelutions and more. It's on a first come first serve basis, so if you see that someone has already asked for a pokemon, assume that it is taken unless otherwise stated. I will be crossing off pokemon from the list as they are reserved so keep checking. Three per person, just like last time. My reference page is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/comments/1cmo35/benagain1s_reference/), and if you liked these giveaways I'd love if you could write me a reference!

This is my first time posting to this sub so sorry if I do not follow proper format/etiquette, also I have no giveaway/trade experience in B/W or B2/W2 so the first few traders may have to bear with me.

I ask only a few things from this giveaway: 

1 - I will be working on my making a living nationaldex and would like to try and make a friend or two so we can help each other out. If this sounds like you please let me know.

2 - There is a Meloetta whom seems to be an event Pokémon that I ask someone hold for me until I restart my game and can trade her back. I'm very nervous about trading it but I can't even think of just deleting it.

I and my Join Avenue thank you all.**

So I've spent the last few days trying to breed a Poliwag with Grass hidden power.  Today, I finally looked it up and learned that it's literally impossible to have a 31 Sp.Atk have a Grass hidden power.  So much wasted time.  However, you should be glad because you get to profit from my mistakes!  I also just have a few random DWF Dratinis sitting around, so you might as well take those too.

Things of note:

* The entire reason I'm breeding is because **I found out the mother Politoed (which I got from GTS) is a clone.** It bothers me, so I'm replacing her with her offspring.  If her offspring would bother you, don't request one of her children.
* The Poliwags are all Modest, level 1, DWF.  The only move they know is Water Sport (lol)
* The Poliwags have a guaranteed 31 Sp.Atk and *very* well IV'd parents; past that, I have zero knowledge of their IV's other than their hidden powers aren't Grass.  Who knows, you might have a monster coming your way.
* The Dratinis are all level 1 DWF's - 3 Milds, 1 Brave, 1 Lax, 1 Careful.  They all know ExtremeSpeed, but as females it can't be passed to a child.  I also do not know their IVs but chances are they're not bad.  If you want a Dratini, you can request the nature.

**One pokémon per person.  I also will not be reserving any for X amount of hours in the future, please try to be available reasonably soon after your request.**  I will keep the list as updated as I can.

Hello! I'm going to be giving away 10 RNGed shinies of the winners choice. These will be shiny and as close to perfect IVs as I can get.

How this giveaway is going to work:

Step 1: Everyone will post their FC, a number from 1-100 in the format 00XXX, and their favorite song with a link.

Step 2: Tomorrow, at 8 PM PST I will use Random.org to pick 10 numbers. I will contact the winners and then RNG the shiny of their request.

Step 3: I will give them the shiny and everyone will be happy!

**Tldr: Post FC, Number from 1-100 in format 00XXX and your favorite song with a link.**

Any breedable Pokemon of any given IV distribution, with egg moves (most are available, any that require TMs from Gen IV or the Battle Subway are only available at my discretion), shiny, of any given nature, with DW abilities available also at my discretion. These will be obtained via **RNG abuse**. If you disagree with RNG abuse, **do not apply**.

**RULES:**

* You **must** have given away, or at least offered, **3** Pokemon total. You can provide proof of this with links to either comments or threads you started. EDIT: You only need proof for the required number. (Giveaways of shiny or legendary Pokemon are equivalent to three ""regular"" Pokemon) This also should be a giveaway done on **this subreddit** specifically.

* You **must** provide your friend code if it isn't in your flair.

* Top **5** entrants will be chosen based on number of upvotes.

**ATTENTION:** Number of upvotes means exactly that, according to RES. **Downvotes don't help anyone**, so don't bother!

~~Entry will be closed on **October 18th, 12:00 AM UTC**. Anything submitted after that will not be eligible. Breeding will begin shortly thereafter with Pokemon being traded as soon as possible.

And during the contest I'll also be giving away a near perfect, shiny Landorus and Volcarona!!

New questions will appear on the main post every 10 minutes. I will be replying only to people who answer the question correctly first. 

The contest will take place on **Saturday, October the 13th at 5:00pm Central Standard Time (CST) and last until 8:00pm**, giving you 3 hours to accumulate points.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**[ALWAYS CHECK THE SERVER STATUS FIRST](http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/home.twofiftyeight.com)**.

*I enter the GTS and nothing special happens.*

&gt; Make sure that you have edited the right connection number and that you saved your settings on the way out of the menu.  You can also try setting both your primary and secondary DNS to the distribution IP.

*I enter the GTS and get an error code.*

&gt; Make sure that the DNS address is correct.  If you are still getting an error, either post or PM me with the error code and I will try to help.

*Are these Pokemon legal/legit?*

&gt; Yes.  All distributed Pokemon are able to be used on WiFi and at any Nintendo sponsored VGC tournaments.  I have personally had the ""hack check"" ran on my RNG's by Nintendo officials on multiple occasions and have never had any issues.

*I missed last weeks distribution, what now?*

&gt; Download the .pkm file using the links above and use http://www.pokegts.us/ or [ir-gts-bw](http://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/downloads/list) to transfer it to your game.

*The Pokemon I downloaded is fainted and has 0 for all its stats, is this some kind of cruel joke?*

&gt; You ~~didn't read the rules~~ forgot to make sure you had a full party before entering the GTS.  Drop your downloaded Pokemon off in the daycare or give it a rare candy and everything will be back to normal.",,True,,t5_2ub11,False,,,True,t3_znhrx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/znhrx/5th_rpokemonrng_week_14_giveaway_winner_meloetta/,

With the New Shiny Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina event just around the corner, people will undoubtedly need event checks. However, After Today's Event Checking Session with /u/MutantEnemy, He will be stepping down as an event checker for a while. He gave me his blessing to step in in his place. 

Unfortuntely, the mods of /r/pokemontrades have already spoken... They are banning me from posting Weekly Event Checks because I don't have a Cherish Ball Flair. It sucks, but I understand that they don't trust me just yet. However, I feel that there is a severe lack in opportunities to get people's pokemon checked. 

Although they are preventing me from making those posts, they acknowledge they can't control people PMing me for Event Checks. So spread the word to your buddies that I can help them if they need me. It also won't hurt to lobby on my behalf, if you feel inclined, to change their mind on letting me help give back to the community.

EDIT: Since Sneasel has been guessed, but not claimed, I will be giving it away to whoever can guess the random number I picked between 1 and 20. Good luck :)  **EDIT: You can guess every 5 minutes instead of every half hour!**

To commemorate the [Seven Deadly Sins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins#Historical_and_modern_definitions), I have RNG abused 7 perfect, shiny Pokémon that exemplify these vices.   

If you can guess one of the Pokémon I RNG'd, it’s yours!  

*****
Rules:  
 - You can only guess one Pokémon every half hour.  
 - You can only win one Pokémon per giveaway.  
 - If you are guessing again, make a new comment. If you edit or reply to your old one I might miss it.  
 - You have to guess the exact stage of evolution, so guessing Pikachu if the Pokémon was Pichu, won’t count.  
 - Don't delete your guess if it is wrong. This makes it easier to keep track of how long ago you last guessed.  
 - Hints will be added about every hour, if I think they are needed.  

*****
Hints:  
 - Each of the Pokémon deal with and have an ability that shows one of the Seven Deadly Sins.  
 - The Pokémon that represents pride has the hidden ability Justified.  
 - The Pokémon that represents envy has the hidden ability Cursed Body.

Hi, from my last giveaway, I had over 50 eggs from this subreddit. On another website I had to breed over 60 more, so it's still taking a while to finish it off. **Only Pokemon already reserved are being bred. Requests are over, and were over last Wednesday.** 

The following Pokemon you **reserved** are finished. 
Aipom, Roselia, Eevee, Cyndaquil, Phanpy, Shroomish, Growlithe, Magikarp, Feebas, Swinub, Pichu, and Poliwag^read-below.

These Pokemon below I'm still working on, either because they're extremely hard to get DW abilities for, or they're towards the bottom of my list. 

Natu (3 more left), Gligar (2), Snorunt (halfway done), Murkrow (2), Turtwig (4, working on soon), 3 each gender Nidoran. 

*I'm almost done, I'm so sorry for the wait but I've had a stressful weekend, one of my relatives has fallen sick and I have a little brother and a depressed mom to take care. I'm SO sorry for the delay in this giveaway guys, I've just had a rough week. Hope you can understand!*

I'm sorry for some of you Poliwag requesters, I've had a real hard time, breeding over 60 and only getting 3 lacking Swift Swim/Water absorb. I believe the first three people who requested Poliwag got their Pokemon (or is going to tonight). Sorry for the inconvenience.

Still have tons of Charmanders to give away**, haven't even given 1 box (30) away yet. 


Hey guys! So I got smart and decided to use an everstone to get that nature that everyone desires (for a Charmander at least). I've had to keep taking the Charizard out of the daycare to breed something for my dex, that is complete now, and the Charizard ended up forgetting key moves. So I've had to restart my shiny quest a few times. If anyone can guess how many eggs I've been through so far with this one Charmander, I'll give you a DWF *(either an Aerodactyl or a dream world ability Vulpix.) 

Now, the Charmanders know Outrage, Flamethrower, Overheat and Fire Blast. Ability is Blaze, all have 12 HP. I have 4 boxes filled, so there are plenty. 

I'll be here mostly all day, but I'll update the post when I'm available or not, and when the Charmanders run out (which they usually never do). **My friend code is 2624-0699-4118. Please try to PM me your friend code when you are ready to pick one up**, as it gets messy sometimes if there are a lot of people commenting and it will be easier for me to get back to you quickly.

HOW TO ENTER: So here's the deal, we wrote down all the pokemon we had and then wrote on a seperate piece of papers all the numbers until 450. Then we assigned each pokemon randomly a number. So to enter you will choose 2 (or 1) number(s) and we will tell you if you won. So in a way you dont know what your winning. Later on Il atach some images of the work we done, all on paper this time, unlike last time when I done it on Google Docs. Since Tommorow is Chistmas you dont need to go on today or tomorrow. Have a good Christmas.

Your post should look like this: Thanks for this giveaway, I choose numbers XYX and Number XXY. The numbers are from 1-450.

BackStory: So why I split it into to half's, 1 section is 'My Line up' and 1 section is my 'Cousins Lineup'. A big Thanks to my cousin for breeding 55 pokemon while I also bred 55 Pokemon.
We both stayed up until 3:20am at night, but my cousin stayed up until 4am at night. Also Thanks to everyone who participated in the last giveaway, some of the pokemons bred here are trades I got from the last. 

Here's a ambum: http://imgur.com/a/j6yqF#5

I'm offering anything breedable. If you need it I'll breed it. I'm not breeding for gender, nature or egg moves, just species. You can ask for something you are looking for and do it yourself. Don't want anything in return. Place your order in the comments. Don't ask for more than two at a time please. I make these to order so it may take some time depending on how busy I am. I work on a first come first served basis. If you feel the need to give me something in return then give me an egg and don't tell me what will hatch from it. I enjoy the intrigue. But this isn't necessary. Do NOT ask for Pokémon after I have closed the post, because you will just be wasting your time. I'm not waiting around forever to give out pokemon.

I am also available for helping with trade evolutions. You must provide the items wherever necessary and it will count as one of your two. If the pokemon you are evolving will learn moves upon evolving you must let me know which moves you want it to know and which to delete. Otherwise I will just ignore the new move.

If we miss each other tonight please PM me a good time to meet up.**

**EDIT: I'm going to sleep now will be up early tomorrow if you want to trade just PM me**

Title says most of it, I got the Dream Radar game on my 3DS and have been playing it almost everyday and accumulated a lot of Pokemon I just do not need.  Just look through this doc and PM me which one(s) you want. I have never really used a Google doc before but my hope is to be able to edit the spreadsheet and strike-through all of the taken pokes.

Most of them are level 5, the reasoning behind this is for some reason I wanted  to get as many level 5 legendaries as I could before beating a gym leader. (I have both versions so don’t think I waited weeks before I played the game) Don’t ask why I wanted them to be level five because I don't have a good answer besides I thought it would be cool and unique. The legendaries are not up for the giveaway but, if you're interested for whatever reason send me a PM. 

As of right now I think I’ll put an arbitrary limit of 2 Pokemon per person just so the trades do not take forever and everyone who wants one can have a chance. I am not looking to keep any of these so if I don’t get very many requests feel free to ask for more. 

This is a giveaway so I don’t need anything in particular but, If I had to make one requests it’s this. If you own Black version 1 please trade me from that version if its all the same to you. I have been trying to get a Join Avenue Dojo from Black version and have not had any luck.  Other than that just trade me whatever you want. 

**I plan to be mostly free all weekend starting today at 6 pm EST, so hit me up anytime or just come into the Wi-Fi room.** 

Limit of 2 Pokemon per trade, for now.

**Starts at 6 pm EST tonight**

Ends: Sunday or when they are all gone 

Edit: One thing I forgot to add, I can change Rotom into any of his forms for you before the trade. He also learns his signature move for that spec so let me know which of his moves is ok to delete as well.

Don't want anything in return. Place your order in the comments. Don't ask for more than three at a time please. I make these to order so it may take some time depending on how busy I am.

The 'mon are [Snorlax](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=detail&amp;uid=2072582) and [Rotom](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=detail&amp;uid=2072583).

**Here is what you gotta do:** I have assigned a number between 1-100 for each of the pokemon. All you have to do is write the name of the pokemon you want and a number. You can guess for both if you want. Also, include your FC in the comment. 

*ex: ''Snorlax [insert number], Rotom [insert number]; my FC is 5555-5555-5555''* 

**You are allowed to guess for each of the pokemon ONCE PER HOUR**, so come back after each hour, maybe one will be still unclaimed :) 

**Anyone who comments more than once in the same hour will be ignored.**

UPDATE: It's been 5 hours, start guessing again :)

**READ PLEASE:** Since it is taking so long, i'll give a hint: both numbers are **EVEN**. Good luck! **Snorlax was claimed, 44 :) NOT_WAVING_AT_YOU was the winner. There is still rotom, though :)**

**Rules:**

 Leave a comment with your choice!
 You must nickname the pokemon you choose!

**PUT YOUR FRIEND CODE IN YOUR GUESS OR I WILL NOT COUNT IT, EVEN IF IT IS IN YOUR FLAIR IT WILL NOT COUNT. I WILL NOT REPLY TO POSTS THAT BREAK THE RULES**

 Editing your guess will disqualify it!

**CLUES:**

1. In egg form, this pokemon takes 21 cycles to hatch
2. This is a mono-type pokemon.
3. This pokemon was used by a Gym Leader in the original pokemon anime.

I've been toying with the idea of a breedable giveaway, but I feel like I would be overwhelmed with requests and it would take more time and energy than I want to devote to it. So instead I want to try a sort-of limited giveaway. Here are the rules:

* The first 10 people to post will receive 1 of any breedable they want.
* Only ask for 1 pokemon per post.
* You can post again after you get your request, and once again after you get that, but that's it. (i.e. you can only get 3 total, tops.)
* You have 48 hours (even if that's passed the time the giveaway ends) to claim your pokemon after I confirm the offer. After that I'll release the pokemon and your spot goes to the next person in line.
* The giveaway ends after the 10th person or after 3 days.

This way I can make sure I'll be able to get to everyone and that it won't take forever. If it goes well, I'm going to do a lot more of these, just whenever I'm in a generous mood. Hopefully this will be something I can put up after dinner and be finished with before I go to bed.

So let the giveaway begin!

~~EDIT: I've got like 3 trades still pending, but otherwise, that's 10. I'll be closing this as soon as I complete them, but you can still post until I actually do.

1376338815.0,9,self.Pokemongiveaway,1k89il,[5th] ANOTHER CHLOMO GIVEAWAY!,10,1,309,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/1k89il/5th_another_chlomo_giveaway/,"Hey! I'm sorry for being fifteen or twenty minutes late, but I've finally got my internet working and I'm ready to start the giveaway!


Just like last time, this giveaway will happen in four parts:

* During the first part, I will be giving away some pokemon that I have.

* Once those pokemon are gone, I will be giving away five mystery eggs.

* Once those eggs are gone, I will be offering to breed any starter pokemon (or Zorua, or Phione) for the five people that post after the mystery eggs are distributed.

* And, at last, once all that is done, I will be giving away a DWF Bagon OR DWF Lapras to the person who can correctly answer the question that I put up.




Please read the rules carefully:

* Please **pay attention** to what part we are on! Do not ask for something in a part that we have not yet reached. I will be posting when one part is finished, when a certain part is going to start soon, and when a certain part has started. So, please look for those comments from me as well!

* Adding onto this, just because I say one part is finished, doesn't mean the next part is starting. Please wait until I announce that the next part is starting.

* Abbx will be modding this thread for me. So, if ever I am not able to get to your questions right away, he will do so in my place. Please listen to him just as you would listen to me for the giveaway.

* This should probably go without saying, but I'd appreciate it if you guys could be patient. Please do keep in mind that I am going to be tending to the needs of multiple winners. Adding onto this, I would also appreciate it if each of you didn't keep me waiting for a super long time, since others are waiting on me too.

* Read the limitations, please! In **part one** you may take as many pokemon as you want! So, there are no limits for part one! In the rest of the parts, you may only take one from each (ie; one mystery egg, or one breedable).

* If you do not specify what nature or gender of the pokemon that you want from the list, I will be giving you a random one. I don't want to have to wait for a lot of responses. :c

* You are allowed to participate in more than one part. So, any given user has the chance to get something all four times.

* Please do not ask for anything that is not being offered in the giveaway.

* I would also appreciate it if you only took pokemon that you will be using. If you want to take twenty Eevees for whatever unknown reason, I don't mind as long as you actually would like to use them. I would rather not see them used as fodder or merely released, but I suppose I can't stop you if that's what you intend to do. So, try to be considerate and don't take pokemon that you won't use; other people could love them too. One man's trash is another man's treasure, yes?

* Be nice to everyone! We're all friends here. I mean, what do you really have against anyone else?

* All accounts must be at least a month old. There is no multiaccounting allowed either.

* Those that abuse or disobey the rules to a significant level or a good number of times will be banned from the rest of the giveaway. Depending on the offense, I reserve the right to ban said person from all future giveaways.


**~~PART ONE POKEMON:~~ PART ONE IS OVER!** *These are the pokemon that are still reserved for people.*

* ~~Serious~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW EEVEE)

* ~~male; hardy; volt absorb (DW)~~ reserved for Shiny_Emboar (DW PACHIRISU)

• Is the ideal thing to have one player inactive and wait for the other to connect to them? (The ""X is busy"" thing)

• Is it more effective to have one player using the screens looking for a Trade, while the other will contact them?

EDIT 3: Closing for the night. It's getting late. I'll open again tomorrow afternoon (I'm 12 hours ahead of EST)

EDIT 4: I'm back and ready to give out pokemon again! :)

Disclaimer: I used pokemon from Pokecheck to breed some of these pokemon because I was lazy to really go full out for IV breeding. I only used pokemon that were legal according to pokecheck to breed though.

RULES: No reserving. I'll trade to the first person who meets me in the room. If I'm out of stock of a certain pokemon by the time I get to you, I'm sorry. If you want to trade with something on my list but I'm out of what you want, tell me and I'll breed it :).

So these are the Pokemon I have in stock:

3 X Rotom  
1 X DW Sigilyph  
5 X DWF Sigilyph  
10 X Impish Mudkips  
2 X Mudkip  
1 X DW Poochyena  
2 X Tepig  
3 X Impish Beldum  
2 X Adamant Machop  
1 X DWF Eevee

1 X Calm Eevee  
2 X Timid DWF Abra  
3 X Snivy  
1 X DWF Pichu  
1 X DW Pichu  
1 X Pichu  
3 X Chikorita  
1 X Totodile  
4 X DW Riolu  
1 X Torchic  
1 X Bulbasaur  
2 X Cyndaquil  
2 X Treecko  
1 X Charmander  
2 X Squirtle  
4 X DWF Murkrow  
1 X DW Murkrow  
2 X DW Porygon  
1 X DWF Munna  
1 X DWF Igglybuff   
1 X Chimchar 

DWF means Dream world female, DW means it's a male with the dream world ability. For pokemon with multiple variations, please state your preferred variation, or I'll pass you a random one. 

And because I don't want to make a separate post, I'm also looking for handouts. Specifically, I'm hoping some kind souls could pass me some of these pokemon (If you have any of these, I'll be willing to breed you a breedable or a DWF too):

DWF Sableye, DWF Bagon, DWF Tentacool, DWF Magikarp, (various other DWFs), Paras, Diglett, Mankey, Exeggcute, Rhyhorn, Spinarak, Hoppip, Snubull, Teddiursa, Slugma, Smeargle, Zigzagoon, Seedot, Makuhita, Electrike, Torkoal, Spinda, Kecleon, Chimecho, Snorunt, Burmy, Stunky, Voltorb.

You will be contacted by either Minca94, Kyser7513, or myself and we will give you an egg. When your egg hatches please come post what Pokemon you received. Whoever was given the correct egg will win a Mew.

**THREE** Mews are being given out today. I have a list of everyone who was signed up so please don't comment if you weren't given an egg, I will be checking to make sure those who post the correct Pokemon we're on the actual list.

Many of you were given an egg last night by Kyser, but Minca and I won't be able to give out eggs for a few hours, so please be patient. That's really all I've got for now. Good luck!

NOTE: This was the first of many giveaways, I'm going to try to do them every other month or so, so if you didn't win this time don't worry. More are to come!

EDIT: A few people have yet to claim their eggs, if they are unable to contact me by 11pm (EST) I will give their eggs away. We have had two winners so far, I've just been waiting for the third so I could contact them. I'm sorry the contest is taking so long.

**NOTES**

**Mightyena** appears twice in the database and could be a **clone**, or the first person to pokecheck it did not delete the pokecheck on it. I got it over the GTS so I have no idea where it originally came from. Because I do not know it's history I am treating it as a **clone**. Please, do not attempt to trade this on /r/pokemontrades as it may not be an original.

**Haxorus** can be caught in b2/w2 at level 60 after completing the national dex at the Nature Sanctuary. **However** this one does not appear to be the in game shiny Haxorus. This one was found/caught in Mistralton Cave at level 31(according to pokecheck).

**Dragonite** can be obtained in w2 as a shiny This Dragonite **is** an in game shiny.

**Gible** can be obtained in b2 as a shiny. This Gible **is** an in game shiny. Once it evolves the name will change to English (assuming you are playing an English game). This Gible is no longer holding an exp. share, therefore you will **not** receive an exp. share with this Gible.

Plus, a bonus shiny!",12,4,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/13xhyy/5th_international_beldum_giveaway_plus_a_bonus/,"So, this weekend I discovered this subreddit, and I decided to dedicate myself to giveaways because I love charity. On Monday I had a giveaway for 6 Litwicks for people to train into lovely Chandelures. During the downtime yesterday I had come up with a couple of ideas that I'm going to try out on everyone here, and I spent a lot of time trading for different Beldum. It was a lot of work. I spent like 10 hours straight searching around and trading. Scrafty for a Poliwhirl, Poliwhirl for a something, something for a whatever, whatever for an italian Beldum. That's right folks, international Beldum. The idea behind this is that it'll be better for all of you because while you're leveling it, you'll get a bonus 70% experience gain. That's significant. Toss a Lucky Egg on that, you'll be blasting through levels at 2.3 times normal experience rate. What you do with that is your decision really, it's level one with a wide open playing field for training. You can EV train the shit out of one, you can give it whatever you want, or you can just have a nice pokemon to throw in your lineup. **There's one Beldum from each non-US region available: Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and South Korea. Plus there's a bonus shiny Beldum, but since it's US, it won't get the boost unless you're from another region.** Since these are all from GTS, I can't be 100% sure of their legitimacy, but they all *look* legit to me.

__________________________

First person to claim one gets it. One Beldum per person. Put your friend code in your flair or in the comment for me, the number you want, and when you'll be ready to trade. Get a pokeball, catch a random throwaway pokemon in a bush nearby, and trade with me. **I'll give the Beldum I trade you an ultra ball to reimburse for the pokeball spent on the throwaway pokemon so that you have a 100% gain in the giveaway since nothing of value was lost.** Good luck, enjoy your Beldum, and grow him into a monstrous Metagross.

I know I just did a DW Eevee giveaway, but I had to breed more Eevees for people and I would love if these dearies could get a home! I mean, I have so many that you could practically drown me in a sea of Eevees and call me that old lady down the street who lives with her Eevees (I'm not old enough for that though, unfortunately). But, anyways, this was also a good opportunity for me to give other things to the community! This includes the other pokemon that I have listed, the mystery eggs, the starter breeding offer, and a DWF Eevee! And, don't worry guys. I promise I won't be giving out anymore Eevees (unless asked) for a LONGG time. I hope that relieves your nightmares. xD


* During the first part, I will be giving away some pokemon that I have.

* Once those pokemon are gone, I will be giving away five mystery eggs.

* Once those eggs are gone, I will be offering to breed any starter pokemon (or Phione) for the five people that post after the mystery eggs are distributed.

* And, at last, once all that is done, I will be giving away a DWF Eevee to the person who can correctly answer the question that I put up.


So, as stated before, this giveaway will be happening in four parts. Please read the rules carefully:

* Please **pay attention** to what part we are on! Do not ask for something in a part that we have not yet reached. I will be posting when one part is finished, when a certain part is going to start soon, and when a certain part has started. So, please look for those comments from me as well!

* Abbx will be modding this thread for me. So, if ever I am not able to get to your questions right away, he will do so in my place. Please listen to him just as you would listen to me for the giveaway.

* This should probably go without saying, but I'd appreciate it if you guys could be patient. Please do keep in mind that I am going to be tending to the needs of multiple winners. Adding onto this, I would also appreciate it if each of you didn't keep me waiting for a super long time, since others are waiting on me too.

* Read the limitations, please! In **part one** you may take as many Eevees as you'd like and one more pokemon from the list. In the rest of the parts, you may only take one from each (ie; one mystery egg, or one breedable).

* You are allowed to participate in more than one part. So, any given user has the chance to get something all four times.

* Please do not ask for anything that is not being offered in the giveaway.

* I would also appreciate it if you only took pokemon that you will be using. If you want to take twenty Eevees for whatever unknown reason, I don't mind as long as you actually would like to use them. I would rather not see them used as fodder or merely released, but I suppose I can't stop you if that's what you intend to do. So, try to be considerate and don't take pokemon that you won't use; other people could love them too. One man's trash is another man's treasure, yes?

* Be nice to everyone! We're all friends here. I mean, what do you really have against anyone else?

* Those that abuse or disobey the rules to a significant level or a good number of times will be banned from the rest of the giveaway. Depending on the offense, I reserve the right to ban said person from all future giveaways.


~~**PART ONE; POKEMON GIVEAWAY**~~
~~Here are the pokemon being listed and ready for adoption! I expect all of them (except the regular Eevees) to be taken before I proceed into part 2.

To make this post less long, I will be removing pokemon from the list as they are taken.~~

So, Porygon is a local favourite, then.  I'll remember that for next time, when I return to do a third giveaway, though with (I hope) additional varied options.  I'm going to take a break from watching the thread, though I'll check back in an hour or so for any additional requests.  Thanks for your time, folks.  Hope those who've received something, are pleased with their trade.**

Today, I have some Porygon, Bronzor, and Igglybuff up for grabs.  I ask for nothing in return, though if you're feeling generous, I wouldn't mind random Gen 1 or Gen 2 Pokémon.  Otherwise, whatever excess you can do without.

**Reminder: Please provide your Friend Code along with your request.  I am using my B2 FC.**

I was planning to make more available, but I might just conduct another giveaway later today.  I'll need to go over my DR 'mons and determine the next, my third batch.  My PC boxes need emptying...

As with before, I'll try to keep this thread updated with what was claimed, by whom, and whether or not the trade was completed.  If there is a claim without immediate trade, it'll be listed pending for - let's say - an hour or so, perhaps less.  Whichever works to give these 'mons a new home.  Additionally, if there is something preventing me from maintaining a presence here for longer than 10 minutes, I'll edit the topmost area of this post advising of any delays.  Because, reasons.

Also, all Pokémon are Lv40 unless otherwise stated.  And there will be a few.

(I'm also willing to gauge feedback for any particular preferences for DR Pokémon, from what's available.  Is there a non-Legendary you're wanting/needing?  For reference: [Dream Radar](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dream_Radar).)

This weeks contest is *Pokemon Survivor*.

 We have asked entrees to pick 1 pokemon, while following the rules, and use them to adapt to various weather/battle conditions that will be inflicted by the mod team over the next week. *Included in the rules is the fact that you* **CANNOT** *use legendary pokemon. You are also barred from editing your post in any way. If I see you delete your post multiple times to re-create it, you will be DQ. For more rules though, check the main thread @ PC.*

 Think of it as a story-telling competition, but with a bit more flair.

 The reward you may ask for such a task? That is simple.

 One of our incredible SurPRIZE boxes that contain 10 pokemon of varying nature and rarity - but in this contest - the box will *only* contain rare pokemon! No fodder here. 

 On top of the generous prize we are also offering even more rewards for players who go above and beyond to paint an incredible picture and story for the journey their pokemon will be going on.

 If it seems confusing, have questions, or are incredibly interested in taking part -  check out /r/pokemoncontests before 9PM EST tonight and enter, hit the Weekly #2 link to check for contest rules and regulations.

 As this contest is timed - it will be up to you to adapt and prepare for the dangers that lie ahead!! Good luck trainers!

2 guesses per hour, if you edit your post I'm disqualifying you, even if its for spelling mistakes. 

Enjoy this little mini giveaway! 

1st hint: one is a starters evolution

Edit: one is gone, time for another hint. 

Hint: two is not a starter, and is electric type.

Edit. Its still an electric type, but a user guessed extra so I'm switching out the electivire for another non starter electric. 

EDIT: someone deleted their posting and I don't know who, so now I don't know if someone is posting twice within an hour. If someone knows who do it let me know and I'll make sure they don't get anything. 

Edit: the third one is a fire type. 

EDIT: ONLY ONE IS LEFT. THE ELECTRIC HAS NOT BEEN GUESSED YET.

1360277925.0,8,self.Pokemongiveaway,183en2,"[5th] Contest: Shinies, Legendaries, EV'd pokemon (starts tomorrow)",8,0,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/183en2/5th_contest_shinies_legendaries_evd_pokemon/,"First of all, **please read the entire post before participating**! I will deduce points if you don't follow the rules or are trying to cheat somehow.

All times used here will be [GMT+1](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/europe/european-union/belgium/time/). It's now midnight here. Calculate yourself what that means for your timezone.

So, I'm holding a contest **tomorrow** where you can win some awesome prizes. You can win by answering questions that I will post from time to time.

As said, the contest will start tomorrow, when I get up. You may expect the first question around 9am and is planned to end at 6pm (might end sooner but that's the target time for the time being). I will update the post with a new question every other hour. So there should be 10 questions. These questions will involve general pokemon knowledge, but may also involve poking around reddit for the answer. I will provide hints to set you on the right path if I deem it necessary.

**How to enter?** Just post in this thread that you want to enter, along with your FC (unless it's in your flair). If you answer questions without entering, you're just wasting your time.

**How to answer questions?** Send a private message to me with as title *Contest - Question n* (with 'n' the number of the question) and in the text only the answer. The only exception is that along with your first answer you send in a heartwarming story about pokemon. If you can't think of something, just tell me an awesome battle you had or just think of something. Extra points can be won here so don't be to quick to dismiss this part.

If you answer in this thread, you're out. Everyone has to get a chance to answer.

**How to get points?** The first to answer correctly gets 10 points. If you answer within the first 10 minutes after the first correct answer was given to me, you get 6 points. If you answer after that but before the next question is asked, you get 3 points. If you answer after the next question is asked, you still get 1 point. After a while, I will put the answer in the thread. Obviously, you can't get points for it then. I won't tell you if you're right or wrong and I won't put a score bord up, just to keep in the suspence ;)

**What can I win?** 

The person with the highest score gets my RNG services: you can request any three breedables to your specifications (shiny, IV's, egg moves, ability,...).

Second prize is [this RNG'd (non-shiny) fully EV-trained DWF Bagon](http://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=3355659) (it has 2 extra EV's in attack than the pokecheck says). I have one myself and I assure you: it fucks things up.

Third prize is a pick from any one of [these legendaries](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=7&amp;u=rbhfd). 

As a runner-up prize, I will randomly pick someone from the contestants and they will get this [RNG'd (non-shiny) Larvitar](http://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=3229055). So if you only see this post a couple of hours before the contest ends, you can still enter to try and win this badass motherfocker.

That's about it, I think. Let the entering begin! I hope everyone has as much fun as I hope to have.

~~**Question 1**~~ - What were the first games released in each generation and in what year were they released (in Japan)? I'm only asking for the first games of each generation, no sequels or remakes! I'm only asking for games on gameboy (or sequel handheld consoles) and not spin-off games. So not, for example Mystery Dungeon or XD.

***Answer question 1:*** can be found [here](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Games). You can now no longer answer question 1.

**~~Question 2~~** - What's my favorite pokémon? I'm not asking you to start guessing randomly, as you only get one shot. There are ways to find out!

***Answer question 2:*** My favorite pokémon is indeed Umbreon. You could deduced this, among others from my flair on r/pokemon. I did award some points for Tyranitar because that was my first shiny and I really like it as well.

~~**Question 3**~~ - About 3-4 months ago, a user gave away his *RNG services* on this subreddit. He did this very regulary, including one big contest where you can win your dream team. This was before I could RNG myself and I participated in this contests and other of his giveaways. I'm very grateful to him and his giveaways/contests inspired me to do this one. What was the name of this user?

***Answer question 3:*** That awesome user was OrganicOrganics

**Question 4** - This isn't really a question, more a creativity test. Write your own story line for a pokemon game. You can inspire your story line on the upcoming X &amp; Y games, but this doesn't have to be. You can write prequels/sequels, spin-offs,... I will award points based on originality, whether I would play the game,... with a maximum of 15 points. Since this isn't a real question and I want to award people that put time in to it, all posts will be judged equally, independent of the time of submission. You have time until 5 pm to write this.

~~**Question 5**~~ - I'm not much of a book reader, but the last couple of months I did find the time, despite school work and pokemon, to read a series of books. They're amazing and would like to recommend them to anyone. I'm looking for the name of the serie, not any of the books. [Hint](http://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=2392209).

***Answer question 5:*** The series is called *A song of Ice and Fire*. And not Game of Thrones, that's just the first book.

~~**Question 6**~~ - I'm still a student. In July, I will get my masters degree though and I'm hoping to start my PhD next year. In what field would this be. Hint: I frequent other subreddits than the ones about pokemon (although those are the ones I visit most).

***Answer question 6:*** I'm now studying mathematics, but I have a broad interest in physics (aspecially astronomy) and hope to do something in that direction.

~~**Question 7**~~ - I used another awesome pokemon I RNG'd for myself. It's adamant and knows Close Combat, Bullet Punch, Swords Dance and Extreem Speed. It evolved rather quickly because it was holding a Soothe Bell when I was training it. Send me a picture of this awesome, **yellow** pokemon!

***Answer question 7:*** [here](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/0/03/Spr_5b_448_s.png).

~~**Question 8**~~ - I mentioned earlier that Tyranitar (in my White game) was my first shiny. This isn't however exactly true, though everyone will understand why I don't think it counts. What was my REAL first shiny (and probably of 83% of the people on this subreddit)?

***Answer question 8:*** Obviously, Red Gyarados was my first shiny, back on Silver. I had no idea at the time, since I just had a Gameboy, not Color.

~~**Question 9**~~ - What country am I from. I have stated it in some of my posts, but I don't expect you to look in my comment history. There might just be a hint in this thread.

***Answer question 9:*** As you could see from the link that says at which time zone I'm in, I'm from Belgium.

~~**Question 10**~~ (last question) - An easy one to finish, name all pokemon types in alphabetic order. I'll start you off: *Bug,...*

***Answer question 10:*** Bug, Dark, Dragon, Electric, Fighting, Fire, Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ground, Ice, Normal, Poison, Psychic, Rock, Steel, and Water

You have time until 7pm to answer. After that, I'll announce the winner!

I've been breeding Heracross for desired IVs and I've finally got one that I think I'm going to stick with. I now find myself with nearly 2 boxes of Heracross, about half of which have the DW ability Moxie. 

Each of these has a speed IV of 31, and most of them have 1 or 2 additional IVs at 31 (mostly hp/attack/defense; and one has a 31 SpDef for some reason). I don't know the exact spread, I only checked them with the guy in Gear Station to see which were 31s - but most of them were judged as ""above average"" or ""relatively superior"", and a few were ""outstanding"".

So here they are, by gender and ability:

Swarm M: Adamant#, Quirky, Mild, Relaxed, Relaxed, Quiet, Jolly

Swarm F: Impish, Gentle, Hardy, Bashful, Naive

Guts M: Bold, Brave, ~~Adamant,~~ Relaxed, Mild, ~~Hasty~~

Guts F: ~~Modest~~, Serious, ~~Impish~~, Lonely, Quirky, Timid

Moxie (DW) M: ~~Naive, Relaxed,~~ Impish#, Bold, Hardy, ~~Bold, Jolly#~~, Serious, Quiet, Bold, Relaxed, Bold, Serious, Relaxed, Docile, Naive

Moxie (DW) F: ~~Careful, Rash, Bold, Careful, Jolly, Relaxed, Lax#, Lax#, Bashful, Sassy, Naive,~~ Lax, Lax, ~~Hasty, Calm, Lax~~

I'll be available for the next hour or so to hand them out, and if demand is high I can come back later to distribute some more.

*edit*: Alright it's been around 90 minutes, I'm taking off for now. If anyone is still interested, post here or PM and we can figure out a time to trade later

*edit #2*: I'm back after about 3 hours. Will be going through these for another hour or maybe a little more. Specific requests will be granted in the order received

*edit #3* it's too late for me on a Monday night, need to go again. DWFs are pretty much all reserved/gone. I see a few unanswered requests left, I will try to get to you folks at some point in the next day or two. If I have no additional response in the next 8 hours or so from people who have reserved specific Heracross, I may free them back up to the public

*Final edit* I need to be done with this giveaway unfortunately. I will do my best to honor what has already been requested. I am freeing up a few of these from reserve, due to people who have not responded in a timely manner. I'm trying to be very fair about giving these out as requested, but I also need to consider time spent on this.

So I've had a fantastic day, and want to spread the joy a bit with a giveaway of some of my spare legendaries. For now, I've got 5 that I will be giving away, though I'll probably do another with more older gen Pokemon next week.

[Box of Giveaways](http://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=2&amp;u=aunna)  (Checks will be deleted once the Pokemon is gone)

**Here's how this will work: (All times are in [PST](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/))**

* For raffles, I will sort the thread by oldest, number the posts in the order I received them and run it through a random number generator.

* I often see people getting downvoted in giveaways, downvoting people will NOT help your chances. This will be based on sorting via new.

* To enter the raffles, just leave a reply to the OP including your FC. You do not need to enter each one separately, extra entries will be ignored. I am limiting it to one win per person.


**Schedule**

~~2:00 - Raffle, Winner can pick 1 from the box, excluding Moltres.~~

~~3:00 - I will post a reply to this thread, first response to that gets to pick 1 from the box, excluding Moltres.~~

~~4:00 - Raffle, same deal as before.~~

~~5:00 - I will post a reply to the thread again, first response gets whatever is left in the box, other than Moltres.~~

~~6:00 - Raffle for Moltres.~~

**Winners**

2:00 - Chill84  - Latios

3:00 - Okami117 - Zekrom

4:00 - GraduationFace - Registeel

5:00 - Pokeemon - Regice

Alright so I just learned to RNG and wanted to make this a little fun! I have an RNG'd pokemon that I would like to giveaway ((Shiny :3)) and I'd like to make it into a contest! :D

((got this idea from another thread))

I will be giving some clues, and whoever answers correctly will win this shiny. All of the clues are hints to what this shiny Pokemon is.

**Rules**

1. You may only guess once until another clue has been revealed (then you may have one more guess) and so on.

2. You must nickname your guess. If you think my clues are about charmander, your answer would be ""Charlie the Charmander!""

3. **Put your FC in your comment. If it is in your flair, I will not see it and you will NOT win**

4. Please be courteous :) I do not have to do this, and won't do it again if there is any animosity within the comments. ((I hope to do this fairly often))

***Clues will be revealed once every hour until a winner has been found***

**Clues**

1. This pokemon is has 4 different weaknesses

2. This pokemon is under 6 feet tall

3. *To be revealed at 6:20 CST*

4. *To be revealed at 7:20 CST*

5. *To be revealed at 8:20 CST*

I will delete the post when a winner is chosen. Good luck!!!

Hey guys as we're all aware that mega-evolutions have been released I thought ""why not make a giveaway that involves some pre-evolutions of those pokemon.""

*****
__Rules:__

- You __MUST__ have a valid [/r/Poketradereference](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/) page up
- RNG Bred starters will be given to the first 3 people to enter __AND__ successfully guess one of my 3 favorite animals excluding Octopi.
- General name counts for this guess, for example you don't need to enter:  Common batagur, turtle will suffice for you overachievers!
- Entries must be submitted through the following form listed below. 
- Submitting multiple entries will result in a disqualification. 
- If you win a starter you cannot also win a Litwick. 
- Giveaway ends on Sunday 11:00pm EST, get your entry in before then!

__Pokemon__

- Shiny Modest [Charmander](https://www.pokecheck.org/?pk=5321189)

*****
__Clues and Hints__

Just so we're clear, __NONE__ of the favorite animals is an ""Octopus"", I don't want to see anyone guessing that...

- ~~My ""Order"" name is also the basis for a popular color with a similar name used in Greco-Roman times.... (Think Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Superorder, __Order__)~~
- ~~My kind can be found on all major continents except Antarctica. Most of my kind can glow under exposure to some UV light.~~
- ~~There's a certain new (Gen 6) pokemon whose name shows its relation to me, it's real life counter-part.~~
- __UPDATE__ All Starters have been guessed at this point. However if you haven't entered still do just in case someone cannot get their Starter and also for the Litwick drawing. Not much time left folks!!!

I tried this before, but didn't have enough time to fully commit to it, so it got down voted to oblivion (or for whatever reason down-voters do what they do).

First person to name my favorite starter gets the choice of either a DWF Mawile **OR** a DWF Sneasel (plus an Eevee if requested).

First Person to name my favorite **Generation 5** Legend gets only the Sneasel (and the Eevee if requested).

You **CAN** try to guess both, but there's one guess per 30 minutes! **That means you can't guess both in one comment.** Let's keep it classy.

Natures:

* ~~Bashful~~
* ~~Hasty~~
* ~~Mild~~
* ~~Careful~~
* ~~Hardy~~
* ~~Rash (x2)~~
* ~~Lax~~

Please indicate which nature you want. If you don't have a preference, I'll save you for last, and you get the natures that are left over.

1373168789.0,7,self.Pokemongiveaway,1hsafo,"[5th] Mendanbar22’s Weekly Summer RNG’d Pokémon Giveaway: 'Murica vs. Canada, eh?",7,0,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemongiveaway/comments/1hsafo/5th_mendanbar22s_weekly_summer_rngd_pokémon/,"All the Pokémon have been given away! Thanks to everyone who participated! Keep an eye out for next week’s giveaway!  

*****
To celebrate the two patriotic holidays of this past week, I have RNG abused 4 perfect, shiny Pokémon that remind me of the United States and Canada.  

If you can guess one of the Pokémon I RNG'd, it’s yours!  

*****
Because I only had time to RNG abuse 4 Pokémon for this week's giveaway, I am also giving away some shiny Pokémon from trading that didn't turn out quite as perfect as I had hoped. [Here they are!](https://www.pokecheck.org/?p=box&amp;bid=9&amp;u=mndanbar) In order to win one of them, you have to guess the random number between 1 and 25 I assigned to it. Good luck!  

*****
Rules:  
 - You can guess one Pokémon and one number between 1 and 25 once every half hour.  
 - You can only win one Pokémon per giveaway, unless you guess a correct Pokémon and number at the same time.  
 - If you are guessing for the second time make a new comment, if you edit or reply to your old one I might miss it.  
 - You have to guess the exact stage of evolution, so guessing Pikachu if the Pokémon was Pichu, won’t count.  
 - Please don't delete your guess if it is wrong. This makes it easier to keep track of how long ago you last guessed.
 - Hints will be added every hour, if I think they are needed.  

*****
Hints:  
- All of the Pokémon remind me of either the United States of America or Canada.  

*****
Winners:  
 - /u/Lucifiaro won Braviary, but decided to take Trapinch!  
 - /u/A_O_A_B won Snorlax!  
 - /u/PokeMaverick won Bibarel, but decided to take Heracross!  
 - /u/cerulean_octopus2 won Bibarel with the number 4!  
 - /u/pokeyman71 won Abomasnow!  
 - /u/ihavethekey5 won Eevee with the number 2!  
 - /u/trettet won Rufflet with the number 19!

*****
If you can think of another theme (like *Murica vs. Canada, eh?* or last week's *Circle of Life*) that you would like to see in next week’s (or the week after's) giveaway, send me a PM with the idea and the Pokémon to be RNG’d. If I decide to use it, I’ll give you an RNG’d breedable Pokémon of your choice! If you have any other suggestions or things I should do differently next time, you should send me a PM or tell me in the comments.  

To everyone who sent me a PM about a future theme last week, I read and enjoyed all the ideas you guys had, but because of a chaotic and stressful week I didn't have time to respond to everyone. Thank you for understanding :)

Also, thanks to /u/zfriderici and /u/dabilahro whose ideas led to this week's theme.

So I've recently had the wonderful luck of getting 

Bulbusaur! Squirtle! &amp; Charmander!

and I've begun breeding them, collecting eggs, and
slowly hatching. 

Well, I'd hate to take on this project alone, So I figured
I would be willing to hand one of the three starters off, 
to three random people, give me the reason why you want the
starter, and I will respond back to you.


If you happen to be just in Desperate need of one of these as well, I'm also willing to hatch more eggs of any of the three, for any first gen or second gen Pokemon. So if you REALLY do want one of these, and don't want it to be just a 'random draw of luck' for me to give you one, just offer me something, as I'll be breeding all day, and some people who come in, may also be breeding some of our favorite original three.

Each of these fine young Legendary Pokémon are level 5 with a starter ability and typical starter moves. All of them are of a neutral Nature with perfect IVs in each slot and are holding a gem related to their type. These adorable runts are the perfect companions to begin a new adventure and slay Patrats, Gym Leaders, and take over the entire region! Of the available Pokémon are:

* No. 490 **Manaphy**: *Pure Water type*. This loose-legged Legendary is [thought to be the rarest shiny in the world](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Manaphy#Trivia) and remains the only Legendary Pokémon who can get down in the Day Care!

* No. 492 **Shaymin**: *Mostly Pure Grass/Occasionally Half Flying type*. Take him to the Striation PokéCenter and transform him into a miniature sky behemoth that delivers death from above!

* No. 494 **Victini**: *Half Psychic/Half Fire type*. This natural born winner is such a bonafide studmuffin of a Pokémon that Gamefreak had to give him not one but TWO Signature Moves!

There are ***five*** of each of these cute tykes. The giveaway is on a first come first serve basis. Get them while you can, but choose wisely because like the beginning of every Pokémon game, ***you can only choose one***! Just write the number 4041-5214-0522 in your PalPad and leave your Friend Code and starter of choice into the comment section! An organized meeting will be held shortly after you respond.

*Note: These Pokémon are hacked. Redistribution for legitimate shinies or legendaries is strictly prohibited. If you attempt to trade them across the GTS or use them for competitive battling, I will run into your house, dissolve your testicles with hot acid, and tear your wife in half.*

**EDIT:** The Manaphys are gone folks! There's one Victini left and I think 2 more Shaymin!

**EDIT 2:** For those of you in the Wifi Club room please stand by.

**EDIT 3:** Should be one Victini and one Shaymin left. I'm having trouble communicating with some of you so I'll figure out the status after I'm completed with my next batch of trades.

Hi I just found this subreddit. I just purchased a SoulSilver and the saved game had a ton of old pokemon...

First off, I've played pokemon only Blue/Red then Gold/Silver and then again on Ruby and that was over 10 years ago. I want to get back into this but I'm quite perplexed on getting some starting pokemon that I remember from playing in the olden days. I was able to connect to the wifi and I'm able to get online. I found my friend code which is 5115-2750-3780 after looking up the Pal Pad in the key items.

I booted up this game and found an old game with a ton of pokemon and I am just going to list what I am to believe are the rare ones out here. My intention is to giveaway most of these pokemon and prefer to get some starter pokemon to begin playing this game from the start after wiping out the game.

Party: 
* 80 Feraligatr
* 74 Electivire 
* 79 Mewtwo
* 64 Lugia
* ~87 Palkia~
* 100 Infernape

* 50 Heatran
* 38 Lucario
* 22 Eevee
* 19 Drantini
* 45 Typhlosion
* 53 Giratina
* 40 Suicune
* 50 Articuno
* 72 Ho-oh
* 5 Torchic
* 75 Dialga
* 14 Togepi
* 50 Zapdos
* 40 Venusaur
* ~50 Groudon~
* 50 Moltres
* 41 Entei
* 41 Raikou
* 25 Rotom
* 40 Lanturn
* 33 Gyarados (he's red too, that's a shiny correct?)
* 11 Ralts
* 40 Relicanth
* 10 Dratini
* 35 Latios
* 33 Torterra
* 86 Rayquaza
* 20 Cranidos
* 10 Chimchar

I would like to start up my own game, fresh, but with some starting pokemon from the old games. I really want to get my hands on all of the starting pokemon from the first couple of generations though. If I'm not able to find some of these pokemon I'm giving away, I would like to know which ones (Like I know I can get a Lugia, but I dunno about Latios/Rayquaza/Lucario/Mewtwo, the original legendary birds...)

Hit me up, I'm willing to chat and I would like to start playing tomorrow sometime with some beginning pokemon :)

3. It has to be the **exact** Pokemon, **not** just any member of its evolutionary line (for instance, don't guess Tyranitar).

4. Each time an hour passes without anyone guessing correctly, I will give a hint.

I'm currently breeding for a shiny one of these and I'll have a lot to giveaway. I'll release any spares later though.

Some of these are Timid and some of these are Jolly. Just note that only the Timid ones have their DW ability as halfway through I gave up and bred for a Jolly with my Ditto. So there's a lot of Moody, Own Tempo or Technician Smeargle.

Basic rules;

* Add FC to comment if not in flair. 

* 1 Smeargle per person.

* If you want me to reserve a pokemon, pick the damn thing up or I'll give it to someone else or release it. 

* NO EGGS. I'm tired of people sending me eggs, I don't have time to hatch someone else's breeding leftovers and it just takes up space in my PC.

They all have the ability Limber and the move Transform, none of them are trained and they probably have bad EVs.

Hey! Here's the next giveaway from me! Some people have asked for a **4th gen** giveaway, so here is one. I realize that a Manaphy was just given away, but *this* , ladies and gents, is a **TRU Manaphy** (from the famous group of TRU events) The reason I'm giving away a Manaphy in 4th gen is because it knows the move whirlpool, thus nontransferable to 5th gen **unless I delete that HM**, which I refuse to do, because maintaining Untouched is a factor of appeal for events. 

The giveaway starts **November 25 Eastern Time**. Comment here if you want one so I know how many to get ready. This time, please come back on that day and comment again saying you're available to trade. I don't want to have to track down 30 people again. **Please let me know if you're interested and include your FC**. Please remember to **upvote** so everyone can see this. I get no karma from this. This giveaway will be the whole day instead of just a few hours. Thank you and enjoy!~

There's too many of you, I can't keep track. I can't hunt you down. You have to let me know when you want to trade.

Note: These will be **cloned versions**. Exactly the same as original, simply more copies of them, that's all. All legit and UT.
