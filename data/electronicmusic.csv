Chris Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=lV6W6_PUj0E) has its main melody taken straight from [Arty and Mat Zo's track Rebound](http://youtu.be/DXQhVmnNmxk?t=1m).

According to [Arty's tweets](https://twitter.com/arty_music/status/324181058906107906), no permission was ever asked for the rights to his song from his label.

It's not like Arty and Mat Zo are small time no-name producers (ranked #28 and #72 on the DJ Top 100 in 2012), and their label Anjuna is pretty well known and respected in the EDM scene. To rip them off in this day and age is either pretty bold or pretty braindead (not to mention the fact that will.i.am made a complete waste of the melody).

How do will.i.am and his people expect to get away with this level of tomfoolery? More as the story develops.

**Edit:** 

Arty &amp; Mat Zo's label Anjunabeats is [aware of the situation](https://twitter.com/anjunabeats/status/324212508699271169).

Here is the link to the iTunes page where it is being sold:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/antigen-ep/id549829344

Here is the link to the ACTUAL page where this is available:
http://raubana.bandcamp.com/album/antigen-collaborative-ep

Our music is under the Creative Commons licence. We never gave him permission, we were not informed by him (or his label, if he has one), and we are not getting a cent back from him.

Can somesone please give us some advice on what the fuck we're supposed to do here.  My friend already posted on /r/legal  right here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/xv57f/we_made_an_album_and_someone_is_selling_it_on/

But we will take all the advice we can get.  Thank you.

We found his youtube, which has links to ALL his social media pages:
www.youtube.com/user/thenerfaholictwo

**EDIT:** So far you all have been a ***tremendous*** help, thank you all very much, I'll try to keep you updated with anything new.  At the moment we seem to have his location down, globally, and at some point we're going to call his parents about it so we don't have to get legal overseas about something like this.  Again, thanks so far everyone. :)

**EDIT 2:** So, he sent us as email as some sort of ""representative"" of his ""network"" saying he will take the songs down and that they were only uploaded because ""they got hacked.""  It's basically the stupidest shit I've ever read (which you can read [here](http://i.imgur.com/dQkNm.png) if you'd like to :) ), but mission accomplished for the most part, but he still has other artist's music up as well, but ours looks like it's going to be taken down soon.  Thank you all!  I think we're going to try to contact his family still, just to make sure they know he's doing this kind of thing.

Once more, thank you!

**EDIT 3:**  SUCCESS!! Raubana was able to contact the hosting company that was hosting his music and they took down the album from iTunes.  We get an error message in the US when we try to go to the page the album was on, but can we (just to make sure) get some confirmations from other countries  that it is down there as well? (if it was up there in the first place).  Thank you all SO much you guys, I can't express how much your support means to us.  You all rock!  :)

**EDIT 4, MOST IMPORTANT EDIT:**  If you recognize a song he is selling on iTunes that is not his, here is the contact to the site that hosts him on iTunes:

http://music.venzodigital.com/contact.php

I created the basic article for the umbrella term of '[hard dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_dance)' a number of years ago, but have recently received notification that it's up for removal due to lack of sources.

I've heard the term time and time again, from club/artist/label PR, on the radio and net, and from fans of various styles. Unfortunately I don't currently have the time to research for proper references, so I was wondering if anyone here might be interested in helping? Thanks!

P.S. Too much to ask for a visibility upvote? I get no karma for the self-post. Cheers if so.

P.P.S. For getting in the mood; the [hard dance tag](http://www.last.fm/tag/hard%20dance) on Last.fm.

I would love to hear more discussion from individuals who think they have good insight into the current scene.

CONTEXT: I have worked in the US electronic music industry for four years now, in several different capacities. This is coming from experience, personal observation, and corroboration with my coworkers and friends in the industry.

**EDIT:** I was not implying that producers today are making music at any loss of quality. In fact, I believe music has inarguably gotten better. The point I was trying to make was that in any market surplus of a product, consumers will face fatigue and demand will fall—regardless of the quality of what is being produced.

**EDIT:** inb4 anyone assumes I mean pop dubstep when I say ""I believe the music has gotten better"". I mostly listen to UK bass, 2-step, Garage, UK club, and experimental/acoustic crossover. Night Slugs, Triangle, Lucky Me, Warp, etc etc.

They liked what they heard, and wanted to re-release some of my old tracks (from [various](http://drainpuppet.bandcamp.com/album/green) [free](http://drainpuppet.bandcamp.com/album/goodnight) [releases](http://drainpuppet.bandcamp.com/album/adventure)) as a not-free album on beatport. Now they're a [small label.](http://www.facebook.com/hopskotchrecords?fref=ts) But, you have to start somewhere, right?

So, I accepted. Emailed them back. It sounded like a good idea, make a bit of money, get promo'd by a label, get a mastered album of some of my best-written tunes charting on beatport. I liked the sound of that. They told me what tracks they wanted. I accepted. I sent them the 24bit integer .wavs with -6db of headroom, and then waited for them to get everything in order.

They had it mastered, got the art done, made me sign a contract -nothing sketchy or binding, just me agreeing that they had the rights to release my album under their label and that I wouldn't sue them- and gave me the release date. Feb 18th.

Today is February 18th. Today my first signed EP was released.

[Drainpuppet - Headache EP](http://www.beatport.com/release/headache/1037541). Tell me what you think, and buy it if you like it. Thanks :D

Also, Chemical Burns is the worst track (I wasn't too big on re-releasing it but they insisted) and Lotus is the best.

As of when I made this list, they should be listed in decending order, from most subscribers to least.  I know you may be saying, ""but I don't want my music organized by how many people listen to it, I want it catagorized with similar sounds.""  The point of this experiment was to turn people on to new subreddits they may not have known about.  Feel free to make/post your own mixes.  An example might be http://www.reddit.com/r/ska+reggae+dub (Mixing /r/dubstep+electronicmusic+sambass will not work, bigger subreddits drown out smaller ones)

Please repremand me for any typos and omissions.

My personal favorite discovery was /r/psybient.  That lead to creating this http://www.reddit.com/r/psybient+ambientmusic+chillmusic+psytrance and thus http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com/?r=/psybient+ambientmusic+chillmusic+psytrance

A final tip: If you install Reddit Enhancement Suite http://redditenhancementsuite.com, and visit a subreddit mix such as the one listed above, there will be a +dashboard button in the upper right of the sidebar.  The dashboard is accessable via the cog next to the logout link in the upper right of the screen.  Very handy.  Here is a screenshot of my dashboard after working on this post.  http://i.imgur.com/k8J93.png

1312403818.0,203,self.electronicmusic,j83ed,Let's be honest...is anyone else completely baffled by the electronic music world?,260,57,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/j83ed/lets_be_honestis_anyone_else_completely_baffled/,"As someone who has only really been into EDM for a year or so, I feel like I've made basically no progress in understanding what the hell is going on.

Problems I've noticed so far:

* Genres are micro-categorized to the point that some genres must seriously only cover a single artist or two.

* Many of the members of the community are great.  Many more are hard to deal with.  For example, I posted a mix in a DnB community not too long ago asking for more track suggestions.  While I got some really useful responses, I got more along the lines of ""some of this is jungle, not DnB you tool,"" and, ""this DJ sucks why would you listen to his mixes,"" or, ""this is tech-step, what is it even doing here?""  For someone trying to get into the music, these comments are discouraging -- and damn near ubiquitous. 

* New producers seem to pop up out of nowhere, and people are supposed to magically know who the hell they are -- even worse, a lot of times, there will only be a single track or two from that producer floating around, with seemingly nothing else available.  

* DJs are oftentimes intentionally vague about what they are playing.  This probably bothers me more than anything.  While DJs certainly deserve credit for staying on top of things and putting good mixes together, the producers deserve a lot of credit for, you know, making the tunes in the first place.  I read an interview not too long ago where a fairly well-known Texas DJ was asked where he got his tracks.  His response was basically, ""I'm not telling you that, haha.""

I think a lot of EDM enthusiasts forget what it's like to be a newbie sometimes -- thinking, ""oh, I really like house music!  I think I'll go pick some up,"" and then later finding yourself at Best Buy standing in front of a wall of poorly-designed trance album covers trying to figure out what the hell an ""Ibiza"" is or who actually made the music that you're listening to.

It's also part of the reason that I think Deadmau5 is so popular.  People hear a song of two of his that they like, and hot damn, *they can hop on iTunes and buy a CD.*  A real CD.  If more producers started making themselves more accessible, we'd have more producers who are as famous as Deadmau5.  Instead, fans are supposed to hunt down singles and mixes that -- let's face it -- the average person doesn't have the time or the know-how to find.

So what think you, /r/electronicmusic?  Is this whole genre kept intentionally shrouded?  Are you just as confused as I am?  And, hell, is there any way I can *stop* being confused?

It'll calmly and thoroughly answer some of the most common questions/concerns I hear from day to day.

**""What is electronic music?""**

This term refers to any music that is at least predominantly created with electronic instruments, such as keyboards, synthesizers, computer programs, etc. Electronic music isn't technically a ""genre"" of its own. You might instead call it a ""blanket term"", because it refers to a wide variety of genres across a gigantic spectrum of different styles.

**""Isn't that just techno?""**

No. Techno refers to a specific genre in the electronic music spectrum, and it has a very unique sound that is completely different from some other electronic genres. This will become very apparent to you if/when you choose to explore the genre itself. 

**""But it all sounds the same. Can't we just call it techno?""**

To the untrained senses, almost everything is indistinguishable within a medium. In other words, you (understandably) just don't have an ear for the differences... yet. And that's okay! Here, let me give you a quick comparison, so you can see the variety in electronic:

[""Warmed By the Drift"" by Biosphere](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMPiFv1P79Q)

[""Waters of Nazareth"" by Justice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsE9UYOk-k0) 

[""Sheltered Life"" by Erlend Oye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_WxS8CDRY0&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL4D6915DFF44075C3)

The three examples clearly have nothing to do with each other, stylistically, yet all are electronic music of some sort. 

**""But what's wrong with using techno as a blanket term?**""

The problem with this is that techno as a specific genre already exists. Suppose you referred to all electronic music as ""techno"". Okay, but what if you want to refer to the genre? It just gets confusing. 

**""What about using the term electronica?""**

We try to avoid this term as well, simply because it's more associated with ""dancier"" stuff in the electronic spectrum, and there are plenty of great electronic bands on the more relaxed side of things. Electronic music is a more neutral term.

**""Aren't you just being snobby/elitist/pedantic?""**

Think about it this way instead. Electronic music is incredibly diverse. It's some of the most creative stuff you'll ever hear. But it's also one of the most easily dismissed styles of music. When you call it ""all just techno shit"", you're doing a disservice to thousands of electronic artists, and you're missing out on their music too! 

**""Aren't we just splitting hairs?""**

Well, let me put it this way: if someone legitimately believed that all forms of rock music were ""heavy metal"", you'd be confused, and probably try to educate them... right? And like rock music, electronic music is a huge spectrum of stuff. I don't think it's splitting hairs.

**""Where can I find out more about all this?""**

For an outdated, unashamedly biased, but still comprehensive crash course on electronic music, check out [Ishkur's Guide](http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/). It'll at least give you a good start. From there, I'd suggest downloading Last.fm and listening to some electronic genres on it. Pandora is good, too. I don't recommend Spotify at this time simply because the Radio feature is rather primitive, but if nothing else, you can look on there. Hell, you could even PM me asking for recommendations. I'd be happy to give them.

**""I have a question not covered in here?""**

Post it in the comments and I'll address it.

Hey all.

[Last week I asked you what you wanted to see in the subreddit to increase discussion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/1i0qf3/meta_looking_to_spur_more_discussion_and/) You came together on two ideas, more focus on specific genres and a thread of new artists. I was thinking we could do one of each post a week. If that becomes too much we can scale it back but I'd like to try it for now. 

So here's my tentative schedule:

* Every Monday we discuss a genre voted on by the community. [This week we'll start out with one I've chosen.] I want to focus on smaller genres that aren't usually posted or talked about here.

* Every Friday we'll have a New Music post that will prompt users to post artists with under 10,000 listeners on [last.fm](http://last.fm) or under 50,000 plays on YouTube. [These figures can be adjusted, it's just what I came up with. Let me know.] 

**On to the discussion.**

##Minimal Techno 

Minimal Techno is defined by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_techno) as a minimalist sub-genre of techno. It is characterized by a stripped-down aesthetic that exploits the use of repetition, and understated development.

Minimal techno first emerged in the early 1990s and the style is often associated with a second generation of Berlin and Rostock artists. According to Derrick May “while the first-wave artists were enjoying their early global success, techno also inspired many up-and-coming DJs and bedroom producers in Detroit.” This younger generation includes *Richie Hawtin, Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, Mike Banks and Alan Oldham.* The work of several of these artists evolved to become focused on minimalism.
Robert Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too ""ravey"", with increasing tempos leading to the emergence of gabber. Such trends saw the demise of the soul infused techno that typified the original Detroit sound. Robert Hood has noted that he and Daniel Bell both realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave era, and saw that an important feature of the original techno sound has been lost. Hood states that ""it sounded great from a production standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.""

The minimal techno sound that emerged at this time has been defined by Robert Hood as: ""a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. It's a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound."" Daniel Bell has commented that he had a dislike for minimalism in the artistic sense of the word, finding it too ""arty.""

In Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music (2004), music journalist Philip Sherburne states that, like most contemporary electronic dance music, minimal techno has its roots in the landmark works of pioneers such as Kraftwerk and Detroit Techno's Derrick May and Juan Atkins. Minimal techno focuses on ""rhythm and repetition instead of melody and linear progression"", much like classical minimalist music and the polyrhythmic African musical tradition that helped inspire it. By 1994, according to Sherburne, the term ""minimal"" was in use to describe ""any stripped-down, Acidic derivative of classic Detroit style.""

Los Angeles based writer Daniel Chamberlin, attributes the origin of minimal techno to the German producers Basic Channel. Chamberlin draws parallels between the compositional techniques used by producers such as Richie Hawtin, Wolfgang Voigt, and Surgeon and that of American minimalist composer Steve Reich, in particular the pattern phasing system Reich employs in many of his works; the earliest being ""Come Out."" Chamberlin also sees the use of sine tone drones by minimalist composer La Monte Young and the repetitive patterns of Terry Riley's ""In C"" as other influences. Sherburne has suggested that the noted similarities between minimal forms of dance music and American minimalism could easily be accidental; he also notes that much of the music technology used in EDM has traditionally been designed to suit loop based compositional methods, which may explain why certain stylistic features of minimal techno sound similar to works of Reich's that employ loops and pattern phasing techniques.

[Spotify Playlist featuring a selection of Minimal tracks.](http://open.spotify.com/user/stiha85/playlist/7BJUvrmcII7qrqOIFBDADS)

**What I'd like to see happen:**

I'd like for this to be a little more than just people posting YouTube links. 

* I want to hear why you love or why you hate Minimal. 

* Who are your favorite labels?

* What got you into minimal, and where has it brought you?

* What genres you like to mix with minimal, if you mix.

* If you can't get it, ask people what they think about it.

* Obviously, please post up some tracks and I'll probably make a spotify playlist of the thread as it winds down. 

I hope this is a hit! Let's talk music friends!

While we got that shut down as soon as we found out thanks to all the support and general assistance we got from you guys, but he's back up to his old shit again under a new alias, ""Silver Sable,"" selling other people's stuff on iTunes and bandcamp: 

http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/sable/id252830723

http://silversable.bandcamp.com/ (deleted now)

Here are his general youtube accounts, with links to all his pages:

http://www.youtube.com/user/thenerfaholic

http://www.youtube.com/user/silversablemusic

Listening through any collection of tracks on here will tip you off to the fact that he didn't produce any of this.  You may either recognize a song by an artist you know, or you realize that the music is produced by completely different people track to track.

I want to bring this to everybody's attention not only because he's illegally selling music other people made, but because he started this almost right after he got caught the first time, and I'm looking for a real way to get this kid in trouble.  

If you recognize any of the songs he's selling, *please* contact the original artist (and their respective labels if they are signed) to get it taken down so that this loser doesn't make another cent off of other people's hard work.

Thank you.

**EDIT:** In case you need more proof, he is still selling my friend's music under his original moniker, ""Electro Sawg,"" (this was the original account we had problems with, both of these accounts are owned by Jack Eastment), and these were uploaded pretty recently:

http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/good-time-single/id550469427

http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wide-awake-single/id549698018

These are tracks by my friend Raubana:

http://raubana.bandcamp.com/track/rebelions-harmony

http://raubana.bandcamp.com/track/elf-gear-hop

We need to find out who is hosting his music on iTunes and get him blacklisted, and I honestly think we need to contact the authorities about this.  This is bullshit.  I didn't want to get the police involved the first time, but the fact this little loser thinks he can keep doing this without any consequence he's got another thing coming.

**EDIT 2:**

**He just made another bandcamp after deleting this last one.  STAY ON HIM.**

If you guys can promise to play nice I can make this happen and possibly some other big guys too.

Hopefully this subreddit can finally go back to being a sanctuary for all lovers of Electronic music, instead of the hate and envy filled shit pool it's slowly turning into. It's reassuring to see other people realizing how bad it's become lately, and that's always the first step on the road to recovery.

I have faith we can turn it around.

1324506778.0,141,self.electronicmusic,nlt9n,RJD2s top ten ways not to eat shit on tour,184,43,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/nlt9n/rjd2s_top_ten_ways_not_to_eat_shit_on_tour/,"1. Do NOT hire a tour manager. This one comes with a big caveat. Only do this if you have your shit together, broadly speaking. If you are decent at numbers, care about how things shake out at the end of the night, and are not intimidated by having some semblance of responsibility for your own career, you can totally do this yourself. It's really not rocket science. If you are the kind of person that likes being on time, and can book a flight to somewhere in the continental US on your own, you will be very good at self tour managing. While it is work, so is touring. This right here will save you 10-20% in commission, as well as the expense of an extra person. I have done this for many tours, even when I am responsible for a crew of five. If you choose your band members/merch person/driver wisely, you will avoid herding cats.

2. Hire a tour manager, if you are a. bad with numbers, b. determined to spend your mornings face down in a pile of cocaine infused puke, or c. generally don't like being responsible for yourself. While I say this last part with some modicum of sarcasm, really, you'd be surprised. Some people just aren't built like that. I have met a lot of musicians who would rather have a bad guy to take the blame than to be responsible for their own fuck-ups.

3. Buy a vehicle to tour in. This may seem elementary, but some folks rent for years before taking the plunge. Live music isn't going anywhere soon. Plus, if your band implodes, you have a head start on that fruit basket delivery service you've had your eye on.

4. Make merch people actually want. Posters are great, kids love 'em and they are easy to store and transport. Find a local artist who can screen-print, get them to run off a small batch, and restock as needed. T-shirts are second best in terms of something people always want. It's tempting to go for some cutesy mercy thing that nobody else has, but a lot of them are duds. So unless you're determined to roll out smorgasbord style, stick to the stuff that actually works. One item does not fit all. I know some artists who still can kill on CDs. I can't. C'est La Vie.

5. If at all possible, hire folks with experience touring. If you take a greenhorn, make absolutely sure you won't be babysitting. Take people you would want to be marooned on an island with, the kind of folks with interesting shit to talk about other than music. I guar-an-fucking-tee that you are not going to want to debate which Zep' album is definitively their best by day 13 or day 26. East coast scrabble champ 2007-2009? Sign me up. Opinionated annoying music encyclopedia? 'Scuse me while I fucking choke myself to death. While this won't always affect your bottom line, successful touring is best thought of as buying a timeshare; it pays off incrementally over many years. One three-week stint with a complete dickface can sour you to the whole idea.

6. Get yourself a good booking agent. This is frankly easier said than done, but still very much worth it. My booking agent is arguably my most valuable business relationship, I definitely would not be where I am today without him. A good agency can both save you, and yield you considerable sums. I often talk to artists who can't find an agency to take them on, thus, I know this can be hard to source. Nevertheless, get in where you fit in. For what they do the commission is without a doubt worth it.

7. Pretend you joined the army. This may sound like a joke, but honestly, two of the most important things one can possibly do is to a. stay clean, and b. eat well. You know how they say that in the military, they tell you not to touch your face for sanitary reasons? It's true. If you love picking bogs, you better stop now, cause you are entering ground fucking zero for germs and shit. For food stock up on rations. Peanut butter, dried fruits and nuts, soymilk and cereal-- all your friends, pizza and Micky D's are not. Cancelled shows equal a sure fire way to fuck your money up quick.

8. Know what a properly functioning show looks like. Don't know? Watch. I have been telling myself this for years, so don't take this as being rude. The most valuable thing you can do in most situations is shut the fuck up and listen. Opening slot on a big  tour for the Blah Blah's? Sit back and absorb. If you know what the contour of an evening looks like, you can identify when something is wrong. I have been in many situations where a show was a total clusterfuck, and if I didn't step in and make things happen (backline, soundcheck, set times, etc), no one would have picked up the pieces on my behalf. Most nights, it's clear what roles people play. Other times, you exist in a responsibility vacuum. This, again, is where tour managing yourself can be a big help; there are times where you won't have time to get 3 parties to talk to each other, you just need to make shit happen, and happen now.

9. Sell your own merch. I guarantee this will double or triple your sales. It just does.

10. Don't be an asswipe. I've gotten gigs from promoters, kids, activity club directors, etc, just from them saying ""Oh, we had him last year and he wasn't difficult at all, not like artist X was, jesus that guy sucked"". You can be supremely talented and popular and people will put up with your shit to book you. You will also be the 3%, sooner or later they become one of the rest of us 97%ers. And when that happens, you don't want to be that guy. It's really not hard, just pretend that you're the same guy that was stacking boxes 5 years ago for $9/hr, before you ""hit the big time"". You will have to revert to him sooner or later anyway, as we all do, so you might as well just be him ALL the time.",,False,self,t5_2qmh1,False,,,True,t3_nlt9n,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/nlt9n/rjd2s_top_ten_ways_not_to_eat_shit_on_tour/,

Link to mixmag article: 
http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/avicii-responds-to-ultra-controversy

Quote:
&gt;﻿Avicii has responded to the ""controversy"" around his Ultra set during which he premiered new material from his upcoming album.
&gt;
&gt;He's faced a lot of criticism from fans who believe it shows a departure from his electronic style and that it sounds too 'country' influenced.
&gt;
&gt;In a Facebook post, Avicii said: ""Wow looks like I stirred up some controversy with my set friday night at UMF. Seeing alot of people who don't understand.
&gt;
&gt;""I really wanted to switch things up and do something fun and different...this album is about experimentation and about showing the endless possibilities of house and electronic music.
&gt;
&gt;""It's about how to incorporate acoustic instruments from different styles and influences you wouldnt expect and still stay true to your own sound and musicality which for me has always been about the melodies and positive energy.
&gt;
&gt;""But my album is certainly not 'country'. Every song on the album is a fusion with house and electronic music.""
&gt;
&gt;Listen to the set everyone's banging on about here, or read Avicii's full bang-on here.


So I go over to the link to listen to the mix, and as I type I'm about half way through (25mins):
http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/listen-to-aviciis-live-set-from-ultra

Now... from what I can hear, it seems that yes, it's clearly a departure from what one might expect when going into a venue to see Avicii - but I personally dont think that's a bad thing. At all. 

I think its got a good, eclectic feel to it. Sure; it's not the greatest mix I've ever heard but it's far from the worst. I'm assuming the cause for Avicii to be questioned about the mix and the response was lead by the crowd (read the comments on the mix as it plays - they dont praise him much and frequently people assert that they think he is 'trolling'). And in response the media outlets (Mixmag etc.) have jumped on it to say ""wow, you tried something different and people didnt like it!"" - and I'm not sure if I'm reading the article the wrong way but it seems to me like he's being given a trial by fire for his attempt at something different.

More info was available over here at inthemix:
http://m.inthemix.com.au/news/54901/The_best_ ... _to_Aviciis_divisive_Ultra_set

Quote:
&gt;﻿“Seeing a lot of people who don’t understand. My full set wasn’t being streamed, only the last 40ish minutes with all new material from my album. In a 75 minute set, I brought a 15 minute different breakdown with live musicians to a festival with nonstop dance music for 3 days straight 2 weeks in a row . I really wanted to switch things up and do something fun and different, as I always strive for, and this album is about experimentation and about showing the endless possibilities of house and electronic music… But my album is certainly not “country”, and people have gotten hung up on an instrument we used for the live cover of a song. Every song on the album is a fusion with house and electronic music.”


So yeah - essentially I say fair dues to the guy - and I hope that it sparks a few of his fans into looking into some of the more experimental stuff (if only so they can type 'controversial Miami set' into Google and find the 'All Bases Covered' Shadow mix which is superb). But it really is a shame that so many people are so narrow-minded about it all.

I'd love to get this fucker signed in gold pen.

The operating system is on floppy disk. The eBay user I bought it from also sent a fucking huge Ziploc bag of other floppies with various synth sounds. You would have to load each one. 

Funny thing, the more MIDI notes you programmed into the sequencer the slower the playback got, presumably due to memory capacity.

If I recall correctly, Liam would use three of these on stage in the early days. He would trigger samples with it, and in case he missed a key he programmed the surrounding keys to loop back or something.

Also, the Roland U-220 synth module was his go-to device for strings.

I think he used an MC-505 as well.

Please take a moment to read.,165,47,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/y9i0p/hello_relectronicmusic_please_take_a_moment_to/,"I am making this post to address the quality of the links you are providing to this subreddit.  While the choice of music is great (keep up the good work, I have discovered many new artists and songs thanks to you all!) the quality of the links you are providing is low for the most part.  I am sure many of you are aware that electronic music (all music for that matter) is best heard in high quality (i.e. not compressed files).  I constantly see links to youtube on here that lead to a low quality version of the song, that is readily available in high quality, and I would like this to change for everyones benefit.  

  It is as simple as typing the name of the song/artist you want to find, then adding HD or HQ to your search terms, and it really makes a world of difference.  This will have a very minimal effect for you if you listen to your music on laptop speakers or iPod headphones, but for anyone listening on a decent set of headphones or speakers the difference is phenomenal.  
    
  A perfect example [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bparw9Jo3dk&amp;feature=relmfu) listen to the song while on 240-360p, then simply change the quality to 720pHD-1080pHD and hear the difference for yourself.

It was in the comments of the post about 15hrs ago labeled ""Almost Every Essential Mix"". That link I found pretty disappointing (because I read it wrong; it is actually every Essential Mix Of The Year, as in the best of the year, [link](http://jurawa.com/notes/item/20-every-essential-mix-of-the-year)). hayf then posted this soundcloud listing that has every single one I've ever heard. I figured I'd pass it on to anyone who did not happen to read those two comments on that post. Thanks hayf and herbalalchemy! You've made my hungover Sunday morning much more enjoyable :) One other idea: it might make a good addition to the sidebar since they are not discriminatory towards the genre's they feature.

**edit**: thanks to ieatdots for providing further links to the [original](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/k2yao/every_essential_mix_from_93_11_on_soundcloud_a/) posting, which in turn linked to another [original](http://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/k2ffr/every_single_bbc1_essential_mix_from_19932011_on/) posting (I can't tell which was first), where I found KillerKid's post on a pastebin of just the download links: [here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ZmKFxibT). There, I think that covers all the credit :P 

**edit2**: eatflamingdeath has provided a modified script to download them as mp3's instead of FLAC in the comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/n8ma3/every_bbc_essential_mix_ever_downloadable/c377g0e), along with pretty comprehensive instructions on how to utilize it on your OS of choice. Personally, I just used a real light-weight program called [Converterlite](http://www.converterlite.com/flac-to-mp3?gclid=CKX576TA_6wCFQpS7AodtjNBSA) (only works for Windows Vista/X/7 though) to convert the FLACS to mp3's once I downloaded them from the soundcloud site. There might be negligible loss in sound quality, but I cannot really tell, the bass still kicks for me even through my crappy ipod shuffle and mid-level Sony headset. 

**edit3**: AndyParka has posted another program [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/n8ma3/every_bbc_essential_mix_ever_downloadable/c379zf1) that he claims will download ALL the mixes automatically. I have not tried this though, since I really do not want every single of these, but figured I'd add it here as well in case you do :) ",,False,self,t5_2qmh1,True,,,True,t3_n8ma3,http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/n8ma3/every_bbc_essential_mix_ever_downloadable/,

Plus we've got a lot of history. If anyone would be interested in an authentic experience of the scene, and a local as a contact ;-), let me know, coz it's something i would like to do. Also, if you know anyone heading to London, point them in my direction.

edit: PM me if you want me to put together some sort of tour for you. Let me know your favourite artists, preferred genres, special requests, accomodation requirements, dates of travel (approximate) etc. 

For example, if you were here tonight, you've got Skrillex, ModeStep, Pendulum, Doorly, 16BiT, Delta Heavy and Joker all playing in one car park/warehouse.
