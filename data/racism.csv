Going to school as a black kid in a sea of white students has always been difficult. Growing up I was mocked for my skin and black features, and my hair was often ripped out. The kids at school frequently refer to us as niggers, and make racist jokes in our presence. 

I made a facebook status requesting that white people stop using that word, and the backlash I received was shocking. I had people calling me a liar, yelling at me for making such a big deal out of nothing, telling me I didn't know what 'real' racism was, and that I should go to the south if I thought what they were doing was bad. One student even said that I could drink from the same water fountains he could, so I shouldn't complain. White kids were friending me just to harass me on my status. I was called a bitch. And, on twitter, someone threatened to rape me. 

I spoke out against racism, and someone *threatened rape against me*. All while declaring that he wasn't racist, and that I didn't know what real racism was. I was raped at 13, and this brought back horrific memories for me.

I'm scared to go to school anymore. My parents want to move to get me out of there, but I refuse to let them drive me out.

(I think the top/best post at the time was ""As a black man I feel the same way"" - there's a discussion to be had about that another day.)

I think its becoming a popular thing to say. Safe racism.

I've taken a moment to look back at what black culture (my life) means to me. Keep in mind I'm an older redditor.

I think of a life of immense maternal love spanning generations. Paternal figures almost mythical in admiration. Family bar-b-ques with your cousins. And your cousins' cousins. And your cousins' cousins' cousins. Homecomings for each holiday. Spending the night before Easter getting your hair done. Delicious (oh-so-bad-for-you) food. Having to show your uncles and aunts the latest dance. Moving up to the adult's table. Church on Sunday. Church on Wednesday. Church on Saturday. Borrowing the latest R&amp;B from a neighbor (couldn't hear in on the radio) and listening to it over and over. Not going swimming because of the cost and the effect on your hair. That same family coming from all over to attend your college graduation. I could go on but I'll stop here.

I'm sure I'm ""preaching to the choir"" here. But I know my post would fall on deaf ears posted elsewhere.

There are some things ugly about it, some things really embarrassing, some things sad, hurtful and detrimental. Definitely some things that need to change, but there are some things truly wonderful. And that's why it stings to see ""I hate black culture"". It's my culture.

Some background information: I'm a 23 year old 5'5'' Vietnamese female who looks/dresses very androgynously.


Went to a club with a couple of friends this past Saturday night with a couple of friends.  Unfortunately I found out last minute that it was a 18+ club, so the place was packed with kids.  Since I was DD I got to experience the full effect of immaturity + intoxication with this crowd.

At the end of the night the place starts to close and my friends and I head for the parking lot.  My one friend is trying to bum cigarettes so we wait patiently as he’s asking people in the parking lot.  I’m standing trying to talk to one of my friends when all of a sudden I hear an extremely high pitched mock “martial arts call”, you know, like a Bruce Lee “WAHHHHHHH, YAHHHHHHHH” type yell.  I turn my head and sure enough, this kid is doing “kung fu stances” and yelling at me from across the street.  His friends are dying of laughter and the kid continues his antics, just getting increasingly louder.

My initial thought:  “What….the…..fuck….. Is he for real?”

He was clearly drunk off his ass and couldn’t have been any older than 17-19.  I decided to turn around and ignore him despite the fact that my blood was starting to boil over.  I don’t believe in violence except in the case of self-defense, but this guy was really pushing it.  But like I said, I figured I would ignore him and that would be the end of it, however the fucker decides to take it a step further.

I’m trying to have a conversation with my friend and I can hear this kid starting to cross the street with his posse following behind.  I refuse to turn around.  I have to raise my voice in order for my friend to hear me because this boy has now placed himself **right next to my ear**, screaming “karate” sounds and doing whatever the hell moves he was doing.  I just couldn’t believe this was happening!  I was so flabbergasted by his idiocy I lost all train of focus and thought.  Pretty soon I wasn’t able to carry my conversation anymore.  I was overtaken with rage but just held my fists at my sides as this guy is screaming in my face, spit hitting my cheek.  I just gathered up my friends and told them we should go.  It’s times like these that make me worry about humanity.

I just think that sort of behavior is totally unacceptable, whether he thought I was an easy target to pick on, or if he was trying to impress his friends.  I wonder if he would have reacted differently if I were wearing a dress and heels, or if I was Hispanic rather than Asian.  In any case, I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life and felt like I had to share.  Thanks for listening, and I’m glad I had the strength to refrain from stooping to their level.

Even in the early 1960's, before the passage of civil rights legislation, most of us, according to Gallup polls, failed to see the nation had a race problem. Even as African Americans were being hosed down and blown up in Birmingham, beaten in Selma, murdered in Mississippi and segregated and isolated up North, two-thirds of [whites] said that we believed blacks had equal opportunity in employment, education and housing. In one 1962 survey, roughly 90% of us said that we believed black children had just as good a chance to get a quality education as we or our children did. That we may see such beliefs as borderline delusional now does not change the fact that we believed them to be quite rational at the time.
What does it say about us that even when the nation was characterized by official and quite legal white supremacy, we mostly failed to appreciate the obvious? What it says to me is that our judgement on the matter is perhaps not the best. It says that perhaps we should listen to the voices of those who have been and continue to be targeted by racial discrimination, and not those who have had the option of ignoring it. They say we have a problem. And unless we wish to adopt the fundamentally racist view that we know their reality better than they know it--perhaps because they are ""too emotional,"" or lack objectivity, or are too unintelligent to discern the contours of their own lived experiences--we should probably believe them. It isn't that we are incapable of seeing the truth. But having the luxury of remaining oblivious to the experiences of people of color (we aren't tested on it as a condition of obtaining academic or professional credentials, after all), we simply have little reason to know any better, whether in 1962 or today."" - Tim Wise, Dear White America",,False,,t5_2qhgd,False,,,True,t3_xhkzk,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/xhkzk/tim_wise_on_why_it_is_so_easy_for_white_people_to/,

1349985900.0,25,self.racism,11brsn,"Growing up in Jasper, Texas.",27,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/11brsn/growing_up_in_jasper_texas/,"I grew up in [Jasper, Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper,_Texas). I remember my mother trying to navigate around the courthouse traffic and struggling to explain to me, a ten year old, the concepts of racism and hate crimes. She was saying that we had to get out of the town because the KKK was already marching and the Black Panthers were on their way. This was in America, in the year 1998. My mother was torn between the equality she knew was right and the values she had been instilled with. It was hard for me to understand that my lineage was composed of generations of KKK clansmen and slave owners. Our ancestors proudly wore their pointy hats and killed in the name of white supremacy.

The [movie]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335185/) they made about the James Byrd dragging that was supposed to “relate the story and how it affected all of the residents of the town” was misleading, and though the fence separating the cemetery was taken down, the emotional fence never was. Jasper remains divided, as illustrated by the [recent firing] (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/us/in-jasper-texas-racial-tensions-flare-again.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) of their black and interracially married police chief as well as the charges currently pending against the town.

Shamefully, my mother sometimes aired on the side of her ancestors. I had no idea the “N word” was offense until I was 13; up until that point I genuinely believed this was the only term for black people as I had never heard any other word used in reference to them. I substituted it for “colored,” which I learned a few years later is also offensive. I didn’t know confederate flags were offensive until I moved away at 17. Once, when I was around 5, I held the hand of a black girl in school. This was the only black person I had ever touched and I remember not wanting to. Her hand was greasy, and when I asked my mom about it she said “they’re all greasy, it’s the stuff they put in their hair.” For the next five years or so I wouldn’t touch a black person because I didn’t want to get grease on my hands.

When I was 17 my boyfriend at the time had cancer (he lived) and would be taking radiation therapy during my senior prom. My friend Josh was in my Spanish class and would also be going alone. He asked me if I’d go with him as a friend and I accepted. Later, when she asked me about it, I was appalled by my mother’s response.

Mom: So did you ever find out if Trey would be able to take you to prom?

Me: No, he can’t, the doctors won’t clear him. I’m going with my friend Joshua (pronounced in 
Spanish, since we went by our Spanish names in class.)

Mom: Is he Mexican?

Me: No, he’s black, why?

Mom: You’re not going to prom with a black boy.

Me: We’re just going as friends. He doesn’t have a date, we’re just friends.

Mom: No. People will talk and you don’t want that. I will not allow you to go to prom with a black boy. You can go to prom alone or you can not go to prom, but you are NOT going with a black boy. That’s the end of this conversation.

I argued with her, I told her that I didn’t care what people thought, if they were racist I didn’t want anything to do with them anyway. She never waivered and I didn’t go to prom with Josh.

The next year I found out exactly what she meant. I sat next to a beautiful white girl in my chemistry class who was a grade behind me. Her name was Lana* and she had a beautiful singing voice, a bubbly personality and was fiercely intelligent. But her boyfriend of two years was black, and to everyone else, including her family, she was a “nigger lover” and a “disgusting whore.” Her constant persecution eventually ended with her dangling from her canopy bed, where she hung herself at age 16. Her mom found her, alive but too late. Her boyfriend wasn’t allowed in the hospital room where she took her last breath the next day, and a week later he wasn’t allowed into her funeral. I remember saying, what if seeing him is the one thing that would give her the will to live? And, where are we that in 2005 we have guards at the door of a church, to keep out a black teenager whose only crime was loving a white girl? Who decided that this boy wasn’t worthy of closure, of grieving? Her views were too big for the town and she never knew there was anything more.

I clawed my way out of the town at age 17 and moved to Baltimore at a dead run. I was totally alone and knew no one, but it wasn’t Jasper.

In Baltimore I stopped telling people where I was from. If asked I would say “East Texas” or name a nearby, non-famous town. Living in the blue-light district of Baltimore was a miniscule rung up from poverty but leaps above living in Jasper. The racism was there, as it probably is everywhere, but didn’t present itself so conspicuously as it did during Obama’s presidential election. I was encouraged to “vote black” in the name of progress, but I maintained that voting for a skin color rather than a person was the opposite of progress. Even this was total enlightenment compared to where I came from.

Jasper has good people, but very few stay who have the means to leave. My mother told me recently, when she met my Hispanic boyfriend, that every generation it gets better. When you take my grandmother to a store she sits at the front and monitors all the “Mexicans” because they’re all stealing. My mom, for probably the first time in her life, has a black friend. “They’re still not ok to date because the Bible says, but you can be friends with them.” But then she said, “I think you’re a lot better than I am. But I’m trying.”

I live in a small rural town about 30 miles east of Sarasota, FL. I'm originally from SF, moved here a year and a half ago for the heat and culture of Sarasota but the husband and I wanted acreage and livestock. My family is Israeli, we moved here when I was only a few months old; I posted my first comment mostly tongue in cheek since I know she didn't refer to Israelis. But then when the racism got stronger, I decided to take a small stand. In case it isn't obvious, I'm the one with the equality corgis.

Didn't change anyone's mind, hoping that maybe someone thinks about it later, not expecting anyone to. I don't actually know any of these people in person as we don't get off the farm or go to church. I know I don't feel good about this, but I'm not really sure why. Anyway, just tossing this out there.

EDIT: forgot to mention, the post started in a ""for sale"" group on FB for our small town. It was about the new owners of our gas station who are doing some legitimately bad things, like turning the coolers off at night and firing the long-term employees.

The majority of our neighbors are hispanic so that's why they say they are justified in talking the way they do.  The problem I had was that my niece was in the room and starts yelling ""I hate Mexicans, and I hate Mexico"".  So I told her to leave the room and tell my mom that she is setting a bad example.  My mom tells me that: 1) my niece, who is 6, will not really take what she says to heart, and 2) that I don't know anything since I haven't been in a ""real"" work place.  And that since she is a female working in a ""man's"" world that her racism is justified.  My brother agreed with her and says I lived a sheltered life.

I just wanted to know if there is a way I should approach the situation and if I am just in what I had tried to do.

Oh and my sheltered life consists of serving 5 years in the US Marine Corps, working and living independently in various jobs serving veterans and students.

I tried to tell her that ""hey, I'm half gipsy on my mother's side"" but to that she replies something like ""yeah, but you're not a 'true' gipsy, true gipsies steal stuff and beg etc"".

I have been coming to Reddit daily for about 2 months. I am surprised at the amount of racist remarks, links and memes there are. It is time we started down voting these posts. We should never reward these posts all the way to the front page.

This includes the Successful Black Man meme, posts with the N word, posts that elicit uses of the N word in comments, etc.

I was raised culturally white, but I don't feel all white.   I'm 28 F and I don't often have racism used against, me but occasionally I do.  I get followed by security in stores.  Even friends think it's okay to be racist, because I'm the ""White"" Mexican girl.  I am very proud of my Mexican heritage.  

Tonight, I went to an audition to sing in a band.  The bass player brought his gross trashy girlfriend.  She made rude comments all night, most likely because I was well-dressed and I am fairly attractive.  At some point she referred to a song that goes ""Aaaayoo""  (Dynamite by Taio Cruz) ""oh this song is great for you because you'rre  Mexican like ayayayayay!"". I don't recall mentioning I was Mexican or joking about it.  She didn't know me and we hadn't established a rapport.  I think my boyfriend was shocked that I came home upset over racism.  
In the past he has also said he doesn't feel like he's in an interracial relationship.  I hate that I have to say ""Well, you may not see me as Mexicans, but the racists sure do!"".   Racist comments to my face haven't happened to me in a while.   I hate that I feel a little angry, but almost just as vindicated in the ""look I am a minority"" way!

In elementary school I would often get asked ""is you chinese"" ""what are you?"" from kids in school and I would respond ""I'm San Diego-an"" or ""Caliornian"". I distinctly remember a man in a dirty white tee and overalls in the local piggly wiggly (lol) asking me where my parents are from and that in this country they could trade me for a good size pig. what the fuck lol. 
Anyway I was pretty much blind to racism because as kids we don't really know the difference until our parents teach us racism. I don't want to waste your time so I'll just tell you when I realized racism existed. 

I was enrolled in a local daycare (Happy Days) when my best friend wanted me to go to his daycare at a woman named Mrs. Anne's house. It was fun, she gave us cookies and was nice. Well we all went to go play outside afterwards and my friend told me to come over to the playhouse in the backyard when a girl (paige?) told me to stop. I asked why and she stated ""He isn't the same as us"" and looked me straight in the face and said ""you look like a MONKEY"".
That was the first time anyone had said anything like that to me before. I looked at my friend and he looked at the girl and the other people in daycare (there were only 5 of us) and he didn't say anything. I ran out to the front yard and sat in the driveway crying wondering what I did to make her mad at me. Mrs. Anne came out about 10 minutes later and put a kool-aid jammer and went back to watch the rest of the kids play. I sat there until my mom picked me up. I told her I fell but I was okay because I didn't know how to explain the situation. They already paid for a week of daycare so I went for the rest of the week and my friend would selectively talk to me when it was convenient for him. 

I've been to Dallas and Austin very often and everyone there that's my age now is really nice because the population is more open minded than a small town that's never heard of a filipino. So if you don't live in Texas and you find yourself here there's a basic rule of thumb. The smaller the city the more white trash redneck jesus loving racist homophobic people you will find.

One time, a black girl was giving out pamphlets for her church, and when she rang the doorbell of someones house, they told her to ""Go home nigger"" This would always really bother me, and I hated almost everyone in the town (I was extremely unpopular in school too)

So this year, I moved to a city and I live near a rough area. Most of the kids that go to my school are hispanic or black. I have black friends and hispanic friends, many more than the white friends I have (I am white, male and 16 years old) Anyways, I had my ipod out in my hand and I was walking home from school. Three black men were walking toward me, who were buff in stature, and like I said before, I live near a poor, rough part of town (even some black/hispanic kids in school are a little nervous to walk through there) but, all of a sudden I clenched my ipod really tightly because was afraid they might take it.
I felt really horrible after I did this and it's really bothering me. Am I racist?

I have been a user for the last 3 weeks and I am just starting to learn more and more about reddit and its culture. 

However, during my time here I have also noticed strong racist attitudes, mostly directed against black people. I am a Hispanic man and I find myself amazed to how in many threads the top comments are usually racist in nature. But see, this is not your blatant racism (which as bad as it is I actually have more respect for) this is more a sneaky racism, a racism that comes across as ...*well, I am no racist but yeah, I have noticed black people are louder than whites*. Yes, that kind of racism. 

I do ask the community, is there a way that racism can be contained and moderated in reddit? What is the official stance on racism from reddit's parent company Advance Publications? In an era in which reddit is becoming more and more influential and a source of many movements, shouldn't we be more alert of this lenience towards racism? 

In conclusion, I must say I love reddit but it is extremely disappointing to see what could be wonderful discussions are being turned into this *clever racism* (which it has nothing clever about it but you can feel the tone in which it is presented).

I personally know nothing of racism or any discrimination for that matter but I thought I would tell you a story from years past. When was 17, I was a lifegaurd in an upper middle class neighborhood. One of my mom's friends from work was having a birthday for her son and his friends at their house and she wanted to know if i could watch over the kids in their pool as the adults mingle and talk (average age of the kids was about 9). I said sure and I drove over to the neighborhood where the party was at (low to mid upper class neighborhood). The party went under way and there was about a dozen kids in the pool that I was watching. As I was doing my best ""I'm a lifegaurd and I'm a boss"" walk around the pool and I overheard the start of a conversation between these two kids. They were the same age and one was white and the other was black (the only non-white kid there). The conversation went as so, ""Why is your skin so dark?"" the white kid asks innocent and curiously. The black kid thought for a second, thought hard and said ""I don't know. My mom skin is dark, my dad's skin is dark, so I guess my skin is dark."" White kid says ""Oh, Ok."" and they went right along playing and continued to for the rest of the party. I would like to think that even though racism is still very much rampant in the world that it is getting a little better and I hope that soon the whole population of the world can look at race or any differences between one another with the innocence and indifference as those two kids.",,False,,t5_2qhgd,True,,,True,t3_sokel,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/sokel/i_thought_yall_might_like_this/,

I've been at the receiving end of racist slurs throughout my life so it's not a new experience for me, but this one really bothered me because I've upheld the belief that our society is becoming more accepting towards other cultures, and that newer generations will display less racist attitudes; however an 18 year old girl telling me to ""Go back to Pakistan"" challenges my belief.

Local DJ posted [this image](http://imgur.com/VvlK7fj) on his FB page.

Several people were offended, and tried to call him out on it. A [protest event](https://www.facebook.com/events/350224381747911/) at his show is organized.

People jump on it in both camps - defending and accusing. Several people of color come forward and say ""wtf is all the fuss about"" but also others are deeply offended. DJ in question posts ""[apology](http://imgur.com/yZ9no9B,wP9UNfR)"".

The original image seems to come from racist-jokes.com, a site owned by [this man](http://newpwatch.blogspot.com/2011/07/robert-odonovan-newps-founder.html). I could ONLY find it by googling ""racist food stamps"", from [that site](http://www.racist-jokes.com/images/obama_foodstamp.jpg). I couldn't find it anywhere else. 

I'm a Latino myself if it matters. I'm far from being PC, but I personally found the images distasteful - and using them for self promotion then claiming there was no agenda behind it strikes me as disingenuous. Comments from anyone of any background are welcome.

I always thought the answer was simple. You -can- be proud. Have at it! Be all you can be, but it won't change that the term ""White Pride"" has been turned into something ugly by racists groups. They have claimed and defined it for themselves and turned into something hateful and negative.  The anger felt should be towards these racist groups for stealing the term and meaning and making it about hate. They have made white pride almost synonymous with racism.

Am I crazy? To start things off, I am genetically 80% white. Phenotypically, I’m not so sure what I am. Please don’t ask me to explain the breakdown. I know it, but I’m so tired of having to justify what I am to strangers that ask me. I was raised in white culture and taught that I was white, and I enjoy many aspects of white privilege. Or at least I think I do. Until earlier this year, I was taught and believed that the best way to live morally is to completely ignore race. I stupidly believed that America was mostly a post-racial society, with a little bit of racism here and there (like many, I thought bigotry was the only form of racism). Now that I found out that wasn’t the case, I’ve looked back on my life and found a lot of circumstances that I didn’t really consider at the time.

Most of my life, almost all the people I made friends with were people of color. Asian, black, hispanic, Indian, mixed, these accounted for about 90% of my friends. Remember, I thought I was white, so I thought this may have been some kind of subconscious fetish that I had. I didn’t consider that maybe, just maybe, I might just have more similarities to the people that didn’t belong to the majority culture. At one point, I realized I was being consciously stigmatized, but more on that later.
As for almost all my interactions in the US, inevitably this question pops up, “So, what exactly are you?” Sometimes, I guess it was just general curiosity. I know now that this was almost always an important question in identifying the relationship I was about to have with the person I was talking to. It’s usually asked by two kinds of people, white people to figure out which minority I am, and people with Latin American heritage to see how similar I am to them. Very often, I’ll be lovingly reassured by the white person I’m talking to, “Oh, you’re just white.” I believed them on the surface of my mind, after all, I am mostly white. I never felt comfortable disregarding my non-white heritage, but I stupidly thought it was qualified based on ratios. 

Here’s some examples that everyone can understand. Open bigotry, when it’s impossible to think I’m just being paranoid. When I was in middle school, I asked a fellow student to deliver a note to a teacher for me, he dismissed me as a “dirty Mexican” and walked away, laughing with his friends. I thought I was white, so I was confused. A little later, I was walking with my friends at night (just walking) and I was stopped by the police to that they could make sure we weren’t doing anything illegal. I thought I was white, so I just chalked it up to me looking like a suspicious young fellow. Another time, I was smoking a cigar in a park after highschool graduation, cops came. One time I was sitting in the park with my white girlfriend, the cops came right at curfew to escort me out. These are just a few occasions, so I got really good at talking with cops. It was only later that I learned I get stopped by the police way more than average. When I was working fast food, I didn’t hear the number of sandwiches an irate customer wanted, so I asked him to repeat it. He screamed “CUATRO! CUATRO!” At that point I began to suspect that I might not be seen as white by society… This was a thought I had had before, but now I was taking it seriously.

I didn’t come from a rich background, but my family made a lot of money when I got older. I spent my highschool years in a town that was about 98% white. I was immediately made uncomfortable by not only the complete lack of cultural diversity, but by the outright rejection of anything (so I thought) foreign, including myself. My first two years, I had one friend (half Cuban, half Panamanian), who also had only one friend. Of course, in highschool you have to find a group to roll with as well, so I chose to hang out with the punks and the Goths, because at least they knew something was wrong with the place they lived. No actual friendships there, though. In those four years, I made a total of one white friend. The rest of my friends were people of color (I don’t regret this, to this day I think that I found the only people in that hole who actually had souls and a consciousness).  Through the entire experience, I just thought it was because I was from a completely different background than everyone, and they rejected me because I behaved differently. Funny how I had the same differences with people who were my friends (one lived in affluence that I can still hardly conceive of). Another thing that I could never explain was that other people from my background adapted really easily with the white kids. I thought maybe I was just weird or something. Of course, I was proud to be weird since I hated just about everyone in that place.

In late highschool and through college (I’m about to graduate), I began to play up my Roma and Iroquois heritage. I started telling people I wasn’t completely white, and that it was important to me that I had other heritage. Most of the time, they just scoffed, “you’re just white.” Other times, they would go “Woooow, you’re a gypsy!” This was my white girlfriend’s reaction.

I was with her for three years. On the last year of our relationship, I realized that she didn’t even know anything about me. She would do things that she had always done, and was always surprised when I didn’t like it. After three years, she still knew nothing about me. One thing she did know about me was that I was her “gypsy boy.” I always knew that she didn’t really like me, just the idea of me, but it was only later I realized I was being fetishized. I wasted three years with someone who wanted to brag to her friends that her boyfriend was a gypsy. Of course, some people identify me as white, so I’ve known people who have had it faaaar worse than me.

The first time I had a genuine emotional connection with someone was with a black feminist. She was as big a slut as I am (her words, and she was proud to be), so even though we initially didn’t like each other, we eventually collided. We had both gotten to the point where we had about lost faith in humanity, and we both knew that the other could get one of us to make ourselves vulnerable. Being vulnerable was something neither of us wanted. It happened, though, in a very controlled fashion. She was also from a predominantly white town, but her makeup was clearly half-black. Her major awakening happened when she went to University, when she finally had a movement to get behind, when the things she was feeling were validified by others who had the same experience. The more she talked about how most of the guys she dated were just mystified by the fact she was black, the more I reflected on my own experiences of being a human novelty. The more she revealed my own cultural prejudices, the power of modern racism, and the experiences of others, the more I really started to look critically at my life and the world in general. One thing will always stick with me though, she was the first person who outright stated “You’re not white.” It felt like a weight was lifted, I wasn’t just some white guy who was trying to show off his non-whiteness, she thought it was a real thing. Of course, we had to part, but we left on good terms although I still piss her off all the time.
I’ve now been living in South Africa, where I am absolutely white to everyone in terms of this culture. It’s been a strange parallel to life in the US, but I’ve definitely learned what it’s like to be white unequivocally. I have power here and everyone knows it. The police are at my disposal and people are universally open to me and constantly show me respect. Everyone respects the fact that me and others like me are in power. I never experienced this in the states. I hate the fact that it’s like this, and I hate the fact that it’s like this in the States, but over there I might be on the other side of the equation.

So here I am now, about to go back to the states after observing the culture objectively from abroad for a year, kind of dreading going back to it. I despise white American culture, and every typical American I’ve met abroad has pissed me off just by nature of their behavior (I find white American culture to be decadent, sensational, closed-minded, racist, willfully ignorant, arrogant, xenophobic, exclusive, and generally distasteful at all income levels, especially white people who claim to different and object when you call them out). It’s an unfortunate prejudice I’ve developed, but I’m beginning to think it’s defensive.
Now, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m not white, although raised to think that I was. The problem is, I have no alternate culture to defer to. I’m the only one with Roma blood that I’ve ever met (where I live, I’ve known Roma elsewhere), and I’m quite distanced from the Iroquois. The last time I tried to communicate with Native Americans, they dismissed me as white (as I think roughly 100% of white Americans claim some Indian heritage). So, I’m nothing, I can hardly even be called mixed especially when you look at most of my family. Here are some questions: Am I just white? Am I just finding shit in my life to pretend I’m a victim because I don’t like the idea of being white? Are there other factors I’m not considering? Is there anyone in my situation? Has anyone else just found out that society doesn’t think they are what they thought they were?

And finally, because you were curious about my controversial face, this is it:

Please send me any other studies you know about that I haven't included.

**Evidence for the black-white unemployment gap:**

(1) Current unemployment: According to the US Dept. of Labor, as of August 2, 2013, [black unemployment is at 12.6% and white unemployment is at 6.6%](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm).

(2) Historical unemployment: [the unemployment rate of blacks has been roughly double the unemployment rate of whites since 1972](http://trueslant.com/megancottrell/2010/06/11/should-we-fix-the-blackwhite-wealth-gap/).

**Explanations for the black-white unemployment gap (support for the theory of institutional racism):**

(a) [Job applicants with African-American names are less likely to be called back than job applicants with white names](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873).

(b) From the study cited in (a): [Improved credentials increase white job applicants' likelihood of being called back by a statistically significant 30%. Improved credentials increase black applicants' likelihood of being called back by a non-statistically significant 9%](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873.pdf?new_window=1).

(c) [Black male wages are 71% of white male wages for comparable work. Educational differences and self-selecting lower paying jobs account for some but not all of the wage gap](http://www.epi.org/publication/whiter_jobs_higher_wages/).

(d) Traditionally, it has been understood that blacks are last hired and first fired. A study in the journal Demography found that ""[blacks are the first fired as the business cycle weakens](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3000014/)"" although the study did not find evidence of blacks being last hired.

(e) [Spatial mismatch geographically isolates blacks from jobs](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2005/2/metropolitanpolicy%20stoll/20050214_jobsprawl.pdf).

(f) [Whites with criminal records are more likely to receive job callbacks than blacks without criminal records](http://www.princeton.edu/~pager/pager_ajs.pdf).",,False,,t5_2qhgd,1375980474.0,,,True,t3_1jxsu1,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1jxsu1/blackwhite_unemployment_gap/,

I'm just pissed off at all the racists I've had to deal with recently. Every time I get over it, some shit happens again.

I have spent the past 7 months in France, and have about 3 more left. I am an American (Halfie), who has only really lived/visited the coasts. I was unused to racism before coming here, and being here (not in France in general, but the places I've lived) is basically constantly white people being racist to everyone else, and the minorities being racist as shit to everyone except their race, and white people. Most days there are some random assholes saying ""oppa gangnam style"" and shit like that whenever I walk by, not to mention all the social connections saying shit like ""oh so [you/parents/other family/etc] must be [insert random douchey generalization of being asian here]""

So tell me, why should I give someone a second chance when they say horrible racist shit? The few times they apologize they just go on to do it a few more times that week, if not the same day. I'm tired of most people being offensive to me everyday then claiming ""But we aren't racist! You're just overreacting""- all the while 99% of social connections being white people or people of the same race.

I do get it, they don't know what it's like, especially not where I live in France; but I really just am too fed up with it to feel like forgiving people anymore.

If it does, I hope it teaches me something.

Today, I got into an argument with a friend over Facebook who posted a status that said something to the affect of ""sometimes I wonder why I have white friends.""

I impulsively attacked her, telling her how ignorant it was to make blanket statements that make implications about any one race, pointing out that such statements perpetuate racial oppression.  My initial belief was that she of all people should think it absurd to make racial generalizations because she, as a black woman, probably has some idea of what its like to be directly oppressed because of her skin color.  She said things like ""sorry I'm black,"" which further confused me.  

Was I blindly acting of my own ""white privilege"" by denouncing her words as racist toward white people?  

Is it ignorant of me, as a white person, to even feel oppressed/offended by that?  

In any case, I've effectively confused the hell out of myself.  I'd really appreciate some insight and opinions on the matter.  Specifically, I'm looking for some enlightenment regarding ""white privilege,"" ""white guilt,"" and how they coincide with both racism and perhaps anarchist beliefs.

At a campfire, I was telling a joke I heard from my father, which at the time, I didn't know had any offensive connotations.

""Three world leaders are in a sinking boat, and in order to lighten the load, they must each throw away their most abundant resource.

The German says ""I will throw this beer overboard. We have too much of this.

The Mexican says ""I will throw this burrito overboard. We have too much of this.""

The American picks up the Mexican and says ""We have too much of this"" and throws him overboard""

I get a couple scattered laughs, but then I look slightly behind my left, and there was an Hispanic kid, giving me a weird look. I just sorta sunk back into my seat, and pulled my blanket over my head, and decided to reevaluate any decisions to repeat what my dad says in public.

I'm a teenager, 18 on the August 31st. I live in Malaysia, a multi-racial country and I love it. The place where I'm at right now consists mostly of Chinese and a small amount of Indians and Malays.

I started college about 2 months back, at the beginning it was fun. I socialised a lot, way more than at high school. Then this started. I get mocked on a daily basis on my skin colour. I mean, I know I'm dark.. why do they need to mock me about it? In particular, 2 students which are both Chinese males. My entire class consists of Chinese students(except me) and when one of those 2 guys make a joke about me.. the whole class laughs. Only reason I'm not standing up for myself is because I'm not too muscular. I'm a thin soft-spoken introverted guy and I tend to keep to myself. I don't want to end up getting hated by the entire class just because I stood up for myself.

I decided to seek advice cause I just got a message on my class group on whatsapp with a meme pic saying ""I can't see my black friends in the dark"" with reference to me. I'm so annoyed. I don't want to see a teacher, neither do I want to stand up for myself. Help me.

Racism, as it pertains to our laws and society can only move one way: from white people, or the majority 'race,' to the minority. Racial prejudice is, not in its strictest sense, racism. A minority can be racially prejudice against white people (although understandable if they are), but that is not the same as racism. Racism, the same thing we fought against in the civil rights era to reaffirm the intent of the 14th amendment is about evening out the power dynamic so that white populations cannot use institutions to unduly prohibit minority populations from entering places of public accommodation, jobs for which they are qualified, and schools that are otherwise funded in some part by tax dollars.  Although I find any disparaging remark or attitude based on race to be detestable, it is not apples to apples when the 'racism' goes from a minority to whites. A surprisingly good example of this is the water park episode on South Park. I feel that this is an important point to remember. It means there is a quasi-double standard; but that standard reflects the harsh realities of true racism.

Here is the info about what took place @ the Citgo Gas Station on 99th Halsted &amp; why my family is administerinf a STAND UP PICKET...

On June 27,2013 an unfortunate event occurred in the neighborhood in which some of us currently live, grew up, went to school and or have family/friends who once or still lives in. The Citgo gas station 99th Halsted NE corner of 99th street is where this unfortunate event occurred.

I am calling for everyone to STAND UP!! This is what happened.
My 4y/o son, husband James and I stopped at this station before baseball practice. We went for the baseball essentials, Gatorade, water and sunflower seeds. While looking around for the seeds, we couldn't find the brand of seeds we prefer, so we picked out some more and went to the counter to pay. Upon reaching the counter, I asked the man at the register do they carry the particular brand we were looking for. Unfortunately, his reply is what has warranted this notice.

Yelling.....""You all have no right coming in here telling me what I should have. All you people do is come here and spend 2 and 3 dollars at a time. You niggers don't have shit and won't ever have shit."" After words were exchanged between him and my husband, of course we left the store without purchasing anything. Well this wasn't enough for the man who claims he owns this station, he followed us out said more demeaning words to my family all while throwing candy at us as if we were dogs.

Confused, my son asked ""Mommie why is that man talking so mean and throwing things at us? All we wanted were some snacks. He also asked; What is a black nigger?"" As my heart drops, now, at 4years old, I have to begin talking to our son about the way the world is....

Disrespecting a man in front of his wife and children is something a man should never be faced with. Being called black niggers in front of our son leaves us eager to teach both of our sons to fight back using forward conscious actions!

It is NEVER ok to use racial slurs. If this person had the audacity to say these things to adults, imagine what he may be saying to the children who frequent the store without adult supervision. This business owner in a predominantly African American neighborhood verbalized disrespect to our neighborhood and us as a people. Again, I am asking for everyone to STAND UP!!

Next Sunday July 21,2013 @ 10 am 1 week from today, I am asking for everyone to show up to the Citgo to Picket.

We as a people need to STAND UP and send a message to those who come into our communities to make a living but degrade, disrespect and lack appreciation for our patronage. Please help my family and I STAND UP to inform the community of the stereotypical, racial profiling and disrespect that this business has shown and will continue to show if we don't STAND UP! Let's not spend money there and inform others so they won't either.",,False,,t5_2qhgd,False,,,True,t3_1ikwlx,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1ikwlx/chicago_gas_station_attendant_calls_african/,

I keep telling him that Zimmerman has a car and Trayvon had legs, if he wanted to flee, he could have fled.

Tonight was the biggest club in the game, Collingwood, playing the Sydney Swans who are the reigning champions. So this had a crowd of over 60 000 and and would have had hundreds of thousands viewers.
This round is also Indigenous Round. It is a round set up to celebrate everything the Indigenous people of Australia (the Aborigines) have contributed to the game and the culture of Australia. This year marks 20 years since one of the most famous photos in AFL history was taken - Nicky Winmar lifting up his shirt and pointing to the colour of his skin after being abused and spat on for simply being Aboriginal.

Tonight, one of the champions of our game, a leader of the Indigenous community was racially abused by a fan. He pointed her out, she was evicted and it serves as another win in the fight against racism. It will be one of the iconic moments in Australian sporting history in regards to racism, the big stage, a champion of the game/leader of the community, standing up for his basic rights.

Would also like to say that the person who made the racist comments was only a 14 year old girl, so education for her is the key, not a vile stream of comments over the internet! The AFL and the industry as a whole will make sure she gets taught, I just wanted to bring to attention another incident of racism but with an outstanding response.

As a trainee soldier this attacked me hard, especially after watching the video so I decided to comment, so here is a transcript of what happened. Just want to add that I am of Indian heritage.

&gt;Me
&gt;I'm a trainee soldier and seeing that body, no soldier deserves this shit. If their own countries weren't trying to oppress their people so badly we wouldn't be there in the first place.﻿ Words can't justify what the hell they did, revenge? Bullshit, the war in afghan is due to the supressive taliban who we're tryna stop. Our training never says look out for foreigners to kill, we limit our fire unless we're attacked. Basic training 101

&gt;Really? I'm risking my life for you people, I've seen soldiers come back missing limbs or worse, and you're gonna racially insult loads of people here yh? I'm born and bred British, probably done more with my life in 3 years than you ever will, and actually do the world some good and you're gonna insult me and some﻿ of the others on here based on race? Genius. Show some respect.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;Him
&gt;Sorry, a brown Indian can not be born and bred British.
&gt;What﻿ about that is hard for you to get?
&gt;Being British means you are indigenous to Britain.
&gt;Welsh, Scottish, Irish, English, Cornish, and so on.
&gt;Not Indian.
&gt;You people turned the entire Indian Subcontinent into a rape filled dump.
&gt;And now you want to do the same to the UK, not happening.

&gt;Funny last time I checked all of Britain started off foreign. Vikings from Scandanavia, all﻿ Scots have heritage from Spain and Greece, same goes for Wale and the Celts. There is no such thing as indigenous Brit yh? Now apart from the fact we have Gurkhas who've saved the Brits time and time again, and the other way round. Now how about you get of you racist ass and do humanity some good.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;Him
&gt;You're a moron.
&gt;Vikings from Scandinavia?
&gt;All Scots have Greek and Spanish heritage?
&gt;lol, shut the fuck up you dumb shitskin cunt.
&gt;There has been genetic consistency in the UK population for at least 10,000 years, this has long been proven by anthropologists.
&gt;the Norman/Viking/Roman invasions had a tiny impact on the population as a whole.
&gt;Gurkas are not British either, you will wake﻿ up tomorrow as a smelly shitskin living in someone else's homeland just like you did today.

1367123038.0,6,self.racism,1d98kx,I never really witnessed racism before... but now I think I finally understand how messed up it is and feels.,10,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1d98kx/i_never_really_witnessed_racism_before_but_now_i/,"Honestly, throughout my life, I've only witnessed racism on tv. Never really believed it and really I never thought I would witness racism in my life but I guess I finally did. And even though it probably isn't even close to what others go through, it really, pissed me off and made me angry and yet I think I need to learn how to react to such things.

Okay to start off. I'm brown and live in a multicultural community in Canada so really I don't expect racism at all.

Today, I had a programming contest to go to with a group (all brown). There were 53 teams there and surprisingly, we were the only brown team there. The rest were asian and white. Before the contest starts, a lady was explaining the rules, which I'll get back to later in the story. 

So the contest starts, there are 4 problems we have to solve. Our group, solved the first problem in 4 minutes. The first one to solve it out of 53 teams. We raise our hand to get it checked. This guy comes, don't really think there is a need to mention his race, therefore I won't, but he comes with a partner. He gives us a usb and from the start, I knew I didn't like him because his attitude to us was really aggressive and he was really being rude to us. He says in a loud voice. You're going to take this usb, plug it in, copy the data file, eject the usb, then take it out. We say okay and we start to do what he says. Just to ensure, my friend asks, this is the data file we have to copy right? He replies, ""how bout you read your paper?"" Then, ""Did you guys even learn how to read?"". My friend states, ""We were just making sure because we have never seen this data file before."" He didn't really say anything after that and looked away. My friend ejects it and then I take the usb out. Then he screams at us, ""DID YOU EJECT IT?"" We said yes, he didn't believe us so he had to ask his partner if we ejected it and his partner replied yes, and I could see he was a nice guy just by looking at him. 

So after he calls some lady (the one that explained the rules at the starting) and as soon as she comes. She says we are disqualified. Apparently because we have preset code in our computer. I mean come on? We have to bring our own laptop that we have programmed on to practice. Of course we are going to have preset code somewhere in our laptop? She just says nope, you guys are out because I specifically stated at the start you are not allowed to use preset code. Then I replied and honestly it was the in a respectful tone I said, ""Actually, you stated we are not allowed to use preset code, not we are not allowed to have."" She replies, ""I don't like your attitude."" Then a long awkward pause. Then she said it's not my job to explain the rules, you need to read the rules on the rule book (which we did recieve). So by now 5 minutes into the contest, we are already out... 

Then what really pissed me off. She goes up to the microphone and states, ""If anyone has any preset code in there laptop, you'd best delete it right now, or else you will be disqualified. We have already disqualified one team for this."" THEY GET A WARNING AND A CHANCE TO DELETE THERE CODE... and we don't? Are you serious??? 

Sadly there's more to this, the same guy that was talking really rude to use, went to another group to check there problem, and of course that group was the same race as him. I swear, that group asked this question ""Which data file is it?"" while we asked, ""Is this the data file we use"". He simply replied, ""Guys, you guys need to read the problem sheet."" and that's it. These guys that he replied this too were like right infront of us to the right. So we head it loud and clear, and we just got so mad. Yet couldn't do anything about it. I know this probably isn't the most racist thing you guys have heard, but really it was the only time I felt racism towards me and it sucked. I really hated it.

Thoughts? Am I just being a little too sensitive about this? or is it right for me to get mad at this and how should I have handled this?",,False,,t5_2qhgd,False,,,True,t3_1d98kx,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1d98kx/i_never_really_witnessed_racism_before_but_now_i/,

My current project is a 10-15 minute documentary that aims to explore race relations in colleges all across America. Myself and the filmmakers I work with are not looking to make a film that takes a strong stance one way or another on race relations. However we have noticed that many feel there is an issue and many others don't even know that issue exists. That disconnect is what we would like to explore.

The film is going to be constructed through outreaches to the community like this: crowd sourcing. Rather then laboring on about our own opinions on the way students of different racial backgrounds relate to one another, we want to hear from you! Anything you can submit is helpful. Even if its just to say you do or don't like the project. Comments online, text emails, video submissions, images, skype interviews, anything would be great!

I know I have prejudice, and it truly upsets me as an individual, but I don't know how to fix it without talking about it. I'm not talking about stereotypes, those are logically invalid, I'm talking about as an individual I have feelings that while I accept them as completely illogical but are involuntary in my reaction. 

I know this sounds terrible, and I feel terrible for having these responses, because I truly believe each individual is just themselves. At the same time however I have a response to someone of a difference race. It's not the acknowledgement of stereotypes but the acknowledgement of them being of a difference race at all. I want to just see people, and I grew up in sheltered area and so when I see someone of a different race I partially consciously acknowledge it. I just want to see people as people and don't know the stepping stones to get there, because as much as I don't want to see ""races"" I still do. How can I fix that.

TL;DR: I see races, but the best way to move beyond that. I don't see anything but individuals so how to I get to seeing past it because I want to change and want to have help to get past it.

I really don't hope you don't take offense to this, I want to change I just fully don't know how. I'm sorry. ",,False,,t5_2qhgd,False,,,True,t3_puxe6,http://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/puxe6/i_want_to_have_an_honestly_better_understanding/,
