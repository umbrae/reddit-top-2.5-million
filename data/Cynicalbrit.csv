It's about time I think. The last AMA I did was over a year ago and it was mostly Starcraft focused. I'm here to answer your questions today. After the AMA is done, if it works out well and I have time, I'll turn the AMA into a gigantic bloody video with expanded answers and banter. 

It is AMAA (Ask me Almost Anything) because I will not talk about my income. Partners generally don't do that because people get weird around money and the networks we are partnered with encourage us not to talk about it, so the amount of money I make is off limits, as are questions like ""how much did Video X make you?"". Everything else is ok, within reason.

Ask away.

**Alright folks I'm wrapping it up. Answered over 300 questions so I hope I didn't miss too many.

I like the name, it's got some cool connotations.

1) It's game-related and instantly identifiable by enthusiasts

2) It's got the whole ""nicotine patch"", get your fix thing going on

3) It's where the content comes from, it grows in the Content Patch, obviously, along with the lettuce.

4) It's descriptive of what the show is, regular gaming content updates with actually using the word ""update"" or ""news""

Format-wise it's pretty straight forward. Nothing fancy, just really well presented gaming news and punditry. It'll give me a chance to present the news as well as add a little cynical commentary to it that will hopefully be entertaining. A tiny bit of Blue Plz! styling could come into play. The last few minutes of the show will be dedicated to the user question, the best answers will be shown there. 

I've taken some lessons from Azeroth Daily, I want this to be less of a slide-show, so along with Zooc, we put together a layout that will look slick and high quality but also provide plenty of video-assets to accompany the stories where available. OCRemix music will provide the background bed, since I very much liked the idea of putting music in the background a'la Azeroth Daily and my older podcasts.

This is a proof-of-concept layout that Zooc put together for the show - http://imgur.com/k8h8K This is bare-bones, the final result will be far nicer. The rounded-screen to the right is designed to show footage and images where appropriate while giving a consistent, uniform feel to the presentation.

I'm hoping this show will have some nice cross-appeal. It'll be current and interesting as was The Mailbox but with less reliance on user-submitted content. It seems like a win/win for everyone. 

The show will air Monday-Friday as the Mailbox did and we're shooting for 15 minute episodes. I'm also looking into having Zooc host it while I'm unavailable so we don't have huge content gaps like The Mailbox did. It makes more sense with this format since delivering the news is something you can do with relative neutrality whereas Mailbox lived or died on the basis of my opinions.

It's been a good run. Thanks to those who followed the Mailbox. The audience for that show doubled during it's run, which for a purely gaming-centric opinion piece was quite the thing. It remains one of the most watched gaming-opinion shows on Youtube but it's time to try and take the concept further and ramp up the attempts to inform, educate and entertain gamers.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_129ed3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/129ed3/the_new_show_will_be_called_content_patch/,

Radio engineer here.  We've spoken a few times over twitter, but that is a profoundly poor medium for giving advice on sound equipment.  I've worked in college radio for upwards a dozen years now.  Congratulations on your purchase of an EV RE20.  It's one of the best microphones for spoken word, full stop.  The [station](http://www3.amherst.edu/~wamh/index.html) where I currently work has three of them.  I have used an RE20 to record voiceovers for an independent film.  In every instance that I have used the it, the RE20 has delivered the sound I've needed.  As a bonus, it's built to a fairly tough standard, making it resistant to the abuse dished out by drunken and overzealous college kids.

I noticed you've had some trouble getting your audio interface to play nice with the EV.  I'm not sure what model it is, but I suspect its mic preamp section is not up to the task.  In all my years in radio, I have seen one mic preamp used more than all others *combined* and that is the [Symetrix 528E.](http://www.symetrix.co/products/analog-application-specific-resources/528e-voice-processor/)  My station has 3 of them to go with our 3 RE20s (you can see them in the splash bar photo on the WAMH site, hidden behind acrylic rack covers so the $%&amp;*  college students don't futz with the controls.)  Speaking of controls, upon an initial glance, the 528E might appear to be overly complex and intimidating to set up.  It's not a consumer product, but I can assure you that an engineering degree is not a prerequisite to operating one.  The most important thing to have is a working pair of ears.  [This site](http://support.symetrix.co/s.nl/ctype.KB/it.I/id.481/KB.4372/.f) offers a crash course in setting up the 528E.  My own personal preferences are a bit different, but I can say that guide is a very good place to start.

The only other major concern with the 528E is the price.  It might seem steep, but for professional grade equipment, it really isn't.  Preamps have a lot of expensive analogue components in them and are not subject to market forces the way digital technology is.  When it comes to mic pres, the 528E is a relative bargain.  Things can get [a lot worse.](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SLAM)

If you do decide to get a 528E and have trouble setting it up after following that guide, I might be able to be some some assistance in fine-tuning it.  Whatever you choose to do, thanks for all the videos and countless hours of entertainment.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_13fbfm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/13fbfm/attn_mr_biscuit_re_your_new_microphone/,

It was awesome, so we sent them free stuff and posted it here for you to check out[/b]

Before you close this e-mail: I have personally gone through the first ~1000 comments on ""VLOG - Are you still there?"" and turned their opinions/reasons into a form of statistical data that you guys might be able to use. 

I'm extremely sorry if these aren't the correct ways to contact you for this. The options were Public Relations or Business, both of which sounded too formal, but I couldn't find a general-purpose address anymore (other than snail mail). To be safe, I'm trying both, and I apologise for any problems that may cause! I'm posting my results below in text, as I was afraid you would dismiss an e-mail with a word/excel document attached.

(I know 1,000 is only a fraction of all 15,700 comments, which is only a fraction of 82,600 views, but this is just a representative sample, and the spread was largely consistent as I went through and is hopefully able to be extrapolated. Either way, this is just a tool, not necessarily answers - and at most I just hope that it helps you, if only to reinforce (or even contradict) your own impressions or findings. Keep in mind it's always possible that later discussion bred topics never brought up early on, as many of the topics listed here are ones TB brought up himself in the video, and were likely on people's minds.)

(There was some overlap in opinions, so may not represent exactly 1000 on-topic comments, but it does represent people who gave more than one reason.)
Note: Off Topic contains not just spam, double posts, trolls, jokes, etc... but also many comments where people very vaguely guessed at why others might not be watching, instead of giving their own reason for (not) watching. e.g. ""I think kids these days just have short attention spans and so tune out quickly, but I'm not like that so I dunno really."")

________________
Below is a more expanded account of my results:

LEGEND:


(###) - Number of people whose reason/opinion fit into this category.


[###] - A notable subset of a larger category. (Not extra data, just showing a ratio of explicitly stated reasons).
No direct quotes - The sentences under each category are generalized paraphrases of the most common things I saw said. They are to give context/examples of what I saw (roughly in order of frequency). They do not necessarily represent my personal opinion, though I admit there is potential for personal bias to have influenced my interpretation of what people said.)

(Bracketed sentences are notes of mine.)


* I Just Didn’t Care for the Games (208)

* The games simply didn’t interest me/hadn’t heard of them so I didn’t click. [170]

* Too many indie games. [38] So many 2D Platformers, it’s getting ridiculous! Feels underwhelming/uninspired unless it's the next Braid/Bastion/Minecraft, in which case I've already heard of it and know to click. I would prefer more AAA coverage.

(NOTE: Most people made explicit they felt this was nobody/PAX’s fault, nothing to do with your coverage. “Just a bad year for PAX.”)

* Enjoy Convention Content – Want more (132)

(Multitude of reasons, usually just expressed they enjoy your convention coverage and hope you’ll continue to cover events, though will understand if you stop.)

* Uninterested in Convention Content (118)

* Simply dislike convention coverage in general, by anyone – won’t miss it. [58]

* Feel it’s all about developer sales pitches. Everyone is too agreeable over things that seem sub-par and uninteresting.

* I associate Youtube coverage of conventions with bad quality videos [4]
(Aknowledged their predjudices and gave your coverage a shot, saying it was better than they anticipated.)
* Interested only in your regular content [56]

Mostly WTF is... and Content Patch (Lots of overlap)
Some Starcraft/Terraria/Blood Bowl
Not necessarily anti-convention coverage, just convention-coverage-TB just doesn't feel right/interest me.


* Games are too far from Release (105)
Dislike hearing about games that aren’t done/releasing quite soon [82]
Recent game scandals have made early-promises and hype into painful concepts – Developer says the game is good? Well, the proof is in the pudding.


(NOTE: Just scandals such as Aliens: CA, SimCity, The WarZ, and their misleading advertisement/failure to deliver.)
If alpha-presentation is ""not indicative of the final product"", then why is it being shown off? I only want to know about what I’m actually getting, as next year it could be completely different.


New Indie games come out every week – I’d rather know about them as I can play them right now. I’ll forget everything about your unfinished game even a month from now – it’s simply not relevant yet.


(One person suggested: ) Inverse proportional video length – the farther away the release date, the shorter the coverage.


* Specifically enjoy seeing early coverage [15]

* Only look up what’s currently on Steam [8]

* Lack of Criticism in the Journalism Format (100)

I come to this channel because of TB's ability and willingness to give honest, fair, and reasoned criticism, which is missing in convention coverage.

I come for your opinion, TB. Without that, you may as well be a generic journalist with generic gameplay footage – I can get that anywhere.

TB’s interaction with developers feels too disingenuous – over-politeness for the developer’s sake robs the footage of what makes TB’s content unique.

You can give criticism/feedback on pre-alpha games while still forgiving alpha-bugs – art direction, controls, game mechanics, use of QTEs, apparent design flaws, etc... Give us raw opinion in a way that makes this coverage your coverage. Something that wont insult the developers, but help them.

It just feels like a large commercial.

(This tied in a lot with Developer Presence)

* Youtube Problems (64)

Your videos didn't show up in my feed.
Youtube’s confusing new layout impossible to navigate!
I didn't realise I had been auto-unsubscribed from your channel...

* Too Busy to follow Content (60)

(In order of frequency:) Easter Holidays with family, Spring Break, Exams, was at PAX myself, etc...

* Opinions on Developer Co-Commentary (49)

* Developer commentary is bad [36]

Their mere presence changes TB from The Cynical Brit into Generic Polite Games Journalist.
Too eager to sell the game on buzzwords.
Too nervous, it’s distracting.
Repetitive information in attempt to always be saying something.

* Developer commentary is good [13]

Interesting insight into developer mindset you don't otherwise get.
Generally enjoyable to hear.

* Your Convention Coverage is still of less quality to your usual standards (38)

* Unavoidable crowd noises are off-putting [29]

It's not your fault, there's nothing you can do about it, but it just bugs me too much.
I like to listen to your videos while I do other things, and the crowd sounds just break my comfort/ability to multi-task effectively.
English isn’t my first language and sadly the crowd makes it impossible to understand at times. (At least two people said this.)

* Unspecified [9]
(Not altogether helpful, though didn't seem like trolls).

* Too many videos at once (27)

My feed is flooded with your videos that I miss many of them.
I see so many videos and I feel I have to watch them all, but don’t have the time and I end up watching none.

* Suggest new approach to convention coverage (26)

Make the experience more personal!

Something only TB can provide. [9]

Walk around and have fun, film fun events, don’t just cover the games!

Give us more of your convention experience – all the other info is available from any other outlet.

This doesn’t have to be the focus of content, but have something to break up the wall of professional coverage with some more personal/human moments, like how you break up a drama with comic relief or you stress out your audience.

After gaming go aside somewhere quiet where you can express your opinion more candidly.

While you're running a business, you're running one that is largely personality driven.

Show more of Gen and Zooc! (Least mentioned... &gt;.&lt; Sorry guys!)

I'd prefer summaries of convention information over individual coverage [10]

Summarise more information into armchair personal impressions videos, like you did more recently.

Do your coverage of games through Content Patch – game footage in background but more concise and focused summaries.

Do more Upcoming Schedule videos, so we know what to look forward to instead of seeing random, unknown games that we skip over – I have less motivation to click unknown videos without lead-up.

I'd like more actual one-on-one interviews with developers, like you did with Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning [5]

Your approach to game demos is too unstructured [2]

It's effectively like watching the first 20 minutes of a Let’s Play - usually the least entertaining bit.

Needs more structure, a method that gives a slightly more comprehensive view of the game, as the experience-by-proxy doesn't work. Something like explore certain mechanics viability first, then look at texture quality, then lighting, etc... rather than just letting things come to mind.

* Your Channel's Presentation of the Videos confused me (22)

Lack of ‘WTF is...’ branding [14]

Hard to distinguish your content from the other videos in my Feed, so I accidentally skipped over them.
What happened to “WTF is... PAX Edition!”?

* The new thumbnails were confusing for the same reason - I didn't recognise your content. [8]

* Uninterested in PAX (East) Specifically (19)

I'm not against convention content, I would just prefer E3, or GamesCom coverage.

I don’t understand why you would cover PAX...?

(The way these were said sorta felt like they were unaware that TB thinks that PAX is more impressive than E3 for games coverage.)

* Conventions are over-reported already (14)

My feed was absolutely flooded by all my subscriptions – I gave up following it.

Without your personal flair, nothing you present isn’t already available elsewhere. (Giant Bomb, IGN, other Youtube channels, etc...)

* Video length (13)

Too long for not saying much... I just don’t have the time. [8]

They're just the right length, keep it up! [3]

Some seem so short... It looks shallow in depth so I don’t click it. [2]

Claims on Youtube’s new way of calculation views (7)

Doesn’t Youtube only count people who watched the video right to the end now?
(NOTE: I noticed a lot of people saying they’d stop watching a video halfway through when they weren’t engaged by the game at hand. So many may have not reached the end, if this is a thing.)

Off Topic (134): (Deleted/Not considered, but representative of the ratio of comments that aren't actually relevant.)


Other information:

Order of breaking 100 opinions:

* First – I Just Didn’t Care for the Games

* Second – I Like Convention Content

* Third – Games are Too far from Release (Shortly after Off-Topic)

* Fourth – Lack of Criticism


Games most brought up, in rough order of frequency:

* Project Shield (mixed opinions – 28 mentions at 18:10 (I don’t care : I found it very interesting) )

* Transistor (favourable)

* Divekick (mostly negative)

* Daylight (mixed/generally negative, though some enthusiastic)

* Apotheon (mixed, art style liked, but often example of “Not more platformers...”)

* Battleblock Theater (generally favourable)

* Mark of the Ninja/Rise of the Triad (sparse, but generally favourable. Though common criticism on Mark of the Ninja for being DLC and not a full sequel.)

* Dungeon Defenders (generally positive, but often example of “Only other video I clicked on other than Transistor, because I recognised the name.”)

Food for Thought: Someone was just thinking out loud in the comments and said this (paraphrased, as I didn't copy it down), and I just found it interesting.

 

“Game channels seem to be split into time periods. There are Retro-Gamers who show off interesting stuff from the past, and Journalists with alpha-state coverage and upcoming stuff in the far future... Then there are gamers like TB who cover the present. With his WTF is... of games as they release, and commentary on current events in Content Patch, and I feel like he’s not only the best in this area, but that that’s where his strengths and charm lies.”

 

On a separate note, I noticed a comment like this or two:

 
""I know my comment wont be seen, but [helpful opinion]"" - xFriendlyNapalm
 
And realised that (unlike usual) an overwhelming amount comments were supportive, giving critical feedback in non-fanboy or trollish ways, but just wanting to contribute to help. There were only about five trolls in the ~1,136 comments I surveyed. I guess it’s just a little heartwarming to see the silent majority speak up and be heard.

I'd just like to take a little bit of time to express my true sympathies to both yourself and Genna for the situation that you find yourselves in at present.

To hear about people who genuinely care about their lives and professions to the extent that you both do is heartwarming. I respect you an incredible amount for how genuine you let yourself be in your presence on the web. Blowing up once in a while over twitter at the faceless mass of jealousy and entitlement is endearingly human. It's for this reason that I personally feel such a connection to you. Hell, I know we've never met and maybe never will, but that doesn't stop me wanting to let you know that I deeply respect both your work and the self that you give insight to online. 

In regards to Genna's wellbeing I can relate, having experienced severe depression myself. I wish you both all the best in managing the difficulties and pain that it brings. I know you probably won't ever see this, but I extend my most sincere offer of aid if you ever want it. I understand that it's horrible not knowing how best to support her, it's heartbreaking to see someone you deeply care about going through something so inexplicably crushing, Having been on both sides of the fence, sometimes at the same time, I can only offer my experience and advice. If not at least know that you've made enough impact on my life for me to sincerely want to help you.

I'm sorry if this is inappropriate at all and I hope that you can understand it's written with the best of intentions. I just want to let you know that people care, I care, and want you to be happier. Even with my miniscule role in your life as a fan I want to help in this small way that I can.

Yours,
Another human being.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_1kh9ve,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1kh9ve/well_wishes/,

I've prepared some content for the time I'm gone including Terraria, TGS Podcast and WTF is of upcoming games The Showdown Effect, Warlock Master of the Arcane and War of the Roses. As of right now, my rig in the US is non-functional, it won't power up for some unknown reason. I'm hoping the missus manages to resolve that today. My laptop is capable enough for video-creation, though obviously not as meaty as my main office machine. Worst comes to worst I can work on that if we can't get my new rig fixed in time.

Aside from a lack of Mailboxes (it is not practical to create Mailboxes in advance), you shouldn't see too much of a difference this week, though don't be surprised if there is a content gap after I get there. I have a tendency of coming down with something when I do transatlantic.

Usual show and upload times will not change. TGS Podcast will still be at 10pm BST/5pm EST/2pm PST every Saturday where it's practical to do one. Uploads will still occur, barring any problems, between 4pm CEST and 8pm CEST 6 days a week. As for livestreams like Showcraft yes they will be coming back, I've not determined when or in what form yet though.

That's the worst thing about the misuse of a word, it can cause the word to be forced out of regular speech just because some morons decided to run it into the ground. See the bitching I get about using the word ""Epic"" as part of my intro, even though I created that sample in 2005 before the whole ""epic"" meme even began.

Gamer entitlement is a real thing, regardless of what some people will tell you. However, there are an awful lot of folks who view things as absolutes, extremes, black and white. It's not ok for only some things to constitute gamer entitlement no, the entire phrase must be considered meaningless because ""lol whiteknights"" and other such nonsense. It is unfortunately indicative of the rather childish dialogue that seems to exist between vocal gamers who are really involved in the discussion for the sole purpose of upsetting other people. Media outlets are guilty of this as well, IGN went on it's now infamous rampage regarding ""gamer entitlement"", lambasting gamers for daring to criticize Mass Effect 3. The counter argument is that gaming entitlement is a myth. Neither of these are true, gamer entitlement exists, but as with many things in life, occupies a middle-ground.

Here's what in my opinion constitutes gamer entitlement vs what gamers are actually entitled to as consumers.

You are entitled to....

* The content that is on the disk when it is reasonable to do so. That means that content which is complete and functional prior to release should be included as part of the purchase price. Content that began it's development prior to release but is not in a finished state to the point where it will take significant time post-release to complete, should not be expected to be provided for free.

* A functioning product. If your system is to the correct specifications and does not have significant user-created problems preventing the product from running well (ie. clogged up with bloat/malware, improperly configured etc),  then the game should run to a satisfactory standard.

* A product that is properly configured for the platform it's on. This for the most part applies to PC, with options such as rebindable keys, proper kb/m support, FoV slider (or reasonable FoV to begin with) in FPS games and a proper options menu. It can also apply to consoles, though for the most part see ""a functioning product"" above for problems that console users have (see every Bethesda game ever for PS3).

* Post-release support to the point of ensuring that any technical problems which impede the proper operation of the product are fixed with patches.

* Rebalancing where necessary in multiplayer titles to ensure an enjoyable and fair gaming experience.

------------

You are not entitled to....

* Free content updates

* Content created especially for later versions of the product on other platforms. While it makes good business sense to provide this, it should not be expected for free if it does arrive.

* Provide creative input into the title and expect it to be implemented. You are not the designer. Feedback is useful but the developers are under no obligation to use it.

* Lambast, attack and insult members of the industry on a personal level just because they said something you didn't like. Consumer rights do not extend to that point and anyone that's ever worked retail will tell you that.

* Thursday : Hyper WTF is Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with Fony/akamikeb

* Friday : WTF is Kung Fu Strike?

* Saturday - WTF is Endless Space?

* Sunday - WTF is Unmechanical?

* Monday - WTF is Adventures of Shuggy?

I am in San Francisco for 3 reasons.

* To film and compete in a charity War of the Roses tournament. My team contains Seananners, Angryjoe, CTZ and an unannounced combatant. We'll be battling to win $5000 for the charity of our choosing. I'll be able to film in-game with FRAPs from my point of view, hopefully including the VOIP chat between the team. The event will be streamed live.

* To stream and compete in the ""Food Fight"", an event in which I and my team of progamers will be pit against EpicMealTime in the forthcoming MMORTS, End of Nations. Same deal, should be able to get a VoD of this.

* To visit and film at the developers of Natural Selection 2. Hoping to get a couple of videos of the game with developer commentary.

The upvote system of Reddit works much better than the upvote system on Youtube, which is completely useless. Here I can see the topvoted posts easily, on Youtube not so much. We're essentially allowing you guys to become a gigantic panel of internet judges but I will have the final say on which comments get on the show.

There are concerns that people could exploit the system to get their own comments on the show, but that's also the point of the peer-review, your opinion still needs to be interesting enough to get people on Reddit to upvote it.

There has definitely been success in regards to ""taking back"" the comments section. It's an overwhelming surge of interesting opinions and discussion as opposed to the usual bitching and flaming so I'd like to continue the experiment.

This thread can now be used to post interesting opinions on the subject of ""Modern Military Shooters"". Please bear in mind that dissenting opinions are also interesting, often far more so than the usual ""hurr durr CoD bad""

**Please copy-paste the full comment, including the name of the person who posted it so we can reference and credit them**

Planetside 2 launches on the 20th and it's time to announce hte outfit. We will be playing on the East - Waterson US server. This SHOULD be playable for EU folks though expect some lag. 

**What is it?** - Let the Brit Drop is a group of elite, fearless, gormless shock-troopers that specialize in 3 things, suicidal Light Assault play, massive Galaxy drops and obnoxious dubstep

**What are the requirements?** - The requirement is that you specialize in Light Assault at least to some degree. During operations you will be required to play Light Assault most of the time. It is our mission to jump walls en-masse and surprise the enemy. You must also at some point be willing to pilot a Galaxy dropship and we would recommend investing at least some certifications into it.

**What exactly do you do?** - We are the shocktroopers. We are the first ones in, sometimes the only ones in. We rely on shock and awe. Hundreds of soldiers scaling walls via the use of jet-packs or raining from the sky via the use of Galaxy drop ships. At that point we kill everyone on the walls and make our way as quickly as possible to the objectives. Take them or die trying, then move on. It's as simple as that.

**What Faction?** TR

**What Server?** East - Waterson US

**That's it?** - Yup, that's it. Nothing else is required. Be ready to scale the walls, drop from the sky and die over and over again. Success is far from guaranteed. You'll be able to contact me in-game for an invite to the outfit. I'd also recommend following my Twitter because that'll be where you'll hear about upcoming operations and other such amusing nonsense.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_13gwhv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/13gwhv/let_the_brit_drop_planetside_2_outfit_announcement/,

Nobody reasonable actually acts this way, that would be ridiculous, it's a videogame.

That video got 300,000 views in about a week. It's not a good video, it's a terrible video, deliberately so and it was also a bit of a test. Does my audience react well to that nonsense? The answer is yes, they do, they lap it up just like any other gaming YT channels audience does.

The question I have to ask is, why? Why did that video succeed? Why is ""rage"" funny? Were you aware that it was not genuine rage? Did you even care? I'd like to hear some opinions.

Contest is over. The winners are That_dumb_guy, Noodle155, linkingday, Carda39 and Rezudox. Here are their entries.

That_dumb_guy

A game cancelled by Activision

Probably by their budget division

Square Enix said hey

Send that game our way

So expect more cinematics than missions

----------------

Noodle155

There once was a guy called TB, Who fought with his friend called Jesse, 'You say this game sucks but here is the crux: You can go to the toilet and pee'.

------------------

linkingday

There once were some games called True Crime
And I thought they were quite sublime
Third was cancelled too soon
By some corporate goon
Now to Activision I won't give a dime

--------------------

Carda39

There once was a guy named TB / Who gave Sleeping Dogs out for free / But no one could win / 'Twas a horrible sin / Because no one had bothered to read

Rezudox

The man is a biscuit quite total,

His reviews are not anecdotal,

This game he flogs,

Its called sleeping dogs,

However, now that it has entered Open Beta, I must warn everyone here who is even remotely interested in it: CoS is Pay2Win.

The game now has an energy meter. Not the kind of energy that a WoW Rogue would use like mana, but rather a Facebook cow-clicker style of energy, one that restricts usage. Even though that isn't Pay2Win, the new Electrum Shop certainly is. Before, in Closed Beta, you could buy minor convenience items like crafting materials (borderline, but still acceptable in my opinion, as it's easy enough to find loads of the stuff in the wild), temporary skill boosts (again, found in the wild), and pets. Now, in Open Beta, nearly every item in the cash shop has stats attached directly to the items. Items you can buy at level 1, and blow away anything you might find naturally.

My advice to those interested in the game is to either watch it carefully to see if the devs/new publisher will get rid of this, or just avoid it and play something else (I suggest the gold standard of freemiums: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online).",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_1e6cjj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1e6cjj/warning_regarding_city_of_steam/,

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure many of you have realized that since this morning around 8:30 PST the absolutely wonderful http://www.youtube.com/my_subscriptions  page now redirects to the absolutely dreadful http://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions.
&gt;
&gt;For those that don't know the /My_subscriptions page had a very user-friendly and sensibly designed layout. You could easily find videos from everyone you were subscribed to without going to their channel page, new videos would pop up as soon as they were done processing in the new release tab, and it would remove videos from the new release tab after you had watched them. It was orderly, quick, and made browsing your subscriptions fast and easy.
&gt;
&gt;The /feed/subscriptions page is notorious for not showing videos randomly, has a awkward and unintuitive layout, will sometimes take quite some time before updating new videos, and directs you to a channel's page for new videos instead of a convenient list of that channel's new releases.
&gt;
&gt;I am bringing this too the attention of the Polaris Network in hopes that, as a large network that supports some of the largest channels on YouTube, they might be able to do something here. That the wide spread complaints won't fall on deaf ears. 
&gt;
&gt;Thank you. 
&gt;
&gt;~~EDIT: It appears that after many complaints, the /My_Subscriptions has been reinstated for now. While fantastic news, I feel that it would benefit us all if large networks like Polaris help build a more user friendly Youtube through civil discussions and by sharing user feedback. Thank you.~~
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: It seems they (Youtube) are occasionally re-enabling the /My_Subscription then disabling it again. Hopefully they'll make up their mind and choose correctly. I don't want rely on twitter and reddit to get video updates.

However, I am not here to discuss what changes we can make to the podcast to fix it. On the contrary, I want to remind everyone that, by and large this podcast has worked, and for all its problems the vast majority of podcasts have been good. I can already tell there will be massive calls for guest screening, massive format changes, etc. And while some improvements can certainly be made, I would like to caution against ruining the ""spirit"" of the show by changing it too drastically. There will always be guests who don't click, slow news weeks, and technical problems. That happens when you have 59 podcasts and counting.

I only use the sub to fill my need with SimCity content untill it's released. I've had trouble with that sub in the past, anytime I or anyone else brings up the topic of EA and its business model are automatcally downvoted to oblivion and anyone who says anything even remotely critical about aspects of the game are either downvoted, insulted or both. There are a lot of easily butthurt die hard SimCity fans in that sub and as you saw sometimes can be a pain in the arse.

Anywho your stream was extremely entertaining, it was a nice way to spend a Sunday hungover, although it was painful to watch at times =P but that's the same when you watch anyone play a game for the first time I guess. When the lizard decided to wreck your industrial area and die in your landfill, and when Genna came in and started arguing with you, it was extremely entertaining and I was laughing until my cheeks hurt.


Keep up the good work, and hopefully you'll make another SimCity video before release.

It's fairly unusual that I am able to give you guys a schedule of the games I'll be covering, however since I preparing a lot of videos in advance of leaving for PAX, I am able to share that list with you. This list is subject to change on the basis that something might go horribly wrong in the encoding process and I may have to adapt.

* Thursday: Blood Bowl vs Angry Joe
* Friday: WTF is Alien Spidy?
* Saturday: WTF is Go Home Dinosaurs!
* Sunday: WTF is Retro/Grade?
* Monday: WTF is Monsters Love You!
* Tuesday: WTF is Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space
* Wednesday: WTF is Sang Froid: Tales of Werewolves?

After PAX I am flying straight to Vegas. This was to be for the IPL6 tournament which has now been cancelled. I will however be going there regardless since our tickets are non-refundable and both Genna and Zooc will be there. We'll be taking a few days break after PAX East, which is an exhausting experience and will also be taking time to encode the many videos (we have more than 20 appointments) that we record at PAX East. Once this happens I will also be starting to upload PAX East content at a rate of about 2 videos a day. Content Patch will resume when I return from Vegas on April 2nd. Content PAX, a PAX-specific show discussing news and games I've seen at the show will be released on a daily basis while I am at the event.

One final thing. The Gamestation Podcast Live will be happening in the Wyvern Theatre at PAX East on Saturday at 5pm. We do not anticipate that we will be able to stream this, but there will be a VoD made available for you to watch if you don't attend. If you are planning on attending, please bear in mind the theatre is fairly small and it'll be first come first served. I dunno if we'll even fill it but just in case, get there in decent time to get your seats.

I'm attempting to be objective: the content I've seen come out so far has been really bad.  I was hoping that there would be some good shows coming out.  I know the demos for most gaming youtube channels are kids/teens, and that's fine (even [TB's demos can be skewed that way](http://i.imgur.com/kKYREj5.png)).  But it seems like so far the content that's come out on Polaris is trying *really* hard to cater to kids:

* Over-edited videos 
* Bright colors and goofy music
* No swearing for at least some of the shows?
* Did I mention the amount of over-editing?

Based on the shows that have come out so far (""FriendZone"" and ""PewDiePie &amp; Friends"") I'm feeling quite disappointed in the change.

Now I’ll admit I do enjoy his channel, but I’m not a fucking fanboy, so please, if you’d like to retort to what I say, don’t start with the line “Well you’re obviously biased.” 


The main thing that seemed to get on people’s nerves with what he said was the assertation that he didn’t care about his subscriber base. This is, in my opinion, something that people who haven’t experienced the utter bullshit that comes with being well known or easily recognizable can never understand. 


My connection to this phenomena, (let’s just call it Mob Stupidity) comes from the fact that I’m really fucking tall. “How does that matter?” You ask. It would surprise you how stupid average people get when around a Seven-Foot –One  tall individual. I’ve been the center of attention my whole life, and NEVER have I gotten a break from it. From the grocery store to the mall, my high school, college, and job experiences have always revolved at the fact that when people get into a “Hey, look at that” mentality, they become fucking retarded nine times out of ten. If you’re famous you get it from the mob people. If you’re different you get it. If you’re a gaming commentator you get it a thousand times over, whether you be someone like Totalbiscuit or a dude with fifty subscribers. And on youtube you get the extreme rude bullshit of internet mannerisms. I can guess that Totalbiscuit gets hate mail every day of his life, regardless of what he does. I’d make people angry too if I told people to fuck off whenever they asked me how tall I was. It’s really tempting at times. Not that ALL people are reatarded about it, I’m sure TB gets nice comments too, but you’d be surprised how common the other side is. 


But the thing is this, that “Mob Stupidity?” It makes those it’s directed towards feel one or both of two things, uncomfortableness, and anger. People have said really fucking stupid things at me, a drunk dude once said to me at a party: “Woahh! I bet your mom’s vagina is taller than Shaq!” That’s fucking terrible. I wanted to hit him in the face. Because people don’t realize how hard it is. I never get a break, it’s ALWAYS about the tallness when I meet people. Totalbiscuit obviously can lead a fairly normal life, because he might not be noticed in the average American grocery store, but that’s not the point. The point is this, he’s entitled to feel pissed when people, STUPID INTERNET PEOPLE demand things from him. When he says he doesn’t care about his subscriber base,  he’s both being brutally honest, and lashing out at the Mob Stupidity that the average Joe will never understand. He’s entitled to that, as much as I am entitled to tell people to go fuck themselves when they say I should join a Basketball team. Because it gets old. Really fast. 


And it probably isn’t the best PR for his channel when he says stuff that pisses people off, but I smile whenever I see him, or anyone else, doing it. Because in all honesty, it’s just giving the stupid’s of the world a taste of their own medicine. Lets them feel what it’s like to be cornered and judged. 


I’d be very interested in hearing what people think of this.

Livestreaming is something I've always liked doing, I started doing it over 10 years ago on my shitty dial-up connection doing pirate radio stuff, regularly broadcast on WoW Radio and before I even started the YT thing I was doing SC2 and gaming streams. Some people keep asking how I justify doing it when I'm so ""Anti Lets Play"". Quite frankly? I don't really need to justify anything. I keep the Lets Play stuff off the channel, I'm not pumping out tons of LP content every day just to make money off the back of someone else's game and every now and again it's nice to sit down and share a game with the fans via the medium of livestreaming. I'm starting to regret even taking a stance on LPs to be honest, they're actually not important enough to even get concerned about, not to mention the REAL people responsible for this current nonsense aren't the people making the content but the viewers that lap it all up and demand MOAR MOAR MOAR. Hell you can argue you'd have to be an idiot NOT to make as much money as you can while that particular trend lasts. I really wanted people to just understand that you should respect the work development teams put into games and not just see them as a means to pull stupid faces, spout memes and make a bunch of money because for some reason that's what every teenager wants to watch these days. This is something that a bunch of people put years of their life into and they probably didn't envision all that work being drowned out by someone speaking in a stupid voice and screeching at random intervals because apparently that's ""funny"" now. 

I'm strongly considering bringing some LP content onto the channel, but if I were to do it I'd do it right. When it comes to livestream stuff, that'll stay there unless there's a good reason to put it on the channel (ie. a special event like TB vs Athene or TB vs the Developers). The nice thing about putting this stuff on the livestream channel is that you don't have to bloody watch it, but apparently that's not enough for some people, they want control over the content you create and will shout at you if they don't get their way.

Anyway I hope you guys are enjoying the live content. Apparently you are since we had 12k concurrents on the stream for FTL, which is a crazy number.

This is of course irritating to the viewer, but also to you, I must figure, getting bombarded with questions as to when the next episode comes out.

I feel that a proper end to a series is needed. It doesn't have to be you finishing the game, I understand finding time can be hard, but a simple, 2 minute long Vlog stating that the series is over, or on hiatus until further notice, would save you a lot of annoyance when it comes to receiving questions.

I like this. I think it is a good thing to have some things that break away from the format for a laugh while still being informative.

Unfortunately, I don't feel like these attempts at variety have been positively met. However, I feel that these are really just teething pains. I think the Greenlight Cat video was only met with a poor reaction because people weren't expecting satire from TB. It's not something he's done much of in the past and not something that most people expect when they pull up a TB video. I got the point immediately and enjoyed the video and saw a game I'd never heard of.

Another teething pain would be a slight drop in quality in these experimental videos. I mean, honestly, an off-format video isn't going to be as good as a format that's been practiced for 3 years. For example, I didn't really enjoy The Cynical Redub. I think it needed more dubstep and to be named The Cynical Redubwubwubwub. But seriously, I didn't really enjoy it but I appreciate the attempt and see a lot of potential for this sort of thing as TB gets the hang of it. I expect to enjoy future videos of this format.

One off-format video I did enjoy was the Planettary Annihilation video, though this was admittedly less off-format than the others. I was one of the viewers who was sad to see convention footage and developer interviews go. This video felt reminiscent of the convention footage minus the developer.  I feel like seeing the journey a game goes through before it hits player's hands is a very good thing. I was surprised to see that some people disagree with me (I know right? That never happens on the internet). I noticed that people were complaining that PA was too far out and that the game wasn't fit to show yet (Despite being clearly marked Alpha). I feel that gamers too often think that the customer is the only side of gaming business that matters and they forget that developers are people as well, people who face problems and have families and see some games as work and often struggle to get a game out and working properly. I think seeing games journey through alpha and beta to release give gamers perspective and I'd love to see more alpha and beta snapshots.

Anyway, I felt like now would be a good time for some positive feedback. Take it as you will.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_1g3p6p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1g3p6p/i_appreciate_the_recent_variety/,

Since I have more reliable internet now I'm starting to stream a little more, plus the Co-Optional podcast stream is getting more popular every week. As a result I'm working to reward the subscribers who are paying $5 a month to support the channel. Up to this point they've been able to get chat access, chat badges and ad-free viewing. Thankfully since I have an old-school subscription plan, I can continue offering those things (newer partners subscribers don't get ad-free, ad-free masterrace) but I also want to add more features for those who go that extra mile to support us monetarily. It actually means a huge amount, those subscriptions far outweigh the usual ad earnings of any single person by a huge degree, so your continued support is very much appreciated. 

* (AVAILABLE NOW) VoD access, including the podcast, immediately after shows air. As of late, VoDs have been closed off to the public, especially since the podcast is a Polaris show and we want it to have as many views on Youtube as possible. Now subscribers will be able to watch the podcast VoD as soon as it finishes, a full 2 days earlier than its Youtube upload. This will also include the music breaks for those who wish to enjoy the ""full experience"" as well as ad-free viewing.

* (COMING SOON) Subscriber emotes. Subscriber-only chat will remain but we'll be adding new emotes for you to mess about with, including but not exclusively (angbadang) (spoilerfinger) (treadmill) (dodgereats) and (jessesmaid). Probably

* (COMING SOON) Subscriber only Q+A show. I'm debating whether or not to actually lock the channel down with a password that I send out to subscribers for this, but I might just do it live then give VoD access to the subscribers only, that'd be a show that doesn't go up on Youtube at all. I'll think about it.

So thanks for your continuing support, it means a lot and it makes Axiom bankrupt us a little less every month :x",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_1jpwxy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1jpwxy/new_subscriber_features_for_the_twitch_page/,

Some of the old community moderators decided that if Jagex was gonna stop supporting the original game, they would create a website for the game, and host a master server where you can still play the game.

I've been playing Forge since the alpha, and though it's still rough in a few places, very few games have managed to hold my attention like Forge has. Overall, this game is really solid, and I'm glad TB decided to promote it. 


I've been looking for a game like this for a long time - skill based combat, with some MMO elements, but without the crazy grind. It's like WoW arenas or GW2 spvp, but with nothing else to distract it from the pvp.


Anyways, I just wanted to say thanks, though [the official launch trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgmayUxbH0U&amp;hd=1) is also pretty cool! :)


Long live indie games, and thank you TB for bringing some exposure to indie developers!

It often times is not. The last few vods were considerably ""late.""  I am just wondering people's thoughts on whether or not we as consumers of the content can expect it to be on time. I know it is free, but so is local television an I expect that to be consistent. The internet is obviously different, but if TGS expects to be viewed as a professional organization I expect professionalism. I understand things happen which make it late, but it happens so much I often don't even look for it on Friday. If they are having troubles uploading it on time, they should in my opinion, not advertise a friday release date. It says it right on their youtube page. Maybe I am being an entitled child, but I have come to expect more from larger youtube organizations. This is a good thing, it points to the importance and growth of internet media. 

I would like to restate: Yes, I know it's free; and Yes, I know I can just watch something else. 

I am not of the mind that organizations who make considerable amounts of money directly from viewers should be able to do whatever they please without reproach. That is not how it works irl and it's not how it should work on the internet. Certain rules of provider/consumer relations apply to all spheres of business, and The Game Station is most certainly a business. 

edit: I am aware TB doesn't upload the VOD. I just wanted to hear some thoughts from people who probably watch it. Multiple people have brought up that when the vod is late, the information is old news. Very good point, didn't think of this.

Honestly, I can't say that I'm unable to sympathize with their frustration, but the amount of people who just acted plain childish ruined what could have been a really good contest and gotten Nvidia to take more notice to TB and maybe hold more contests down the line.

For those unaware of why the Europeans got screwed out of the giveaway: laws regarding giveaways and contests in Europe are a bit difficult when accepting stuff from overseas, as well as trying to get an expensive piece of fragile equipment through customs costs a fortune. Besides that, the shipping method chosen would have probably been the best available along with insuring the product so that if anything happened there would be a reimbursement. Since TB was sending these out himself and Nvidia wasn't the one giving them away, it would have added up to 1k$ worth of shipping and processing fees if all the winners were international, about 150 for each card. 

Here's the thing: the European audience is entirely at fault for thowing a fit over this, but TB himself isn't entirely blameless. The only reason I (and a few others) know about the shipping and processing troubles that would happen is because he said as much on his Twitter page. A lot of the viewers don't actually follow him or even use Twitter, so maybe if he had mentioned something to that effect in the giveaway announcement video that the processing fees would simply be too much then maybe more people would have been understanding. Sure, people would still cry foul and all that other stuff, but you're always going to have insufferable loons on videos. 

I also read one of the posts that someone made on his comments page that he was just fishing for views on what is considered his least popular show. Look. If TB was really struggling with views Nvidia wouldn't have given him 6 of their best cards for a contest. This was a promotion for both them and him, yes, but at least you had the chance to get something out of it. I'm embarrassed as a gamer and supporter of TB's work that this got out of hand like this. I know that most people on here are sensible, but the European community ought to be ashamed of itself right now. Because of a highly vocal minority, TB is now completely discouraged from providing his fanbase with any giveaways in the future, even though he was more than happy to do so back when he had BluePlz and even before his channel became popular. 

Who knows, maybe this next contest would have been directly reimbursed by Nvidia and it would have been opened up to the entire international community, but we'll never know because we're never going to have another contest giveaway ever again. European whiners (not all of you), you were pissed that you were excluded from this current contest, but may not have been from future ones. Now, nobody gets anything. I hope you're happy.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_1g1lgq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1g1lgq/why_we_cant_have_nice_things/,

I understand that playing through a bad game for just one video is not fun. Perhaps this could be eased by stopping when you feel like you have enough to talk about, or break up the video into several small parts.

There is definitely room for a series like that. Similar to ""this is why we can't have nice things"" but, you know. The opposite.

It would easily generate discussions in the comment section, which is something TB has said that he wants. Pushing the video higher up in the search ranks... Imagine the ad revenue!

To summarize: it would force both tb and the viewer to think harder about game design. TB has a large audience, and such a video would be a force for good within the gaming community.

1353501962.0,67,self.Cynicalbrit,13kauj,Regarding the ArmA developers that are captured in Greece(the other side of the argument),92,25,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/13kauj/regarding_the_arma_developers_that_are_captured/,"I am greek, who has served in the greek army and i want to help TB and its fans realize a few things about this situation.

(1) The greek media dont try to spin this into ""they are turkish spies"". The greek media largely ignore the issue. They might have mentioned it once when it started but it really got no traction other than ""stupid developers try to take pictures of military installations for their game"". As usual, media dont follow up this kind of stories any further. I dont know where this ""turkish spies"" bullshit started from. Yes, if those developers were spies, they would likely be turkish ones because Turkey would have made more sense to spy on Greece(though it is kinda laughable that they would spy like this but whatever). But claiming that they are turkish spies and having this published on a major greek media is absurd. At most either someone who isnt greek fabricated this out of thin air, or some nutjob greek posted this on his blog.

(2) Greece has a population of over 11 million people. 10 million tourists visit Greece each year, most of which go to a random greek island, a greek island which probably is full of military installations. Having served on such an island, i can assure you that tourists photographing military installations(with intend or by accident) as well even accidentally(most of the time) trespassing military bases, is almost a daily occurrence in those islands.

The greek military just calls the police, the police comes in, checks what those people have done(photographs and what not), checks their passports, they are taken to the police precinct for some routine questioning and they are left free(i dont know if they are fined) but they are never detained. The fact that these developers were detained and were also denied bail, makes this situation really interesting.

(3) If those developers just went there for vacations, why didnt they take their families? Why even choose that island? I assume that they are military buffs and they chose that island because they worked on ArmA 3 and they wanted to see the island from up close. They obviously have a passion for their art and for military shit. And because they are military buffs, i wouldnt be surprised if they went around taking photographs of **multiple** military installations. Since as i mention, casually taking a photograph of a single military installation, especially by accident, isnt enough to even get you jailed.

(4) Some might mention ""this isnt the first time that this has happened to Greece. A few years ago some plane spotters were also arrested, blah blah blah"". Yes, a few years ago, something similar happened. So out of the millions of tourists that come to Greece, out of the tenths of thousands of incidents where a tourist actually took a photo of a miltiary installation, this has happened twice? And it just happened that 2nd time to be the ArmA 3 developers. What a crazy coincidence. If this was happening a lot more often, there would have been a lot more stories like this, wouldnt they? And pretty much noone would even bother visiting Greece as a tourist.

(5) There isnt a single country in the world where you are allowed to take pictures of military installations. In fact on some countries, like the US, you arent even allowed to take pictures of the subway or of government buildings. Now imagine if a non american was going around taking pictures of military installations, what would happen then? Local jail overfilled with illegal immigrants? Guantanamo ? Some secret egyptian prison where he could be tortured? Just putting things into perspective.

(6) And yes, in theory the developers could go to prison for 20 years, if they are found guilty of espionage. But come on, everyone knows that this wont happen, so why use this kind of dramatic titles? 

(7) Remember that what you hear is the developer side of the story. Just because they claim that they just photographed a civilian airport, doesnt mean that they did. As i said, if that was the case, they wouldnt have been in the situation that they are now.

TLDR : I think the developers did many stupid things to get in the situation that they are now, but eventually things will work out for them.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,1353599820.0,,,True,t3_13kauj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/13kauj/regarding_the_arma_developers_that_are_captured/,

[Podcast Stream](http://twitch.tv/Totalbiscuit)

PDT: noon,
EDT: 3 pm,
UK: 8 pm,
CET: 9 pm,
EET: 10 pm,

In a little under 2 hours, SmoothmcGroove of the youtube channel [Smooth McGroove](http://www.youtube.com/SmoothmcGroove) will be live on TGS podcast over at twitch.tv . Bit of an interesting choice, since he hasn't appeared on the podcast before. However, he was great on the TGS E3 livestreams, seems knowledgable about the games and, in stark contrast with the guests of the last podcast, a genuinly nice guy. I guess the only concern would be him being too quiet but I am confident he will establish himself in the podcast. Hopefully, this will be a drama-free podcast.

[tweet confirming it](https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/347188732526485504)

His appearances on the TGS roundtable E3 livestream as a sort of a preview:

This isn't to tell him what he should do (as if he'd listen anyway) but just to brainstorm about all the different possibilities that could come from having a show like the one we all know and love.

I'm not sure if TB/mods will appreciate a thread like this, as it could be seen as a little pompous, if so feel free to say but I think I'd like to see the subreddit have some organized and friendly banter every now and again.

The idea of a Starcraft II team ran by Genna (/u/intricacy), TB's wife has come to fruition!

A few hours ago, Team Axiom was announced, featuring CranK (now AxCranK) and an expanding roster which will predominantly be Korean's. Team Axiom is leading the charge in the Korean Starcraft Scene to improve salaries, working conditions and increase exposure for the players themselves by sending them to more events outside of Korea.

This comes at an interesting point in the Starcraft II scene, with the KESPA juggernauts such as Flash playing Starcraft II full-time on teams. With the Korean team numbers almost doubling over a few months, it's become very dog-eat-dog for all progamer's in the scene right now. 

Team Axiom is currently in talks with Sponsor's but is also currently supported by Starcraft 2 Commentators HuskyStarcraft and Totalbiscuit. Big thanks to both who can make this possible!

1373567905.0,44,self.Cynicalbrit,1i3j8u,The TRQ livecast tool needs some help..,54,10,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1i3j8u/the_trq_livecast_tool_needs_some_help/,"Hi, I'm Nienordir, programmer and developer of the TRQ livecast tool, which was specifically created for the TGS-crew to improve the podcast, in a way that wouldn't be possible with skype&amp;xsplit. Unfortunately Dodger, Jesse and TB are *ridiculously* busy, which makes debugging the remaining issues in the netcode near impossible and that's why 'we' need *your* help (well, some of you..maybe :p).  

-----

1.) I need a handful of volunteers to test&amp;fix the netcode, if you want to help out, then you need..  

* Windows 7
* Microphone
* Webcam
* 'High speed' internet (roughly 1.2+ MB/s up%down, that's actual megaBYTEs not bits)
* Enough knowledge about your firewall, to set an application as *trusted* with unlimited network access)
* Skype (necessary evil to organize tests)
* Time on sat/sun around 20:00 UTC, 21:00 CET, 16:00 EDT, 13:00 PDT (so podcast time), a test shouldn't take more than 30 mins to an hour.  
* I'd prefer europeans, due to possible latency/connection issues with oversea, but I'm not picky.
* A reasonable understanding of english, since it involves technical stuff (but I think that's a given)  

2.) (optional) A *netcode specialist* (you know, someone that seriously knows his shit), if you're willing to spent a little time to help out, then you should **know**..  

* TCP/UDP (and *maybe* some of the quirks of Winsock2)
* Deep understanding of NAT traversal and UDP handshaking concepts (this is the *key part*)
* (maybe) familiar with C++, Visual Studio or network layer/packet sniffing
* Aside from that the requirements (aside from the time frame) apply as well or else analysing&amp;testing changes wouldn't be possible.

-----

Aside from that here are some beta 'mock up' [screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/JPSJr) and some of the 'cool' features that would improve the production value of the podcast, once it's ready to go live..  

* true P2P netcode (most of the current quality issues are caused by shitty/overloaded skype servers, because skype *isn't* p2p, eventhough many people seem to think that it is)
* HQ video (with modern encoding, that won't blur up if the connection goes 'bad')
* HQ audio (no robot voices and roughly 192 kb/s CD-quality without sacrifices)
* Inserts
* Soapbox view (one user with big window, others small)
* Stereo panning (no more stupid center channel mono, and if everybody yells at the same time it's easier to understand what they're saying)
* Censoring (for comedic value or to drop names/spoilers without the audience hearing it)
  
Aside from that 'TB' convenience features..easier&amp;faster setup times, tools to achieve better audio balance and no booming voices after being quiet from autoadjust and some other neat things, that I won't tell you about.  

As you can see TRQ is a real thing, feature complete and only requires debugging of some stupid netcode errors before it's ready to use live. Fun facts: TRQ has been in development for more than a year, contains more than 15k lines of code and is a multithreaded bitch. If you want to help 'us'^(read me) out, then this is your chance to help making the TGS podcast (or whatever it will be called) better and chances are pretty high that it will bleed over to the 'scene' (other youtubers, streamers, etc.) to make everything better (also it isn't limited to podcasts, there are profiles tailored to interviews/co-op plays etc. too).  

Thanks for your time and have a good day!

The game is not the fastest paced game however. I don't know how it would work - perhaps edited so that rather than waiting for everyone's turns, it just shows a summary of their moves and Youtuber's moves. (as in, watch TB's turn and commentary on his channel, etc).

I think the strategy and possible complexity, treaties and backstabbing, surprises etc would make an interesting game.

I'd say 4 players would be a good number, on a smallish map. This would keep the game not too monumentally long.

I'd say TB, Angry Joe, Ohmwrecker [(Channel here)](https://www.youtube.com/user/MaskedGamer) (he's TGS, is doing a Civ V series, quite fun to watch. Don't know that he's worked with TB much yet though), and a fourth player, perhaps The Completionist?

In searching around for a fourth player, I discovered that the [Yogscast have a 3-player civ V BNW series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohdne_tz9c0) going, so as a format it does look viable.

I personally would love to watch this, but of course I'm just one viewer. I know requests aren't taken, and I expect such a response. But if I don't ask, there can be no gauging how interested the fan-base is.

Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Oh wait, Crendor, I should have thought!

EDIT2: Having heard Crendor is doing a multiplayer game, I suspect perhaps this request has been answered before even requested! However, would still love to see [Ohmwrecker](https://www.youtube.com/user/MaskedGamer) involved if possible.

EDIT3: Added links to help people find what I'm talking about :P

EDIT4: Apparently you can play with simultanious turns, so until war breaks out you can all play your turns at the same time. Warring factions then have a turn order enforced. This would probably be the perfect way for this tournament to be done. Thanks /u/WinterShine

EDIT5: Apparently yogscast series is 3 players, not 4. Edited that. Thanks /u/thunderbeak",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,1374078366.0,,,True,t3_1igqyb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1igqyb/civ_v_bnw_tournament/,

I feel that, like several of those commenting on the reddit-link to the Divinity video, the lack of dev input when we knew that he had been there and could have been talking may have detracted somewhat. However, as was said in the feedback you referred to, you can't be so critical when talking, and it also reduces the entertainment value. Not something I need to go too deep into since its all been said before.

So, why not a split? In a video like this, and indeed in a video at something like PAX, E3 etc, why not have some of both in the video. I could see this in two ways:

1. For the first half of the video, you have you and the dev talking, covering the main points etc, like you normally would. Then for the rest of the video, you talk as you normally would after the fact, like you did for this video. In it you can reflect on the comment the dev gave, and generally review the game like you would and did here.

2. More editing and not sure how well it would work, but you could keep switching. Say you ask a dev a question/series of questions which are following along a natural theme, then you have a bit of you talking, and then back to Q&amp;A etc. This may help the 'flow' rather than splitting into two halves, but may hinder the flow as you could end up with a disjointed-sounding video. Perhaps keeping two flowing haves seperate would be better, perhaps this.

One final thing to add is that at events like PAX, obviously having time to also do the 'own reflections' is difficult, whether you want to do it in a press room immediately after the play-through (eating up time in the day) or do it at the hotel after the fact (longer after-the-fact, but quieter. But doing a few hours of this sort of thing, after spending a day on your feet at the event, must be pretty tiring).

Just a few humble thoughts on the topic.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,1366840103.0,,,True,t3_1d14vl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/1d14vl/new_devfree_format_some_thoughts/,

Second, (mainly referred to TB) since the guys there at Google gave us a few interesting APIs to play with, any future content that will be uploaded can be automatically inserted into the database, but the the channel must approve the API request (the same thing as Facebook and Twitter integration). So I would like to know TB opinion about that, and some legal issues regarding the trade mark ""TotalBiscuit"".

TB, would you consider doing a team management/roundup for your team? Showing you rolling for/picking the skills for your leveled-up players and possibly giving a brief summary/look forward. Similar to crendor's roundup.

It would only be a couple of minutes long at most, and hopefully not require much editing/work.

Mainly, I and possibly others would like to see this side of the game. I don't own BB but am considering getting it thanks to this tournament, but would at least like to see you rounding up and would like to see your logic in picking skills, and most of all how that entire part of the game works (I have seen it once, by crendor, and was confused as hell how he was allowed to pick basically any ability for his guy. I have no idea how it works).

Let me paint a picture for you:  
Me, a very ranty person, gets the task of doing a three-minute ""discussion radio piece"" about politics and freedom for school.  
  
I did not think it would be that hard.  
Boy, was I wrong. I have genuinely never had more performance anxiety over anything than I have for speaking into a microphone for three minutes.  
  
I speak English about 50% of my waking hours with my friends via the use of Mumble. On Mumble, I can go on thirty-minute rants about the minutae of practically anything (some of the latest things are the election system in the US, herd mentality among people and critical thinking), but why on earth can't I go for three bloody minutes when I'm not talking to people?  
  
Speaking into a microphone is friggin' HARD!

My thoughts would be Purgegamers and MarkiplierGame

Edit: I think that for the next one, going over E3, it should either just be the pillars, or perhaps Angryjoeshow, Keyori, or someone else that is critical, much like you, John. 

Edit 2: From TB:  

Alright I'd just like to make this absolutely clear. I'd like this thread to list guests we've previously had and why you thought they were a good addition to the show. I want to severely restrict the flow of new guests to the show and use ones that have a proven track record. I don't really want to bring Markiplier on again because he's basically a scarecam LPer and I'd probably go at him, he's more suited to a show where I'm not there and they're looking to do something more light-hearted.

Is there any way of getting hold of the newer Blue Plz! episodes and some sort of an organised list of the ones available on WoW Radio's archive?

I have often thought that whenever TB brings in devs to the ""WTF is""-show to tell about the game themselves, the content is always worse than if TB had done it alone. Even if you take away all the technical difficulties. The main problem is that the devs themselves are there to promote the game - which means they will never speak about the flaws of the game themselves unless TB brings them up himself. It also makes it a lot harder for TB to actually criticize the game. I mean I'm not wanting for TB to bring up negatives after negatives and seeing the devs squirm, but I watch TB's content mostly for his honest and direct opinions. Sometimes TB manages to bring valid criticism on the table and then soften the criticism with the standard ""beta is beta"" line, but how often do the devs actually respond to the criticism and whether or not they will fix it (but mostly those are just about bugs anyway)?

The flipside is that having devs on the show really ups the value of the show and the channel. Not everyone gets to have devs themselves showcasing the games in question and TB having access to devs really puts him above the average youtuber. It also makes TBs gameplay more focused on what the game is actually about. 

I also really enjoy when the Hyper WTF is becomes more of an interview than an actual game presentation. The Day Z ""Hyper WTF is"" is probably the only one that I really liked since everyone basically already knew what the game was about and the episode was more about hearing the developers insight and also about the future of the game. I'd like to see more of those instead. 

I'd like to hear how others view the hyper wtf is content and if it's something TB should also consider changing around (now that mailbox is ending) or renaming. ",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_12a5le,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/12a5le/hyper_wtf_is_vs_normal_wtf_is/,

I was looking at the league creation stuff, it looks like I can make a league for us to all play versus each other, and then I can set up tournaments after the fact, or I'll just make new ones and post them to the steam group when that's made.

Edit 2: Holy crap this blew up, ok I'm going to have a steam group posted in the league description in  game and you can join that for all annoucements, the current league is a freestyle league with no structure, just being used for organization and practice, cups and weekly leagues will be handled shortly. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TGSBFL group link, also with so many interested parties, we'll definitely allow chaos edition.

I was wondering if you would concider doing a once a week Mailbox episode on the weekends, where people could ask questions and get answers about things you talk about during that weeks content patch episodes. I know the day to day mailbox was a pain in the ass, and you ended up getting the same questions week after week, but limiting it to Q&amp;A about subjects brought up during that week only may help with that.

I know that I for one watched the mailbox everyday because i  genuinely liked hearing your oppinion. You seem to have a good knoledge of both the gaming industry aswell as the community and i always found it interesting to hear your imput on the questions people asked. and i know i couldnt have been the only one.

If the mailbox is dead, and you want it to stay dead, then how about something along the lines of ""Content patch:After hours"". where you could express your opinions on somthing you reported on in that days CP episode. it wouldnt need to be a daily show, just when somthing big happens in the news that you feel you want to talk about, but not in the ""news reporter"" setting of the daily CP videos.

I'm not arguing over this at all (I understand why he does this) but I just thought, would zooc be interested in filling on for content patch again, for those times you are away or going to be too busy?

.

The ones zooc filled in for before (episodes 4 &amp; 9, I'm not sure if there were others). I know this was early days for the show and so keeping it up consistently was more important I presume, but I enjoyed zooc's episodes of it. It was nice to have a different perspective on the show and mixed it up. Not everyone may agree but I for one liked it and I think the reaction was generally positive.

Of course if zooc wanted to do it! But this would keep the show going when you are away and busy, and hopefully be enjoyable for the viewers.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_172xpr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/172xpr/content_patch_while_away_zooc/,

.

This post may be a bit long, so in summary now (while people are still reading) I am talking about integrating a little bit of the old mailbox style into content patch, say that since its still content patch it can survive if there isn't always good viewer-submitted content, and I give the reason I enjoyed the mailbox element in that the most interesting parts were not normally the news parts but instead questions about more general or less news-worthy topics. 

.

Read on for the full thing.

.

What I wanted to do was try and provide some feeback/criticism of the content patch show, which will involve talking about the mailbox somewhat.

.

I'd like to start off by saying I enjoy content patch (CP), as I did the mailbox. I find CP informative and interesting. I also enjoyed mailbox, but that was more about hearing TB's opinions on various matters that were sometimes 'current' and sometimes more just opinion pieces, questions, or comments. I feel that this is somehing that CP, or at least that I miss from CP.

.

I am hoping there could be room for more viewer generated discussion, without detracting from the show as a whole. This could replace the original idea of having viewer comments on a question picked out in the next show.

.

I wonder if having a mailbox-esque system of viewer submitted questions or topics to hear TB's response and opinion on would be possible to have added to CP. I would envision that each show would end with just one (maybe 2 short) responses to these.

.

If there is nothing good submitted, which seemed to be where the mailbox was struggling towards the end, then the show can continue as normal, since this would only be a 5 minute block on the end of the show. I don't know what kind of volume of spam was being recived by the old mailbox e-mail, so maybe it was just getting too much, but perhaps its worh a try. After all, the series wouldn't hinge on having good quality questions submitted as the news presses on anyway, while also possibly providing more content for less busy (news-wise) periods, since this opinion stuff would not be time-specific and good questions could be saved and used at a later time.

.

The reason I want to see this viewer-submitted content back is because I feel that the opinion and question pieces submitted to the mailbox were often the best parts of the show, and more interesting to listen to than the news-type pieces that were also covered. Just looking at the final mailbox, the first, third and fourth (of four) questions were not things that were news and wouldn't be covered in CP, but I found very interesting to hear your opinions about and is the kind of thing that drew me to the show and, in a way, kept me watching the channel.

.

Personally I was rather skeptical of all the ""scumbag dev"" accusations and figured the warz would help provide some healthy competition for dayz.

But after this recent debacle of warz devs trying to charge for clans *a core aspect of the game, which is not F2P*, i'm starting to think that the games detractors are definitely onto something.

The fact that they'd even consider it is shady as fuck, but to then ""compromise"" by instead letting the first 20 members (not account bound) of a clan be free and then charge 5-7bucks for another 20 slots just blows my mind.

I've basically written the game off as a money-grab at this point, are you of the same mind? Any chance you will cover it in a content patch?",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,t3_13zwrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/13zwrm/tb_any_chance_you_are_going_to_chip_in_on_the/,

I think the problem is that a lot of TBs fans see him not just as a person who produces high quality videos for our entertainment, but as a friend, somebody they've got a bond with because of their shared interest in games or whatever (this goes for most, if not all big YouTubers and celebrities in general, tbh).

Well, I hate to break it to you, but TotalBiscuit is not your friend, he's not mine, he's not a friend to most of his 700k+ subscribers. He's a guy making videos on the internet, just because you subbed him on YT/liked him on FB/followed him on twitter/etc, that doesn't suddenly mean he's obligated to be your buddy and listen to your thoughts on any particular subject, because he's not, he's not obligated to give the slightest fuck about you.

Imagine standing on a stage and looking out at a crowd of over 700k people all trying to tell you what they want you to do/make/etc next, now imagine how offended the rest would be if you focused upon one random individual when you've always said no to the rest? Now, imagine trying to meet the individual demands of each of those 700k+ people... You just would not be able to, and you'd probably go insane if you tried.

He cares about his subscriber base as a whole, yes, which is why he and his wife work so hard to make sure we are provided with content that is both accurate and of the highest quality. But you, personally, are just a number, a statistic, a face in the crowd (and that isn't going to change, especially if your tactic is to hurl abuse at him or his family).

He bases his content upon statistics and view counts, logistical data and all that. Because focusing on the masses rather than individuals is how all successful business become successful in the first place.

There's a quote TB came out with a few times during his Blue Plz podcast, can't remember the exact wording or who it was by, but it fits here. ""The fastest road to failure is trying to please everybody all of the time.""

Now, I dunno where I was going with this, or where I planned to end up, or if I even made the point I was trying to make, but oh well, guess I'll just end it here.",,False,self,t5_2tqbt,1341313942.0,,,True,t3_vy2io,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/vy2io/my_rambling_thoughts_on_the_recent_tb_controversy/,

Or just numbers about all the videos and the channel in general. I remember (I think?) that TB used to release that kind of information kinda frequently (or at least when enough people asked politely).

DirectCompute is an open API, supplied with DirectX, opposed to the green team's CUDA with is mostly closed (thats why you can run TressFX on NVidia and PhysX cant run on AMD). And in straight up general computing performance AMD cards kick NVidia (http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph5699/45164.png).

One more thing: Not that long ago NVidia annonced that that there will be Physx on PS4 (AMD Hardware). A long time ago you could you a low-tier NVidia card for phisics processing with an Ati for video processing. Thats gone with windows 7, nvidia said that microsoft broke something (can't remember what). Microsoft fixed that in Win8, so nvidia locked it in the drivers.
