So, I figured I may be of some help. If anyone on here would like any items from Microcenter but aren't close enough to make the drive, I'd be willing to pick them up and ship them. I currently work at Microcenter Distribution, so the Columbus store is like twenty minutes away. I wish I could share my employee discount, but it's pretty crappy on large items anyways. However, if anyone plans on doing some cable management, I get a steal on cables and extensions, and MAY just happen to use my discount to buy them for me then decide I don't need them anymore, before I even open them (Major hint hint right there)

.

.


**How it'll work...**

1. Browse the sales on /r/buildapcsales or [Microcenter's Online ad](http://www.microcenter.com/specials/catalogs/index.html) to figure out what you want.
2. on Microcenter.com, select your location as ""OH - Central/Columbus"" and make sure there are some in stock. Add it to a cart and select ""in-store pickup"" to find the total including tax. Also factor in a rough estimate for shipping costs.
3. Send me a message with what you'd like (including the cart, if you can), and I'll send you my paypal info.
4. Once paypal payment is received, I will then go to the store and pick up the items, find a box, and ship them out. (I plan to make a trip there at least once a week. Once I ship them, we'll figure out the exact shipping and give/take as needed)

.

.

**Why?** You may ask. Well, for one, I know how bad it sucks to see a sale and not be able to get it. This is my little way of paying it forward in hopes that karma isn't quite a bitch to me. Also, I've got college expenses to pay for, so any **tips are greatly appreciated :)**

.

.

I just created a Heatware account (kyamcg) for this reason, so bare with me while I gain some feedback. I have one successful trade on /r/hardwareswap so far as well. I just sent out TheOmnipotentPilot's parts today, so hopefully he'll come back with some good feedback once he receives his package Wednesday. 

If any mods want proof/verification, I can send a photo of my work ID or whatnot.

**6/15 EDIT: So far I've shipped two redditors' items, and am waiting to hear back from a third.

This being the case, I'd prefer to stick to smaller items. Motherboard+cpu bundles for sure, as well as drives, cables, and other easily-shipped items.**

* Crossover 27q for $250
* 7970 for $275 (I don't know if anyone bought this from him, but please come forward and give this man his innocence).

I ""bought"" the Crossover from him.

He had physical verification with just his user name; however, I suspect that he actually just hoaxed us since none of us really know if he is going to send it even though he posted a pic of it with his username.  

I paid him through Paypal as a payment for Goods. Not as a gifting option. 

He said he would ship it Monday morning. I sent him a reply about noon asking him for a tracking number and if it had simply been ship, he has yet to respond. It's been about 24 since, and the original post had been deleted. I do want to give him some time, but all these factors I'm going to list make me super anxious. Just every little bit of this feels bad and I should've known better unfortunately.

I should've saw it coming when he asked for:

* Amazon gift card
* Gift as a paypal
* Very defensive in his argument as to not receive it as a normal payment for a good

His account history shows that it was a throwaway, but the optimist in me said, ""Maybe he's just super duper anxious about concealing his real account or info,"" but then again that wouldn't make sense.

The price of $250 shipped for the Crossover 27q led-p seemed too good to be true. His paypal was also unverified and who had two different names (the e-mail was a random ass name at gmail and then the account name is some random ass name.)


Anywho, I sent the money Sunday morning. Does anyone know how long it takes for an unverified account to transfer money say to a merchant or verified paypal (I think that is what he may be doing) or simply have access to it? I just hope that my money isn't gone or spent.

I don't care however long (as long as it's not more than 60 days obviously) it takes for the money to come back, I just hope I'm able to get it back. I have enough cash flow to suffice. 

If the item does come through, I'll be glad to remove this post, but should I start a dispute now?

no prob man. :)

Seems like a swell guy huh? Nope. I even offered him more money later on, he didn't want it. So what red flags do you see in this? He accepted $80, that's it. He even showed the GPU in a photo. Later on in the PM's he declines my money that I sent and asks to send it to a new Paypal. At this point I knew something was up but I completed the deal because I don't have anymore money to spend (life is very expensive) and I really, really want this GPU. After I send the money I see that the Paypal I sent it to is under a different name, I canceled before he accepted. I knew he was scamming me but there was a little piece of me saying ""What if this is legit? this will complete your rig"" so as per usual I didn't follow my gut and continued with the process. So stupid of me. To get straight to the point days pass and there is no sign of him. I've made multiple attempts to contact him VIA Steam, Email, ect. No luck. At this point I knew it was all over, I sent one last PM.

Look man something doesn't feel right about this deal, if I don't receive a working tracking number in a few hours I'm filing a claim and getting my money back. I've tried being patient but you haven't replied to ANY of my PM's. Sorry if this was a legit thing.
permalinkfull commentssource

He deleted his account a few minutes later. 

So you think I can go get my money back, right? Nope. Usually I'm good at following my gut but being desperate got the best of me and I sent my money as a gift to avoid a minor 4% charge, like I said this was my last bit of spending money for a long time. Ding!, ding!, ding! it's allll over folks! So what can you do to prevent this?

1. Link your Paypal to your bank account and send money that way. This way your bank can get your money back. Trust me, they don't fuck around.

2. If you're unable to send money through a bank account PAY THE 4%, you won't regret it. 

3. If it at all feels like you're getting too good of a deal, you probably are. 

Thanks for reading guys and good luck!  (Ignore all errors please)
If anyone has anything to add to this feel free to PM me and I shall edit the post.

UPDATE: Called in and filed a claim, wish me luck!

I would like to introduce myself as the newest mod of this awesome and growing subreddit.  In addition to helping stop scammers, clearing out the spam filter, and answering all of your questions/concerns I will be focusing on keeping the approval flair for completed trades as up to date as possible.

From this point forward, all completed trades will be placed here.  As moderators we only require that you and the other redditor involved int the trade post here.  Once both parties have posted, flair will be granted as soon as possible (I'm shooting for inside 24-48 hours).  At the time of writing almost everything should be up to date.

Please do not freak out or spam the mod inbox if your flair does not appear right away.  That being said, if you notice it has been a while, go ahead and shoot me a message and I will get it corrected for you.

I look forward to working closely with you all to keep this sub working like a well oiled (and scam-free) machine.

I want to bring your attention to the recent activities of a potential scammer in the community.  They created accounts to try to ""sell"" their Apple products, and while on the surface this may seem fine, what was surprising about the deals is that they were selling for SIGNIFICANTLY less than what they were worth.

After speaking with each account, I started to notice a striking resemblance throughout: same writing style, use of emoticons in specific areas, same trade requests (half &amp; half payment methods) and ironically, they all hailed from Canada, Victoria Island.  While I have no qualms with our neighbors to the North, it seems incredibly unlikely that each user was from the same area.

The accounts in question were (I use were as he deleted them all) /u/Hi_For_High_Five, /u/krazyfire1 &amp; most recently /u/srchang.  Here is one of their posts: http://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITEXCHANGE/comments/v8yri/hmacbook_pro_w/.

That being said, I'm not trying to be a party pooper, I just hope people stay vigilant in their potential dealings on here.

Also, this way when you say ""amazon gift"" people who care or who are just pessimistic can add some levity to your passionately hoping for a good deal self.

P.S-Never gift essentially- this is old, but what I mean is recognize that as human beings our unconscious/conscious WANTS to believe that we can get something for far less than it is worth and scammers play on this to convince us to use unproven unsafe methods of payment.  So remember to ignore the part of you that says ""Its such a good deal, and I have all of the pictures"" or whatever other proof the person provides.

Hey /r/hardwareswap,

I took the plunge and built my dream Intel rig. Now I'm trying to recoup some of the cost by selling all this AMD/budget build stuff. I've never sold anything on this sub, so this should be fun.

Ideally I could sell the entire build(other than one of the CPU's obviously) in one shot, but if you're interested in just one part, just make an offer, whether you have gear or would like to make a cash offer.

Stuff I'm interested in:

Mouse: If you had a Mionix Naos 8200, that would be just perfect. But if you have a good wired gaming mouse you think I'd be interested in, please don't hesitate to message me. I currently own a Logitech G500

Keyboard: Currently own a CM Quickfire Rapid. Works perfectly fine expect that I don't like the brown switches very much and it's not full sized(no num pad), so if you have a different switched and full sized keyboard you think I'd be interested in, please offer!

Monitor: I have a 60 Hz 1080p monitor around 21.5""(?). If you've got a better one, let me know!

If you've got any questions just ask and I'll do my best to answer them.

My friend and I are here on a mission.  A friend of ours has a failing laptop that can no longer play games and he lacks the money to fix or build himself a new pc.  As we have both been building and upgrading our own computer, we have an assortment of older parts already (posted below).  While we have most of the parts needed to construct a computer, we still do require a few basic components.  In addition we are fond of trolling each other, and thought this would be a great opportunity to get some jabs in.  So what we are looking for is as follows:

* Any harddrives that have very limited size (10-20gb).  Something that you still have lying around just because it was useful at some point and time.

* Used case fans- anything that makes an annoying rattle or other noise.  Again something you couldnt bring yourself to throw out but do not have an active use for at the moment.  Mismatched colors and/or LED lights are a plus!

* A PSU.  This we actually want to be of decent quality.  We require something around 600w range.  If it is ugly all the better.  Does not have to be state of the art, but no fire hazards please.

* Older GPU.  Right now we have an 8500gt that is okay to use in the build, but that is just mean.  We would much rather have something that was good for the time period, but now is obsolete.

* Any additional trolling suggestions are much appreciated. 

Here is the list of parts that we have:

**Case**- Thermaltake Commander MS/1 Snow Edition

**Motherboard**- Asus P5GC-MX/1333

**CPU**- Intel e2200

**RAM**- 2x1 gb DDR2 PC2 5300


Just to reiterate we are looking for parts that are annoying but still usable. Also, we are willing to pay for them but have limited funds to do so.  Donations are very much appreciated but not expected.  We will post pictures of the rig after we are done if there is an interest in seeing this abomination.

EDIT: Wording

EDIT2: Anyone who contributes to this glorious build through parts or ideas can have their Reddit Username engraved somewhere on the case.  It is a symbol of our gratitude and it would annoy him slightly

1347828122.0,12,self.hardwareswap,zzja4,[PSA] Guide to Safe Trading,14,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/zzja4/psa_guide_to_safe_trading/,"I'm a frequent online hardware trader on HardForum, Anandtech, and Tom's Hardware, and have recently started perusing /r/hardwareswap. Somebody attempted to scam me this morning, which led me to notice that there isn't enough information about safe trading practices (for buyers and sellers) made public to users here, and even though this isn't necessarily a major trading forum, safety still applies everywhere. 

I'm going to run through a basic list of things you *should* do as a buyer or seller when trading. 

**EDIT - Remember, no single rule is the make or break of trading; the only way to protect yourself completely is *to take as many precautions as possible***.

You can choose to ignore or uphold as much of this as you want, but that's on you and you'll have to live with the consequences. I'm going to try and break this up into categories as best as possible. If I forget something I will add it, and I am always available for questions if you have any.

**Trading Feedback/Reputation:**

- If you are a regular trader, heatware is a must. It is generally accepted by traders on many forums and gives you a decent amount of credibility (or discredibility), especially once you get past ~25 trades. It also protects your identity on forums since you can add your forum usernames to your profile. [As an example, here is my heatware profile.](http://www.heatware.com/eval.php?id=75353)

- eBay feedback is ok at best. The problem with eBay's system is that you cannot rate buyers anything other than positive, which is garbage. There are some buyers who will make your life hell and try to screw you over as much as possible. As such, I would only recommend this as a very last resort, and for judging *sellers only*. [Example](http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=757boilermaker90&amp;ftab=AllFeedback)

- Some forums have built-in feedback systems. These are generally very solid as long as you can provide a link between the forum and reddit (will vary by scenario). You generally won't run into this, but if you do it is not necessarily a bad thing.

- Some other equivalents to heatware exist (beer is another one I've heard of) but most people use heatware if anything. I would discredit a feedback profile if the user **BOTH** has not been active for several years *and* only has a few transactions. Some traders go dormant, but they will usually have ~50-100 trades over the course of several years. I would take extra precautions against a seller with 3 positive feedbacks in 2008 - it's simply been too long.

**General Trading Practices For Buyers**

- **ALWAYS** ask for photographs of an item, specifically with the seller's username and date handwritten on a piece of paper. This proves ownership, since people can easily download somebody else's photo and re-upload the image in imgur. If the item is something built-in to a PC (hard drive or something along those lines), have the seller provide pictures of the screen while holding said piece of paper. If the item is being sold with noted flaws, it is not improper to ask for better pictures of the flaws. Pictures are **non-negotiable** unless you're trading with somebody you trust (which should be absolutely *nobody* but people you know personally). [Example](http://i1123.photobucket.com/albums/l554/bravokiloromeo/Toshiba%20Portege%20R835-P56X/IMG_0064.jpg)

- **ALWAYS** ask about condition of items. Transactions through Paypal &amp; Amazon Payments assume 'as-is' sales, so unless the item was grossly misrepresented or was damaged in shipping, it will be tough to get a refund. It is up to the seller to be honest here, and their trading reputation will reflect that. 

- **ALWAYS** ask for some form of feedback (heatware, etc mentioned above). People will often give this information up front, but it is always on you to ask if they don't. Good traders are more than happy to provide this info. You can also search by username to see if they're in the system. 

- **ALWAYS** use a secure method of payment with some sort of dispute mitigation service like [Paypal](www.paypal.com) or [Amazon Payments](payments.amazon.com) (I believe Serve and Dwolla also have it, but I'm not too familiar with them). If you happen to be scammed, you can file a dispute through the payment organization. **SEND THE PAYMENT AS 'Payment for Goods/Services'** or else you forfeit the right to dispute the transaction. You can generally use a second layer of protection like a credit card vs. a debit card, since you can file a chargeback through your credit card company in the event of a scam. 

- **DO NOT PAY AS A GIFT OR THROUGH NON-PROTECTED MEANS** (also against Paypal's Terms of Service). There have been traders asking for payment in Newegg credit (or the like), and there is no reason to follow through on this. If the person is actually serious about getting credit, they can take the money you pay them *via Paypal/Amazon* and buy their own gift cards/pay for the item. This is a classic scam and unfortunately people simply just don't know (actually the main reason I chose to write this). 

- **USPS Money Orders are ok in SOME instances.** Some traders on the bigger trading forums will ask for USPS Money Orders, which are OK as long as you feel like you can trust them (i.e. ~100-1000 heatware feedback). **ONLY USE USPS MOs** as others like Western Union have issues being spoofed and faked, and you could even have problems getting a legitimate one through a non-USPS organization. [More info on MOs](https://www.usps.com/shop/money-orders.htm)

- Get as much personal info as possible if you feel extra wary. Name, address, phone number, etc. More documentation will save you hassle in the long run. A lot of experienced traders will ask to speak to newer traders over the phone simply to verify and get a feeling for the trader's demeanor. This doesn't usually happen when you're buying an item, but you may encounter it. 

- Once the deal has been struck, make sure to get confirmation that the seller shipped your item and a means to track it. **ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS GET SOME FORM OF TRACKING NUMBER**. If the seller is too cheap to cover it, make sure to offer to pay for it yourself. **Paypal and Amazon WILL REQUIRE PROOF OF DELIVERY/NON-DELIVERY in the event of a dispute.** Make sure to have the seller update the item status in Paypal if that was the method used.

- **INSURANCE IS ON THE SELLER, NOT THE BUYER.** You should never be asked to pay for insurance, since it does absolutely nothing to protect you throughout the transaction. Insurance covers the seller only, since they should/will refund you if the item is damaged or doesn't arrive (you can still file a claim/dispute even if they refuse to refund you). If you are asked to pay for the extra insurance fee and you refuse, you are still well within your rights to file a dispute/claim in the end. 

- When the item arrives, make sure to check the condition of the item and notify the seller of it's arrival for their records. Document (i.e. photograph) any and all damage to the packaging and the items. Save/photograph packaging (inside and outside) as well, as shipping companies will often ask to see the type of shipping material used. Test all items ASAP to check for shipping damage (or simply straight up lies). You will have to contact the seller to resolve any problems, but if you receive an item not as described, **THE BURDEN IS NOT ON YOU, IT IS ON THE SELLER**.

- If the item doesn't arrive within a reasonable timeframe (will vary on shipment method/company used), contact the seller ASAP to work it out. If a long period of time passes with no resolution or contact from the seller, open a *dispute* (not a claim) with your payment company. Disputes are meant to start communication between traders and resolution of a problem, and will usually automatically escalate to a claim. Once it reaches claim status, the payment organization will adjudicate to determine who is at fault and the punishment. **MORE DOCUMENTATION IS ALWAYS BETTER**, and feel free to make phone calls to the organization regarding the claim. Sometimes Paypal's system will automatically make judgements (like if the seller forgot to update the item as 'shipped' in Paypal) and talking to someone over the phone is an easy way to prevent any incorrect judgements.

- *No matter how things turned out*, make sure to leave a heatware feedback. Positives are obviously for trades that went well, but can also be left for trades that had some bad luck but the seller was still extremely professional (I actually value these more than just regular positives, since it says a ton about a trader's character). Neutrals are for ones that went slightly sour, but ended up working out (i.e. difficult trader who was reluctant or lazy to follow through on some stuff). These are usually subjective and serve as warnings. Negatives are for trades that went absolutely terribly and resulted in extreme hassle for both parties and/or scams. Leave all appropriate information in the heatware review - people will want to know what happened so they can take necessary measures.

**General Trading Practices For Sellers**

- Provide pictures and an accurate description of your item. Buyers should/will ask, so it's easier on everyone to provide this up front. The more PMs it takes to find out about the item, the longer it takes to actually make a deal. People also don't like surprises, so do your best to provide photographs of damaged sections.

- Provide references/feedback. As a seller, your reputation is everything, and you should take all means to protect it. ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and only five Minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you will do things differently."" – Warren Buffett 

- Sign up for [Paypal](www.paypal.com) or [Amazon Payments](payments.amazon.com). If you have enough feedback, USPS Money Orders are also an option. See #3 in the Buyers section for more info about why you should do this.

- When shipping an item, make sure to package it well. Think about how you would want the item to arrive on your doorstep - pristine or destroyed? It's pretty easy to reuse boxes and packing materials from other purchases (I have a lot of Amazon ones lying around), and make sure the item is well protected from impacts and is stabilized (i.e. doesn't shake around in the package). More movement = more damage. Try to avoid regular (i.e. non-padded) envelopes, as these go through rollers and scanners, and items can be torn out of them very easily. 

- USPS is great for small items. Flat rate boxes are great for small &amp; heavy items, but are a bit of a rip-off for lighter ones (better off with your own packaging and non-flat rate postage). UPS/FedEx are great for larger and heavier items like big laptops, cases, etc. Shipping speed is dependent on what you work out with the buyer. I use First Class for small items (under 13 oz), Priority for some in between sized items under 3 lbs, and Priority Flate Rate boxes for bigger ones. I would use UPS for anything over 3 lbs and not in a flat rate box, since USPS will charge you out the a$$.

- **If you use Paypal and USPS**, print a label directly through the transaction in Paypal; you will get shipping discounts as well as free delivery confirmation. **ALWAYS** get signature confirmation on items worth more than $250, as you will need it to qualify for Paypal's seller protections. 

- **If you do NOT use Paypal, but are shipping through USPS**, go to http://paypal.com/shipnow to save on shipping as mentioned in 4c. You must have a Paypal account, but you do not need to use Paypal during the transaction to use this function. 

- **INSURANCE IS YOUR ONLY PROTECTION DURING THE SHIPPING PHASE**. The buyer is already protected under the payment method, so use insurance if **you** need to. My general rule of thumb is that if *I can't afford to swallow the cost of the item, I purchase insurance.* Packages do get lost or damaged, so chipping in an extra $5 on a $400 item is definitely worth the security. 

- When actually shipping the item, it is best to deliver it to a USPS/UPS office. They will scan it and give you a receipt, which is important to keep for your records. I sometimes use USPS Home Pickup, but that's hit or miss depending on your location. **If the item doesn't make it into the shipper's system, do NOT expect to be protected even if you purchased insurance.**

- Notify the buyer that their item is on the way. This is just general courtesy, but how you communicate with people will affect their heatware ratings. More communication = better.

- If you hit a snag (emergency, etc), **ALWAYS NOTIFY THE BUYER**. Stay in contact as best as possible, and if you foresee this emergency causing problems with the trade it is best to cancel/refund up front. People get upset if you disappear on them with your money, and will often leave neutral/negative heatware as a result. 

- Keep tabs on the item, and contact the buyer if it was delivered and you haven't heard from them. If something has happened to the item during shipping **ALWAYS ASK FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE**. I will not provide refunds unless I see visible evidence of neglect on my behalf. If a claim is filed, the payment company will want to see evidence of this as well, and if you call you can bring to their attention the unwillingness to provide evidence of neglect on your behalf.

- Once the trade is completed, leave a feedback on heatware. In addition to what I wrote in #7 above, if you receive an unwarranted negative feedback **DO NOT LEAVE RETALIATORY FEEDBACK**. In this scenario, contact the guys at heatware and provide them with details and evidence of the trade and they will remove the negative from your account. **IF YOU LEAVE A RETALIATORY FEEDBACK, IT WILL NOT BE REMOVED**.

**Other Things I Didn't Mention Above**

- Be courteous and professional, but don't be afraid to set boundaries. When it comes to money, some people will do anything to get one past you. I'm a nice guy and a respected trader, and I will always uphold my end of the bargain. However, if it's not my fault it is not my problem.

- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Just resist your gullibility and move on. 

- **PHOTOS PHOTOS PHOTOS** If an item is delicate, I will usually take extra photos before shipping in the event the buyer should say I shipped it damaged or whatever. I feel like this was implied above, but this is extremely important for everybody involved.

- **KEEP ALL DOCUMENTATION** This includes photos, PMs, entire threads, etc. If something starts to go south, don't be afraid to copy text from entire sale threads, or even screenshots (probably a better bet since it will have aspects of your PC in the shot as well and thereby proving it's existence in the event the OP decides to delete the thread or their association with it). More evidence is always better when settling claims, and don't be afraid to contact people involved in the claims process to provide them this evidence. It is a hassle, but it will only hurt you in the end to be lazy. 

- Be smart. Don't trade internationally (some people are legitimately trying to buy stuff overseas; they aren't *all* Nigerian Princes) unless you want to deal with it. I have shipped items overseas (non-trading) before and it is an absolute pain in the ass, so I can't even imagine the hassle of trading with somebody overseas. Far too many things can, and often will, go wrong.

- **IF AT ANY POINT YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE** find a way to fix it. It is easy to ask for more info about the other trader, and if it still feels sketchy, simply **DON'T TRADE WITH THEM**. Even if you have made a deal, you can always back out; sure it will piss some people off, but there's nothing they can do about it. *If payment/items have been exchanged it is too late*. Some sellers might be nice about the issue and will accept a return as long as you pay return shipping, but this is **never guaranteed nor required of the seller**. 


If you read this far, thanks for reading and taking the time to help yourself. I hope all of your trades go smoothly and without incident. Now you know, and knowing is half the battle!

If you came looking for a TL;DR, there isn't one. Stop being lazy and read the entire damn thing. Knowledge is power, so get up to the top and start reading. 

**I hope this can be permanently attached to /r/hardwareswap and other trading forums in a very public place. The sidebar is just that - a sidebar - and it is very out-of-the-way for people to read. I understand that people need to go out of their ways to trade safely, but with reddit's user base I think there are just too many people who simply don't know how to trade and what protections are available throughout the process**

Here is the [gallery](http://imgur.com/a/hQCcN) (8 images) with timestamp.

I have two ~~boxes~~ **cartons** of mostly unopened (I opened a couple boxes to take pictures) Hynix DDR2 FB-DIMM modules from a server that has since been retired.

The server was an IBM Bladeserver (I've since forgotten the model).

The RAM is IBM branded Hynix-made, specs:

* PC2-5300F
* CL5
* ECC 
* Fully-Buffered
* Registered
* Heat-Spreader
* 1.8V

**This will not fit in your standard desktop! FB-DIMMs have the notch moved back slightly since a typical consumer board won't run FB-DIMMs! BEWARE!**

I have 23 Kits (512MBx2) of the smaller guys, and 15 kits (2GBx2) of the bigger guys.

I have tested and used the larger kit (4 kits of 2GBx2) in a 2008 MacPro Quad-Core, and it works great.

I realize this is a bit of a niche type of thing, so offers will be considered, even though I know this stuff is typically on the expensive side. (I don't care, it's doing me no good sitting in a box).

If you've got a workstation or server, or a MacPro, these are great modules.

As far as trades, I'm mostly looking for some DDR3 RAM (faster than 1333 preferably), I'm also looking for a decent graphics card (upgrading from a PNY GTX 460OC), but I'd consider just about anything.

I can ship multiple kits at a time if you want to save that way, just let me know.

Thanks for looking, and happy swapping.

**EDIT**


Corrected boxes to *cartons* to avoid confusion; I have a total of 38 *boxes* of kits of RAM, two different capacities of kits: 2x512MB and 2x2GB in matched pairs.",,False,self,t5_2skrs,1375976846.0,,,True,t3_1jyi2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/1jyi2m/usct_h_ddr2_fbdimms_galore_more_in_comments_w_8gb/,

Whole Rig and monitor is pending sale from a local buyer. Hes coming by monday to take a look at it, I will update this then. And if sale falls through, ill split up the build. 


Posting this on here and my local Craigslist, willing to part out after a few weeks on craigslist. Seeing that I would rather sell as a whole build, even though that's gonna be a miracle. Everything works perfectly, I have 90% of all original boxes and accessories. Basically wanting to discount everything by 20-30% depending on the age and condition of the items. I'm looking to part with my ultimate time consumer because i'm currently working and sorta lost my desire to play as much as I used to. So my loss is your gain. And sorry for the layout, sorta in a rush. If any question about he build PM me and ill get back to you asap. Thank you

For my stupidity I deserve what happened, and am glad I didn't have to learn by losing the laptop.

I was trying to sell my laptop (G74SX) for cash or an ultrabook. Ended up getting offered a 14"" touch screen ultrabook and a Galaxy Tab, which I accepted (we exchanged pictures w/ our usernames). We exchanged addresses and names but that was it; mistake #1. We agreed that we wouldn't pay for each others shipping as we were both shipping items; mistake #2. Never asked for phone number or anything.

Red flags:

1. We shipped at the same time, but a few hours after his item shipped, he deleted his account.

2. 2 days later, his item being shipped said that the addressee's address had moved and was going to be shipped back to him.

I have a 6 month old [Das Keyboard Ultimate S](http://store.daskeyboard.com/Das-Keyboard-Ultimate-Model-S/dp/B003F7WXTG) with blank key caps and Cherry MX Blue switches (tactile and clicky). The keyboard is in great working and aesthetic condition. I've had no problems at all with keyboard. The only reason I'm selling is that I've become a mechanical keyboard addict and want to try out other types of switches.

If you live near Margate, UK you are welcome to pick up in person or I will ship (even internationally) as long as you cover the shipping costs.

Got lots of stuff I don't want, the prices I'm listing are just rough guidelines, If you can find any of my stuff cheaper elsewhere I will certainly lower my price. I pretty much did a rough price guestimate using eBay listings. Things with (boxed) mean that I have the original box for them. Some stuff I havn't priced up, just make sensible offers :)

I will accept pretty much any payment method if possible, Paypal, Bitcoin, BACS Transfer, etc. Just ask! :)

Without further ado, things:

£350 - Saphire AMD 6990

~~£70 - 7 x XFX ATI HD 5870 1GB (boxed) ^1~~

£40 - 4 x Corsair CX600 Builder series 600W power supplies (boxed) ^1

If you are curious about where all this stuff has been / come from, here's some history on everything :)

1) All of this stuff was purchased for bitcoin mining back in May 2011. It's all been faithfully mining in my spare bedroom since then, has turned a nice little profit, and is now a bit too slow to compete with all the other miners, so it's gotta go! [photo 1](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/Photos/2011/May/IMG_20110520_150522.jpg) [photo 2](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/Photos/2011/May/IMG_20110525_034107.jpg)


2) These used to be the monitors I used on my main desktop. I decided to upgrade to 2560x1440 monitors, so these are now sitting in the spare bedroom not doing much. They were always great monitors though! [photo](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/Photos/July%202010/2010-07-20%2017.49.29.jpg)


3) Used to be the power supply in my main PC, however when I upgraded to a new motherboard I could no longer fit my SLi setup in since the PSU was right up against the bottom of the board and I needed to utilise the bottom slot. Remember that this is the new CPX form factor by Antec, so you'll either need an Antec case or a hacksaw to get it to fit ;)


4) Bought this for bitcoin experimentation but never ended up using it. It got took out of the box and I looked at it, that was about it. Never been used and in the original box with all the things.


5) These are great fun especially for the price, I bought it and used it as a [bedside clock](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/Photos/December%202010/IMG_20101208_021003.jpg) for a while (Yay Ubuntu+Conky). I use my Nexus 7 to do this job now though, so this has been relegated to the cupboard. Has a green stuck pixel right on the edge of the screen. You can find lots of info about hacking them [here](http://www.jogglerwiki.com/)


6) Used to use this as my fan controller but switched to a couple of BitFenix recons because I fan control in software. Looks really cool though. Shame I can't have this and software control really! :P


7) Used to be my old gaming PC, got relegated to being the home theatre PC and then got relegated to the cupboard :P, Hasn't been used in a while but I assume it all still works, will test it before I send it off.


That's all, again feel free to ask me any questions. or negotiate on the prices (especially if your ordering more than one thing).

The above system is for sale, but with a neat twist. (you may have seen this on r/buildapc a little while back: http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/qgyf6/build_complete_itx_wembedded_monitor/ ) I cut one side of the case out and have successfully mounted a 14"" laptop screen that functions as a primary display. Since then I swapped out the CPU and video card as they were just too powerful for the 1440 x 900 screen! : ) The entire system was built in March of this year or sooner- has had no problems and will come with a fresh install of Windows 7 Ultimate on the SSD. The screen is converted by an LVDS adapter that is housed within the case. Power is brought the screen and the PSU via a single, split standard power cable. The case will fit and power a full-length GPU (I've done a 580 with no temperature problems at all), and it includes an HD4870 as a video card. Also not included above is the price of the screen, which ran about $50 for the screen itself and $30 for the adapter kit. It's got handle mounted to the top, as you can see in the pics, and is great for LAN parties, or just having a decent PC you can carry around. Also includes mini-microphone and all accessories. Oh, and the keyboard mounts to the back of the case with velcro.
A video of the PC can be found here: http://youtu.be/h45N8IJNINI

And pics: http://imgur.com/a/ZdgdJ

I'm selling it because I thought it would be the right idea for me (traveling actor/gamer, etc) but it still really too large and impractical. For the right person I think this is awesome. I am considering parting it out- here's what I'd ask for the individual parts: 

CPU: $80
h40: $30
Motherboard: $130
Memory: $30
SSD: $50
HDD: $30
Case, screen, adapters, and cables: $150
PSU: $85
ODD: $15
Keyboard: $15
GPU: $40


The prices are pretty firm- I'm not desperate to sell- I'd rather wait for the right buyer than settle for a low price.

I'm asking $600, with keyboard, mic, all cables, 4870, and of course the embedded monitor.

[Here is a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/wufyi/in_homage_to_the_prodigy_build_posted_a_few_hours/) to the build over on /r/GamingPC. Includes pictures and specs.

The only thing I've changed is that the 200mm fan has been replaced with a much better one that is now mounted to the front of the case on the exterior. It doesn't look terribly ugly, but with a little work it could turn out looking pretty nice. I'll post a pic of what it looks like now when I get home.

Why am I selling this? Really the objective for this build for me was to build an extremely capable gaming machine with the smallest footprint possible. Packing an overclocked Ivy Bridge i7 and GTX 690, both watercooled, I think that objective has been accomplished :)

Included is every internal component on the spec list, MINUS the SSDs. To get everything to fit, I had to remove the optical drive bay and the hard drive cages, so 3.5"" HDDs are pretty much out of the question. There is a cage on the right panel that holds two 2.5"" SSDs or laptop HDDs. Also note that the motherboard has two eSATA ports on the back, and a pretty good number of USB 3.0 ports, making external storage a viable option.

As for price, I'm really not looking for any offers under $1300 US.  Given that pretty much every part is best-in-slot for ITX and that the 690 alone costs a grand, this is in my opinion a VERY reasonable price.

[Imgur album of hardware](http://imgur.com/a/NKzTC)

OK, first off, I really do love this computer, and the whole selling of it is primarily due to my monstrous case.  It still runs most current games at high/highest settings.  For specific reasons, I need a much more mobile desktop (airplane carry-on small).  Since I'm going the mini-ATX route, I decided to build a new computer from the ground up.

And that, hopefully, is where a generous buyer will come in.  These prices are by no means set in stone as the used electronics market seems incredibly dynamic.  If you have a more reasonable price and you can back it up, please do!  (I'd also appreciate a heads-up if I'm underselling too!)

I love my computer but it's not practical for my needs anymore. ***I prefer to sell as a package deal but I'd be willing to negotiate smaller package deals or individual sales.  All prices are negotiable within reason.***

I loosely based my prices off of used prices I found online and what I hope is common sense.  Without further ado:

* Thermaltake Armor + (ATX Full-Tower Chassis) - $50.00 (I love this thing)
* EVGA e-GeForce 8800 GTS 640MB PCI-E - $35.00
* Gigabyte GA-965P-DS3 Rev. 3.3 - $50.00
* Zalman Copper CPU Fan - $15.00 (I also love this for some reason)
* 2 120-mm fans - $5
* DVD ROM - $5
* CD-RW - $5
* Associated connections - value not considered
* Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q6600 2.4GHz - $50.00
* 4GB (2x2GB) DDR2 G.Skill RAM - $20.00
* Note: You will have to provide your own HDD and PSU or I can purchase new ones for you (which will adjust the price).
* **Total** (depressing) price for all computer parts: $235 local price + up to $95 U.S. shipping and packaging, if required.  The U.S. shipping price is based on $10 for cardboard and foam packaging and $85 shipping to the western-most zip code in Washington state from my zip code; the shipping price may actually be much less depending on where you are; for instance, shipping cost (excluding packaging) to St. Paul, MN would cost $60.  I also consider local within about 100 miles for all the computer parts, but I'm also flexible with that number. ~~&lt;---**EDIT 1:** Includes the price of the TV~~

* **EDIT 2:** [Samsung LNT4671F 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD TV](http://imgur.com/a/YEy2i), the photos don't really show detail but there aren't scratches and I babied the T.V. during my ownership - $550.00 local price + up to $305 U.S. shipping and packaging, if required. The U.S. shipping price is based on $60 for crate packaging and $245 shipping to the western-most zip code in Washington state from my zip code; the shipping price may actually be much less depending on where you are; for instance, shipping cost (excluding packaging) to St. Paul, MN would cost $215.  I also consider local within about 350 miles for the TV, but I'm also flexible with that number.

I just wanted to point out that the Samsung TV is awesome, but again, its size is just not practical for me.  ~~I hate to list it at $200, as it's kind of difficult to think about its original price when 120Hz was the new rave (I bought it new from Best Buy at $2800).~~

Lastly, please excuse the slightly dated time stamp, dusty equipment (I've since sprayed it out with compressed air) and somewhat shoddy photos; I rushed to take these photos before I left for a vacation last week, but I'm sure they still represent the product sufficiently (if not, just ask for more!)  Also, the currently installed GPU is not the one for sale.

HP Touchpad is in like new condition, has had a case and screen protector on it all its life. Included is 2 extra screen protectors, a gel case, a pleather envelope case, and two chargers with cables.

The Silverstone Strider Plus 500W has been in my current rig since I purchased it July 2012. I replaced it with a 750W power supply to go along with my new graphics card.[Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817256065)

The MSI 7850 was purchased along with the Silverstone Strider Plus 500W in July 2012. It was replaced under warranty in February 2013 for an issue that had been present the entire time I owned it, where randomly during gaming, my computer would crash. The new one fixed that issue, but introduced a new issue with the HDMI port only. I am including the HDMI to Mini displayport cable that I purchased to work around this issue ([this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K62HQ0/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)). The card functions perfectly through both MDP and DVI.[Newegg](
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127706)

I needed to run some wires into my case, so I removed two of the metal bars from the slot cover on the back, [see here](http://i.imgur.com/zZneDWP.jpg). It doesn't affect the card at all, but if it bothers you, sorry. :(. Also specifically, the issue with the HDMI port only comes up when trying to run a full screen game, artifacts appear. Games run in a window fine, and full screen videos work fine, but certain games have issues running full screen. Again, the HDMI to MDP cable alleviates this problem.


I also have codes for the following, that came with my 7970:

Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon
Crysis 3
Bioshock Infinite
Tomb Raider

I would be looking for around £90. Having said this, I will be using the funds to contribute to my rig, so if you have any of the following up for grabs, I would be happy to barter. 

* GTX580 1.5GB,
* Full-tower gaming case,
* A socket 1155, 2 slot PCIE3, SLI certified motherboard,
* SSD/HDD,
* Offers.


The brand of graphics card is XFX. I bought the old version (has since been re-designed - and for good reason) which had a terrible fan/heatsink. To be fair to the cooling, they were very standard (which should be expected, from the model of card), it was the casing that was the issue. It was a generic fan right at the end of the card, with a big bulky plastic case. This meant that when I tried to push the GPU by running Skyrim (at pretty high detail) it would max out at 97C and BSOD my PC. This happened several times before I went out and bought an aftermarket cooler. The cooler I bought is an Arctic Cooling Accelero Twin Turbo Pro. I bought the card for ~£150 and the cooler was around £40-50 at the time (and a lot of hassle getting it on), and I believe both products are around the same price as of right now. Despite this, I have made the price kind of low for several reasons:

* The model. Since, the 7000 series have come out and honestly, I haven't been following them as closely as I have the GTX600s. Speaking for nVidia's new cards, they are, generally speaking, much more attractive all-round in terms of power consumption, performance, power-to-cost and cooling. I'm assuming this would be similar with the 7000 series, so I'm going to also assume that my 6870 would be now becoming obsolete, in light of the newer models.

* I don't have the original box nor any of its included peripherals. I only have the installation disk, which is essentially not needed as all drivers can be found on the website (I will ship it anyway if one desires). 

* Shipping. I realise a lot of the posters on this subreddit are from the US. I would be expecting you to pay the shipping price, so I thought I'd make the price of the GPU a little lower to cover for this.

* **MINOR FAULTS**. This isn't something which bothered me when I used the card, but I know from experience that others get very nit-picky when buying second hand items and I felt I owe my fellow redditors this assumption. During one of the '97C moments' which I mentioned prior, a minor problem occurred. A lot of (randomiszed) pixels on the screen would change colour (?), mainly on the desktop. This would happen (if I recall correctly) immediately after booting up, and would disappear (for the most part) in a few minutes. However, I do remember there were a couple that were stubborn and would stay around for much longer - although I seem to recall I mainly only ever saw it on white webpages (mainly, the background of YouTube) and on the desktop. **HOWEVER**, I've changed monitors, graphics cards and motherboards since then, so it might not even have been an issue revolving around the GPU, but I felt I should mention it anyway.


Feel free to ask questions.

I have all of the parts for the cooler, but I packed it up to sell and would prefer to not have to unpack it unless someone seriously distrusts that the two fans are in there. The card is currently in my computer, and again I would take it out if someone really wanted to see what it looked like outside the computer.

The cooler was used for about 2.5 months, and worked amazingly well, but I am going to upgrade to water cooling soon so it no longer is necessary in my computer. I cleaned out 98% of the dust as well. I am asking for $65 (shipping included) for the cooler.

The video card is about 4 months old, and has worked perfectly thus far. However, it is voltage-locked, and I really want to overclock my video card when I get my water cooled loop. I am asking $360 (shipping included) for the card.

I would also take trades for 5800/5900 series GPUs (plus some cash, potentially), or a trade straight up for a different 7970 that is not voltage-locked.

Everything has a receipt apart from the motherboard - which I have a bank statement for proof of purchase. Everything was purchased new by myself from June of last year onwards. 


Couple of points on the case: 

Couple of small things - there's a few marks on the case (very small), all documented in the pictures and the next small irritation/small thing is that the bottom front intake fan makes a noise for the first 30 seconds of powering on then and then quietens down - it's either rubbing on something or the fan has a fault (replaceable under warranty I would have though) and lastly the case has some lights above the IO ports on the back, i've never been able to get these to work, either through my own fault or again manufacturing issue (again should be replaceable under warranty). 

The case comes with 2xNZXT Fans and 2xAF140 Fans installed as well as a spare NZXT FAN.

Just got an H60 and have decided to go back to the hobby I so loved on my old Phenom II's. Looking to OC an i5-3570K or i7-3770K to 4GHz+ and I'm swapping my Xeon to someone who wants the power and features of an i7-3770 without the overclockability.



I'll trade for a 3570K with cash or pay cash myself for a 3770K. No need for it to be brand new in the box, but preferably without any major overclocking hours on it so I don't have to worry about spontaneous failure. 



On my end, the Xeon will be shipped in the original box with the unused stock Intel HSF and manual (no sticker). I will clean it with ArctiClean before shipping it out, so the IHS should be good as new! Never been overclocked (obviously), just used frequently for Blu-Ray and HD encoding/decoding using Handbrake and WinX Blu-Ray Decrypter.

I can offer some cash, but keep in mind my friends and I are pretty broke. I have a few great toys, but in terms of actual disposable income, we're all very, very limited. Anyway, if you're interested in some of our junk, or have junk of your own you'd like to get rid of, but don't want to pay the shipping on, all we ask is that some part on it still works. Have a motherboard with 3 bad RAM slots? Awesome. a few blown caps? I've probly got the parts to fix that. the only exception would be PSU's, but I doubt any swappers would really be willing to part with the spares we keep for testing.

[Asus G73JH](http://usa.asus.com/Notebooks/Gaming_Powerhouse/G73Jh/)

Gaming laptop that can handle almost all current games with ease. 

* ATI HD 5870 Mobility
* Intel Core i7 Q720
* **64GB Crucial M4 SSD**
* 500GB Hard Drive
* 6GB of RAM with one open expansion slot left
* Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit

Is in great shape in looks, hardware, and software.

* kept all fans cleaned out of dust
* unlocked the GPU to be able to overclock through CCC
* Have flashed BIOS to most recent firmware
* repasted GPU personally using Arctic Silver 5 paste
* have always used most current drivers (although HDD will be wiped if sold)

Decided to sell this for a smaller laptop for college and build myself a desktop. Spent ~$1400 on the laptop new. Looking for maybe ~$900 **OBO**.

Have some pictures [here](http://imgur.com/a/oESVB) and can provide any others by request.

Would like to use PayPal only or cash if you're in my area.

Edit: Figure I should note that, although I unlocked the GPU I haven't really used it while overclocked. I haven't played anything that the computer just couldn't handle while not overclocked.

 I ended up paying $300 for it because it included a 1TB HDD and Windows Home Server (**not 2011**). **The HDD is not included here.**

I'm willing to trade for just about anything cool including but not limited to: server components, racks, rails, desktop components, peripherals, computer accessories, routers, switches, hubs, game systems, games, and gaming accessories.

One has neat blue LED's One fan on top, one fan in front (there are vent holes in the silver part of the front of the case and 2 underneath the front) [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/GRG2j.jpg)

I'm looking for $650 for the thing, plus whatever shipping ends up being.

There is already a mild overclock on there to 3.9 Ghrz.  I haven't gotten much luck going above that, because the MicroATX board I got doesn't like voltage increases for some reason.  But it's still a beast.  I haven't had any issues with it for close to 6-8 months or so.

It doesn't include a keyboard or mouse, but does include a power cable obviously.  I guess if need be, I can throw in one of my older keyboards and mice. 

I'm looking to sell/ship around towards the end/middle of May, depending on when I can get a hold of a new GTX 680 for my new build.

1.) **8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 PNY 1333MHz RAM.** I've had the RAM for a couple of months now and it's been working great. I'm getting rid of it is because I want faster RAM and it doesn't match my other components. Most RAM in it's category goes for around $70, so I'm asking $45 shipped. 

2.) **Intel H61 mATX motherboard.** Great motherboard when in use. I upgraded from it for a newer Z77 motherboard. Comes with the motherboard, I/O shield, SATA cables, and driver CD. I don't have the original box or the quick reference guide unfortunately. $40 shipped.

3.) **In Win Z589T case.** It does not come with the power supply, just the case itself with the screws for mounting the motherboard and a power supply. Only local pickup for the case, PM me if you are close and are interested in it. $25

4.) **HP Pavilion Dv5.** I've had this laptop since 2010 and barely used it, literally having a lifespan of maybe 8 weeks, leaving it in Europe for vacations, that's why it has a Portuguese keyboard and power cable. It currently has the Portuguese version of Windows Vista Home Basic, but you can install a new OS if you want. $150 shipped. 

5.) ~~**Galaxy GT610 1GB.** Originally bought it at Best Buy last December and it has worked well until I replaced it for something else. It comes with the card, drivers CD, quick installation guide, and warranty card. $20 shipped.~~ - Sold! 

6.) **Norton 360 2013 Antivirus.** I got it for free when buying a 3G mobile hotspot in another country, hence why it's in Portuguese. I use other Antivirus software, so it's no use to me. It says it works for up to 5 devices. I can either ship the box to you or just PM you the codes in the box, which is still sealed. The English box retails for $120, so I'll ship it to you for $25.

I had it in Crossfire with another 7850 but I upgraded my monitor to a 1440p Korean one. The performance of two 7850s at 1440p is pretty poor.

I have the box now, I didn't when I previously posted. I had to cut out the UPC for the MIR so it's gone. I ordered the card on 11/30/12 so it's not even a year old, but XFX's warranty doesn't transfer and the account has some personal information that I'm obviously not going to give to the buyer. So in effect, there's **no warranty** of any kind, hence the low price. 

I would prefer to meet in person that way the buyer can test out the card and see that it does in fact work. Anyone who can meet me will get priority. I am willing to ship it, but the buyer will have to pay that cost.

I used it for about two years for watercooling. It's heavily modded but still in good condition. It's missing two cable grommets, but they can't be seen if using an ATX mobo. It's missing a few expansion slot covers and at least one, maybe two, 5.25"" bay covers. It still has the PSU filter but has been cut down as to not interfere with the 2x120mm hole. 
List of mods(all shown in pictures):

* cut hole in top and added a 4x120mm Bitspower fan grill
* The top was damaged a little when cutting the 4x120mm hole so it was repainted. Doesn't look perfect, but still looks good in my opinion
* cut hole in bottom for 2x120mm fans(no fan grill here)
* removed both HDD cages(plenty of space to add a new cage in either the old cage space or 5.25"" bays)
* cut hole in rear side panel for 120mm fan and added mesh grill
* replaced power and HDD LED with orange LED instead of the stock white
* cut hole on the rear of where the top HDD cage used to be for watercooling tube and added grommet
* Toolless clips have been removed from the 5.25"" bays

Because of all the mods I'm willing to let this go very cheap. Only problem is the cost of shipping. Shipping alone costs nearly $50. I accept PayPal or I'm looking to trade for a 120gb+ sata3 SSD

Never used [Corsair HX 650 modular PSU](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139012). Purchased from Newegg a few months ago, only to find that there was misinformation on the Corsair website about the dimensions of this PSU (website said it was 140mm, it is 150mm, and therefore didn't fit in my case). If there is interest, I will plug it in to make sure that it isn't DOA. Will ship with all original packaging. $80 shipped.

I forgot them at a friends place, and under the assumption that they were lost, I ordered another pair. My original pair showed up a few weeks ago, so I now have two pairs. I will be selling the original pair, as they were used for a shorter period of time. The headphones are in perfect condition, and will come with all original packaging. $35 shipped.

Comes with the charger and netbook only; Ubuntu will be reinstalled as I do not have a W7 license to include.

I would like to get 300.00 USD a card, I would be willing to go lower like 550 or 500 if they were bought as a pair. Im just trying to get at least 500, which will pay for half of the 690.

1) Paypal/Money

2) SSD

3) Z77 Motherboard

4) ???, you tell me. High end computer stuff mostly.

All keys are functional, the LEDs in the CAPSLOCK, Scroll lock, and Windows Key lock still shine brightly, and there is no damage to any of the keycaps themselves (beside the aforementioned fading on a few of them).

* Ebay: Nominal listing fees. People may be hesitant to buy from you if you don't have a lot of Ebay feedback points. (""A++++, excellent seller, fast shipping, great personal hygiene, etc."")

* Amazon: Similar to Ebay. Not sure if dispute resolution is better or worse for sellers. You are required to offer a return policy. Not sure if this is good or bad. Reputation may matter less. You don't want people to use your stuff and return it normally, but it does make people more likely to buy.

* Craigslist: No fees, meet in person, possible chance of getting robbed or scammed depending on what town you live in. Seems difficult to demonstrate that your hardware works to a seller short of allowing them into your home (bad idea), or lugging your computer somewhere else.

I'm also tossing a pair of 120mm Cougar Vortex, Cooljag Everflow, or sleeved Swiftech Helix fans in.  I haven't decided which pair to add yet, but all but the Swiftechs are PWM.

I recently upgraded my heatsink to the Thermaltake Water 2.0 Extreme, so I don't really need my Archon any more.  I love the thing, but I'd rather pass it on to someone else. 

It's in excellent condition and comes with everything from the box including the Thermalright Chill Factor it came with.  The only problems are that it's missing one of the silicon strips that went between the fan and the radiator and the retention bar is very particular about the screwdriver you use with it.  If you use one with the head just a little off it will strip the head.  It's the condition it shipped to me from an OCN member in.

If you were to buy the second fan and the Archon separately, you'd be spending ~$100 with shipping, maybe a little more since Performance-PCs shipping can be higher than it should be.  I'm also tossing in a PWM fan splitter.  I think $60+shipping is a fair price.

I am interested in selling my ati 4980 turbo+ ([Link](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161298)). I bought this card on 10/16/2009 and it has served me very well since then, however with prices dropping on newer cards I went ahead and upgraded to a 2gb 6950. At the time this card came out it was a pretty amazing card and it is still capable of playing most games at max or close to max settings (skyrim actually automatically set to high settings and ran super smooth). If you are curious of performance compared to newer card it is on par or a bit faster (depending on game) than a 6770. 

I do understand this card is older and has a few years (3) on it. [6770's](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007709&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=ati%206770&amp;name=Desktop%20Graphics%20Cards&amp;Order=PRICE&amp;Pagesize=20) sell for right around the $100 price point, so I will be asking $50 + shipping (pretty firm). I will be sending the card out in my 6950 box so it will have proper support/protection in shipping. If you are interested I will also toss in about 1/2 a tube of artic silver 5 so you can pull the heatsink and get everything performing like new again.

From my history you can see that I am an established redditor. If you also pop over to /r/gameswap you can also see that I have a few successful trades including actually mailing physical copies of games.

If you have any questions or would like pics please send me a PM and I will see what we can do. Payment will be accepted via paypal (non gift) and GPU will be sent certified.

Side note: I am really posting this card because I am hoping that someone who has been wanting to build a rig can start with a pretty good GPU for a good price. You should be aware this card has some negatives. It is POWER HUNGRY so don't think you will be able to run it will a 400w psu. I have been using an OCZ 600w psu and have had zero problems. This card also runs a bit hot, normally around 60c under load. The final draw back is if you decide to overclock the card even further (which can be done) and have to turn the fan up it turns into a tornado in your case.",,False,self,t5_2skrs,False,,,True,t3_tk5mx,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/tk5mx/usa_h_ati_4890_turbo_w_50shipping/,

That is a basic overview. In total, it still has the mobo, CPU heatsink, video card, 60w PSU, card reader, video capture card, remote with IR receivers, integrated 802.11n wireless card. Defiantly not a powerful PC, but throw an AM3 CPU, some ram and maybe a disk drive and you have yourself a nice little media center. Runs super cool and quiet, but TBH is rather small (it can fit a dual slot PCIx16 card) and has no cable management. But the [video card](http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/ati-radeon-hd-5000/hd-5570/Pages/hd-5570-overview.aspx) does rather nicely. I was running Crysis 2 at 1920x1080 on the second highest setting (I can't remember what it was but it was not gamer) and got a solid 50-60fps. It also comes with a stock AM3 CPU cooler, works very well, had my Phenom x6 OC'd to 3.5ghz and it would only get up to about 55c under heavy load.

All you need is a AM3 processor, some ram and a HD, you will be good to go. I have the original box, so shipping should not be too hard, and it should get to you in good repair. I will ship from around Vancouver, so closer is preferable. If you want the whole thing, or bits and pieces, message me and we will hammer out the details.

I will also include my Home Premium windows key on it so you don't have to shell out even more for an OS.

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/FzFz5R5.jpg) a broad picture of my stuff today.


**ITEMS FOR SALE**:  
ASUS G71GX-RX05:$350  
Apevia Computer Case:$30  
NETGEAR WNDR3300:$45  
Cisco-Linksys E3000:$50  
Palm Treo Pro:$25  


**ASUS G71GX-RX05**:  This is the BestBuy version which is a little neutered compared to the G71GX-A1.  It's a capable little machine and can run BF3 at the same level as the XBOX or PS3 (Ewww, 25 FPS at minimum settings...)  Which means you really probably won't want to play that on here.  But anything less demanding than that will be handled with ease.  

Does not come with a hard drive, but it can take 2.  The second HDD bracket which I had to buy is also included.  Does not have a charger, it broke and that's actually why I'm selling this.  I have a desktop with better specs now, and don't have much use for a heavy power hungry laptop.  Chargers for this go from $30-$60.  Functionally it works fine, and while I could turn it on with a charger with lower voltage and amperage, it could affect the hardware and make it more prone to breaking in the future and I don't want to do that with respect to whoever buys it.  The laptop itself came with stupid doors on the sides that covered the ports on the sides (maybe ASUS was afraid of dust) but they quickly broke and are now missing.  A piece of plastic which is supposed to cover the connection between the screen and GPU is also missing.  Some screws on the bottom are also missing but the panels have no problem staying on.


Important Specs:  
CPU:     Dual core Intel P8700 processor that runs stock at 2.53 Ghz but the ASUS TurboGear software can automatically overclock it to about 2.90 Ghz.  You can use SetFSB to overclock it higher with clockgen 9LPRS929AKLF.  
RAM:     6GB RAM  
GPU:     Nvidia GTX 260M with 1GB VRAM which can be overclocked a little.  
HDD:     Not included  
Screen size:     17.1""

**Apevia Computer Case**:  Basic ATX computer case.  Has 2 USB 2.0 ports, headphone and mic ports, and an eSATA port.  Has 2 fans.  The display shows case temperature.  Has power and HDD LED's.

**Treo Pro**:Old unlocked GSM phone from Palm running Windows Mobile 6.1.  I think on XDA you can find a way to flash it to Windows Mobile 6.5.  Works fine but has a lot of cosmetic damage although screen only has a few small scratches.  Battery doesn't hold a charge very long.  No charger included but it's a normal MicroUSB so a charger isn't hard to find.

I'm looking to condense my entertainment desk down into a single portable unit, preferably as I said above a Sager or Clevo gaming laptop. I've listed the specs of the desktop below:



* Case: Cooler Master Elite 120 Advanced


* Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-H77N WI-FI



* RAM: 2 x 4GB Corsair Vengeance LP DDR3-1600 9-9-9-24



* CPU: Intel Xeon E3 1230 V2 (essentially an i7-3770 with no integrated graphics for those not familiar with desktop Xeons)



* GPU: MSI Twin Frozr III Radeon HD 7950



* PSU: EVGA NEX750B 80+ Bronze 750W Semi-Modular PSU




* ODD: LG Blu-Ray Reader / DVD-RW Drive



* SSD: 128GB Crucial M4 Solid-State Drive w/ Windows 8 Pro 64-bit



* HDD: 500GB WD Black (manufacture date January 2013, IIRC)



The PS3 is the second-gen slimline model with a 160GB HDD and two controllers, all in perfect condition.  I could include TES IV: Oblivion GOTY Edition if anyone wants it, no charge.




The Dell 23"" IPS monitor is only about three months old, and has zero dead pixels or bright spots. It will be shipped in the original packaging and box.



The Corsair K60 is about six months old and works great, no stuck or damaged keys, and I've done an extensive cleaning of the keys and aluminum housing in preparation for sale.



The TF700T tablet is about three months old, and comes in perfect condition in the original boxes with all original accessories. It has been updated to Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (the most recent Android version available for tablets), and works perfectly, no scratches and no dents.



Again, I'd like cash offers for these items (priority will be given to those who want to buy the desktop as a whole or buy multiple items with bundled shipping), or an offer for an excellent-quality Sager or Clevo laptop with at least the same graphics capability as a Radeon HD 7950 or thereabouts.

Yes, those are my sexy, sexy feet.

Case is easily big enough to handle 3 video cards, and will also hold 2 power supplies for all you aspiring miners out there.

Has not been modded, will come nearly complete, save a single missing PCI slot grill cover on the back, but assuming you have a video card, you don't need them all anyhow. It has a ton of screws/misc hardware as well. It's missing 2x 120mm fans (the loud stock ones), but I've thrown in a Noctua 140mm intake fan. Assuming you're interested in this case, you probably have a ass-load of gentle typhoons to spare.
Here's the deal: This beast is heavy (30ish lbs), and I am **not** interested in shipping it. If you live in NYC, and you want to come get it, bring me some cash, and I will send you on your merry way. Case is located in Park Slope.

I also have a nice little XFX 6950. Yes, I'll admit that it's only the 1GB version, but it does have 1408 stream processors, and if you know why that's important, I can tell you with some mild overclocking (~950ish mhz) it was getting 381 MH/s. Also plays games well, ran Skyrim with everything maxed except the grass distance over 50 FPS. I would rather **not** ship this either.

**GTX 550 Ti #2**:Ha.  Here's a story.  I bought the 550 Ti's to use in an SLI configuration.  I was disappointed with the performance so I upgraded.  Currently I have a GTX 670, **GTX 570**, and **GTX 550 Ti #2** in the same computer mining Bitcoins.  My mobo doesn't really like that and I had to cut (well, melt) the casing on the 550 Ti to fit around my SATA cables.  It works completely fine but an eighth of the casing is removed.

Ive had it just over a year and its served me splendidly. Plays all my games at ultra except for MSAA when available e.g BF3.

Its a great card with unbelievable cooling compared to most other 6950s, on avg its 11C cooler and i also redid the thermal paste about 3 weeks ago which also lower the temps by about 5C on load.
Unfortunately my card cant get 6970 shaders coz its been lasercut, but it still OC's well.
 For high grade games like BF3, Crysis 3 Beta etc the clocks are at 920/1375.

greetings everybody,

i am attempting to build my self a new $500 budget gaming rig because the one i use now is outdated and i really can't do much on it as far as gaming goes.

due to financial troubles (bills) i had to lower my computer build priority, i am not able to buy all the parts i need right away so i began to slowly save up money for parts, I currently have $240 saved up, I will be salvaging a case, hdd &amp; but i already bought a new psu with a giftcard i got for christmas, so I will only be needing a cpu/mobo/ram/gpu

i am willing to sell these parts

I've got a [Sapphire 4870 X2](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102768) that I just don't care to have any more. It works, but has a few kinks that I just don't have the knowledge/time/effort to work out.


The story: This card was originally for sale at the computer store I frequent for a cool $90. I bought it because it was a good deal at the time (about a year or so ago) and it would be a good backup card to have. My brother then sold his GTS 450 and used this in his computer as a temporary card while he saved/researched a new one. It ran everything like a champ, 100% no problems. It wasn't even very loud.


Then, it suddenly stopped posting. We took it out, and it felt like one of the cores was overheating. We waited for it to cool with no avail. So, I went ahead and returned it. It sat on the shelf for months because the owner didn't RMA it (even though it was within warranty).


Fast forward a few months. I found a 4850 512MB at Goodwill for $4 (it was in a 6950 box, which just about gave me a heart attack). It worked and everything, and I had read up on the 4870 X2's overheating and thought I could fix it. I traded cards.


I took it apart, cleaned out the dust and everything, and applied some Arctic Silver on both of the GPUs. I popped it back together, and voila, it posts. I tried Ubuntu just to install an OS and see if the card would overheat, and it eventually reached 70^o C because the fan stayed at idle. I upgraded my PSU from a 600w with two 6-pins to a 620w with a 6-pin and a 6+2-pin. I installed Windows 7 and Afterburner, set the fan to 40%, and it stayed at a cool 35^o to idle. It ran perfectly fine for hours and hours (even overnight) with no artifacts or crashes or anything. But then as I attempted to install Catalyst and such to mess with the Crossfire settings, it BSOD'd. Now, when I turn it on, artifacts come up on the screen.


As I said, I don't really care about it anymore now that I bought a 5970 that I can mess with. 


It comes with the original box and all the original accessories (minus the power cables, which were gone when I first bought it). The card itself is in near-perfect physical condition, inside and out.


I'm up to any offers on the whole thing, either through PayPal or through trades. Feel free to offer anything as a trade. But keep in mind that I've looked on eBay and have found [fully-functional ones](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Graphics-Video-Cards-/27386/i.html?_from=R40&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=4870+x2) as well as [non-functioning ones.](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Graphics-Video-Cards-/27386/i.html?_from=R40&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=4870+x2&amp;_dcat=27386&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_ItemCondition=7000)

The second one is the current generation like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823201040) one.

If you're not aware, the difference between the first generation and the second generation are that the first gen does not have a removable cable, and the first gen's body has nicer texture to the face plate. Aside from that, they are pretty much identical.

I'm selling the first gen because I replaced it with my second gen. I'm selling my second gen because I'm replacing it with the [white](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823201052) version of the RK-9000.

The first gen had a slight case of chattering keys. Pressing some of the keys would result in two key presses instead of one. I've used it quite a bit recently and haven't experienced the issue again, but I can't promise that it won't return. Some of the keys are a bit faded, as I used this keyboard for a while before I replaced it.

The second gen one is in perfect working order. The area along the keyboard under the space bar is a little shiny from my thumb, but there are no other imperfections. I've plastidipped it white, which I can leave on, or take off depending on what you want (though I did a pretty bad job on it... So taking it off is probably a good idea :P). Also I use my own keycaps for the board so the key caps that it will ship with it are hardly used. Oh, and the feet are plastidipped so that it doesn't slide around on the desk. Also removable upon request (though I would definitely keep that on).


I won't be shipping either keyboard until early January, as I'm waiting for my replacement keyboard to come in from Newegg, which is scheduled to arrive on January 2. Looking for around $60 per board.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/mwsBp) are the photos of the keyboards as-is. They will both be getting a thorough cleaning when I switch the keycaps over to my new board.

I run an iPhone repair business. My friend sold me his cracked White iPhone 4S that was used for AT &amp; T. I fixed the front an back screen with brand new glass quality panels. I use the highest quality parts to fix them. Everything works 100% and I can guarantee that no screws or parts were missed in the operation. In the event that the phone has any defects in the next 6 months, I'll take it back (i.e. broken sound controls, speakers not working, LCD issues). I'm that confident in how well the phone works. The only visible damage is scratches on the metal frame of the phone. I'll include a screen protector and case and a charger. 


The phone is unlocked, sim is out, and is ready to be used.

I also have a Dell U2311H Ultrasharp monitor that I purchased from another seller from HWS about 2 months ago. It has a slight line in the middle of the screen, but other than that it's in great shape. It is marked refurbished. I'm upgrading to a Catleap.


**SOLD** ~~Price: **$100** Shipped~~



I am also looking for a full PC or parts to make a cheap mATX or compact gaming system. Cases, i3, Phenom IIs, APUs, mid tier GPUs, and small cases: all that good stuff to make a game sufficient to run modern games at competitive frame rates. 

I'll post pictures later today!

I got it about 2 years ago for around $1,100 and upgraded to 4GB cache. At the time it was around a $300 upgrade. They're still selling for $780-$1,000 at the default 512MB cache level.

The Mini-SAS will run any SATA drive with a cable available from newegg or just about anywhere else.

This one has been fairly lightly used, mostly just powering a 0x4 2TB raid and two independent disks on my desktop. I've had no issues with it at all, I'm just upgrading to the 1882IX so this one has to go.

[Here's a 1.4GB/s benchmark using standard Western Digital drives. Because of the 4GB of cache it'll hit that for many operations under about 1-1.5GB.](http://i.imgur.com/9SOEs.jpg)

Edit:

Three more benchmarks... 

These two are run against a single run of the mill WD Velociraptor. No raid, nothing special. Not even aligned right. [The first one](http://i.imgur.com/SqTs3.jpg) is a 1GB test file and I've set the card to heavily favor reads, so you'll notice far less write caching with my version. That said, you can see the reads are fairly impressive.

[For the second bench](http://i.imgur.com/V4xvQ.jpg) I used a smaller test file, 100MB, which is small enough for the write caching to come into play. In this one you can see 1GB/s+ on reads and writes.

[Finally, I ran a different bench utility against a single Vertex 3](http://i.imgur.com/JNddm.jpg) Off the shelf, nothing special. You can see it again favoring reads. You can change the settings on the card, right now I have them set aggressive towards reads.
 

With refurb 512MB cards going for $780+ I'd like to get $700 shipped for this 4GB version.

Guitar Hero Aerosmith

Guitar Hero 2

Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock

Accessories:

2x like new 360 controllers (the official ones)

all cables, etc

2x Guitar Hero guitars (one is from guitar hero aerosmith, one is from I think guitar hero legends of rock? both in working order with very minor cosmetic scuffing, you almost cant see it)

1x cheap third party headset w/ a glowing led in the mic piece

Condition:

Every thing works flawlessly. Never had any issues with the console or any of the games/accessories! I also have the original 360 box with all docs that come with it. Every retail game is in a solid original game case as well!

Also have an Acer Revo 1600 in perfect condition. It's an amazing little nettop pc that I currently have XBMC Ubuntu installed and use it as a media server. I just dont use it as much since I use my 360 for hulu/netflix etc. You can install any OS on it though and do whatever you want with it. Comes with power cords, keyboard, and mouse.

and lastly I have a Microsoft Zune 80gb mp3 player. It's nice! The silver piece around the touch control on the front is a little scuffed but it works perfectly. Includes the proprietary usb cable.

What I want: Any PS3 systems/game combos and perhaps other offers as well. I have found that I have many acquaintances who play on 360 and I have Live Gold, but it's getting to the point where all of my good close friends have a PS3 and I just think it would be more fun to play with them and be able to swap games, etc

I want any PS3 offers for consoles in similar condition, working and of high quality. I am mostly looking for the console with games for an even straight up trade.

Let me know what you have if you are interested.

I have completed one trade on a previous reddit account that I dont use anymore at /r/gameswap w/ username http://www.reddit.com/user/mikesuds I can login to that one to confirm with you that I am who I say I am!

The above system is for sale, but with a neat twist. (you may have seen this on r/buildapc a little while back: http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/qgyf6/build_complete_itx_wembedded_monitor/ ) I cut one side of the case out and have successfully mounted a 14"" laptop screen that functions as a primary display. Since then I swapped out the CPU and video card as they were just too powerful for the 1440 x 900 screen! : ) The entire system was built in March of this year or sooner- has had no problems and will come with a fresh install of Windows 7 Ultimate on the SSD. The screen is converted by an LVDS adapter that is housed within the case. Power is brought the screen and the PSU via a single, split standard power cable. The case will fit and power a full-length GPU (I've done a 580 with no temperature problems at all) Also not included above is the price of the screen, which ran about $50 for the screen itself and $30 for the adapter kit. In addition, I am including an HD4870 GPU, which is not listed above. It's got handle mounted to the top, as you can see in the pics, and is great for LAN parties, or just having a decent PC you can carry around. Also includes mini-microphone and nano-USB wireless-N adapter. In addition I can throw in a pair of decent Logitech desktop speakers. Oh, and the keyboard mounts to the back of the case with velcro. I can also ship you the little wooden riser I built so the screen is a good viewing height. Will ship anywhere in the US via FedEx based on weight. (~20lbs)

 A video of the PC can be found here: http://youtu.be/h45N8IJNINI

And pics: http://imgur.com/a/ZdgdJ

I'm selling it because I thought it would be the right idea for me (traveling actor/gamer, etc) but it still really too large and impractical. For the right person I think this is awesome. I will not part out; it's too custom a job to take apart. I'd consider trades for current-gen gaming laptops under 15"", and would possibly put cash towards any current-gen Mac laptop. The price is pretty firm- I'm not desperate to sell; just feeling that ""materialistic malaise"" that I'm sure you're all quite familiar with. 

Oh, I guess a final price would be good- I'm asking $700+ shipping as it is above, with speakers, video card, keyboard, mic, all cables, and of course the embedded monitor.

Everything pictured is up for grabs EXCEPT the hard drives (moving to new computer), tubing (fittings still included) and the GT 520 (no longer have it). Additionally, I will only sell the 580s with the water blocks attached.

I'm not really looking to screw people over here, just want to get enough cash to pay for my new machine. So to make this easier for everybody, price per individual part is 50% of the current Newegg price (or FrozenCPU for parts not on the Egg, basically all WC parts) + $5 shipping regardless of size anywhere in the US. I think that sounds fair.

If you are willing to buy more than one part, I'll give you preference, as it will make shipping and costs much easier on me.

I severely went over my budget so looking to sell my old computer to absorb some of the cost. built this computer maybe 3-4 years ago and the only upgrade that I did since it was built was the video card.  In terms of future upgradeability this is on it's last legs as to what it could do.  **make me an offer, I am located in the los angeles area**

* Asus P5N-D motherboard

* 6gb of 800mhz ram

* Sapphire HD 5850 1gb video card

* Duo core E8500 processor overclocked to 3.8ghz

* Xigmatek dark knight after market heat sink

* Aprevia X discovery case (fyi this one has NO cable management)

* Logisys 750w power supply

* Western digital 500gb HDD.

And because I have no intention of screwing someone over here's some of the games that I play and their performance.

* WOW: ultra settings, get 10-15fps in stormwind/25 man raids. 25+ FPS in 10 man raids.  30+ fps out in the world questing.

* Batman Arkham city: High settings  get decent FPS, don't know the actual number but I get an occasional stutter or lag. 

* SWTOR: max settings, UNPLAYABLE in ilum or when there's a vast number of people.  my FPS would drop down to .5 fps in ilum.  decent FPS in any other setting.  

* Battlefield 3: playable in high settings but more suited for medium.  

* Skyrim: settings on high is very enjoyable.  good mix between FPS and visual goodness.  

* Rift: max settings, got about the same performance as wow

* Saints row the third: I think this game is more reliant on processor power.  even on minimal settings there was unenjoyable performance. 

* LA noire: I would know how this played it if i ever got the damn game to install properly.

I have additional case fans that make airflow pretty awesome (after running it for several months almost no dust build up) and the only parts that get even sort of hot are the video cards when stress testing.

As stated before, I'm hoping to move to a gaming laptop (been looking at Sager) and the only non-cash trade I'd be willing to make would be for a new or slightly used high-end gaming laptop.

If it makes a difference, I still have all of the original receipts, and am happy to send them with the computer for warranty purposes.

Both cards are currently running unlocked, in crossfire, at 6950 clock speeds without a single problem. The BIOS switch doesn't change the clocks, but both cards should run 6970 clocks fine via software. I ran one card at 6970 speeds flawlessly before I bought the other, but when I had them in crossfire, I kept the clocks at stock since I had no need for the extra speed. One is the Dirt3 edition, and the other is the non-Dirt3 edition, but they are essentially identical.

I would like $205 each + shipping via paypal. I would also be willing to take Amazon giftcards if you are comfortable enough mailing/e-mailing them. I am located in Austin, TX if you're local. I have lots of feedback on various forums and eBay, so don't hesitate to ask for some if you'd like some reassurance. **EDIT: BOTH ARE NOW SOLD.** One has been sold locally, and other to user ""xpyrofuryx."" Thanks for your interest!

I have provided a link to a photo of them in my PC, as well as some screen shots of dxdiag and GPU-Z. The linked video was directed to a person who was interested in buying them before, but has since backed out; it shows the cards running 3DMark11 so you can see they are in fine working condition.

Apologies for the crappy quality. My only camera is an iPod touch. 

There is nothing wrong with the case, just decided to rebuild my computer and wanted a Node 304 for the size difference. My Node 304 will be arriving Thursday so I can ship as soon as Friday. Will be shipped in original packaging. I do have Paypal but would prefer just to trade parts. 

HP dv7. I'll be honest and say that I'm not proud of the thing. Its had some heavy use over the past couple years but it still does everything well enough to get by. The bad; there's a bad scratch on the screen and the g,h,v and . buttons have fallen off. If you want it I will be shipping it with a NON-authenticated copy of windows. I will be reformatting as to not pass on personal info.

The monitor is good and has built in speakers. It has no dead pixels. It's not the brightest monitor in the world but it has worked for me as a second monitor for my setup. It's no longer needed so I thought it would be a good idea to pass on.

Asking price for both is $285 for the 7970 and $290 for GS3.  **Shipping is free**.  Here is a picture verification of the devices: www.imgur.com/wm9cTR3.jpg

First up is the 7970 GHZ. This card has been used for the past few months by me, but since I've just come home from being overseas for a few months I've decided to upgrade my graphics card to a GTX780, hence why this card is for sale. (mainly to cut some of the cost of buying the GTX780). The 7970 OC's stable to 1175 on the core and 1550 on the memory.

Next is my Samsung Galaxy S3, which has served me well over the last year, and which still functions like new. It has a screen protector on it (which will be replaced by a new one I have coming in within a day or two) and a (crappy) otterbox defender case. The phone has a few knicks around the metal band that is on the outside and on the power button, but the screen remains virtually flawless (I will double check this and make sure before selling) and the phone overall looks good. I've been using the phone with straight-talk and have had no problems with it functionally. (just upgraded to a GS4 though, so that's why I'm selling)

There are a few things that I should mention right away, so I shall do that now.


----------


 • All Payments WILL go through Paypal no exceptions.  I do not have any other services setup and don't plan on doing so.

 • All prices are Shipped if you live within the US48, if you live outside of the US48, you will pay for shipping.

 • If you receive a graphics card and for some reason it is not working, you will have 30 days from the day that you receive it to return it to me. I paid to ship it to you, you pay to ship it back please.  I find that only fair and fitting.

 • If you do need to return the card due to it being faulty within the 30 days, you will receive a full refund for the card no questions asked.

 • I will wait till I receive the card and check it to make sure it is indeed faulty before refunding any money.  If the card still works, I will ship the card back and no refund will be processed.  You made a choice to buy a card, please don't back out of it.

 • No negotiating the price down, I am already taking a $100 loss on the 7970 and a $25 loss on the 295's.

 • I would LOVE to be able to wait till all the cards are sold before I ship them out.  However, if 2 sell and there is one left, I will just use the third card until it sells.

 • I will wait 1 week from the day someone wants to buy something before I ship it.  I will not ship it until the money has been transferred to my Paypal account.

 • If you have any questions about the cards, please ask them in this thread and not in a PM, someone else may have the same question and they all should know the answer.

There, since that is now out of the way.  A bit of information about the cards.  I receive my 7970 from a fellow OCN member like yourselves.  I picked it up off of here for $400, but am looking to give back to the community at a loss to make sure someone can have a damn good graphics card at a cheap price.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this card and it overclocks great on stock voltage.  I have been running it at 1050/1550 since I've owned the card and it has played everything I've thrown at it great.(Skyrim; Team Fortress 2; LoL, Grid 2, XCOM, World of Tanks, Bioshock Infinite, etc...)



I also receive my GTX 295's from a fellow OCN member as well.  These cards were once used for folding@home and have incurred many MANY points on them for a good cause.  They are basically OCN memorabilia if you think about it.  But in no way does that change the price of them.  I picked these up for $125(shipped) a piece at the time and used one in a spare rig for when a friend came over and the other... well, it didn't get used at all.  I couldn't find anything to put it in.  I did however make sure that both cards did function correctly and they did.



All of the cards are most likely not under warranty anymore, but honestly, I do not believe that is something that needs to be worried about.  They have run flawlessly without any hitches since I've had them and I believe the same will happen for whomever purchases them in the future(in spite that you do not over volt them(Don't do it, it never ends well)).  The HD 7970 does come with the box and most(if not all) of the accessories.  The GTX 295's however do not have boxes or accessories with them.  For more information about the cards specifics, please click o it and you will be brought to it's main webpage.  The main reason behind me selling these cards is due to the fact that I need to purchase a 7990 for a mITX build I will be doing in the future.  Please ask any additional questions that you may have.

I have quite a few different parts available. Looking to downsize a bit on one of the builds and the other is just some spare parts i have lying around.

Ssd gone. Used cpu,motherboard,ram, optical drive,bitfenix case, and cx430 in another build. So they are gone as well.

Looking to sell all of the parts in the bitfenix case: Case,power supply, dvd drive,2 blue led coolermaster fans.. Although i'd prefer somewhat local, it doesn't really matter.
Here's the phantom build:

Looking mainly to just sell the ram,hard drive, video card, and fans. However will be open to offers on other parts.

Also have 2 regular black coolermaster fans in the phantom, and 2 on their own. Last fan is the fan off of a hyper 212.

**KEYBOARDS**

Razer Blackwidow BF3 Edition - $60 + shipping, near-mint condition with one week of use.

SteelSeries 6Gv2 w/ MX Blacks - $50 + shipping, shine on WASD cluster and left shift key after about a year of use. I will sell it for $60 + shipping if you want the Rosewill caps (never used) on it.

IBM Model F XT - $40 + shipping. I found this keyboard at my school when it was about to be thrown away. I haven't been able to test it, but the keycaps are surprisingly clean. 

[IBM Personal WheelWriter 2](http://imgur.com/a/uabLq#0) - $70 + shipping. This is something you don't normally see, another product of fishing around my school's to-be-dumped pile. I haven't tested it, although if any of you are interested, I'd be glad to try it.

**KEYCAPS**

Rosewill OEM ABS Keycaps - $15 + shipping, Never ever used (Got a WASD custom set right away after ordering the keyboard).

~~Filco Ninja ABS Keycaps - $25 + shipping, roughly a year of use, but no shine since I always washed my hands before using the keyboard. Comes with 84 caps (plus alternate windows keycap), not 104 since I had a TKL board.~~

**MICE**

Logitech G9x - $30 + shipping, the cable is frayed in a few spots, as shown in the album at the top of this post. The performance is unaffected. Comes with the weights as well.

Razer Deathadder - $25 + shipping, like the G9x it is also frayed in a few spots, and there's a small smudge of makeup on the right mouse button. Performance is unaffected.

I'm hoping to sell everything together, but I would be willing to sell parts individually if there's enough interest. Also, shipping the whole thing could be pretty expensive so if anyone wants to pick it up I live in Berkshire. I would be willing to sell everything together for £550.

I got it in order to match the white and black theme of my enthusiast build. However, I just noticed that the Galaxy GTX 770 ($450) was released recently and I would really like to get that instead. 


I'm looking for a direct trade for a new Galaxy HOF card or $460 in order to purchase one.

This is a very preemptive post because I won't be in town until August 28th and won't be able to do the trade/sale until then, but I wanted to gauge some interest.

One thing to note is that this card is not available in any US retail stores.
Thanks.

Up for sale is a limited edition Razer Tron Keyboard. It was made to promote the Tron movie and has since been discontinued. Sellers in Amazon try to sell this keyboard for more than $300! I'm not that seller, I'm letting it go for a good price.

It was purchased in February of 2013 and does not come with the original box, sorry about that.

It has a line in and audio out jack on the keyboard which is a nice shortcut and has a modular keypad (you can flip it from one side to the other depending on preference). It also has an animation when you turn it on/off and lights up while in use.

PM me if you're interested, paypal is preferred.

i also have a 320 GB HDD i can include, but i'd kinda like to keep that as if this sells i plan to backup all my files and games on it.


i don't overclock it, as my house is pretty warm and i like it to stay silent, but if you don't mind the fans kicking in or if your house is a cooler ambient temp than mine, i've had it up to 4.7 Ghz for the CPU and had the GPU up to a GHz. no real need though, it's pretty overkill for a single 1080p screen.

the PC partpicker list shows the video card as the Flex2. mine is actually the original Sapphire Flex, but it was discontinued and i can't find it listed anywhere. the Flex series is nice because it comes with two DVI ports and an HDMI port and supports 3-way eyefinity without any of those adapters that are notorious for burning out every couple of months.

asking $700 or as close to that as i can get. i need 2 grand to put down on this car, i've got ~1300. the $700 includes shipping in the US/Canada. sorry, i'm not going to risk or pay for shipping overseas. i'll ship it in the same box and packaging the thermaltake chaser case came in.

for an extra hundred bucks i'll throw in the 21.5"" Acer 1920x1080 display that's included in the pics. not listed in the PCpartpicker list are the speakers and the keyboard/mouse. they're just generic wal'mart  brand, i'll toss them in if you really want em.

Hello there everyone! 

Newegg really sucks for refunds. My cohabitant had already bought a computer case for me as a gift, so we decided to return the one I had already ordered, the [Cooler Master N200](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119274). It just arrived in the mail today. I literally haven't taken it out of the box.  When I went to set up the refund, Newegg wanted to charge me $20 shipping! Ghastly!

This can case be yours! New! Unopened! Watercooling but mATX form factor! [Pics!](http://imgur.com/a/4M58X/)

[W]: A 500g hard drive. Or just $30  (current newegg price). Or something creative, make me an offer.

I can also take it out of the box to demonstrate the existence and newness for anyone. I'll be cutting off the barcode from the box, to take advantage of a rebate, but i'll cover up the hole before I ship it.

Looking for in person swap. I live in Chicago, anywhere accessible by El works. 

Thanks!

* Case: NZXT Phantom. I've added an extra 200mm fan, but I've disconnected a 120mm fan because one of the blades broke and it rattles when at full speed. - £75
* CPU: AMD Phenom II 955 Black Edition. I've mainly left it at stock clock, but I've sometimes turned on the ""Turbo"" settings. - £45
* CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus - £15
* Motherboard: Asrock 970 Extreme4 - £50
* GPU: MSI Twin Frozr III Radeon HD 6950. I have successfully flashed it to a 6970 BIOS. - £130
* PSU: Corsair TX750 V2 - £60
* SSD: Crucial M4 128GB - £55
* HDD: Two Samsung Spinpoint F3 1TB - £35 each
* RAM: Corsair Vengeance 1600MHz 8GB - £35
* Others: CD/DVD drive (£10), 300Mbps Wi-Fi PCI card (£15). I also still have most of the extra bits and pieces that came with the parts, e.g. case screws, but I don't have any of the original boxes.

I'm hoping to sell everything together, but I would be willing to sell parts individually if there's enough interest. Also, shipping the whole thing could be pretty expensive so if anyone wants to pick it up I live in Berkshire. I would be willing to sell everything together for £525.

***$235 (each) Shipped CONUS***

I'm getting rid of my eyefinity setup, and going with a single 27"" 2560x1440 monitor. So, all 3 of my beloved Dell monitors have to go.

[Here's an album of images](http://imgur.com/a/Q7rdP). 

The album resized the photos, so you really can't read the tag in the verification photo. [Here it is by itself](http://i.imgur.com/OmyO8Yt.jpg). I didn't think to write Reddit on it since I generally don't post here, but the name ""Simonzi"" is used on all forums and same for Heatware.

The album has all 3 for a verification photo, then each one individually. Powered off, with my normal desktop background, an all white background, and an all black background.



The monitors are still in a like new condition. There isn't a single stuck\dead\bright pixel anywhere on any of them. No real backlight bleed or dark\light spots. No scratches marks on the screen, etc... These really are some of the best 24"" monitors I've used.

They are about 1 year old, and still have about 2 years on the Dell warranty. All 3 are A02 revision. Will be shipped out in their original boxes, with all original documentation and cords. They will ship out through FedEx ground. Payment through PayPal or Amazon Payments (preferred).

I'm in RI, so if you're local, they can be picked up for $210 cash. Which is what I'd prefer, but the chances of finding someone local are slim. They are listed in other places, but will keep this updated as quick as possible. If you have any questions or requests for a specific picture, just let me know.

[PICS](http://imgur.com/a/f31Hz) (sorry, the last photo is horizontal and that's my fault)

Hey everyone, this is my first time doing this but I am looking to sell off my CPU, Motherboard, and both of my graphics cards. I'm only looking for local trades in the VCU, West End, and Short Pump area.

I am asking for $340 for both the CPU &amp;amp; motherboard. They've been used for approximately six months and the CPU is currently overclocked to 4.5Ghz with 1.3V for core voltage. The temps never reach above 75C in P95, I also have this cooled in a custom water loop as well.

For both the graphics cards, I am asking for $600 for both. I don't want to sell them one by one, since I want this money ASAP in order to purchase something else. 

I don't really have photos, other than my completed build. But send me a message with a request and I will do the best that I can. For verification I will provide a photo of my username next to my build (which has all the parts in it).

**EDIT:** I have made the mistake of writing out 7970 Ghz OC with Boost when in reality the **correct** graphics cards are **Sapphire 7970 OC with Boost**, here is the [link](http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-DL-DVI-I-SL-DVI-D-PCI-Express-11197-03-40G/dp/B009B6Y01Y).",,False,self,t5_2skrs,1369743807.0,,,True,t3_1f3zrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/1f3zrm/usa_va_intel_core_i7_3770k_processor_gigabyte/,

* The G510 keyboard is brand new. Got it as a replacement, but got a blue switch keyboard.

* The ipod touch is a 2nd gen 8gb. It will come with the case pictured. The screen and glass are in perfect shape and scratch free. The glass does sit a little loose though without a case, so I'd suggest keeping one on it. Can be jailbroken easily if you would like me to.

* The ipad is in perfect shape it's a 3rd gen 16gb Wi-Fi. If comes with the leather stand case, but only has the cable, no wall block.

The laptop is [this model](http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/pc-peripherals/notebook-computers/high-performance/NP700Z5A-S01UK-spec) upgraded with a 128GB Samsung 830 SSD and still running a clean, unbloated install of Windows 7. The i7 in it is a HyperThreaded quad-core model (2675QM). It's completely silent doing anything daily-usage related, with quiet fans spinning up when using the dedicated GPU (HD 6750M). Battery life is between 6-7 hours of what I do with it (note taking, Internet browsing, coding).




Got the Raystorm from /u/purpleparrots225 and never opened it. Tried to buy a res/pump from another Redditor and package got lost, so I'll probably have to eat that $55. I'm not really interested in pursing an open loop anymore. This comes with sleeved LED cables and brackets for LGA1155/2011/AM3+ as far as /u/purpleparrots225 indicated.



AC3 is a PC-DVD copy I got as a gift after I already purchased it on Steam. Key is **not** activated yet.



Finally, the questionable APU. Friend's motherboard VRM exploded and caught fire, shut off immediately, APU shows no burn damage, but could be dead completely. He gave it to me, and I already have a 3570K build, so I'll probably ship this for free to a Redditor with confirmed trades, and if it works, they will pay me then.




Like I said, I'm looking for a touchscreen Windows 8 laptop, preferably 14"" or larger with an Ivy Bridge i5 or better. Optical drive doesn't matter, neither does SSD.

CPU: Never overclocked outside of bios except for checking it's capabilities and I am pleased to say it seems to run cooler than most, owned for &lt;2 months.
__________
Motherboard: Works great, startup is incredibly rapid and I have had not one single problem with it. Owned for &lt; 2months.

Xbox (Black): Perfect working order, newer model with a big juicy hardrive as well as the internal storage.
___________
Games: I'll list all that I can remember and if you wish to buy them with the xbox's I could consider selling them for a little off as to compensate for less shipping hassle.

- Around half a dozen desktop or server motherboards w/ cpu+ram (mostly PIII era or equiv AMD)

- Four HTPC mini-itx boards. Socket 478, vga, s-video, rca, coax, and an lvds port to drive an lcd panel (can bundle cpu+ram, see below)

- Around a dozen video cards. Most AGP, some PCI. A couple are for old SGI or DEC machines.

- Random PCI cards (SCSI, IDE, nic, etc), some mini-pci wifi I think

- Half a dozen P4s, 1.x-2.x ghz range, early northwood class.

- A couple sets of serial matched PIIIs for dual-socket motherboards. (One set is in one of the server boards)

- Several PIII slocket adapters 

- Dozens of sticks of DDR1 ram

- Dozens of sticks of PC66/100/133 ram

- A new-in-box mini-itx case. Shoebox formfactor. Generic OEM. 250W PSU. [pic](http://sneakertech.com/-/reddit3.jpg)

- Old ass 486 laptop (probably still works, previously used as an OpenBSD router)

- A handful of SGI O2 machines. Various states of intact-ness

- Lots of old 68k Mac stuff, including keyboards, joysticks, vampire AAUI networking shit, and a Houdini board with a 486DX on it.

- A [my*vu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyVu) (LCD glasses for video iPods). New-in-box.

- A Gamecube, with the modem and gameboy modules. Fairly certain the controllers are missing, but I think it has the A/V cables.

- Boxes of random brackets, adapters, cables, dongles, and doodads.

- Random other consumer electronics junk.

- DDR2 ram that works with an old 3ghz core2duo box I have. Ideally 16GB (4x4GB) but I'll take what I can get.

- An intel Atom or Via type mini-itx board, with a *passive* heatsink. (I already have ones with annoying tiny fans, I want something silent)

- An AC adapter (or information about one) that matches this drive enclosure [pic 1](http://sneakertech.com/-/cptps1.JPG) [pic 2](http://sneakertech.com/-/cptps2.JPG)

- Money always works. Make an offer.

====================================

**NOTE:**

I recently suffered a family/financial crisis and am absolutely flat broke at the moment. I seriously can't afford to package and ship any of this shit.

I also have a new 300GB WD Raptor drive on its way from an RMA that's available for sale if anyone's interested, ~~and a 16GB Nexus 7 for sale for $150 (don't have it with me to take pictures, but will post if anyone is interested)~~.  I also have a 19"" Viewsonic, and 22"" Samsung 220WM monitor for sale for $40 and $65 respectively... will post pics if you're interested, but shipping would likely be prohibitive for most.  


Some notes:
Video Cards were purchased last April, and are still under warranty, they were never overclocked.  X25-M SSD is less than a year old, and has barely been used.  Everything else is in excellent condition, with pictures available upon request, though please only request pics if you are genuinely interested in something, as I'd like to avoid taking her apart until components are ready to go to a new home.  Almost everything comes with original boxes and accessories... there are too many things to list, so if you are interested in something, reply or PM, and I will send details of what comes with what.  Buyer pays actual shipping, I will cover Paypal fees.  I may be interested in some trades, but am primarily looking to sell.

- Rosewill Mechanical Keyboard w/ red switches. Comes with box, usb, ans PS2 cables. The backspace is gimmicky, will work twice every 5-10 presses. Bought a blue switch to fix it but never got around to it.
- Sony Vaio Laptop. Found this bad boy up in my closet, so it has some age. Looks like the model number is PCG-7F1L. I'm pretty sure it has to be hooked up to a charger (included) for it to maintain power, but I'll update tomorrow.
- Gateway Desktop PC with monitor. Have a link to the specs in my old links, but I'm on my phone and too lazy to look for it right now
- Black (newer model) Modded xbox 360 controller. Left thumbstick is a little gimmicky also. It has a delay when you try to press down on it (not like moving the thumbstick downward, actually pressing it down like a button)
- Black (newer model) 360 controller that is in basically perfect condition
- White 360 controller that works flawlessly, just a little dirty
- Will update with more stuff I find

Looking for either $$$ or an iPad Mini-I'd add $ of course.

Its $209+shipping on the Google store, so $180 shipped seems fair.
