We have decided it is time to close Tree Town Toys storefront.  Our lease is up at the end of the year and upon a review of the retail environment, the specialty toy industry, and our overall business operations we have chosen not to renew our lease.  We will be closing our doors within the next couple of weeks, and wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for your support and patronage.  We have watched your kids grow over the last many years, and are honored and privileged to have been part of so many lives here in Ann Arbor.
 
This was a difficult decision for us, as you can probably imagine.  It is not one we undertook lightly.  Our kids have grown up in Tree Town Toys - they are the reason we went in to business for ourselves.  They have been an integral part of our business - joining us at trade shows across the country and helping in the storefront.  As we have grown, and our kids have grown, it becomes more of a challenge to find the time to do everything our businesses demand and still be there for our kids. Ultimately we decided that in order to prioritize our family, a tough business decision had to be made.  Our retail operation takes tremendous resources to operate at a level that we are satisfied with.  When we weighed our options we decided to close the Tree Town Toys retail store.  This allows us to focus on other business, Dragonfly Depot (http://dragonflydepot.com), which provides websites and order fulfillment for independent retailers and charitable organizations.  Most importantly, this allows us to focus on our family.

There are so many amazing people to thank. We’ll start with you – our customers.  We have come to know so many of you personally through Tree Town Toys.  Thank you for choosing to support local businesses like ours.  Thank you for letting us be a part of your family activities and your children’s growth.  Thank you for joining us for so many in-store activities.  Thank you for helping us create amazing events that have positively touched so many lives of people around the country and around the world.  We cherish the time you spent with us.  We consider ourselves to lucky to be part of the Ann Arbor and Detroit Metro communities.
 
To all of our staff and employees – current and past, thank you.  You’ve been with us for the good times and the difficult times.  We’ve laughed together, learned together, played together, and celebrated together, and without all of you we would not have been able to do the amazing things we did.
 
To First Martin and Chris Grant, our landlord, thank you for all the support you’ve provided over the years.  We couldn’t have asked for a better landlord for our business.  

To all of the toy manufacturers and reps we’ve worked with over the years – and there are over 600 of you - thank you!  The last few years have brought some real turmoil to the toy industry, and we know how hard you all work to create and sell innovative and wonderful toys, and without you we wouldn’t have been able to bring joy and delight to Ann Arbor families.

To our fellow toy store owners around the country - thank you for making the toy business special and for providing humor and insight when we needed it.  
 
We will honor gift cards in the storefront until we close and encourage customers to use them while they can.  Our website http://treetowntoys.com is operated by our other business, Dragonfly Depot, so you can continue to shop for quality toys and games online.

Thank you all!  Tree Town Toys wouldn’t have been the same without so many of you.

Neither were wearing helmets nor had bike lights, and the roads were filled with cars. Both of them flew past the intersection without even looking around or slowing down, and the second one almost got hit. This is just to remind everyone to bike smart, obey traffic laws, and don't put the safety of yourself or others in jeopardy.

I've never done anything like this before, so I am completely unsure of what details need to be considered when doing something of this nature.

I'd love to make some friends who play table top games! I'm a big fan of games like Eclipse, Puerto Rico, Pandemic and Space Alert.

I also have a decent PC game collection if anyone does any LAN parties.

And of course if you just want a drinking buddy I'm pretty good at that too.

How my site was taken down in a web-washing attempt by false “hate crime” victim Justin Zatkoff  
By Mark | November 11, 2012    
  

  I apologize for the interruption in service yesterday, but my site was taken down without my consent, at the request of a man by the name of Justin Zatkoff. If the name sounds familiar, it’s because [I wrote about Justin back in 2006](http://markmaynard.com/2006/10/beaten-down-by-a-gang-of-gay-liberal-thugs-in-ann-arbor), when he was severely beaten in Ann Arbor. The story went viral in conservative circles, as you may recall, as Zatkoff, a student at Oakwood University, was, at the time, the executive director of the Michigan College Republicans. Furthermore, it was suggested to investigators that his beating was likely the work of his liberal enemies. Here, with more on that, is a clip from the conservative website The Truth Causus, which proclaimed the attack to be a “hate crime” perpetrated by “liberal thugs.”    
  

&gt;  Justin Zatkoff, the executive director of the Michigan College Republicans, was brutally beaten after leaving a party in Ann Arbor on Saturday night. The Oakland University junior from Bloomfield Hills, Mich. was rumored to be targeted by militant leftist groups. Zatkoff, pictured above, did not know his attacker, and no money was stolen.    
&gt;  
&gt;A source close to Zatkoff reports:    
&gt;  
&gt;Justin may have been 1. randomly attacked (but not robbed??), 2. attacked by BAMN (well known for violence and strong in Ann Arbor), or 3. attacked by a homosexual rights group (Justin received an ‘odd/threatening’ email from a gay rights group about a day before the attack.)    
  
  
  As hard as it may be to believe, however, that was not the case. Justin was not beaten by a menacing gang of homosexuals. His eye socket, nose and nasal cavity were not broken by the members of BAMN, who, to my knowledge, have never done anything more radical than march around campus with signs advocating for affirmative action and immigrant rights. No, he was beaten by a friend in Ann Arbor after drunkenly provoking said friend. The following comes by way of the October 1, 2006 issue of the [Michigan Daily](http://www.michigandaily.com/content/alleged-political-hate-crime-not-what-it-seemed).    
  

&gt;  …Last Thursday, Don Carlson, state chair of the Michigan College Republicans, issued a statement urging students to “Keep (Justin) in your prayers” during his surgery and to “Travel in groups when possible, especially until the elections are over.”    
&gt;  
&gt;Carlson also included a link to the post on truthcaucus.com alleging that it was liberals who had beaten Zatkoff.    
&gt;  
&gt;The police report tells a much different story.    
&gt;  
&gt;Police said Zatkoff received his puffy purple left eye during a fight with a high school friend.    
&gt;  
&gt;Zatkoff was at a friend’s party on the 1100 block of White Street on Sept. 23 when he engaged in what the police report called “horseplay” with a friend. Fueled by alcohol, Zatkoff was belligerent.    
&gt;  
&gt;“When Zatkoff drinks, he gets a little out of control,” the report quoted one of Zatkoff’s friends. “At this particular party Zatkoff was being obnoxious.”    
&gt;  
&gt;Another one of Zatkoff’s friends eventually admitted to police that it was he – not a gang of angry liberals – who punched Zatkoff.    
&gt;  
&gt;After learning of the friend’s confession, Carlson said his statement had not been politically motivated.    
&gt;  
&gt;“I wanted people to be warned of it and be careful,” he said. “That’s just good advice”…    
  

  Well, according to [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/justin-zatkoff/59/85b/25a), it would appear that Zatkoff is now studying law at University of Detroit Mercy. I’ve also heard from a friend that he’s been interning for a Republican federal judge appointed by Reagan, by the name of Lawrence Paul Zatkoff. (*Judge Zatkoff, I’m told, is best known around these parts for [accusing federal agents of entrapment in a discrimination case against Ypsilanti landlords known for refusing to rent to families with children](http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/10/28/ypsi-housing/).*) Given that their shared last name isn’t terribly common, and that Lawrence is a graduate of Detroit Mercy School of Law, where Justin now attends, my guess is that the two men are related. I’m tempted to add something at this point about nepotism, and how this is just one more instance of Republican hypocrisy, given that Justin Zatkoff, from what I’m told, spent a great deal of time on the University of Michigan campus a half dozen years ago, protesting affirmative action, stating that such policies gave students of color unfair advantage over their white counterparts, but I’ll save that rant for another day.    
  

  So, it would appear that Justin Zatkoff, now in law school and working for a relative who happens to be a federal judge, is looking to clean up his online image. And, in order to see that accomplished, he sent out a slew of cease and desist letters citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) on October 31. (He maintained, in my case, that I didn’t have the rights to use the photo of him with the black eye, which accompanied my 2006 article.) Unfortunately, however, the company that hosts my site didn’t let me know until Thursday, and, when they did, I didn’t immediately read their email. So, on Friday, they pulled my site. It wasn’t a huge deal for me, seeing as how I don’t derive my income from the site, but the idea that someone like Zaktoff could have my site yanked from the internet, I guess you could say, kind of pissed me off. Not having the financial resources to fight him in court, and lacking a relative on the federal bench, I removed the offending image, and, within a day, my site was back up. As I said, it wasn’t a terrible ordeal, but, if I were dependent upon this site for an income, the interruption could have been devastating, and, because of that, I felt that I shouldn’t just let it go without doing something that could perhaps dissuade others in the future from following Zatkoff’s example. So, I sent word out to my artist friends that I was looking for drawings and paintings of Zatoff, to replace the one that I didn’t own the rights to… The results can be seen to the right. The [first image](http://markmaynard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/AlexisFordZatkoff1.jpg) is by Alexis Ford. [The second](http://markmaynard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/AnnSchneiderZatkoff.jpg) is by Ann Schneider… And [here’s the DMCA letter](http://markmaynard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/zatkoff1b.jpg), minus Zatkoff’s contact information.    
  


  Being a bleeding heart liberal, I’m somewhat conflicted about this. Zatkoff was likely about 20 when this original incident took place. Vaguely remembering what life was like at that age, I can imagine that he was confused, upset and embarrassed when he got his ass kicked by a friend for being… to quote the Michigan Daily… “obnoxious” and “out of control.” I can easily imagine how someone in that situation might tell police, as Zatkoff did, that he didn’t know his attackers. I cannot begin to fathom, however, how he could allow the “hate crime” lie to spread across the internet, knowing full well that it wasn’t the case. While it’s unclear to me as to whether or not the idea to blame the attack on “liberal thugs” actually originated with Zatkoff, it’s obvious that he didn’t do anything to stop that narrative from spreading prior to the 2006 election. And I find that to be absolutely despicable. Not only were our limited police resources being diverted unnecessarily from other vital tasks, but the student members of BAMN, and others, had to experience the indignity of being investigated as suspects, and confront the very real threat of serving time in jail for a violent crime that they didn’t commit.    
  

  But, in spite of all this, I could perhaps have found it in my heart to be forgiving. And, if he’d written to me and explained that he’d learned from the experience, and was attempting to move forward with his life, I likely would have wished him well and removed the image without a second thought. Instead, however, he took legal action, forcing my site to be taken down. (Granted, some fault lies with my site’s host for not alerting me sooner of the DMCA notice.) That doesn’t, to me, show remorse. Quite the contrary, the image that it conjures for me is of a wealthy, entitled Republican law student from West Bloomfield, who thinks that he can bully people into assisting him in his quest to rewrite history, and scrub the internet clean relative to this shameful incident, so that he can continue to ascend through the ranks of the Michigan Republican Party apparatus. (Speaking of which, you can find a nice photo of Zatkoff at a University of Michigan football game with Governor Rick Snyder and Congressman Fred Upton here… It would seem that maybe I knew what I was talking about in 2006, when I wrote, “He’ll no doubt go very far in conservative politics.”)    
  

  [note: *According to a short update on the [Michigan Liberal](http://www.michiganliberal.com/diary/12887/) website in 2008, Zatkoff, in addition to filing a false police report, has also ""faced allegations of illegal campaign finance activity, immoral behavior (including posing semi-naked for sexually explicit photos), (and) corruption."" And, it would seem, this is not the first time that he's threatened to sue. ""In a weird twist of events,"" According to the report by Michigan Liberal, ""Zatkoff even threatened to sue Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis after scores of College Republicans were leaving the organization and pleading with Anuzis to remove Zatkoff as chairman.""*]    
  

  And here’s the irony… Because of these recent threats of legal action over copyright, Zatkoff’s name is once again making its way around the internet. If I didn’t find his previous actions so loathsome, I’d feel bad for the guy. He clearly doesn’t understand how the internet works, and, now, as a result of his actions, he’s going to experience the full force of the Streisand effect (the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide or remove a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely). Yes, a huge storm is forming off the coast, ready to blow inland. [Memes are gathering](http://www.quickmeme.com/Republican-Justin/?upcoming) on the horizon, and new articles are being written. Soon, a whole new generation of Americans will know about Zatkoff, and this time, thanks to Facebook, it will spread like wildfire.    
  

  [update: *I've just been alerted to the fact that Justin now has his own [ArborWiki page](http://arborwiki.org/Justin_Zatkoff).*]    
  

  It’s also worth noting, that some sites aren’t removing their images. From what it looks like TMZ is among these. The image accompanying their 2008 article on Zatkoff, which is the same one that I’d used, is still up. (Their article was on Zatkoff’s having been fired from his position within the Republican National Committee’s “Victory ’08″ Campaign, “after he stole 300,000 pieces of campaign literature from Michigan campaign headquarters.”) Another site, by the name of [Sadly No](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/37833.html), is openly mocking his request, saying that the image that they’re using, which was taken by a Michigan Daily photographer, falls under fair use. (I’m glad to see that not everyone has buckled under the pressure, like I did.)    
  

  Oh, and if I’m reading this correctly, he’s not only fighting to have people remove his image from their sites, but [he’s petitioning Google to stop indexing pages](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/owners/1995/Justin-Zatkoff/) that mention this sordid past.    
  

  All of this has me wondering if perhaps the College Republicans offer a Web-washing 101 course at their annual convention. And, if not, I wonder if there might be a business in it, consulting with young, conservative political operatives who want to hide their campus activities before heading into the real world. I suspect it could be quite lucrative.    
  

  The bottom line is that we can’t just let these things slide, regardless of how inconsequential they may seem to us today. People need to be held accountable for their actions, and college students need to learn that there will be consequences for this kind of behavior, regardless of whether or not they have a relative to pull strings and get them into law school. And, while we’re at it, I should add that the College Republicans, like the rest of the Republican party, need to undergo a serious reformation. I’d argue that these actions of Justin Zatkoff’s did not take place in a vacuum, but were informed by the culture of the College Republicans, which has been fostered since the early 1970s by the likes of Karl Rove and Lee Atwater. The “win at all costs” mentality that they’ve driven into young, impressionable conservatives may have served their cause well for a time, but I’d argue that the modern world deserves better. And, judging from the last election cycle, a great number of Americans agree.

Not sure how many people here are from Saline but it doesn't have its own sub reddit so this is the closest thing. DO NOT EAT AT THE JETS PIZZA IN SALINE.

Go outside later that night and the delivery guy drove through the lawn and ditch while backing out, destroying a good strip of grass and breaking a sprinkler head clean off. 

I called the place to complain and while the Manager was worthless (It turns out the delivery kid was her son) she finally agreed to give us meal credit so the next time we wanted pizza it would be on the house. Fine. 

This past weekend we call and order some pizzas but say we are going to come pick them up, hoping to avoid more broken sprinkler heads. When we get there we find out that our meal voucher is not valid so we have to pay again. We are informed that the manager drove out to my friends house and did not feel like the damage was that bad (It had snowed since then so she probably didn't see any damage) and when we got out pizzas we are pretty sure one of them had spit on it.

Recently my relatively expensive and readily distinguishable bike was stolen via bolt cutters after I locked it up with just a chain overnight instead of a full on U lock(stupid I know). 

Later on in the week I find it on craigslist, along with other bikes. The listings are started at around the same time and have cellphone at 3am quality photos of them as well as descriptions of one guy(same contact #) listed as well as the same somewhat familiar front porch. 

These photos were taken in front of the shady house down the street about 200ft away.

Taking a brief walk over to the house I saw that it had a truck with a hard covering, a large cellar, garbage in one of the windows, some locked up bikes, and an unlocked bike with a rusted out chain lying in the yard. 

I reported all this to the police days ago, but they've told me that they're immensely busy right now. They have the report, but this is a low priority compared to the homicide and multiple recent robberies.

I made this post to see if anyone else has had their bike stolen this way and to raise some attention.

I'm not posting any specific information, as witch hunts are bad, but I can not 100% confirm anything aside from the fact the guy on craigslist has my bike and that he took pictures of it in front of this house.

My girlfriend wanted some Washtenaw Dairy donuts on our way out of town today, so I drove down 3rd street to where the construction was. The way was blocked going north and west, and east-bound traffic is not allowed at the moment, so I had her hop out and then walk back, hoping the trucks and diggers would be out of the way by then. They weren't, so I had essentially been stuck on a one-way street for about five minutes with no signs of being able to move any time soon, since all the workers were pretty much ignoring us.

Since it is just a quiet residential street, I decided the best thing to do would be to carefully turn around and go back up to Jefferson to escape. When I got to Jefferson, of course a cop car was sitting right there and immediately pulled me over. The police lady was very confrontational about it and seemed to be intentionally trying to provoke some sort of reaction from me (for instance, asking if I had documentation of the fact I was moving despite having a car obviously loaded with stuff, and ending the conversation with ""well just stay away from construction areas from now on."") Luckily she didn't decide to give me a ticket, but while we were in the area doing some other errands we saw the same cruiser circle around the construction zone two more times.

TL;DR Just a warning that police might be aggressively patrolling the area trying to bust people for impossible situations and poor signage.",,False,self,t5_2r5tm,False,,,True,t3_1j5580,http://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1j5580/watch_out_for_police_around_the_madison_ave/,

I've seen a number of posts from people looking for jobs in the past (and actually hired a Redditor from one!) so figured I'd give this a shot.

As stated in the title I'm hiring delivery drivers, part time to start with full time a possibility if interested. This is for a pizza place, specifically the Hungry Howie's located @ 1874 Whittaker Road a couple miles south of downtown Ypsi.

---
Requirements

- At least 18 years of age
- Must have your own vehicle
- No major traffic violations - DWI, vehicular manslaughter or something like that. A speeding ticket or two is fine.
- Must be available between 4pm and 1am Friday and Saturday.
- Must be available between 4pm and midnight at least a couple other days during the week.

---
Pay is $7.40/hr + tips + comp per delivery. I think the comp is currently $0.80/delivery. The owner changes it occasionally as gas prices fluctuate.

The possibility that you'd actually be working from 4pm to 1am any Friday or Saturday is extremely slim - unless you really want to! I just need some flexibility in scheduling. I'm happy to work around school and/or another job or three but when most of my crew has restricted schedules it can make it difficult to properly staff the business. Right now I could really use some people available from Monday to Wednesday as things are pretty tight those days.

The job is pretty easy. When you're not delivering you'd be helping out by answering phones, washing dishes, making dough and the occasional pizza, cleaning and so on. I can be a tough boss - I'm obsessed with making excellent product and providing excellent service, and based on our sales my obsession is paying off - but I try to keep things as light and fun as possible. We're always joking around, listening to music, just trying to have a good time while still working as well as we can.

If you're interested please apply in person at the store. If you have any questions you can PM me here on Reddit but I might not respond very promptly.",,False,self,t5_2r5tm,False,,,True,t3_1c5i4g,http://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1c5i4g/hiring_delivery_drivers_ypsilanti/,

Dank4Tao here, I put together the last meet up back in December that about 20 of you made it to!

Finals are just about over for most of us, and I was wondering who would like to do it again?!

Bar Louie has invited us back and that is a potential place; but once again, I would love to get feedback from the community.

What would [/r/annarbor](/r/annarbor) like to do? Where would you guys like to go?

21+ Ideas:

* Bar Crawl

18+ Ideas:

* Picnic @ the Arb

* Lazertag

* Ann Arbor Comedy Club

The more the merrier as well always, but keep in mind some venues (cough cough, Ashley's) don't support walk ins of 10+ well.

[Pics or it didn't Happen.](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/december-ann-arbor-meet-up/photo/697/)

Let the discussion begin!

**::EDIT::**

Discussion so far!

I think we may have enough people to do two! One this weekend for the End of April, and one next Month of Mid May.

That way if someone cannot commit to one date they may try to schedule for the other one.

Tentatively:

* April 27th, 28th, or 29th.

* May 11th, 12th, or 13th.

I also need to discuss weekdays vs. weekends with the community.

Since it's been talked about making this monthly thing, it'd be nice to plan this out beyond April/May and see if anyone else would like to organize events for different months.

**II.EDIT.II**

Let's Do This SATURDAY the 28th.

Bar Louie @ 10pm.

I'll be calling to make reservations tomorrow for a group 10+.

We'll decide from there places for a bar crawl.

Additionally I'd love to talk about a MAY meet-up with people that make it.

Hope to see you guys there!

No reservations, booked solid for Graduation.

1. The meetup will occur the last Thursday of every month. That means our first one is 2/23/12.

2. It will probably start around 6:30p. It's earlier than last night's meetup because we'll need time to cook the pizzas. Come straight from work if you need to. If you can't be there pretty close to 6:30, please volunteer to bring soda/drinks or something besides a main pizza topping.

Or, I've been to the Arb and kayaked the river but I haven't been to the botanical gardens. I've hit up maybe 3-4 restaurants downtown (but I'm not sure when I'll have a pay check again so I can't be blowing tons of money at the Chop House).

To cut to the chase, I am desperately poor, and on the verge of losing everything. Over the last two years I've slowly sold off everything I cared for out of pure necessity. I have a home--currently--but will lose it by December if I don't do something. I'm working two jobs, but its not nearly enough. I'm terribly depressed about all of this...so I've decided to do something about it.

I enjoy writing, and I enjoy new experiences and random social experiments. So...do any of you need someone to do something for you, in exchange for money? No sex acts, no hurting anyone else...other than that, I'm pretty open. In addition to trying to better my situation, I figure that keeping this up for a few months would allow me to meet a bunch of people I wouldn't meet otherwise, and do some interesting jobs that could be inspiration for future writing. So...need a ride to class? An essay? A handsome date to the prom, a la a romantic comedy? Solve your problem, help out a fellow denizen of A2, and maybe earn your place in a future novel all at the same time! I'll be looking forward to hearing from y'all.

I recently adopted a one year old cat from the Huron Valley Humane Society. As it turns out, adding a second cat to the family did not sit well my my current cat, and has resulted in a very high stress environment for both cats. Not ideal; not healthy.

I've put a lot of thought into it and have decided that it's for the best to relocate the new little girl. Rather than take her back to the shelter, I thought I'd put it out to you guys, since my goal is to find the best possible situation for her and I would like to make sure that she goes to a good home.

Here's a picture:
[kitty](http://imgur.com/oYLUc5L)

A little more info:
She's fully clawed
She's the most affectionate cat I've ever met.
She has no problems with other cats, the current tension is brought on by my other cat.
She's tiny

I would also include all of her cat accessories that I got for her; litter box, bowl, and scooper.

If you or anyone you know are interested in adopting this adorable furball, shoot me a message.

Thanks.

UPDATE: Thanks to a helpful redditor, Kitty is on a test run to see how well she gets along in another person's home. If all goes well, she'll have a happy new home with a nice sistercat.

I don't want to go into a long rant, but I'm kind of at my last option Reddit, and I am desperately trying to find any sort of work in Ann Arbor just to keep my head above water.

I'm in school full time right now for the summer and have been living solely off of my extra financial aid once my classes and books are paid for, which hasn't been very much at all, and I can't keep doing this. My previous employer in Ann Arbor was closed and I haven't had any luck in finding a new job. I'm not asking for much, just anything part-time for now, just to make an extra few bucks so I can pay the bills instead of ending up on the streets.

I am in class from 10-4, Monday-Thursday, until the end of June and then I will have complete and open availability.

I want to apologize for having to resort to this, but I felt that this would be as good a chance I would have at finding something as the applications I've been handing in.

If you would like to know anymore about me, feel free to PM and I can give you details about my work history and any other questions you may have.

Thank you all for your time.

I just recently (as in two days ago), moved to Ann Arbor from Texas due to work.  Due to some unpleasant circumstances with things falling through and overall short notice, I was forced to move up here without a place to actually live lined up.  I also have quickly learned there aren't as many apartment availabilities here as in the past places I have lived.  I am currently staying in a hotel, but that can only last so long.  

As one possibility to make things work, I am possibly looking to do a short term, approximately just one month or so, rental of a room while units in certain areas become open.  I'm a 24 year old male young professional.  I am traveling super-light at the moment, everything I have fits in my small sedan comfortably.  I make a comfortable amount of money, so there would be no worries about payment or leeching off of whoever I would be renting from.  I am open to most price ranges (within reason!).  Basically, my options are to settle for an apartment that I can move into now or find a place to live for a month while other availabilities I have my eye on become open.  If you know of anyone who has a room open, needs a short-term fill-in while they look for a longer-term solution, has had a roommate just move out, etc, please let me know.  I'll also likely make a post on craigslist, but I was wondering if any Redditors had any suggestions or help they could offer first!

Today I was driving on Platt Rd. between US-12  and Ellsworth, and for those of you who have been in this neck of the woods, there is a lovely walking/biking trail that runs this entire length.  I have enjoyed it for dog-walking and biking myself, which leads me to the question of why some bikers still insist on riding along very narrow shoulders on Platt Rd?

Please don't get me wrong - I really do respect biker's right to the road and I understand that they are allowed to be there.  Unfortunately, without a designated bike lane (but with the nice path right beside the road), I'm legitimately confused as to why bikers are using the road and not the path.

Me and my friend (who is also a fellow redditor l), have a lease on a 3-bedroom place in Ann Arbor. It is a ranch-style house complete with one bathroom and a large, partially finished basement with washer/dryer and a bar area, plus central heat/air and an unattached two-car garage. There is also a nice unfenced backyard and BBQ area -- with an actual grilling pit (THINK OF ALL THE BACON EXPLOSIONS WE CAN GRILL OUT THERE!). The house is located next to Miller Nature Area, and is located on the #18 bus route. Alternatively it is only about a 10 minute bike ride to the UM campus. You will be sharing the house with two males, both 2nd year graduate students (Microbiology/Immunology and Immunology), who are social, active, and tidy. Rent runs at $550/month plus 1/3 of the utilities. The place would be available starting August 8th. We do have a dog (super friendly, yellow lab), so unfortunately we can't take any small karma machines (cats).

We would be looking for graduate students, professionals, or studious undergraduates. We are not looking for someone who wants to party every night and doesn't do their fair share around the house.

Any certain tear-inducing dishes at places that I wouldn't think to go? 

I appreciate hot food that has flavor. I could easily cover my food with Tabasco or Red Hot but then it would just taste like vinegar. I love Sriracha sauce because it is hot and the flavor is awesome. I seriously put it on everything except cereal and ice cream! After a while it gets kind of boring so that's why I'm posting here. Please guide me to the hotness!!

I've still got some reservations and questions about it, though. Help put my mind at ease so that I can take the leap and come visit!

I'm 19, female, and know no one in the area. This is probably my biggest concern is my safety as I've never visited anywhere completely alone before. Will I feel safe in Ann Arbor walking around and doing things by myself? Maybe some of you lovely redditors would be willing to show me around for a bit?

What are some good, relatively cheap options for places to stay? I've found a couple of places on airbnb that look closer to downtown, cheaper, and overall more promising than any hotel options I've seen, for about $50 a night. I need access to a fridge and microwave and preferably a kitchen due to some dietary needs. Will I find anything cheaper than this?

How necessary is a car? It sounds like I can get along fine with AATA buses and walking, and perhaps a bicycle, but I'm not really sure what to expect because I've grown up in small towns my whole life where cars are absolutely necessary. Basically I just want to explore the city, I'm thinking mostly around downtown but will also need to go to the grocery store and such. I originally considered driving from Nevada, but a plane ride is much cheaper and takes much less time. I don't think there are many other options available as I don't think I can rent a car at 19, or if I did the fees would be astronomical.

I'm a new homeowner in the EMU area and looking to rent out my spare rooms. Its a 5 bedroom house and I have no idea what to do with all the extra space. A friend suggested to turn it into a Cat Hotel but I think I want to find some people that help pay the bills.

The house has three bedrooms on the main floor that are about 10 X 10 or slightly larger and all three have spacious closets.  In addition, there is a room on the top floor that is a little larger but does have a ceiling line that angles with the roof; so its great for someone who likes a non traditional room. All rooms are 350 a piece and this include utilities, high speed internet, and use of all home appliances (Of course [^_^] ). The house does come stock with one big cat, he is an awesome lovable Main Coon but I don't think this should be an issue with most Redditors.

My house is located at 454 Dexter Ave, off of Packard between Hewit and Golfside. If you commute into Ann Arbor there are two main bus lines withing walking distance.

If you happen to be a study-abroad student or in need of a furnished room, I have the ability to furnish one of the rooms in the house with a twin or full size bed, a desk and a dresser.

You can post questions below or e-mail me through Reddit and I'll try to respond as soon as possible.

Cheers
-Kent

The real reason I want to go though(and the reason why this was brought up before on reddit) is so I can tell them a basic way I want it cut, then have them so the rest to make it look good on me. I hate telling the person in one of those places in a strip mall what numbers I want because I ways forget and I feel like they just do a default look instead of making it look good on me. 

Basically I want to find a place that costs about $15 for just a lain adult cut, and I want to be a to tell them something ""I want it to be short but I don't really know what looks good, so just do whatever so that you think it looks good. ""

I would have thought more people would like me saying that because it gives them freedom to do whatever but I ways get weird looks when I say that.

We maintain a community accessible workshop where anyone may come to build, learn, or teach anything.  We are currently organizing as a nonprofit and hope to soon obtain larger facilities.

Sometimes we're called a passion-based university, sometimes a rabble of young people with power tools, and sometimes just described as ""education for the hell of it"".

We hold weekly open Build Nights every Thursday at 8pm at 525 East Liberty in which everyone is welcome (and you're welcome to drop by at any time a member is in), and our boring organizational stuff happens on Tuesdays (which you're also welcome to come to).

Yes, it's time once again for your favorite cinematic plateau of excrescence, The Smithee Awards!  This year is the 22nd Annual Smithee Awards -- which means that ""Jump"" by Kris Kross was the #1 song in the land when the first show occurred.  And which we will never speak of again.  

22nd ANNUAL SMITHEE AWARDS
1800 CHEMISTRY BUILDING
U of M CAMPUS
SATURDAY, APRIL 13
7 PM until DONE

Reminders:

The Smithee Awards are free!  Monetarily free.  Any time lost is your own. 

There will be unhealthy snacks and drinks of colors not found in nature
(except perhaps in certain unsavory documentaries).  

The movies will contain incidents of violence (VIOLENCE!), nudity (NUDITY!), explicit language (PROFANITY!), and CAPITAL LETTERS (YELLING!).

Another reminder:  The Smithee Awards is a celebration of a certain type of cinematic excess.  We show five clips per category (Most Ludicrous Premise, Stupidest-Looking Monster, etc), and the audience votes as to which clip is the ""winner."" There are 19 categories, so the whole event lasts for several hours.  The audience is allowed to come and go as they please -- but there will be no one admitted after we have closed up for the night.

Come if you can.  Lament if you cannot.

Trader Joe's Cookie Butter *will* be used as a baking ingredient.

I'll be looking for likely a one bedroom apartment given I am single and don't know anyone up in Ann Arbor.  I'd of course like to keep price of renting low and find a good deal, but I'll be making a decent living so I don't have to go super bare bones or anything.  I'm a bit spoiled by San Antonio having dirt cheap cost of living so I'm not 100% what housing prices are in Michigan.

We are two twentysomething kids, creative types, living in New York City (No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn). He's a musician and works in radio. She's a line cook. We love beers, live music, cats and dogs and birds and frogs. We don't ask for much: just a couch or a floor, or even a yard in which to pitch a tent (literally speaking, folks). We're well-mannered and housetrained. If you're up for it, we'd love to see your city from your point of view. Play the tour guide!

**What we can do for you:**

In exchange for your hospitality, we can offer a private-chef-style meal, getcha good and drunk, wash your windows, vacuum the curtains, whatever. We can also guarantee reciprocation: come crash at our place in Brooklyn, any ol' time you'd like!

We realize this is a couchsurfing kinda situation, and yeah, we're gonna do that too. We just thought we'd reach out to our fellow redditors first. We've never done this kind of thing, and reddit's yet to let us down.

We'll be in Ann Arbor on 10/30 and 10/31. If you can help us out, you'll score some real-life karma (and we will both go back and upvote every one of your posts ;D ). BONUS HALLOWEEN ROUND! We're gonna be dressed up as Skwisgaar and Pickles the Drummer of Metalocalypse! Know any hip haunted happenings?

* Loves music
* Big fan of scotch
* Works at the hospital doing research
* About to adopt myself a puppy (it will be named Dalek)

Here's a little background - I'm 23 years old, female, and I've lived all over the country.  From Texas (ugh) to California (different), I've experienced all sorts of regional differences and local mannerisms.  I keep coming back to Ann Arbor.  

Some of that isn't by choice - my family moved here when I was in elementary school and stayed till middle school, then moved back the summer of my freshman year of college.  I went to school out in California, but I'm back living with my family.  

Here's where my disenchantment begins - I returned to Ann Arbor with high hopes - I'd fall in with an awesome artsy crowd (more nerd than hipster, not too much nerd, appreciative of beer and other fine Michigan things), sell things that I make on the side, get a crazy cool job in copy writing or editing.  Unfortunately, none of these things have happened.  I do some part time work for a family friend, which is fun and would be a reasonable job if it were full time and reasonably secure (educational copy writing and editing mixed with general secretarial duties).  I babysit, I mow lawns, I make balloon animals at parties, I take care of pets.  I'm not sitting at home being a lump, but technically, I am unemployed and living in my parents' basement.  Not really where I wanted to be six months after school ended.

I always figured that I'd sell things at the farmers market as a last resort.  I make some pretty neat things out of glass and metal, materials none of the current...""artisans"" use.  I'm also not a grumpy old lady, which I thought might work in my favor.  Turns out, the farmers market is a giant political cesspit.  The people I spoke to in order to be part of it are so darn rotten that I'm now kind of jaded as far as Ann Arbor goes.  

In a way, Ann Arbor will always be an awesome little melting pot of school pride and eccentric locals, beautiful things to see and endless things to do.  I hope that this ideal Ann Arbor isn't just a thing in my head.  I hope that things will turn around and that this city will have room for me in it.  Right now, though, I'm feeling like some sort of bad graft.  There's really nowhere else I'd rather be.

I'm not normally a whining person and it is probably a terrible decision to go and complain at reddit when I am so new, but I'm doing it anyway.

My fiancee did a ton of research into the ballot proposals and wrote up a little bit about each one. Here you go if you want to see a short summary about how they actually will work, which is often counter-intuitive.

&gt;2012-1 Emergency Manager Law - vote no


&gt;    The powers of EMs to break contracts are voided by Proposal 2 anyhow. Moreover, the appointment of an EM breaches the fundamental right to elect local government, and only remedies the immediate situation without fixing inherent problems in polity charter and structure causing the financial emergency in the first place. The populations and tax bases in the effected locales have fundamentally decreased, and a better solution might be to facilitate rezoning and restructuring of charters and school districts instead.

&gt;2012-2 Guarantees the right of private and public sector employees to unionize and engage in group bargaining - vote yes

&gt;    Private sector workers are already protected under federal law and will be largely unaffected. However, this law supercedes all other state and local laws on the books, and will prevent future so-called ""right to work"" laws such as were recently passed in Wisconsin and Indiana. There will be some legal fallout in at least two lawsuits, and restructuring to accommodate new unions may get expensive, but in my opinion the benefits and protections far outweigh the costs.

&gt;2012-3 Increased renewable energy goal for 2025 - vote no

&gt;    While I do think switching our energy dependence to renewable sources, I don't think the state constitution is the place to do it. Moreover, it's incredibly poorly conceived and written. Depending on the reading, this law potentially outlaws solar power ( not renewable on a human timescale, part of a definition used in the wording of the law). It also only limits rate increases caused by the switch to renewable energy sources. Energy rates we pay can still increase significantly due to increased coal shipping costs, etc. Finally, there are all sorts of loopholes for utility companies to postpone meeting the timeline laid out in the law. All in all, it was a nice idea, but please try again.

&gt;2012-4 Some sort of collective bargaining rights for in home caregivers - vote no

&gt;    Like Proposal 1, turns out this is just the latest of a series of bad laws which first gave in home caregivers ( such as family forced to care for a loved one) state recognition and minimum wage funding, which was good. Next came unionization and access to special training through the union, which was good and bad (slammed with union fees, and very few of those eligible take advantage of the training those fees pay for). Finally came the ability to opt out of the union, although nonunion workers are still obligated to pay the fees. This new law wouldn't really change any of that mess, but it would enshrine it in the state constitution. Where all of those rights are already covered by Proposal 2, anyway. In other words, this one's another unnecessary, bad law that is too specific and doesn't belong in the state constitution.

&gt;2012-5 Requiring a super majority in both houses of the state congress to raise taxes - vote no

&gt;    This is another law that is not what it seems. While it may seem this law will protect us from higher taxes, studies comparing states that require super majority approval to those that don't did not find any significant differences in tax rates (see link at the end of all this). However, those studies also found significantly more time and money wasted on the issue in legislatures in super majority states, along with pursuant funding issues and delays in public works projects. And it's not like Michigan doesn't already have enough of that going on... This law would only further hobble the legislature without actually providing any of the perceived protections implied in the wording. Not a good choice.

&gt;2012-6 Requiring a public referendum on any future projects connecting Michigan to Canada - vote no

&gt;    This final proposal is yet another law that is not at all what it seems. The push for this proposal came almost entirely from the owners of the Ambassador Bridge, connecting Detroit to Windsor, Ontario, in response to plans to build another bridge in Detroit in order to better accommodate the heavy, often gridlocked shipping traffic bottlenecked by the current system. The proposed referendum would not even follow normal procedure for receiving public approval of new works, completely bypassing the legislature in an unprecedented move. Furthermore, it could also negatively impact Michigan's other major ports in Sault Ste Marie and Port Huron. Essentially, this is a poorly framed power grab by the owners of the Ambassador Bridge to legitimize and perpetuate their current shipping monopoly in Detroit, thinly veiled as being in the people's interest. Besides, their commercials trying to somehow connect a new bridge to unemployed policemen are idiotic and make my skin crawl.

&gt;For more information, please check out my source, the nonprofit, nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan's in depth analyses of these ballot proposals at http://www.crcmich.org/election/index.html.

Once you enter your info, they'll give you a link to a sample ballot, with links to all the candidates who have websites. Remember, we're also voting for Congress, mayor, people to run our state universities, and judges, among others this election.

&gt;Finally, even if you disagree with my opinions here, please vote, and vote informed!

My current roommate is moving out in August, and I'm looking for a few new ones. I have a 2300 sqft, 4 BR, 2.5 Bath house in Pittsfield township. It's located in a quiet subdivision near Carpenter and Elsworth road. It's a great location, there is shopping, restaurants, bus stops, and a movie theater all with in walking distance.

The house is fully furnished, the rooms can be furnished or unfurnished depending on your needs. The rent $550 a month with all utilities included. The best part is, there is no lease, it's all month to month!

Also, I have a super sweet cat named Ginger. I am okay if you use her to karma whore, but those who are allergic to cats, this may not be a good fit.

A little bit about myself, I'm 26/M. I work at a tech start up downtown. I'm at the office more often than not. I like have get together every once in a while with friends or via meetup to meet new people. I'm a non-smoker (if you smoke, I'd ask you to smoke out on the deck) and a social drinker. I'm average on the neat scale (I do hire a cleaning lady to come out once a week or two weeks depending on the number of people in the house).

Here's my conundrum: My pets are my family (obviously), so I don't want to get rid of them. BUT I have two 30 lb spaniels and a house cat. Most places either only take cats, only take dogs, only take small animals, or only take two animals. The last rule is always the weirdest, since my 3 animals probably make much less mess than a St. Bernard.

ANYWAY. Any tips on finding a place around town that's pet friendly? Do you have a place to rent? Double bonus if the yard is fenced, especially since I'm not looking for an apartment.

My current lease is up at the end of June, but I'd be willing to move in May if necessary. Leave me a comment or send me a message if you have any ideas that I'm overlooking, since I feel like scouring ever rental site or Craiglist is getting me nowhere.

As I mentioned, I don't really know anyone in the area, so I thought I would make this post and see if anyone was interested in hanging out, showing me around, or possibly getting together a Reddit meetup while I'm there. I'd love to attend a meetup if we could make something happen, but I'm also definitely interested in maybe making a couple of friends in the area to do things with one-on-one or in small groups or what have you. If I enjoy Ann Arbor as much as I think I will, I'll be back in the future, so it would be nice to make some friends in the area.

Here's my ever-expanding list of things I'm planning to do while there. Feel free to recommend any other awesome thing I shouldn't miss out on:

* Top of the Park

* Explore UofM (includes feeding squirrels in the Diag and spinning the cube)

* Kerrytown shops and farmer's market

* Pinball Pete's

* Michigan/State Theaters

* The Ark

* Graffiti Alley

* Fairy doors

* Leslie Science + Nature Center

* Museums

* Nichols Arb

* Zingerman's Tour de Bacon (anyone want to do this with me? Some of their locations look to be a little further out and I'm thinking might be more fun to visit with someone else than by myself. Plus, free t-shirt!)

* General downtown wandering



Also, I'm looking at getting a bike while there as it sounds much faster/easier to get around downtown with one. Any suggestions on where I might be able to pick up a decently functioning one for under $50, and a decent lock for as cheap as possible? Alternatively, does anyone have an extra bike/lock they'd be willing to loan me? I'm 5'4"" if that helps any. Not terribly familiar with bike measurements or what size I need and all that.

Help?,8,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/1dntzd/moving_to_ann_arbor_in_june_first_ever/,"I'm starting grad school at University of Michigan (yay!) in July, and my boyfriend and I hope to move up some time mid-June-ish in order to get settled before the big workload descends upon me.

I'm finding it a bit challenging to rent a place from such a distance. Budgetary concerns make it such that I really can't make a trip up to apartment shop, so it looks like I'll be renting sight unseen. I've been trying to use Craigslist, but their guidelines warn rather vehemently against renting sight unseen, or renting to anyone from a distance. So even if I find a place I like on Craigslist (which I have), I will apparently seem like a scam artist if I try to rent it from here. Oy.

A few more details:

1) I will not have a car. I'm more than happy to take public transit everywhere, but I'd much prefer to be within a walkable distance of places I might frequent (i.e. central campus, bars, coffee)

2) I have 2 dogs. Both female mutts, fully vaccinated, crate-trained, accustomed to apartment living one ~50lb, one ~30lb. A bit more challenging to find a place that will take big-ish dogs.

3) I'm happy to do a sublet for the summer and then get a new place when leases start in August.

4) I'm hoping to stay below $900 if possible.

So... does anyone have any experience or insight? Any other tips for a southerner moving up to the mysterious midwest?

EDIT! 
Thanks for all your suggestions, everyone! I just secured a sublet, so I'm set through mid-August - well within the bounds of every one of my qualifications above (which honestly surprised the fuck out of me - I expected to compromise somewhere). However, I will definitely use all of your tips while seeking out a more permanent residence for the fall.

I know that sounds like a pipe dream, but an Ann Arbor degree is basically my life's greatest ambition, and this is the best shot I'll ever get at achieving it.
