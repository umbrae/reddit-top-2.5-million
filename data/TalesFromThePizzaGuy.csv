My restaurant gets a call, and at the end of the order the person on the line apparently requested that we ""send a hot pizza guy.""

I get there, and two teenage girls answer the door, pay for their pizza, and I leave. No mention of anything, no awkwardness, relative comfort level all around.

The Pizza Hut I deliver for is in a decent area, there are nice neighborhoods, average neighborhoods, and then a few ghetto-ish apartment complexes.

Around 9:30 on a Friday night we get a delivery order to one of the ""ghetto-ish complexes"", after delivering to these places over an extended period of time, I'm not as scared to deliver there, but I do take my precautions more seriously. (Lock my car, leave my wallet in the car, always be on guard, etc.)

I pulled into the complex at about 9:50 and saw two police officers circling the building with a dog, pointing their flashlights through the bushes, etc.

I sat in my car and watched for a minute before I decided to get out and stand, I started to walk towards the building and asked the officer standing in front if it was safe to enter.

The officer chuckled and told me yes, but asked what the number was for the apartment. I replied ""Apartment 8"". He chuckled again and said ""oh great. I'm going there too!""

He stood next to me as I walked up to the door, I told him that if it was dangerous that I didn't want to even enter the building, so when we walked up to the door I told him that I would probably not get tipped if he was standing there next to me.

Apartment #8 was on the edge of the stairs, so he crouched down on the stairs to allow me to make the transaction.

I knocked on the door a few times and a woman answered in raggedy clothing, who clearly had some sort of drug problem. I told her the total of the order ""12.60"", she gave me 15 and told me to keep the change. I thanked her and started to walk away after handing her the Pizza. The officer then preceded to jump around the corner, put his foot in the door, and asked ""Is Bobby (insert last name here) available?"" I walked out of the building and heard a shouting match as I headed towards my car, the other officer who was standing at the bottom of the steps with his dog laughed and told me ""Good Job."" as I walked away.

She was also my last customer of the night and she paid by credit card so therefore I can just go straight home after delivering.

I arrive at her house and I see there's a party going on. Cool. I knock on the door and this really cute girl ordered. I give her the pizza after confirming the credit card number and she offered me to come in. Since it's my last delivery and I'm off the shift now, why not? I come in.

She offers me to join the party and enjoy myself. I proceed to get a beer and introduce myself with some people. I had a good time with the girl and some of her friends and others.

The party comes near to an end and people starting leaving. I didn't want to overstay my welcome so I came up to her and I say my goodbyes. 

She says, ""Wait, I didn't get to give you a tip!""
I say, ""It's okay, the party was good of a tip, besides I had a couple drinks so it's fair.""
She says, ""Please stay a little longer?""

I proceed to stay longer and continue enjoying my time with her. Eventually everyone leaves and it was only me and her. She asked me if I wanted to stay overnight. I proceed to agree and we made some sexy times overnight.

Next day, I wake up and she was gone from the bed. I go down to the kitchen and I see her. I said that I had fun and I had to go to work. She says that she wants to see me again so we exchange phone numbers.

All week, we've been talking and hanging out a bit. We got to know each other much more and I really like her. She's a great woman and we have many similar interests.

**How I made $500 in a single night**

So my town is pretty small.  The only saving grace for a delivery driver is that there is a state university in town and you can make bank off the college students. Most nights I worked I would bank around $100 in tips.  This story takes place later in my delivery career when I was 23.

The forecast had been calling for heavy snow.  Rumor was we were going to get about an inch or two an hour all night.  It started early on around 2:00 but was pretty light.  For a while we figured the forecast was a bit exaggerated so my manager said we’d stay open unless it started to get bad.

Around 8:00 a the roads started to get bad as the snow started to pick up.  About the same time our phones started ringing off the hook with people calling our store because the other pizza places where shutting down.

My manager looked at meI told my manager and asked what I though.  “You’re the one out there,” he said. I told him I was fine in the Jeep with 4wd and if they kept making the pizzas I would keep delivering them. Just no promises on the whole ""30 minutes or less"" thing.

Over the course of the next 4 hours I had the town to myself. I got stopped at one point by a cop asking me what I was doing out on the roads.  Luckily he recognized me (*my dad was a local firefighter and had even been police commissioner for a while*) and he told me to just ""be safe"" and stay out of the way of the plows and emergency vehicles.

Every house I delivered to was grateful that I was willing to deliver.  I got about a dozen cups of hot chocolate and tips ranging from $10 to $20.  At one point I had to stop and fill up because I was burning extra gas being in 4-wheel-drive 100% the whole time.

When we finally shut down at 12:00 I counted out just over $500 in tips.  That was not including my hourly rate plus the per-pizza delivery charge that I got.  Pretty much the best night of tips I had.

From that point on I was known as the “Pizza Jeep Guy.”  Which is a good jumping off point for another story.  ",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_14fzbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14fzbx/how_i_made_500_in_a_single_night_story_4/,

I live in a small town in Arkansas and deliver for a local pizza business. Most of the houses I deliver to are lower class who dont have the gas/vehicle to come pick up the pizzas, so i dont expect tips very often. So on Monday I took this delivery to a house out in a wooded area. When the woman answered the door she looked pretty stressed or upset about something but i couldnt tell what. She payed for the 28$ total in all 1$ bills and after she had counted it all out she started apologizing for not having any tip money and I assured her it was no problem. I turned around and began walking back to my truck when i hear a little kid yell for me to wait so i turned around to see a boy probably around 6-7-8 years running towards me with something in his hand. Once he gets to me he says ""Here i want you to have this."" and extends me a Blastoise Pokemon card (Blastoise is my favorite Pokemon). He lights up when I tell him how much I appreciate it and how Blastoise is my favorite Pokemon and we talked about what his favorite pokemon were(most of them i didnt recognize because they were newer generations).

It was a balmy Saturday afternoon and at 18 years old my skinny dorky ass could barely hold the stack of delivery bags as I took 12 large pizzas to a pretty nice house in the only fancy neighborhood in our area. 

There were balloons on the mailbox and a sign that stated something along the lines of ""Brittney's Sweet 16 Pool Party"", a glimmer of hope as I had yet to kiss a girl and thoroughly enjoyed seeing them in swim wear (this is back before the war on teen sex). I grab the first half of the pizzas and walk through the side gate towards the backyard where I can hear the sounds of splashing and laughter, I round the corner and my eyes get wide and the scene before me, MILF everywhere... Hot, sexy, suntanned MILF. Turns out the ""Sweet 16"" was referring to the cocktails they were drinking and they were liquored up and acting like horny teenagers. 

The cry of ""PIZZA GUY!"" goes up and I'm directed to set the pies on a long table while the woman who seemed to be the hostess with the mostess was making damn sure all her girlfriends saw me stare at her tits. I headed back to the car to get the rest of the pizza and I hear the MILF giggles behind me, I know my ears are burning red and I'm trying to be cool and not get a raging clue.

During the training videos it made it pretty damn clear that bad things would happen if I went inside and there was no way in hell I was going to miss this bad thing, trying to be brave I stepped into the kitchen with the intro music to every porno playing in my head. 

Mostess handed me a $20 and said ""Thanks"" then walked me through the house to the front door. I thanked her and as I walked out the door she called ""Hey pizza boy!"", I turned as she flashed!

I know that's pathetic, but I have no life outside of work and family. Anyway, we had an order for 175 deluxe pizzas to deal with (due at 11pm ) as well as a busy Thursday shift. We did have warning, so my gm was able to order enough food to get through it. He failed however to schedule any extra people. We started making them at 6pm which also coincides with the start of our dinner rush. I recently made the move to management, so I never left the make line. We cut the last pizza at 10:30. It had been decided we would split the tip 4 ways between the people dealing with making and delivering the order. We filled one driver's scion, and my van to the brim and got the pizzas there at 11:02. They actually tipped us $200.00 which shocked us. We half expected them to be stingy, and throw us a 20 or something equally as lame. I will say though that is the hardest I have ever worked for the $50.00 I got out of it. I was extremely proud of our team through out the night. We had great delivery times all night, and got the job done. I will never look a deluxe pizza the same way again though.

It was an average evening when the shift manager came up to me and explained that a couple had came in earlier to place a delivery order for a certain time. Their family was in town because one of their dads had died and they had just attended the funeral.

They wanted us to deliver a pepperoni pizza to their son at a hotel. They said that it also happened to be his birthday and they wanted to cheer him up after he had attended his grandfather's funeral on his birthday and gave us a candle (I think it was Scooby Doo or something like that). My manager instructed me to knock on the hotel room door and after the kid answered, open the pizza box, put the candle in the middle of the pizza, light it with my lighter, and then say Happy Birthday. I agreed.

I got to the hotel and knocked on the door to the room which we were given. The couple answered the door and told me that their son was in the room next to them. They got out their video camera and started filming me. I knocked on the door to the son's hotel room and he answered the door.... he was a goth kid wearing all black with black eyeliner and dyed black hair. I think it was his 17th birthday.

I was a bit surprised, but opened the box, lit the Scooby Doo candle, and wished him a happy birthday anyway. He gave me a blank stare as his parents were filming it and laughing.

She became well known to all the drivers, some took her ""tip"" some did not. Our manager caught wind and laughed it off. This continued for a few months and everybody jumped to take her delivery.

One day my manager was talking to one of her regular costumers. He was going on about how amazing she was with her oral skills. The manager began to jokingly claim that maybe there was something askew about why this woman was blowing all the drivers. The manager suggested that maybe the she was actually a he. The redneck got pissed and exploded whilst turning red.

Fast forward a few days, the same driver took her delivery and whilst ""she"" was doing the deed, the redneck reached down and stroked her cheek. He came back looking like he was about to cry.

**Bootlegged right in front of campus police**

There was a small amount of snow started to collect but it was nothing major.  All the main roads were fine and most of the secondary roads were just a little slushy.  About the only place the snow seemed to be accumulating was in the parking lots.

My current run had me ping-ponging around campus to all the different dorms.  It was a lot of running around but it was worth it.  One of my orders was for the on campus apartment building.  I recognized the room number as being at the back of the building.  I also knew there was a skinny maintenance path that led to the dumpsters behind the apartment building.  I figured it would be my best bet to make life easy.

I wrap around the one dorm and pull into the parking lot which had a small layer of unplowed snow.  It wasn’t enough to warrant 4wd so I just kept the Jeep in rear-wheel-drive.

After jumping out and delivering the pizza I looked back down the maintenance path and saw that the entire parking lot was empty, seeing an opportunity for a little fun, I jumped back in and strapped myself in.

For those that aren’t familiar with the “bootleg” maneuver you basically drive in reverse as fast as you can then hit the brakes (usually the parking break to lock up the rear wheels), cut the wheel to one side, let the front of the car spin around 180 degrees, and then hit the gas.  If conditions are right, and you pull it off, it’s a seamless 180 degree turn with no loss of momentum.

So I kick the keep in reverse, hit the end of the maintenance road, yank up on the parking brake, cut the wheel to the side, spin the Jeep around, hit the gas and pull off a flawless textbook 180 bootleg.

I am smiling to myself as I get to the end of the parking lot… then my heart sinks.  Sitting at the opposing stop sign in a campus police car.

Now, these aren’t your “rent-a-cop” campus security types.  They are full fledged badge wearing, gun carrying, sworn-in police officers.  They are notorious hard-asses for the shit they have to put up with on and around campus.

I dunno how much time passed but it felt like an eon.  I seriously expected his lights to flip on followed by a stern talking to and maybe even a ticket for reckless driving.

I was a pizza delivery guy for a little over a year off and on. I got fired 3 times from the same store and re hired twice. So I'll have a couple stories to post in here.

The first is the go-to pizza guy story.

I think at the time I was 21 or 22, and I looked younger. I could pass for 16. I'm 28 now and I still consistently get carded for drinks and people comment on how young I look. 

I was delivering to a commercial apartment building in Seattle. It's where people from out of town on business stay for a week or more.

A guy answers the door and he says ""I forgot my wallet, come in for a second?"" I say ""sure.""

He asks the price, I tell him, and he starts sifting through a couple bills in his wallet. He hands me a couple bucks for the price of the pizza and then for no reason at all he starts making small talk while still holding open his wallet. ""Where do you go to school?"" ""How old are you?"" ""How do you like the job?""

I'm trying my best to be polite but let him know that I don't want a conversation with short easy answers.

He says ""What's the biggest tip you've ever gotten?"" - I said ""Well, sometimes we do deliveries of 25 pizzas or more, so I've gotten a $100 tip before."" he says: ""How much of a tip should I give you then?""

I'm 100% confident I know where this is going. He's holding a bill (still in his wallet) and his hand is shaking and he's acting creepy. My spider senses are tingling. but I can't accuse him of doing something he hasn't done yet. So I'm trying to diffuse the situation: ""Well, the tip is extra, they already pay me to do my job, so you don't have to give me anything if you don't want to.""

He says ""Would you like a $20 tip?"", I keep repeating my line: ""I really appreciate that, you don't have to if you don't want to. It's just extra. It's not required.""

He starts to slow down because he's starting to stutter now, he pulls a $20 bill from his wallet with his hand shaking and says ""I'll give you a $20 tip, if you pull your pants down for me.""

I was stunned that he actually did what I thought he was going to do. I just said ""no."" in a ""definitive, but this just got weird"" tone. 

He says ""Not even just to look?"" (In my head, I'm like ""WHAT DID YOU WANT TO DO BEFORE?"") Outside, I remain calm and just say ""no."" again.

Now he's shaking really hard and incredibly embarrassed. He hands me the $20 and says ""Well, here, take this anyway. Sorry."" and I speedwalk out of the apartment and run to my car.

I called up my best friend at the time and tell him what just happened. The first words out of his mouth: ""Did you do it?"" I said: ""No!"" he says: ""Dude, why not? That's $20!"" and we laughed about it. The joke used to be: ""No, I didn't do it! I'm worth at least like $30 on craigslist.""

Everyone at the store laughed, some of the more experience drivers started telling their horror stories and giving me the ol ""Welcome to showbizz, kid"" pat on the back. After hearing some of them, I realized I probably got off lucky.

**TL;DR: A guy asks if I'll drop my pants for a $20 tip. I said no. He gave me the money anyway. I look young, guy was probably pedo**

1341920954.0,221,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,wbnld,My best day working at Pizza Hut.,247,26,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/wbnld/my_best_day_working_at_pizza_hut/,"Okay, so for my second post here I'd like to say I'm not a writer by any means so if you don't like my style skip to the TL;DR. I would like to provide a little back story as to how this adventure happened in the first place.

I started working at Pizza Hut in high school as a cook and that lasted for almost a year. Once I graduated and turned 18 I quickly switched over to a driver because who wouldn't want a $10/hr raise right? Having cook experience both hurt and really helped my job at times because if the restaurant was busy but we were slow on deliveries they would have me hop on the make line/cut table to help out, they would also do this when we were just insanely busy anyway and I would miss out on the tips from the runs.

Anyway on to the story. My local ISP has a headquarters in my hometown and they would occasionally place some huge orders 1-2 weeks in advance and word would get around and everybody would know about it. I was scheduled to be opening driver at 10 am so I could help out making this specific $2500 order (250 pizzas). When I got to work at 10, another driver had already been there for a half hour, and clocked in but wasn't doing much of anything. He wasn't scheduled until 11 mind you. 

So, I'm hating every single minute of making these pizzas knowing that I wasn't going to be delivering them and getting a pretty decent tip. 10:45 rolls around and we get an order for a single p'zone going to the pet store in the shopping center right behind our restaurant. I was stoked, because the store policy was a strict first come first serve when it came to the deliveries to keep things fair. So since the other driver clocked in first had to take the p'zone. 

The clock strikes eleven and the preplaced order for the ISP starts coming out of our printer and I start loading the pizzas into my car, the whole car was entirely full including my trunk. I had to keep all but my driver side window up to keep the pizzas from sliding out when making turns. All the glass in the car was fogged up and I had to keep wiping the windshield with my hand so I could see the road. 

I end up making it to the ISP and after multiple trips back and forth from my car and into the building the part where the signing of the credit card receipt/tipping phase came about. The woman looks at me and says, ""What's 20% of 2500?"" I look at her and in shock just kinda mumble ""500."" To which she replied, ""Well I wouldn't go to a restaurant and tip less than 20%, let's make it an even 3000."" I then thanked her sincerely and she just looks at me and says ""It's the company card anyway. Not like it's coming out of my pocket."" Then gave me a wink.

By the time I made it back The other driver was on his fourth delivery and according to the manager on shift he was pissed because he had been stiffed on the first three. She gave me the $485.73 (I already had $15 for my bank) she owed me and told me to clock out. So I tipped out my cook $100 and everybody was happy. Except Kevin, but he's a dick anyway so I don't care.

**TL;DR**

I was scheduled to come in early to make 250 pizzas and deliver the order. Some dick coworker decided he wanted the delivery so shows up to work way early to snipe it from me. We get an order right before the big order is supposed to go out, that he ended up taking.

Surprisingly enough the door almost immediately opens and a younger man is standing at the door buck ass naked with a raging clue.

I tell him I can't make change for that and he would have to pay with something else, blah blah company bullshit rules, then he tells me it's a tip.

We had this lady, which we dubbed Sausage Lady, who ordered from us every two days for years, always the same thing; Medium Triple Sausage.  She wasn't a big lady, she was rather thin and had one little dog.  She was nice, but didn't talk too much to us.  Every time she called, we'd just let her know it would be there in about twenty to thirty minutes.  Always paid cash/check, always tipped decent, always friendly.

Four days go by, no call.  Like a normal kitchen waiting on the Sausage Lady, we just made mention of it, but didn't act.  Five days, six days, and finally a week goes by, no call from Sausage Lady.

I mean hey shit happens, yeah thats more insulting then nothing. Really I would rather you have just not tipped me, but I'm not going to get an attitude about it.

The cord was about 3 feet long and you could see the circles it had run in the dirt around it, clearly it's out there quite often. After getting paid (no tip) and giving them the pizza, I bent down to pet the poor thing for a few minutes.

It breaks my heart and absolutely ruins the rest of my day when I see dogs tied up outside on short leashes and trails on the ground indicating they're always tied up. It was especially hard seeing the puppy because he was soo young and they had already gotten tired of him and left him to live a life tied up outside.

Another time, this past winter, I walked by a pile of blankets that a chihuahua had burrowed into because it was tied up right next to them. I tried to give him some love, but he was very aggressive, actually bit my leg slightly when I walked away. 

I don't understand how some people think that it's ok to treat a living animal like that.. It's heartbreaking.

I enjoyed it for the most part as it was easy cash and I didn't have to deal with the customers.

So one night we are completely dead. Nobody was in the store and nobody was calling in to place any orders. I'm about ready to croak from boredom when an order comes through. Carry out. Since we were slow, I actually took the time to make sure that pizza was perfect. Not only were the toppings placed on there nicely, I actually hooked them up and added a little bit more than I was supposed to. Just to be nice.

Pizza comes out of the oven, gets cut, boxed up and sent to the front. 10 min later my manager comes back just shaking his head. I ask him what's up. He says the lady who ordered that pizza I had just made said she saw me ""scratching my nuts"" and demanded a new pizza. I said ""wtf, not only was I not scratching my junk back here, but you can't even see the cooking area from the front counter."" He said he knew and not to worry, he wasn't giving her another one, but it got better. He said she wouldn't give him the 'tainted' pizza back and the new one she demanded was actually a completely different (and more expensive) one.

He looked at her and said ""Ma'am, you want my cook, who you claim was scratching his genitals while making your food, to prepare another pizza for you, and you want to keep the one he's already made for you?"" She actually said yes!

He told her it wasn't happening and to have a nice night. Said she was muttering something under her breath as she left.

The first two deliveries were in the same apartment complex with the third in the neighboring apartment complex.  The first order was $22.44, and apparently all the woman had was two twenties, which, having just started the evening, I was unprepared to have change for.  I gave her back one of the twenties and told her I'd cover the rest of the cost. Obviously, no tip there.

Next order: $16.37.  This guy was curious about job openings at our store.  Maybe he was disappointed to hear that we weren't hiring, or maybe he just didn't have the money. Either way, no tip.

Next order: $34.65.  She was upset that it took forty minutes instead of the predicted thirty-two and demanded that I give her a free pizza.  After telling her numerous times that I couldn't authorize that but to feel free to call my boss, she gave up, and paid me exactly $34.65.  Again, no tip.

Next order: $57.24.  Group of girls having a party of some sort.  Lots of screams and giggles emanating from the home as I attempt to make friendly conversation.  Apparently something  went right with that order, got a $12 tip. Awesome.

Karma right? Paid for someones meal, got my money back sixfold.

Wrong.

Several orders later: An address I don't recognize, a street I've never heard of, and order adding up to $41.12.  I find the place. a giant circle with some of the largest houses I've seen.  When I reached the house, I was absolutely amazed. Large mansion, lots of ornate details y'all don't care about, like exquisitely carved marble lions on either side of the stairs leading to the front door.  I knocked using the large doorknockers on the massive doors in front of me, but no answer. I ring the door bell, hidden behind bushes cute in neat little spirals, and a nice tune echoed inside.  The large door swung open, revealing the woman pulling it; no taller than 5 feet, seemingly wearing nothing but a royal blue silk bathrobe, blonde hair, blue eyes, stunning figure.  She invited me into her mansion, explaining through her thick accent how thankful she was that I was bringing her food.  She led me to the kitchen, also massive, and had me place her items on the counter.  She asks again what the total was.

""41.12, ma'am""

She pulls out some money and hands me a one hundred dollar bill, saying ""no change""

I replied, ""no ma'am, I don't have enough change for that"" thinking she was asking.

""No no no, I mean I don't need change""

I stuttered, completely baffled by the size of the tip. $60 on a $40 order? How does that ever make sense?  I told her it was the biggest tip I've ever gotten, to which she giggled and asked, ""you've never been here before, have you?""  I hadn't. ""Well, that's how we do things"".  She then stood holding the front door, smiling and waving as I drove away.

All I can figure is I gained some good karma by paying that little bit for that other woman's food, and the universe was returning my money, thirtyfold.  It's the little actions that matter, guys.

Like most delivery drivers you tend to see a lot of crazy stuff. Probably the craziest  thing that I ever saw/happened to me was when I had to take a delivery to some rundown apts/condos. 

I was the only driver at the times, since it was the lunch shift during the week so it wasn't that busy. I got a delivery to go out to some apts that I had been out to many times before. I got to the apt and knocked on the door. After waiting some time the door finally opened but just slightly. A middle aged man was peeking out from behind the door. He was clearly not wearing a shirt but his shyness made me think  he wasn't wearing anything at all. He asked me what I wanted. apparently the uniform and pizza bag wasn't enough of a clue. I answered him and told him I was the pizza guy. Upon hearing that he threw the door open and his whole attitude changed. 
I must say at this point I was terrified, because as I said, I thought he was naked. To my relief he was at least wearing boxers. 

At this point he invited me in. To this day I don't know why I agreed but I entered. I did make him lead though. Something about a semi naked strange man behind me made me a little uneasy. As he led me through his small apt he went through a tiny hall way to the living room. before he entered tho he stopped at the entrance and looked in his kitchen, giving me a look of accomplishment and pride. Kind of like, ""Ya, that's what I'm doing."" I look around the wall into the cove-like-kitchen to see a not so attractive woman, bent over wearing bright orange tiny shorts and a white tank top, pouring boxed wine into a Styrofoam cup. She notices me finally and stands up, clearly drunk, and exclaims, ""its the pizza man!"" 

At this point I realize that the man is gone! A half naked man is never a good thing to lose track of when you are in a strange place. The middle aged woman has now come over to me and is explaining that they are both doctors and that this is there day off an they are adults and can be inebriated if they want. Keep in mind all of this is in slurred speech. I hear the man call her into the room and I follow here. I see him sitting on the couch writing out a check...in pencil. With out even looking up at me he asks me, ""do I like to play?"" Already feeling like I'm in the twilight zone, I answered him ""With what?"" thinking he meant drugs or something. His answer made me nearly drop the pizzas. He replied, ""Pussy!"" He went on to proceed to tell me that him and his wife are swingers and that if I wanted to I could have sex with her. He claimed that they just finished having sex and that he isn't as young as he used to be. So if I wanted to I could do it before there other swinger friends came by in about 20 mins. 

As I said I was shocked. All I could do was chuckle nervously. At this point he was done writing the check and had handed it to me. I believe I told him ""No"" but all I can remember is that I just kept nervously laughing. They thanked me for the pizza with a weird smirk and told me I could exit through the back door. Thankfully I never had to go back there.  But in my 2 years delivering that was by far the weirdest thing that ever happened to me. 

tl;dr on a random delivery I got propositioned by a not so attractive middle age couple of swingers. I was told I could have sex with the man's wife before there other swinger friends arrived. needless to say, i told them no, between my nervous, shit scared out of me, laughing.

I get sent out on a delivery with 1 order of 14 piece wings to an apartment complex notorious for not tipping. I get to the door and who should answer but a child around 8 years old. My tolerant but begrudging mood drops faster then a mob snitch in cement shoes. 

I hand the girl her wings without so much as a smile and hand her the receipt to sign. She finishes signing the receipt, hands it back to me, then begins to fish around in her pocket. Moments later she finds what she was looking for and goes to hand me a $5 tip. 

As my disposition begins to lift I begin to feel the ground shake. A glass of water on the near by dining room table begins to ripple. It was a scene straight out of Jurassic park. 

THUD..... THUD...... THUD..... THUD....

Then out of nowhere comes this HUGE 5'6, 400lb woman, moving at a much quicker rate than someone of that size probably should.

I'm delivering in city #1 and she lives in city #2 where we don't deliver but i didn't notice this until later. Anyways she tells me that last time she ordered she said no olives and we put olives on her pizza and said that the manager said her order was half off text time. Well I check on the computer and don't see anything on her account saying she gets half off. i check our complaint log book and still don't see anything so i get my shift manager and she ends up just giving her the half off and finishes taking her order. As soon as she hangs up the phone our power goes out so we are unable to make her order until the computers are back up. 30 minutes later when the computers are back up i realize she isn't in our delivery range and decide to be nice and just take it out instead of calling her back half an our later telling her she needs to order from the store in the other city where she's at.

15 minutes later her order is ready to be taken out. i get in my car and drive off and decide I'm going to call her and just let her know of the whole power situation and just letting her know why her food is late. So i call her and she starts yelling at me saying im lying to her and I'm actually out smoking weed with my friends instead of taking her food to her. (yes, those were her actual words) Then say's she wants her food to be free and wants it remade since now it's old. I tell her that I'm not lying and i shouldn't even be taking out her order since she's not in our delivery range but i wanted to be nice and not have to waste her time. I also tell her that she wont get a free order and that the food literally came out of the oven 5 minutes ago and wont be remade. She tells me that she wants me to go back to the store, call the store she should have ordered from and that she's going to complaint to my manager about me. So i tell her to go ahead but i wont be calling the other store. I hang up the phone, drive back to my store and my shift manager is on the phone with her. When she gets off the phone she tells me to go take the order back out, that she explained to this lady that every thing i said was the truth and i wasn't lying and tells me she will give me double mileage.

So i take it out again and I'm about a block away from her apartment and she calls me, i answer her call and she say ""Where's my food?"" and i tell her ""umm well you sent me back to the store and you also live kinda far outside of our delivery range so it's going to take a bit longer, but anyways I'm only a block away and will be there shortly."" She says "" oh yeah? Or are you lying to me again?"" I say ""Are you kidding me?"" and just hang up the phone. At that point i was furious and just wanted to go back to the store. But i said to myself ""it's not worth it since I'mm already here, i might as well just drop it off."" 

Well i get into the apartment lobby and notice i need a door code which they didn't give me so I'm like ""oh great now i have to call them again"" So i call them and she answers and says ""Ummm, what do you want?"" and i say ""I need a door code to get in, or do you guys not want the food anymore?"" and she say ""i don't know"" and i say ""Really, are you kidding me? Do you want to food or not?"" And she yells ""I don't know if i want it anymore.""

Now please keep in mind that I'm not someone who easily get angry or ever talks like this but when she said that something just set off in my head and i lost all control. I said ""You fucking cunt, are you fucking kidding me? I've already wasted an hour and a half on you and your going to fucking say you don't want it anymore? Fuck that."" So i take the food from the bag, stomp on it then some guy gets the phone from her and says ""don't talk to my girl like that you fuckin' faggot, im coming down there and im going to fucking deal with you"" and i say ""fuck you and your ""girl"" is a bitch."" So I'm kinda having a full blown panic attack at this point and im fearing that this guy's going to come down and beat me up or something so i hang up and just run out of the building. 

Half way back my manager calls me and say's ""what's going on?"" Still furious i kinda yell at her and say ""im done with this job, fuck these customers, i fucking quit."" and she says ""just calm down and it's okay, just come back to the store.""

I get back to the store and my shift manager is on the phone with her crying and when she gets off the phone i asked her ""what did they say?"" and she just says ""that that lady was just crazy and is going to be black listed and not to worry about being fired, that she would vouch for me"" but id have to talk to the general manager and the owner which was fine. The general manager gets to the store and i tell her the whole story and she says ""next time something like this happens just go back to the store and by the way, those apartments are filled with nothing but scum so don't worry about it."" I end up finishing my shift for that night. 

That was my last shift until our payday. Payday comes around and i go to the store and it's just my general manager there so i get my check and she tells me that she has to fire me. I guess the apartment owners called the store and told them that they were going to press charges on me for breaking their door which wasn't really broken, the handle was just kinda bent from me being afraid that they guy was going to come down and kick my ass and running out. She said she really didn't want to fire me since she felt that it was just kind of a shitty situation since i shouldn't have even had to take it out but it's what the owner said she had to do. I just told her i had a good time working there and i'd see them around.

It's in a college town, so your job options are basically either to work a student job or work in foodservice/retail/hospitality. I did pretty much all of those things over the course of 5.5 years, but the job I had longest was as a delivery driver for this little outfit that specialized in delivering everything but pizza.

So this guy calls in the order. Manager/owner/accountant/marketing director/HR guy (it was a small business) was out back so I ended up taking the order, cooking the food and driving out to drop it off. Knocked on the door and it opened by itself.

That is to say, I *thought* it opened by itself because at first glance, there was no one on the other side of it. Like a haunted house in a Scooby Doo episode. It was a bright day and it was dark inside so I couldn't see very well.

I stood there and scrutinized the foyer of this person's house for a few moments until I hear a deliberate throat-clearing noise coming from the area around my knees. Upon closer inspection, this sound had come from a guy on his knees waiting indignantly for his food. 

Upon yet even closer inspection, turned out the guy didn't have knees. He was a Lieutenant Dan-style no-leg-having person. So I handed him his food bag, with the credit card slip stapled to it for him to sign, and he tears it off with his other set of stumps. Turns out he didn't really have what a traditionalist would call ""arms,"" either. 

So my only purpose now is to get a signature on this credit card slip. He weeble-wobbles his way into his living room, motioning for me to follow him, and I do. On the way in, I notice a completely limb-enabled person laying on the couch, lying inert in a manner not unlike Steven Wright in *Half Baked*. 

Stumpy produces a pen and holds it between his ersatz arms and signs the receipt. He proffers it to me, and what I thought was the most interesting part of the entire thing was that his handwriting (a misnomer in this case) was *amazing.* I can't even touch my own two elbows together on account of muh meaty moobs get in the way, but this guy's signature looked like it belonged on a document in a scroll in some forgotten corner of the library.

1369041267.0,180,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,1eonub,500 Deliveries - Simple Analysis of Tipping Habits,202,22,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1eonub/500_deliveries_simple_analysis_of_tipping_habits/,"I tracked 500 consecutive deliveries, logging information on the following categories:  
* Approximate age of the paying customer  
* Race of the paying customer  
* Sex of the paying customer  
* Location of delivery (House, apartment, dorm, etc)  
* Tip amount  
     
**About the delivery area:**  
  The store is a Domino's Pizza. It is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States near a college campus. The delivery area covers the city, which is mostly suburbs, and extends 7-10 miles beyond city limits into ""country"" roads. The store operates with a $2 delivery charge. Typical delivery times fall between 22-35 minutes. The bulk of the customers to this store are college students.  
    
**Disclaimer:** I cannot guarantee 100% accuracy on the data collected. This was merely an exercise of curiosity. There may have been some mathematical errors here in there in the calculations below, but to the best of my knowledge, the work is sound. *I think*.
    
**""Stiff?""**: Any ""tips"" of less than $1 are considered a stiff. The minimum delivery amount (after tax and delivery charge) at this store is $13.30, so anything less that $1 is generally the customer not wanting coin change. And though some consider this a genuine tip, I do not.  
    
**AGE**  
Ages were guessed and split into six groups. Less than 20 years old, 21-25 yrs, 26-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50+. There was nothing scientific about this age guessing; it's just an approximation.  
  
**&lt; 20 Yrs Old**: 124 orders. Frequency of tip: 64.52%. Best tip: $5.61. Average tip: $1.48  
**21-25 yrs old**: 213 orders. Frequency of tip: 79.34%. Best tip: $13.68. Average tip: $2.51  
**26-30 yrs old**: 32 orders. Frequency of tip: 71.88%. Best tip: $9.23. Average tip: $3.03  
**30-39 yrs old**: 68 orders. Frequency of tip: 91.18%. Best tip: $20.00. Average tip: $3.67  
**40-49 yrs old**: 32 orders. Frequency of tip: 100%. Best tip: $10.00. Average tip: $3.33  
**50+ yrs old**: 31 orders. Frequency of tip: 93.55%. Best tip: $6.93. Average tip: $3.18  
    
**RACE**  
Again, this was a *best guess* based on accent, skin color, hair color, and is in no way scientific.  
  
**White**: 372 orders. Frequency of tip: 88.71%. Best tip: $15.00. Average tip: $2.85. Stiffs: 42  
**Black**: 45 orders. Frequency of tip: 37.78%. Best tip: $3.92. Average tip: $0.85. Stiffs: 28  
**Asian**: 33 orders. Frequency of tip: 57.58%. Best tip: $7.40. Average tip: $1.26. Stiffs: 14  
**Hispanic**: 29 orders. Frequency of tip: 65.52%. Best tip: $20.00. Average tip: $2.77. Stiffs: 10  
**Arab**: 16 orders. Frequency of tip: 100%. Best tip: $3.71. Average tip: $2.77. Stiffs: 0  
**Pacific Islander**: 3 orders. Frequency of tip: 100%. Best tip: $3.45. Average tip: $2.82. Stiffs: 0  
**Native American**: 2 orders. Frequency of tip: 50%. Best tip: $1.00. Average tip: $0.50. Stiffs: 1  
    
**SEX**  
This was, admittedly, less of a guessing game.  
    
**Male**: 296 orders. Frequency of tip: 84.12%. Best tip: $20.00. Average tip: $2.70. Stiffs: 47  
**Female**: 204 orders. Frequency of tip: 74.51%. Best tip: $12.00. Average tip: $2.31. Stiffs: 52  
    
**LOCATION OF DELIVERY**:  
I lumped apartments and duplexes together. The OTHER category includes churches, trailer parks, and one solitary order to the local high school. A ""country home"" is one that lies outside of the city limits on a decent chunk of land. ""Bar"" included both patrons and bartenders. ""Motel"" included both front desk clerks and direct-to-room deliveries. ""College campus"" included deliveries anywhere to campus buildings, not including dorms.   
  
**Apartments**: 188 orders. Frequency of tip: 80.32%. Best tip: $10.19. Average tip: $2.24. Stiffs: 37  
**House**: 164 orders. Frequency of tip: 91.46%. Best tip: $15.00. Average tip: $3.13. Stiffs: 14  
**Dorm**: 99 orders. Frequency of tip: 58.59%. Best tip: $5.61. Average tip: $1.55. Stiffs: 41  
**OTHER**: 13 orders. Frequency of tip: 84.62%. Best tip: $20.00. Average tip: $4.36. Stiffs: 2  
**Country Home**: 11 orders. Frequency of tip: 90.91%. Best tip: $10.00. Average tip: $4.22. Stiffs: 1  
**Fraternity/Sorority**: 10 orders. Frequency of tip: 70%. Best tip: $3.64. Average tip: $1.63. Stiffs: 3  
**Motel**: 5 orders. Frequency of tip: 100%. Best tip: $6.93. Average tip: $3.06. Stiffs: 0  
**College Campus**: 5 orders. Frequency of tip: 80%. Best tip: $5.00. Average tip: $2.98. Stiffs: 1  
**Bar**: 5 orders. Frequency of tip: 100%. Best tip: $12.00. Average tip: $6.32. Stiffs: 0  
    
**OVERALL**:  
Mean: $2.54  
Median: $2.00  
Mode: $2.00  
High: $20.00  
Stiffs: 99  
Frequency of tip: 80.2%  
    
So who is the best tipper I can hope to come across in my area?  
  
That would be a 30-39 year old white male working/drinking at a bar (maths suggest an 87.18% chance of an average tip of $2.93)

Ex-pizza guy, thankfully! It was recommended I post this story here, so here 'tis!

 Kitchen at a pizza joint was damn near the worst job I ever had. But I got at least one good story out of it...

A little background first- This was a family-style, sit-down pizza place.  50 tables or so up front &amp; we delivered as well.  It was Friday night, busiest night of the week for our store and it's my night on dish pit.  The Shift leader hates everyone, but for some reason I seem to catch more shit from him than anyone else [possibly because I was the smallest person working in the kitchen]. I've already been there eight hours, elbow-deep in dishes with the broad side of the oven running full-blast 5 feet behind me, it's August in Oklahoma City [if Hell has a Bonus Level, it's OKC in the summertime], and I am *thoroughly* done listening to him bitching about my failure to do the work of three people [just 'cos you're running on coke, doesn't mean the rest of us are. Well...anyway, *I* wasn't.].  
To continue-

  It's an hour or so until we close and the incoming dishes are piled high and I'm practically shoveling shit in one end and yanking it out the other. Then, from behind me I hear the shift leader yell something about collecting the pans that were piled up by the window [not my job]. All of a sudden- WHAM!! Large pie pan covered in crusty, half-baked sauce slams into the wall of the *clean* end of the pit, sauce splatters all over the tray of clean pans I'd just pulled out and it misses my head by about three inches on the rebound!

Oh, yeah. I snapped.

Now this shift leader was a 6'+, lanky, coked-out black guy in his late 20s or early thirties, and I [at this point] am a skinny little whiteboy, just barely old enough to drink. I grabbed the first thing that came to hand -which just happened to be a [formerly] clean, small pie pan- spun around and let it fly as hard as I could. It sailed dead straight, about 20-25 feet across the kitchen &amp; nailed him smack in the throat. He immediately drops to the floor gagging &amp; clutching his throat and I yell- ""You're lucky it wasn't a goddamn tray of knives coming out, ya fuckhole! Throw some more shit! Come on! Get up and throw some more shit at my clean dishes!!!""

The entire kitchen froze...I stood there for a moment, took a few deep breaths and calmly said: ""I need a fucking smoke..."" and walked out the back door.

The best part? Store manager saw the whole thing.
Zero repercussions.

**TL;DR - Shift leader fucked up my dishes, I went TRON on his ass. [I fight for the users!]**

*epilogue*: He was fine, the pan just bruised his windpipe a little and he talked funny for a week or so. 
Then he pretty much went straight back to being an ass.  
I quit in the middle of my shift two weeks later -after getting the ""You're hired! Come pee in a cup!"" phone call while I was out the back door on a smoke break.  I tossed my apron into the kitchen, got in my car and never worked food-service again.

First one's a little tame, but I have more to tell*

**Homecoming night 1999**

For medical reasons I had to drop out of college my freshman year.  After working the summer at a camp I had worked at the year prior I landed a job at a pizza joint in town.  This was my first gig as a driver and I was young (19), living at home, and rocking my first car.

I volunteered to work a pair of doubles the week of homecoming.  Being a college town I knew we were going to be busy and being too young to party-hard I decided to work and earn a few extra bucks.

I went in early to fold boxes and get all my ""other duties"" taken care of. As soon as 4:00 hit I was off like a mad man.  Unlike most of the other drivers who were all college students, I had grown up in the area and knew my way around town and all the backroads. In the time one of the student shlubs could make a single run I could make four.

Anyway, my 5th delivery of the night somewhere around 4:30 was to this party a block from campus.  They were already three sheets to the wind.  I handed the drunk his pizza, he paid me, and I left.

At the time we had a deal for college students that was a pizza, bread sticks, and a 2L of coke for $15.  Wasn't uncommon to get two guys throwing $10 each at yeah.  It also wasn't uncommon to get a call a few minutes later from the same apartment/dorm/house wanting the same deal. So when I saw that same address pop up I snagged it and made the trip back.

**SAME FREAKING GUY**

""Uh, someone stole my fucking pizza man. Had to order a new one.""

I just laughed, took the money, and left.

About two hours later I see the same address pop up and cued it on my next run.  I ring the doorbell...

**SAME FUCKING DUDE**

I honestly have no idea how this guy was standing.  He offered me a beer which - sadly - I declined.  He insisted... I declined again saying I drove for my job and couldn't risk it.  He insisted again... I declined again saying I was 19 and wasn't legal.

Anyway, he looked like he was about to fall over so I took his money - and he still gave me a beer - and I turned to walk away.  Some chick was walking towards the party so I just handed her the beer and jumped back in my car.

I should also mention at this point that when I made the 3rd delivery I could see the prior two orders sitting right where this guy had put them.  First box was still on the counter next to the door and the second pizza box was still on top of the refrigerator near the window.  No idea if the pizzas were still in them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were.

+++

**TL;DR:** Made three runs to the same house party... same guy answered the door. Kept getting drunker and drunker and saying people kept steeling his pizzas.  Spotted first two orders right where he put them when he gave me the money.  At least he tipped me $5 each time.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_149y4l,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/149y4l/homecoming_night_1999_story_1/,

It happened a couple days ago and it's been eating at me.

I'm the closing driver on Thursday night. This is a pretty normal affair. I'm a college kid with afternoon classes. So, around 11:00PM, everybody decides it's time for their second dinner, and we have two orders pop up for an apartment complex and a Bestway Inn. They're next door to eachother and the orders were two minutes apart, so I obviously get the double.

Just so you know, our District Manager requires us to take our car topper off south of a certain road because our drivers have been mugged at the apartment complex I'm going to. It's a shitty area. Any tip is a good tip. We also have to meet the customer at the mailbox while staying in our car. 

So, I take the car topper off, hide my valuables, and head south to the apartment. I call them on the way there, and meet them right as they're on the way out. I get shorted $.50, but who's going to argue with people from the place you're most likely to get mugged at? 

I carry on to the Bestway Inn, right next door, and head upstairs to room 208. As I pass by 202, I see a high school girl (Hispanic) leave the room with a skinny black dude. I know she's a highschool girl because she's got a 2013 letter jacket on. I make my delivery, and as I'm walking by, she's standing in the doorframe with the black guy out in the hall. He says, ""So, does $500 for the whole week sound good,"" and she responds with a ""Yea, that sounds really good. I'm excited!"" 

What the fuck is going on? She's a senior in high school, and she's selling herself out at one of the sketchiest hotels in the DFW area?

Now fast forward to after the shenanigans, and we're all starving. So I suggest pizza. While we're waiting, one of the guy's suggest we answer the door naked (since we were already all naked and just playing Halo). We all agree and when the guy gets there, the following encounter takes place.

**Naked Guy #1**: *answering the door* Hey, thanks man, we're all starving!

**Pizza Guy**: *With a stunned look* Uh...no problem dude.

**Naked Guy #2**: Is that the pizza? *comes running up the door and grabs one of the pizzas*

**Pizza Guy**: *Visibly starting to freak out* That'll be $35.

**Me**: Dude thanks for coming so fast, I can't wait to dig into this meat lovers. *grabs the other pizza*

**Naked Guy #3**: *comes up behind me and wraps his arms around my chest* You better share that, I love me some meat.

I'm pretty sure I've never seen a guy go so pale in my life. Looking back, I still find it hilarious, although I do feel bad for the guy. I can imagine it would be a pretty shocking thing to see.

They where all quite far apart so I was in a rush to get them all there in good time still nice and hot. First 2 went off without a hitch and the last was to one of those high-rise flats that are usually full of scumbags. So standard procedure I got lucky and got a parking spot right outside the flat, locked her up and proceeded up the lift to floor 6 did the deed and headed back down to the car, all in all about 5 mins.

As I was walking out the fron door I got a bit confused as I was sure I parked my car right there... But it was gone, then I noticed a guy doing a 3 point turn in the road... I thought that looks a bit like....THAT'S MY CAR! I ran out to the car and put my hands on the bonnet thumping it and swearing like a loony telling him to get the fuck out of my car.. He proceeded to drive but his angle was off so I was on the bonnet like Tom fucking selleck raving like a mad man, I slid of to the drivers side and yanked the door open and got a hold of the guys jacket... It's at this point he grabbed whatever it was he used to jam into my engine, some screwdriver type thing and tried to plant it in my face, the adrenaline was pumping and I saw it in slow mo so managed to avoid it but at this point I'm thinking, shit this ain't worth it so I let go and he swerved out into the road taking out the side of another car in the process.

So at this point I'm in the middle of the road holding an empty pizza bag thinking hell... My boss ain't gonna buy this one. I made the call and he had another driver come out and pick me up and take me home. 

I got a call in the middle of the night from the police saying they had found my car and I can pick it up at the impound, I thought we'll that's a bit of luck. 

Went down to pick it up the next day and... Well it was scrap, apparently it had been used for some sort of hold up and the guy got away. I was left in a predicament that I was not insured from work because it didn't cover theft and I was not insured on my own insurance because the police report said I was working at the time. And on top of that I had to pay 300 quid to get my scrap metal back then pay another 50 to scrap it. Then the final kick in the balls I lost my job as I couldn't work without a car and couldn't afford a new one.

It got to the point where, if I was really high and feeling generous, I would pull out the biggest bud from the latest crop that looked like a giant green dildo (probably an ounce or more) and offering it along with the ticket cost of the pizza. 

Within a year I'm guessing I became known within the ""pizza guy"" community because I got the quickest service and finest pies. My guess would be I tipped over $6,000.00 (in weed dollars) in a two year period averaging a pie a week. Just wanted to thank you guys once again for doing the lord's work.

Gets Resolved with a Surprise Happy Ending!,196,31,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/18t68m/pizza_order_gone_wrong_gets_resolved_with_a/,"I don't work in the pizza industry, but I thought this subreddit would find my recent experience amusing.  I apologize if it's a tad long.

Last week, I placed an order at a local pizza place.  I have ordered from this restaurant several times and have always had a pleasant experience.  However, this particular night, something was off.  I had ordered pizza, breadsticks, and some extra ranch dressing to go with the breadsticks.  When I checked the food, however, the ranch was nowhere to be found.  I tried to catch the delivery guy, but he was already driving away.  No big deal, really.  I just called the store and they said they'd send the driver back with the ranch.  

After 15 minutes or so, the driver appears with a bag of dressing.  I thank him and go back to the kitchen.  I open the bag and... it's all garlic butter.  No ranch.  I try to catch the delivery guy, but again, he's already driving away.  I didn't want to call the store again (I felt bad complaining), so I just drove to the store myself.  The store is located just up the road from where I live, so it doesn't take long to get there.  I go inside and the employees apologize and swap out the garlic butters for ranch.  I thank them and go back home.  

I finally get home and I prepare to eat.  However, upon opening the box containing the breadsticks, I discover that they are the wrong type of breadsticks.  I ordered a special flavor and these were just plain.  I'm pretty hungry at this point, so I decide to let it go.  I open the pizza box and discover that one garlic butter was inside the box.  Unfortunately for me, the seal broke during transport and it had leaked all over inside the box.  I sigh, but decide to just eat the pizza.  It's cold at this point, so I had to microwave it.  It tasted ok, but the experience was so bizarre that I decided I was going to file an issue report via their website.

I felt really awful complaining.  I rarely complain and I didn't want anyone to get into trouble.  I didn't attack anyone in my complaint.  I just wrote out the story and said that I was unsatisfied with my experience.  Part of the complaint was a brief side note about the ranch dressing.  I mentioned that I like to order extra so that I can eat it on days when I don't even order pizza.  The stuff is that good.  

Two days later, my doorbell rings.  I answer it... and it's the pizza guy!  He pulls out a couple pizza boxes.  I am confused, but thought that maybe my roommate ordered pizza without telling me.  But before I even finish that thought, the guy apologizes for my recent poor experience with their company.  He says that is definitely not how they do business and they would like to apologize to me.  He presents a pizza box that included a t-shirt and some coupons for free items.  Then he opens up the second pizza box.  It is full of ranch dressing cups!  He says that they read how much I love the stuff and wanted to offer a pizza box full of ranch dressing cups as an apology.  I laugh and say thank you repeatedly.  The delivery guy says that he really loves the stuff, too, so he understands.  We finish our chit chat and he says he hopes to do business again with me in the future.  I say I definitely will and we close our conversation.

I was so blown away by their customer service.  I laughed about the ranch dressing, but it really was the perfect apology.  I loved it.  And that is the story about a pizza experience gone wrong with a surprise happy ending!

I had just walked out to the parking lot when I heard sirens. I didn't think much of it at first and got in my car. As I began to back up, I noticed a shirtless, tattooed, ultra-skinny guy running as fast as humanly possible towards me. He got so close to my car, that if I had backed up any further, I would have hit him, so I slammed on my breaks. 

The man proceded to bang on my driver's side window, gasping for air. At this point, my phone was in my lap, dialing the store. I cracked my window to see what he wanted (I wasn't too afraid at the time because I was still in the parking lot.) The conversation went something like this...

""Can I help you?""
""Hey man, hey, I just need a ride. Can you give me a ride please? Just take me anywhere. I need to get out of here or they're gonna get me!""
""Sorry man, I really gotta get this pizza out."" 
""Look man, here...""

He pulled out a bag of crystal meth from his pocket. 

""You like rocks bro? I'll fuckin' give you these if you just take me to the guy's house you""re going to.""

At this point, the manager was in on what was going on outside. I saw him walk out of the store and yell ""Hey what's going on?"" The man quickly turned to the manager, back to me, then just ran away, across the street and into the nearest neighborhood. 

I told the manager everything that happened and he called the cops. I finally took the delivery, and on my way back, I stopped in the neighborhood. I didn't ask what happened, but there were 3 squad cars at the front of the neighborhood.

I was working for a pizza shop in my hometown that was run by a pleasant Turkish family and I loved my job (unfortunately issues caused the business to close so I could not continue to work there).  So anyways I get a call for a large pizza, a lasagna dinner, and 2 bottles (2 liter bottles) of Pepsi to be delivered to an apartment complex that I regularly delivered to but an apartment number I did not recognize.  So I finish up the order, drive over there, and then it gets weird.  

I pull in and head down a flight of stairs to the appropriate apartment.  As i walk down the stairs I get BLASTED in the face by a smell that I can only describe as a moldy, musty, dirty scent.  Something between old puke, burnt hair, mold, and a dead animal.  This shit was foul.  I hold my breath and knock on the door.  A voice replies from within, ""Let yourself in, it is open.""  Weird. But whatever. I go in and the smell elevates to code red, like uncovered mass grave type of smell. 

The room is dimly lit by a few candles but not lights or windows and it looks like I just walked into a house from Hoarders.  Directly in front of me are piles of random things and trash, these piles are everywhere that I can see.  Then from my right I here, ""Put the food on the table."" I look to see the source of the voice and find the aforementioned table and I think I let out an audible gasp.  I see a man who had to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 pounds (I am not exaggerating this, I was staring at IRL Jabba the Hut) is sitting on a love seat and spilling out over the sides.  He has a desk in front of him and is motioning to it so I place the food down.  Directly next to the couch is a four foot tall mountain of empty 2 liter Pepsi bottles.  

He had left his credit card info with the restaurant so i handed him the receipt and pen and had him sign it and he writes a fat 0 with a line through it in the tip column and then signs the bottom (with a remarkably good looking signature I must add).  I take the receipt and he says, and i quote, ""Do you want a tip? You'll need to do a little extra.""  Perfectly contempt to get out of there so I can breathe fresh air without a tip I begin to say thanks but no thanks; however the man does not give me the chance to answer and instead says, ""Go in the kitchen and get me a fork and a knife.""  I was too confused and terrified to do anything but wander through the trash infested living room and dining room to go into the kitchen (still no lights) and listen to him give me turn by turn directions to the fork and knife.  The kitchen floor was stained and covered in so much dirt and grease that i could kick a layer off, there were more dirty dishes in the sink than all of the dishes in my entire apartment, and there were piles of trash everywhere.  I got him his utensils handed them too him and he handed me back my tip, 2 warm sticky quarters. I thank him and get the fuck out as he tells me to make sure the door shuts behind me.

I was traumatized and felt so dirty afterwards.  The more I thought about it and talked to people about what the fuck had happened, I came to the conclusion that besides the trash, the smell had to have come from that man's inability to get off of the couch and properly clean himself.  I know from being in those apartments before that the showers would not be big enough for him unless he had a custom one installed and judging by how he looked and acted he probably could not get off of the couch.  I felt bad but was terrified to ever go back and anytime he called back (he became a semi-regular and he always ordered the same thing) I always would make sure that I gave that delivery to another driver.  

TLDR: 600 pound man that smells like rotting corpse gives odd requests and then tips 50 cents.

* Guy: C'Mon man, I'll give you a fifteen dollar tip.

I mention this to the cook and faster than lightning the ovens are back on and he's stretching the dough out. I got some really sketchy directions from the guy, and as soon as the 'za was done the cook and I were on the way (i was giving him a ride home that night). Anyway, like I said, the dude gave me really shitty directions. 

I stop at house #1 and some nice old lady says she didn't order and tries to point me on the right direction of where this guy might be. (I lived in a pretty rural area, we were the only place that delivered this far into the sticks, and this was before the age of smart phones) 

Anyway, onto house #2, I saw a cabin I thought might be the place a ways back on the road, outdoor lights on, usually a good sign. I pull into the driveway, start heading to the door and see the door open and a silhouette level off a shotgun at me. I immediately throw my hands in the air, saying ""WHOA DUDE, I'M THE PIZZA GUY!"". I get back in my car and get the fuck outta Dodge.

 At this point the cook is both tired of the run around and pretty scared because we almost got shot. I tell him I wanna check one last place, I remembered the guy mentioning some kinda trail sign that was on the road to his house. We drove for a ways down a super bumpy road. And at the end? Cabin with its outdoor lights on. Cha-fucking-ching. Walk up to the door, and knock. Mid fifties guy lookin really intoxicated answers the door.

Fortunately for me the boss claimed ignorance (he knew damn well who was responsible for any computer tinkering), I feel bad for their tech department now, but I sure as shit didn't then. When I returned to work there was a nice shiny arcade version of Ms PacMan in the dining room. The boss gave me a roll of quarters and told me that if I ever fucked with the computers again he'd fire me on the spot.

Fun job actually: car had glasspacks and a Hurst shifter (anybody remember those?) so I had a good time booming and zooming those pies in record times.

So one day I'm sent to an apartment building, I knock and knock, no answer. Door opens behind me, a guy pops out, ""Hey, they're not home. Bummer for you!"" We chat a moment, he offers to buy the pizzas I'm carrying because ""better than carrying them back, right?"" At a discount, of course!

We call my manager from his apartment (WAY pre-cellphone), manager says sure, pizza time for this guy and his friends!

Fast forward a few weeks, what do you know, same scenario. ""I saw them leave, they're not home. Bummer!"" Cheap pizza again.

Third time around, I'm not having any. ""That's a good thing you've got going there, fellas, but not this time.""

""WHAT! ARE YOU ACCUSING ME? I'M CALLING YOUR MANAGER!""

Fine, whatever, no pizza for you. I walk away.

I've seen my fair share of crazy stuff at the store. Sometimes I have to run to the front to help out on phones when we get busy, no biggie. 

One day, this occurred and I ran up front to answer a call, I do my answering shpeel ""Thank you for calling PJI's on ""Unknown Ave."" this is ShoGunzalez, would you like to try our (special offer pizza) deal for just (special offer pizza deal price)?"" To which I get a ""No, I would like to talk with your manager, you guys gave me food poisoning, I wanna talk to your manager"" (said in crotchety lady voice) I answered ""Yes sir, I'll get him right away, let me put you on hold for just one moment, please."" and she pipes up real loud ""I""M A LADY!!"" I reply ""Yes Ma'am, I do apologize about that, we have some old phones here, one moment please."" I press the hold button before she can chime in again.

I find the GM and let him know that there is a lady (so he doesn't make the same mistake I made) on the phone claiming that we gave her food poisoning and wants to talk to the store manager, the look on his face was priceless, his eyes rolled with such furious anger I thought they were not going to come back. 

This was my bosses end of the conversation: ""This is ShoGunzalez's boss, how may I help you?""

1373905232.0,153,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,1iciav,I was sent to what was almost definitely a robbery/murder/raping/jumping (X-Post from r/letsnotmeet),186,33,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1iciav/i_was_sent_to_what_was_almost_definitely_a/,"So I work at a pizza place, usually inside as my insurance does not cover claims when driving for business, but occasionally I will cover a delivery shift for one of the drivers because the money is good. 



Our delivery area includes a few new development ""upper middle class"" cookie cutter neighborhoods (Bad tips), an older 1940s era village (Average tips), two apartment complexes (great tips), some trailer parks (Great tips or no tips), and a bunch of rural areas (Usually good tips). Not rural to the point seeing hundreds of stars at night, but enough that you couldn't hear your neighbors yell. 



So about a week ago I was covering a delivery shift, I come back to the shop feeling pretty good, I'm averaging $5 a delivery and they have all been pretty close, and check to see if I have anymore deliveries. I have one to an address I have never seen before (we have mostly semi regulars get deliveries so an address that doesn't seem the least bit familiar is odd) its out on one of the more rural roads, I ask the kid who took the order what was up because there were special instructions on the ticket. He says, ""They said go around back because the front door is not operational."" I'm like ok that's not *that* uncommon, people often want you to go around back, either they painted the door, the house shifted and its a bitch to open, or they are just hanging out back.



So as I'm driving out to the house and I get an odd feeling, I don't really like the idea of going to the back of some house out in the sticks. It would all be too easy for some thugs to order a pizza to an abandoned house (there are quite a few in the more rural areas) then jump the delivery guy. I figure i'll scope the place out when I get there and if it seems sketchy just call them and make some bull up about how its against company policy to go around back of houses to prevent robberies. 



As I am driving to the house I realize its towards the end of this road that gets less populated the further down you go, *great*. I'm pretty near the address and driving slow, I see this house abandoned looking and set back from the roads with no address and in a bunch of trees, I think, ""that house better not be it"" so I drive passed and check the next houses' address and lo and behold, that abandoned looking one was the right house....*shit*. At this point I am not super worried though because out in the boonies the standards of upkeep on your house are pretty low so a house in disrepair isn't unusual. 



So I double back to this house and pull into the drive way, at this point I am getting bad vibes, it just doesn't feel right. So I park my car at the very end of the driveway with the rear of the car on the shoulder so anyone passing by can clearly see it. At this point I call back to the shop and tell them I'm at this sketchy house and if I don't call back in four or five minutes call me and if I don't answer call the cops.



While I am on the phone I take a chance to take a good look at the house. It looks extremely abandoned and not just in disrepair. The driveway is crumbling, bits are gravel and there are weeds growing out of it. There is no mailbox, no trashcans, no car, no lawnmowers, no landscapaing, no kids toys, absolutely nothing in the yard. The yard hasn't been mowed in what looks like years, the house is total crap, the roof is all but falling apart, the siding *is* falling apart, the back deck which comes around the side is falling apart, the only part of the house that looks even a little bit decent is the allegedly non functioning front door. The windows are all shut (its 95 degrees and humid and this place does not have a/c) they all have the blinds or curtains shut, the few that aren't are actually boarded up. I don't even see any wires running to this house. Its not dark but is dusk and there isn't a sign of any lights on in the house. 



At this point I am starting to get pretty nervous, I am a 5'10"" male 180lbs, not in any great shape, but I did take karate for 10 years, so I'm not helpless, but I do try to avoid any sort of confrontation I can as I am mostly a pacifist. I'm not too concerned about getting robbed, no skin off my teeth its not my money. I mean I would rather not get robbed, but I'm mostly worried about getting jumped, or killed, its a fairly safe area but recently there have been some rather unsavory people moving in from the city. A big spike in home invasions and robberies, but more worrying a few stabbings and assaults. 



So its time to either nut up or shut up. I'm not just going to go charging in there like a fool so I get out my phone and call the number they gave when ordering, while I'm doing that I'm also getting the pizza out and make sure to leave my door open. A running car half in the road at an abandoned house with the door open looks suspicious right? I figure if shit goes down it might look out of place enough to make someone stop, not that there is really any traffic this far down the road. 



I am starting to walk up to the house while the phones ringing; it rings twice and then an automated message comes on. It says something along the lines of this phone number is associated with a internet texting app (one the free ones you download and let you send free texts from a different phone number over a data connection) I think it was Heywire. We have had issues with people using numbers from those services for pranks in the past. 



This is huge red flag, my heart is now pounding in my throat and my whole body is telling me to bail. I don't want to get a reputation for being a flaky bitch as a driver and lose any future delivery shifts, and that is why I have not bailed yet. So I'm just standing there holding a pizza looking at this house but not wanting to venture around to the back of it. I'm hoping that the resident will look out the window and come out by the road to get their food. So I am looking at the front windows checking for some sign of life. I see a blind go up on the one window next to the front door and a really creepy looking guy, with a hat pulled low and big sunglasses on is looking out. Remember he is in a completely dark house surrounded by trees, at dusk, there is no reason for him to be wearing sunglasses, I also see what appears to be a big guy standing behind him in the room, this could have been anything though. When he sees me looking me mouths something and he darts away presumably towards the allegedly broken front door. At this point I noped the fuck out. I had stayed pretty close to my car so it was only a few steps away so I jumped into the driver's seat and throw the pizza into my passenger seat, something I would never do since I am really anal about keeping my car clean. I slam it into reverse, before I get the clutch all the way in so I grind my gears a little, again something I never do. 



Without looking I simultaneously slam and lock my door, and floor it backwards onto the main road, slipping my clutch horribly but at this point I don't care I don't want to fuck around and risk a stall. I did not even check for cross traffic (really stupid on my part). I start to drive away and look back at the house, the screen door on the outside of the front door is now open but the front is still shut. The guy isn't out in the yard yelling wait come back or anything, he's just gone. So I pull over a little ways up the road to call back to shop and tell them I'm all good and I'll elaborate when I get back. 



The people never called back to inquire about their food, people usually call if their pizza is 15 minutes late and these people never got it so its really strange they didn't call. Pretty much confirming they were up to no good. After telling my co-workers about it we conclude it was definitely a robbery at the very least. So we put the address and phone number on our no deliveries list, and ate their pizza. I doubt I would have actually gotten murdered or anything. Robbed with maybe a gun pulled or a little roughing up yes, but it was still very unnerving, that I easily *could have* gotten into some serious trouble by just doing my job. Especially if the idiots picked a slightly less abandoned house to set up at.





Sorry for the for a relatively minor incident being so long, but hey I like to write even if I am not that good at it. Anyone who deliveries pizza be wary of situations like this, I looked into it and apparently it is a pretty common way to rob pizza guys. I'm pretty glad we did not end up meeting.



TL;DR I got sent on a delivery to an abandoned house, and was very close to getting robbed/attacked/murdered.

**Pistol-whipped to death**

During my second stint as a driver in my mid 20s a friend invited me to a friend of theirs Halo party.  Apparently this was a weekly thing where eight of them got together for some 4v4 action and some free-for-all death-matchs.  Having rocked Goldeneye for the N64 in college I figured I could pick up Halo pretty easy.

So after my shift is over I threw a pizza through the oven for myself (*perk of being a driver is my manager would allow us one free pizza at the end of our shift so long as we didn't waste too many toppings*). I figured a free pizza would be a nice token gesture for the host of the Halo Party and allowing my friend to invite me along.

Free pizza apparently equals instant popularity.

Being good at N64 games apparently equals nothing on the XBox.

When asked what my skills were I said I was pretty good with FPS games but was new to Halo.  A few minutes into the first round it was obvious I sucked.  End of the first round it was ""PizzaGuy: 0 kills - 15 deaths.""

The next round the 'pros' took to 'pwning' the 'no0b' by pistol-whipping me to death.  It was bad enough to get shot to death every round. It was even more humiliating to have zero kills and die 20+ times in a round without having been hit by a single bullet.

I was still a good sport about it.  I kept bringing the free pizza... they kept pistol-whipping me to death.  Finally after like four or five sessions I finally got my first kill.  They actually paused the game, gave me a standing ovation... ... ... then went back to pistol-whipping me.

A few more sessions and I got the hang of it and was registering an even K2D ratio.

Finally, after nearly three months, I topped the kill board.  It helped that there was a new new-guy and he was about as bad as I was when I first showed up.  After that round, a few celebratory beers, and a slice of free-pizza we went back to play.

For good measure I pistol-whipped the no0b a few times... Welcome to Halo Party night.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_14jv5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14jv5u/pistolwhipped_to_death_for_free_pizza_story_7/,

Since the Summer started and school's out, sales are down, tips are down and boy are stiffs up. I got 8 stiffs in one week, 3 in a night. Stiffs come with the territory but rudeness doesn't.

I work for Dominos, which will do ANYTHING to keep a customer happy, free shit, extra free shit, etc. Basically NOTHING a customer does is wrong in the eyes of Dominos.

I went to a house with two maybe ten year old girl answering the door. It's one of girl's Mom's credit card. Minors shouldn't sign for their parents card without permission legally even, but Dominos doesn't care. 
The little girls were laughing as soon as they opened the door.

""We ordered an hour ago, you're an hour late.""

""You ordered 28 minutes ago according to the ticket, less than 30 min.""

""No you were supposed to be hear at 4:30, it's 5:30.""

The girl behind her keeps laughing while first girl signs for credit card receipt, no tip, no total just a big name in 10 year shitty handwriting and she drew a big smiley face.

I see this before I've given her the food, I know I'm not getting tipped. I give her the pizzas and I started to walk away. 


""My Mom gave me this to give to you, but you're late so I'm keeping it.""

The little girl is holding up three dollars, waving them at me and laughing. I turned back towards my car, shook my head but didn't say a thing.

The second little girl then runs out of the house to the front of the drive way and yells ""RUN AWAY YOU WIMP!""

Now, I've had shitheads before but man oh man, that takes the cake. I returned to the store and asked my Manager for permission to call the House back and talk to an adult. 

I was going to be nice and ask if there was a mistake because the girls demanded I was an hour late. I really just wanted the parents to get aware of how they treated me and pocketed the three dollars.

My manager is cool, He knew it was bullshit but He wouldn't allow me to call them or He'd have to let me go. Corporate Dominos could find out and they'd fire me and him. I put in my two weeks notice the next day, I'm done working for tips. Life lessons learned.

It's the middle of Friday night dinner rush and I take a double out, one an address I've been to before, and the other a new address.  I take the familiar one first, as it was ordered first, then head to the new one.  I get to the street, and the address doesn't exist.  I go a little bit up and down just to make sure, because sometimes address numbers will be slightly out of order.  

Nothing.  

I then call the number associated with the order, and naturally they don't answer, so I leave my standard voicemail where I basically list the facts of where I am, what address I'm looking for, what time it is, and so on.  I hang around for about 2-3 minutes hoping for a call back, that never arrives.  As I'm starting to head back to the store, I get a wild hair to try something.  I always hate returning to the store with undelivered pizza because usually you still have to go back out when the idiot calls back.  So I decide to try the address on some nearby streets (tricky to get to because of how they're laid out), and lo and behold on the third street over I find what I'm looking for.

I bounce up to the door with a swing in my step because of the miracle I've just pulled off.  The wrong address, no answer from the phone number, and I STILL found their apartment.  I mention the address issue to the customers as they are paying me, and they are thoroughly unimpressed, and proceed to draw a line through the tip line on the receipt and tip me a gratuity of exactly $0.00.

I was seriously baffled at this.  They were so lucky to actually receive their pizza after giving us the wrong address (online order), and not answering their phone when I called, or even calling back when I left a message.

Monday afternoon, I was doing a cashier shift. During our lunch rush, I get a phone call and the lady asks for delivery. She then asks if we had any gluten-free items. I listed our items to her. She then asks me if we serve pancakes. Yes, pancakes. At a pizza store. I politely told her no, and she thanked me for my time and hung up. My manager told me that was a first time a customer tried ordering pancakes at our store.

At my store, same day, we serve samples outside to get customers in during our dead periods. I'm outside sampleling, my co-worker is inside dealing with a customer, and my manager is just chilling, sitting next to me. This woman, maybe in her late 40's, early 50's, comes up to the table outside. I ask her if she would like to try a sample. She tells me wants to order a slice of pizza. A bit of silence goes by and my manager is just watching this go down. Finally I figure out she was trying to place an order with me and I'm a little dumb-struck. I tell her that she needs to go inside to order. After she leaves, I just start laughing and my manager just says out loud ""What the fuck is going on today""?

Last story happened to my co-worker. He was working as a cashier and a customer places an order for a personal size cheese-pizza. We hand out local-employee discounts for anyone located in the strip-mall we're located at and she requests said discount. She says she works at the sun-glasses vendor just on the other side of the food-court. No one knows what she is talking about. My co-worker says ""What vendor?"" She then flips the fuck out and starts yelling at him and saying that she is going to write a bad review online if she doesn't get her discount.

Tonight: Shit Got Weird. ,184,32,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/18vx9i/tonight_was_my_fourth_shift_as_a_delivery_guy_ive/,"It started out as any normal delivery that I'm used to so far in my short existence as a delivery guy. Delivery expert. Whatever. 

I had to go to a block of apartments that sit right on the border of the suburb furthest away from the store. ""Good"", I thought, that gives me time to sit back and drive, play some music, etc etc - the reason I love this job. There was stormy weather, and while the sky was only partly cloudy, lightning still occasionally illuminated the world around it for a flash of a second.

In retrospect, I think it was something to do with the weather.

I get to where I have to go, and this apartment building is huge - it's the biggest one in the area. I wouldn't call it a skyscraper but it's pretty big. Just this giant monolith in middle-class suburbia. I go to the front door, it's locked. Fair enough. Printed out on the back of some A4 sheet of paper from a book there's a message : LIFT AT THE REAR.

Okay, simple.

I go to the rear, and there's another door with the apartment numbers, the typical buzzer. ""Fancy"", I thought. I bell apartment 68  and there's no response. This sounds like bullshit but I swear to god, there was just some weird low vibrating noise with this raspy noise over the sound of it. Maybe they killed a horse and taped it's last words, I don't fucking know. I shrugged it off. 

Eventually, this lady talks to me. ""Yeah come up"" is what she says. I'm starting into the black little dome that protects the camera. I want her to see I'm harmless, just the pizza guy. It works.

I get into the elevator and look at the floor layout. Apartment 68: Floor 13. Good fucking sign of things to come.

I swear, all of this is true.

I get to the apartment and knock. Before my hand even leaves the door it gets violently pulled open and a puff of dust comes out of the space where the chain lock is attached to the wall. through the small gap of the door that's open I can see a girl about 17 years old looking at me. Someone says something from inside the apartment in another language, and she gets really angry. She paid by credit card so I asked her to get a pen to sign her signature.

She starts screaming at the other person, 

""the pen is by the sink""

""no the sink""

""ITS RIGHT FUCKING THERE"" 

She gets it, we do the thing. I hand her the shit. I try to make idle chit chat but she doesnt want a bar of it and doesnt respond. Fair enough. No tip, she closes the door in my face with no goodbye. Whatever. 

I get back to the elevator and then I hear ""COKE""! 
""COKE WE ORDERED COKE!""

She runs into the elevator where I am and almost puts her hands up to pin me by the shoulders. Then she stops herself. Awkward pause.

Damn it all, she did order Coke. I forgot to bring it with me from the store. So I told her that I'd go down to the servo and buy a bottle of coke (we're told to do that, dunno if that's the same in the states im in australia). When I get back from the servo she's standing out the front of the elevator on the ground floor holding a dough rolling pin. She says ""thanks a fucking lot"" and tears it off me, before she goes back into the elevator. 

I shit you not, when she opened that elevator door, there was some hell weedy looking guy in there. She said to him, ""where are you going? come back with me"" and the guy flinched and made this face like he really didn't want to be there, but she sort of half-serious half-jokingly threatened him with the rolling pin and he reluctantly gets back into the elevator.

The last I saw of her was her eyes staring at me as she stood completely still and looked at me with discontent, not breaking eye contact after the elevator door closed. I could feel her gaze through the metal. It was fucked. 

The second order was in another block of flats, for a unit that didn't exist. When I tried calling the number listed nobody picked up and the answering machine message was silence for about 10 seconds, only interrupted by one word in the middle : ""speak"". 

I was only on for two hours tonight, and these two orders took up my entire fucking night. Such bullshit.

I told her that we were closing down shop for the night, trying to get outta here to go home, and that I would not make such a large order this late at night. 



She basically told me that if we were still open, that I had to take her order, and I said we had just closed, then she replied ""Aren't you open until 1am?"" to which I said ""We stop taking orders at 1245am and it's 1245 right now, you're asking me to put everything back together, pull out stuff that we have put away for the night, so I can make 15 pizzas right away. If you ask me for 1 or 2 simple pizzas, I can make those real quick and get them out to you ASAP, but 15 pies will take time and we are about to close, we would like to close so we can go home too."" her response was ""I get that..."" (she tries psyching me out) ""But what if I order online?"" I reply ""I can't stop you from ordering online, if you get the order in and it shows up here, I will have to cancel it because we require 72 hours notice for any orders with 15 pizzas or more"" (this is actually true, we do require this notice for staffing purposes) 



So then she gets frustrated ""So you just don't want to make this food for me, huh?"" and I go ""Nope, I simply refuse."" and her parting oh so sarcastic words ""Oh... well thank you VEEERY much you've been SOOOOO helpful."" and I, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of having the last word, then reply ""You're welcome, thanks for choosing mypizzashop, have a good night *click!*""




UPDATE: Turns it out it was a setup. The area managers were calling all their stores late to put in large orders right before close to see what would happen, they even have a voice recording!! I was texted by my general manager that I have to be in a managers meeting tomorrow so I can get my ass handed to me. The thing is, I am still a manager-in-training, I have completed as much of my training on my own that I can complete and the rest is up to them to finish it with me so that I can get restaurant certified, until then I am not supposed to be running shifts alone because I am ""in training"". I have on more than one occasion reminded my general manager that I would like to finish my training, and it has yet to happen. I still get paid the training wage and I have been a shift manager for a few months now, I've been running shifts on my own only after a week or so of training. I was told that we required a 72-hour notice for orders of 15 pizzas or more. I'm upset that this would happen because I consider myself a good manager, I take pride in what I do, and I do my best to do the best job I can. If they want to come down on me for this, that's fine, I'll face the music like a man, but they will have to hear me out too, whether they like what I have to say or not.



UPDATE #2: I no longer work for PJI, I went straight to Domino's as soon as they showed me the door, Domino's told to me apply online and they would hire me straight away since they need experienced people. For all you haters saying that I suck or have a bad attitude, I would love to see you do what I did for them for 8.50 an hour. I come in early, stay late, most of the time I do this off the clock. I do a 100% inventory count every night no matter how late I may stay.

[awkward pause]

Friend: ""You can use a credit card and pay over the phone and I'll wait to see if it goes through, then give you the pizza.""

Guy: ""I don't remember my credit card number, and I can't find my wallet anywhere.""

Friend: ""Okay, well I'm sorry to say I can't give you this pizza if you can't pay for it.""

Guy: ""Listen, can't you just give me the pizza? I am having a rough day without my wallet and I order from you guys all the time, [ friend's mind: *sure you do* ] can't you cut me some slack?

Friend: ""Absolutely not, sorry sir. If you have a problem with this feel free to call back and ask for the boss. I can wait here for five more minutes if you'd like.""

Guy: ""You're done for mister. Keep your pizza, I'm calling your boss, good luck paying your bills now because [actual quote] ""your ass is grass, and I'm the lawn mower.""

My friend had a nice laugh over it with his boss while eating some free pizza.

""   Following the script like the corporate robot I am.


""Hi there you deliver to the *generic hotel* correct?"" 


""Yes we do, this will be a delivery then?"" 


""So this might the weirdest order you've ever received."" 


I responded curiously ""Well shoot.""


""I just spoke to someone at the RiteAid acrossed the street from you and they carry ping pong balls, would you deliver us some ping pong balls for 30 dollars, you're a delivery driver right?""


30 dollars as I thought to myself the only driver in the store.   That would make my night.    ""Hold on sir,  let me ask my GM."" 

""Hey GM  can I deliver ping pong balls to a customer at the radison, he says the rite aid carries them he offered me 30 bucks""  ""Go for it. "" my GM replied.


""Sure I can do that for you,  What would you like to order today?""


Turns out the customer just wanted ping pong balls.   I took his information my GM charged him our standard delivery fee and I took his order after my first one.   Delivered them to him without a hitch, easiest 28 dollars (2 bucks for the balls)  I've ever made. 


8 minutes before closing the customer calls back for a second time I answer the same way and he exclaims ""Hey punkingindrublic, what time do you close?""

""In 8 minutes, or midnight"" I respond


""Hey we ran out of beer we were wondering if you knew a place to get any?""  The customer responded quickly


""Well this late you'd have to go to a bar,  its gonna be a little expensive about a dollar a beer for carryout""  


""Oh geeze, you know what could you bring us some like 3 cases worth?   We'll give you a 130 dollars.""


""I can't do that while working luckily we close soon,  what could I get for you? ""   


""Anything light beer would work,  preferably miller lite.   I'll meet you outside around the back,  about how long?""


""About half an hour.""  The thought of making another 50 dollars of this guy was unbelievably exciting.  I was all but jumping up and down.

I took my last delivery for the night and came back the GM knew my plans and already mopped the floor for me.  I called my roommate up and told him to bring me a shirt that we were gonna go make some money.   He showed up 10 minutes later,  We went to the bar,  purchased the brews and off we went greeted by the customer outside.

We exchanged money (unfortunately he skimped down to 105) and invited us to come drink with him and his colleagues.

Got down to the private room meeting room of their hotel and was greeted by about 10 milfs dancing around listening to crappy music and a bunch of middle aged dudes.  We hang out for about 15 minutes until the middle aged dudes start getting into drunken brawls.   My room mate and I looked at each other and bailed.   Easiest 50 dollars I've ever made.

TL;DR  Guy paid 30 bucks for ping pong balls on a delivery,  Then called back later for a beer delivery.   Paid 27 bucks for some beer while I'm off the clock with my room mate.   Join their party only to be greeted by some hot milfs and their husbands fighting.

I just wanted to share a short version of my story and wish you all the best.

I started delivering pies when I was 18, as a way to get me through college. Well, things didn't work out exactly as planned and one day I woke up at 30 years old and said ""Holy shit, where did the time go?"" While I've enjoyed my time on the road, I decided that it was time to make a change in my life and go back to school. I picked a trade school, because I enjoy mechanical work and the program (HVAC/R) was only 9 months long. As a job, delivering pizzas has been pretty great to me over the years, but it hasn't been anywhere near what I would call a steady income. I just couldn't live week to week anymore, sometimes making $400 over the weekend, and sometimes making $40. I'm married now and my priorities have changed a bit. Bills get more expensive and I've been through at least 7 cars in the last 12 years.

So today was the day, I got a new job and put in my notice to my employer. It's hard to believe, but this is finally happening. I just wanted to let everyone on /r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy know that I will definitely still be a subscriber to this sub, and I will continue to read your stories and sometimes share mine.

One day, a Saturday if memory serves, a customer had a whinge about the pizza she'd just picked up. It didn't have enough topping for her and she was convinced we were ripping her off out of corporate greed. I took a look at the thing and saw right away what she was whinging about. It was overtopped, as we were still having trouble training out a bad habit of overtopping that some of the kids picked up from an old manager, but with obviously more on one side of the thing. Before I could offer her a refund, she demanded that we make her a new one. So I decided that if she wasn't happy with the amount of topping, I'd make the pizza myself. To exact specifications.

This was in the middle of the Saturday evening rush, so as I worked, there were about half a dozen teenagers buzzing around me, trying to keep up with the rush, while I plodded along, taking my time, meticulously measuring out everything. I used a knife to level off the sauce to make sure she got exactly one spoodle full. I weighed the cheese pinch by pinch, to ensure she got not a single grain more or less than she'd paid. Took great care to spread it evenly over the thing. Then I went through each topping, weighing each one to the gram, at some points breaking up bits of capsicum to ensure that my measurements were perfect. I made sure that the toppings were evenly spread, to the point of counting the bit per slice to ensure that each would be as close as I could make. Finally, I put a metal peg on the pan and popped it in the oven.

Over the other side, I grabbed a fresh blade and a box, taking the pizza to another bench to cut. I spent as long as I could, making light impressions to guide the final cut, so I could get it as accurately centred as possible. The only way I could have been more precise was if I'd used a protractor or something, which I did contemplate briefly. This thing was one of the best pizzas I'd made. My franchisee was there at the time and wished he'd had a camera, as it was so textbook perfect. I boxed the thing up and took it over to her.

At this stage, she had been waiting a good 25 minutes for the remake. When I offered it to her, she grabbed it out of my hand, opened it up and scrutinised it. I saw her teeth clench and could tell she was about to arc up. Before she could open her mouth, I leaned over and told her that I'd made that pizza to exact specifications, weighing each individual topping to ensure that she didn't get a single gram less than she'd paid for. She looked at me, the gears in her head grinding as she tried to think of something to say, then huffed, spun, hunched her shoulders and stomped off. 

The pizza she rejected, which was still warm by the time I go it to the manager's desk, was dripping with the sweet flavour of victory. ",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_1hwwh7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1hwwh7/complain_to_me_and_ill_give_you_exactly_what_you/,

Backstory: In high school, I was an in store grunt, working for a surprisingly corrupt store manager who we will call Brian.  How he kept his job for so long is beyond me (he was there before I started and was still there after I left, so at least 3 years).  Dude would 'float' money from the till, some times hundreds of dollars for a week or 2.  He didn't care what we did, as long as we did enough work to keep customers off his back and didn't step on his toes with his shady dealings, he was pretty cool with us.  Names have been changed to protect to protect the innocent

Anyway, we could get away with pretty much anything, which was pretty evident by the drivers we had.  It was not uncommon for them to come to work high.  I know some of you will ask why I didn't report it and the answer was I was 16 and liked being paid to do whatever the fuck I felt like.  Also, free pizza and soda whenever I wanted--on or off the clock.  It was a sweet job and I didn't want to ruin it.  Also, amazingly no one was hurt, so that was good enough for me.

So, with the back story out of the way, one day, a driver (Mac) comes in and says he's selling.  Dude whips out a Harold and Kumar size bag of weed (Not quite [this big](http://i.imgur.com/4XBFF.gif), but if memory serves, it was at least [this big](http://concernedbutpowerless.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/kumar_1.jpg)).  Mac was not the most intelligent person and would frequently come in and tell stories that started with ""so I was high on acid/pcp/mushrooms and ________"".  He figured it would be a good idea to leave his stash in the shop while he was on his delivery runs.

Unsurprisingly, it went missing while he was on a run.  Dude started flipping out and complained to the manager.  Brian called him a retard and asked him what he thought would happen if he flashed a bag like that in the store and left it unattended.  They got into a pretty intense argument and Mac ends up walking out and never coming back.

A few days later, the drivers are packing their pipes/bongs from a giant bag of weed.  No one would admit to stealing the bag and Brian got a cut of the ""profit"", so there was no investigation or punishments.

There will be more stories to come as I get time to recount them.  Not sure how many of them there will be in total, but having worked there about 3 years, I should be able to get at least a few.  For the next few weeks, there was very little stress around the shop.

Backstory:
I work for a place in Austin, Texas. Generally a pretty nice town. Delivery area is split into three sections: West/Tarrytown (mostly single-family homes, almost everyone in this section has a six-figure income), downtown (mostly affluent highrises, though there is one project tower and we frequently deliver to some service employees that don't tip for shit), and the East Side. The East Side is a total crapshoot; you get the rich white hipsters tipping you big with daddy's money, the older folks in the single-family homes that tip well, project residents that sympathize with your service-sector plight, project residences that don't give a fuck and won't give you a dime.

While nobody really likes going east, we all do it. There are a few places we're more wary of than others. When I started last year, my manager wouldn't accept deliveries from these places after dark. New manager came in, and the DM more or less forced us to start accepting deliveires from them.

The particular place this story is about is the Elm Ridge Apartments. It's a large apartment complex, completely dark, without police presence. I had been there once before, and the customer threatened to stab me because the pizzas were ""cold"" (they weren't). One the way back to the car a man approached me and asked if I was looking for a hook-up. I noped the fuck out of there and told my manager I would not be going back. At least one other driver had a similar experience. 

Today, she wants me to go there. I told her there was no way in hell I was going to do it. She gave me the option to either take the run or to not work for the company anymore. Welp, here I am sitting at home.

What do you think, Reddit? Did I do the right thing?

I delivered for a late night joint. Took a pizza to a hotel and got chatted up by a not so pretty lady, ended up getting a $7 tip on a $25 order. Bangin, thats all I thought.

Two weeks later I get requested for a delivery on a slow night, showed up at the door and it was the same lady. Turns out she is a trucker and rolls through town about every 2 weeks. She asked me to come in and one thing led to another and she tickled my gentles, then gave me $10. Mind=Blooowwwnn.

This continues for my duration at the pizza joint. I leave the place for greener pastures and break it off with her. Some time passes and she offers to pay me to have dinner with her and bump uglies. Enter Godmode.

In college, I delivered extremely late-night orders at an infamous party school.  Needless to say, I have a treasure chest of stories to share.  For many varying reasons, I have not shared many of these stories and felt this would be a great outlet.  I created this throwaway account because I am a little more grown up now, with and a grown-up job, and I'd prefer to conceal some specific details.*

**Background:**  These stories take place on a large college campus that is infamous for being a drunk-party school.  We delivered food extremely late, well after the bars had closed.  For this reason we were a campus favorite.  The place where I worked was laid back but you were expected to bust your ass.  My first day I remember being grilled by the manager on whether I smoked pot.  I thought I was being called out on my first day for looking like a stoner.  NOPE, her point was ""If you're going to do that stuff, do it at home.  Don't bring that shit here.""  That same day the store owner was firing a bee-bee gun at an employee in the store.  He purposely missed and hit the giant stack of canned sodas.  Soda was squirting everywhere and the owner had to clean up the mess.  This would by symbolic of our work environment.  At that moment I knew this was going to be the best job i'd ever have... and it was.  

... Like many of my stories, this story begins with me being high.  Many of my ""clients"" are drunk college kids and they all think it's hilarious to invite the delivery driver to smoke up or offer him a beer.  I was the delivery driver that would almost always accept just to see their heads explode.  Sometimes the smoke session was the tip, which sucks, but most of the time it was just the cherry on top.

... So it is 2:30am and the bars have just closed.  I arrive to the next house and call the cell number on the receipt.  I see through the window that the guy is passed out on the couch and his phone is ringing.  I'm not about to drive back to work with this order undelivered, so I open the front door.  (This type of thing is not uncommon where we live, so no one freak out.)  I gently wake the guy up and he looks up at me with the happiest glazed-over eyeballs like I am drunk-Santa.  

""I need for you to sign the receipt,"" I said.

""Thank you, dude! I completely forgot I ordered this,""  the guy said as his drunken and gigantic roommate walks in the front door.

Perhaps it was because I woke him up or he's drunk, he tips me well.  As I leave the front porch I hear the gigantic roommate yell...

""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY ROOM!!!""

The order I just delivered went FLYING through the window.  I looked inside the window and see my defenseless customer being held in the air by his shirt as the his gigantic roommate runs with him across the room and slams him into the wall.

""WHY DID FLIP EVERYTHING IN MY ROOM UPSIDE DOWN,"" the roommate yells.

I look across the street and see one of my delivery colleagues, let's call him Pat, standing in the street, making a delivery to the neighboring party. Pat is a short and slightly overweight Asian kid with a major affinity for marijuana.  Everyone from the neighboring party is laughing hysterically at this domestic altercation.  

Now, let's recap where everyone is at this moment.  I am standing on the front porch.  My customer lost his delivery through the window and is fighting with his roommate in the house.  Pat is standing in the street, beside his car, making another delivery across the street to a party.  The Party-goers across the street are scattered in the front yard.

*(This is where the story takes a weird and unbelievable turn, but I swear it happened)*

As we're all standing there, a white Dodge Neon comes racing down this rarely-trafficked street on a collision coarse with Pat.  At the last second the car slams on the breaks as Pat jumps in the air and rolls over the hood of the car.  Everyone, including the two fighting roommates freeze in disbelief.  Pat is perfectly fine but kinda in shock about what happened.  The driver-side window opens up and another delivery driver from the same store is laughing hysterically and takes off to his next delivery.  Pat is dumbfounded but laughing and gets back in his car as well.

Everyone else is stunned.  

Later that night we all met up at the store and have a huge laugh over what had happened that night.  I eventually took a new order back to the original customer that lost his through the window.  It was the least I could do for him giving me a good tip.  From that day on, that customer tells me the same story every time he saw me.

**EDIT - TL:DR; I have tons of stories.  I was high often when delivering.  I delivered to drunk college kids.  Once roommates got in a fight, delivery goes through window.  Other delivery driver hit by car driven by another delivery driver.  Everyone is freaking out.

I recall one night, I was delivering a pizza to house I'd been to before. A nice woman lived there, and she always tipped well.
I get there, run up the stairs and ring the doorbell.
The front door swings open, and there stands the angriest looking man I've ever seen. He takes the pizza from my hands, and opens the box. I'm about to tell him how much he owes, and he cuts me off.   

""This pizza is all messed up."" 

 
I ask him to let me see what he means, and he shoves the box towards my face. I look and see that the pie was made too large for the box, and the crust is folded over where the box hinges. I start to explain and I'm cut off.  


""YOU DAMN KIDS AND YOUR FANCY CARS WITH BUCKET SEATS. MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T DRIVE SO FAST MY PIZZA WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE SHIT.""  

At the moment he finishes his sentence, the lady that I usually deal with walks to the door. She asks what the problem is, and he starts to spout off about how the pie is messed up. She looks at the pie, looks at him, and laughs.   

""[John], the pizza's too big for the box. They gave you more than they should've, so instead of screaming at the boy, apologize,thank him, and give him his money."" 

 He handed me the money and stormed away. She smiled, apologized, and gave me a few more dollars from her pocket.

Here's mine.

So, I was working in Pennsylvania for a small mom and pops type pizzaria, amazing crew working there and the customers were also usually very good. The area was a mix between big well to do developments and working class apartments/housing so you either got the ""I'm rich and don't care to throw money at you"" or the ""I'm a working person too and will give what I can"". So as you can imagine it was a pretty cushy job.

Except for the naked guy.

Every other week he would call and order something, and every time we would all try to make sure not to be the one to have to take it. But  usually I got stuck with it. Now this was an unusually deceptive customer, on the phone you'd think you were talking to someone who taught a class on the proper etiquette of conversing over the phone. But when you got there it looked like you were walking into the crime scene that was about to be you getting raped.

Now sometimes this crazy bastard wouldn't answer the door after calling, then he'd wait afew hours and call back complaining that his food wasn't there. And even if we went back he wouldn't answer the door or his phone.

Every single time, and I mean every single damn time that I delivered food to this guy he was dressed only in a Philly Flyers towel, dripping wet, and reeking as though he'd just covered himself in a bucket warm diarrhea. I lost so many pens when I went there because I just didn't want them back after he handled them, what's worse is when he'd pay in cash........Guess where he kept it. Yup. And to make it worse he'd fish around for it. And the icing on the already terrible rape flavored cake was that he'd act like he was going to hand you the money, then pull it away abit like he's playing keep away with it.

The funny part I suppose was that eventually we recognized his number on the caller id and could just take the order, and the first time we did that he said to me, ""Oh, yah you guys remember me. I order there all the time. You must remember that I'm the Flyers fan.""

Today we will hear of Mr. Salami, and the generocity the man gave to all of us at the store.

Once upon a time, like 3 years ago, a guy ordered a salami pizza and 6 20oz cokes. He lived in a large community in which had 2 entrances and literally over 30 miles of roads inside in which we had to travel at 35mph or the rent-a-cops would get us and call out store.

The total drive to this mans house came to about 10 miles round trip and took close to an hour due to having to drive into the back of the housing community. 

My first delivery was enlightening. I pulled up onto a nice house. I walk to the door, ring the bell, and out comes Mr. Salami. He was covered in stained clothing from head to toe and smelled like ass. He was one of those guys you wanted to avoid getting close to at all costs. 

He signs his receipt, turns, and walks away without a word. No tip. So, I lost a bit of money on the delivery but whatever. 

Fast forward a few months. We have been getting weekly orders from Mr. Salami and no one has gotten a tip from this man, and everyone says he is rude to them as well.

I get the unlucky draw and have to deliver to him again. So, I pull up with his drinks and salami pizza. It had been a terrible tip day and I was apparently obvious in my dislike for this man because he spoke for the first time to me. This is the convo as close as I remember it. This took place directly after he handed me the cc slip with 0 in the tip spot.

MS: You wanna know why I don't tip you guys?

Me: Actually, yes, I would love to know why.

MS: Because you don't do anything to earn it, you don't come to my table and refill my drinks or bring me my food on a plate ready to eat. All you do is sit in your cars and bring me my overly expensive food and expect a handout.

Me: While we may sit in our cars all day, it costs us money to bring you your food. We all PAY to bring this food to you.

MS: Not my fault, get a better job. Blame your president, your parents, your boss. Whoever you want, but it is in no way my fault you took the job.

This is when I leave. I was half expecting to get a complaint, but he never did. However I did inform all of the drivers what I was told, and that man never recieved a hot pizza again. Petty? Absolutely. But it felt good to get something out of the gas money we had to waste to take this to him. We generally would get a double and make sure he was the last to get his.

I ignore them and step to the door and knock. The customer calls, ""One second!"" and the guys are getting seriously close now.

I got to the house, there was room on the curb so I park there.  I always turn the car off, but I leave the keys in the ignition, my thought process being that if they start it, maybe I will have time to get to the car before they start moving away.  That being said, I was up at the door and apparently one of their friends was on the side of the house where I couldn't see them.  He ran out to my car and must have had it in gear, e-brake off and feet ready because one second after I heard my car start, it was moving.  I chased after him.  He got about 80 feet and stopped.  I caught up to the car, grabbed the guy through the driver side window (which I had left down) and pulled him out through it.  I slammed him down.  By this time, his friends had caught up as well.  They see me slam him down on the asphalt and stupidly threaten to call the cops on me for assault.  I calmly tell him to go ahead.  He proceeds to pull out his phone and start dialing.  I then, nonchalantly, as if just to myself, say, ""I wonder what they will be more interested in, a DUI and grand theft auto, or somebody defending their property."" He hangs up.

It came with good hours, was the easiest job I've ever had, allowed me to cruise around in my fun to drive car blasting music and enjoy the summer. Getting paid in cash each and every night is also the shit.

But you didn't come here to hear about how great a job being a pizza guy so, so here's a story:

Most of our business came from catering to local businesses, doctor's offices, country clubs, company outings, golf fund raisers, etc. We had one HUGE pizza delivery to a local country club that was hosting a swim meet for all of western new york. There were going to hundreds of kids and thousands of people, so they ended up ordering about 25 Large pizzas to be delivered on Saturday and then again on Sunday.

We're normally pretty lightly staffed, so I was the only delivery driver on saturday. I work my ass off to get them the 25 pizzas, collect a decent tip, and go on my way. I get called into work the next day to do the second delivery, because they're really busy and the scheduled driver is already behind.

So, I help the guys cook, box, and load up 25 more large pizzas that the rest of the staff came in early to make. I get them in my car drive over there, and actually can park reasonably close to the pool. As I start unloading the pizzas, I notice that there is only 10-15 people at the pool and none of them seem to be doing any sort of organized activity. This was stark contrast to yesterday when there was a sea of people.

As I get the last pizzas setup on a table, a lifeguard who had been looking at me confused walks over and asks me what the pizzas are for. I tell him they were for the swim meet, same thing as yesterday. He tells me that there is no swim meet today, and goes to grab the pool manager. The pool manager comes out and informs me that there is indeed no party today, and they did not order the pizzas. I call the pizzeria to explain the situation, and it turns out the original person who took the order wrote it up but didn't tell anybody, and when they called back to make some adjustments another order was written up, because we had no record of the first.

So I load all the pizzas BACK into my car, drive to the pizzeria, and at this point we realize we're stuck with 25 pizzas that are starting to get cold. People are furious that they came in to work early and spent hours slaving over the pizzas for absolutely no reason, not to mention the fact that I got no tip/payment because the delivery was faked.

We end up letting the staff take a pizza each and then gave some away to the next few customers that came in. I grabbed about 5 and dropped them off at my other job (Best Buy) on the way home, but they still ended up throwing away about 10 pizzas, and didn't get any money back on any of them

Now for those that don't work at Jimmy John's, that is 350 sandwiches, no small order by any means.

So my coworkers spend 2+ hours making these platters, they had two drivers deliver all these sandwiches, and when it's all said and done guess what the tip was? Nothing. Not a single penny was given for a tip. And the worst part was the teachers made our drivers set up all the platters once they got to the school.

I used to work for an excellent family-operated business in TX that specialized in delivering food FROM restaurants TO residential houses, apartments, hotels, and thensome. It was a really nice business to be in since I didn't have to cook, nor do any of the typical stuff. I should also mention that it paid excellently- I wasn't reimbursed for gas, but made up for it by receiving 80% of the delivery fee (which was sometimes a pretty penny).

Well, I'd gotten an order to go to a restaurant on the border of our delivery zone. I was delivering some sushi (not too uncommon) to a nearby apartment complex. I was pleased when everything was going as planned, and even more pleased when the apartment complex was numbered well. I'm sure most delivery guys know the feeling when you're looking for apartment #2 only to see the sequence go 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 17?!

I get to the customer's apartment, I knock and she opens up the door.

And it's my ex girlfriend.

The one ex whom I'd left on good terms was staring me in the face and I'm holding the food she'd ordered and graciously tipped. We weren't expecting one another at all, but she's quick to invite me in, so we could talk.

And so we talked.

And then we had sex.

And then after some lingering cuddling, I excused myself back to work and explained to my boss that the apartment complex was bonkers, no numbers were where they belonged and that I needed a map to find the front gate- he passively agreed with me and I got to my next order.

I'd to whatever i could to make sure i was getting paid. I'd check the addresses of the upcoming orders and try and time things to get orders i knew were to good tippers, drive faster or slower to avoid something that would take me out of the way or have me going to a known bad tipper.

Well one Monday i couldn't avoid this order. This was from a regular that lived on the very farthest edge of our delivery area in a seedy part of town and never ever tipped. Ever. Not even the change. He ask for all his money back down to the penny every time. And the dude had money, he'd always answer the door in some expensive track suit too. Well i got his order along with a couple on the way to take the sting out of things. This was in the middle of rush, so by the time i would get back to the shop, the orders would have come and gone,so not only am i going to not be tipped, I'm going to lose out on a lot more money just making this order. This greatly upset me. All the drivers were sick of this clown and his penny pinching ways! So i decided to get some revenge.

Did i mention its late fall, early winter? Did i also mention this takes place in Michigan? No? Well both of these are true.

So i drop off my other 2 orders and Mr.Regular is last of course. I take his pie and wedge it up under the passanger side windshield wiper and start my trip to his house in the ass end of nowhere. I pull it about a mile from his house and its ice cold. Now there's no way he's going to accept this super icy ice cold box. Being the quick thinker that i am i put the pie on passenger side floor and blast the floor heat. It should be noted that the heater in a 87 Honda Civic should have a setting called blast furnace. I get to his house, and the box is piping hot and the pizza is ice cold.
Head up to the door, everything is normal, he demands his exact change. I look him in the eye and say, ""Thanks man. Much appreciated."". On the surface I'm thanking him for the business but we both understood i was thanking him for nothing.

Well by the time i get back to the shop, he's called in and actually got to speak to the owner. He was livid that it was so cold! I could actually hear him a few feet away from the phone receiver. So the owner asks me, ""Snowreaper, whats up with this guy? Says his pizza is cold."" I told the owner, ""You know what? Fuck that guy. He lives on the edge of our delivery area and he never tips. Not ever. And he didn't tip when i went out there, so he should be happy he's getting a $7 pizza."" Another driver piped up and backed me up saying he hated delivering to that guy and never got tipped ever.
The owner, bless that man, chewed out Mr. Cold Pizza! ""YOU NEVER TIP MY DRIVERS AND YOU COMPLAIN?!?! YOUR LUCKY WE STILL DELIVER TO YOU! IF YOU ORDER AGAIN AND I HEAR YOU DIDN'T TIP YOUR BLACKLISTED!!!"" and with that he hung up on him.
Took the guy a few weeks to work up the courage to order again, but by god, he tipped a buck and the change from then on.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_1f109o,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1f109o/so_you_dont_tip_but_your_a_regular_are_you/,

I've been enjoying your posts and up until yesterday haven't had one of my own to tell. I work the day shift with a woman named S, and basically all we have to do is prep food for the night rushes and do some lunch rushes when they come in. There have been a few days where I'm working night rush but not many. 

Yesterday, S took an order out for delivery in the middle of lunch rush. The phone rang and this old woman answered, who sounded like she was the crypt keeper here. Anyways, I'm on the phone with this woman and trying to understand what she's saying and I'm having just a horrible time figuring out what the hell she wants to eat. She's mumbling like Ozzy Osbourne and what she's saying just doesn't make sense.

She finally decides that she wants some wings and a root beer. So I ask for her phone number to look up her address in the computer. ""I can't give you my phone number, it's a federal thing."" Okay, so I ask her address. She gives me the address and before I can repeat the order to make sure I got everything right and to give her the total she says ""Stop asking dumbass questions,"" and hangs up.

So S comes back and I'm telling her about this lady. Turns out that she's bat-shit crazy. She thinks that the government is tapping into her phone calls and watching what she does. She goes around town telling people that her husband was a federal agent (he worked in town all his life at the local mills) and that her son is in the CIA (unconfirmed). I guess a lot of the guys in the shop will refuse to take her order and if she calls they'll start pressing buttons on the phone so she thinks her phone is being tapped into. S said this lady calls in all the time, asking phone numbers for other businesses in town, asking if we have ice cream (we never have had ice cream and never will) and asking if S will drive to the local ice cream shop, buy her a milkshake, and deliver it.

Last night was one of those nights were I worked in the day, went home for about a couple hours, and went back in at night. A guy named P was working and I was telling him about this lady. He said he had delivered to her before, and he told me this story about one particular deliver to her house:

He said that when he walked in the apartment smelled like cat piss (supposedly this is not uncommon for this woman). He put the pizzas down and was awaiting her payment when she spoke up and told him to make sure the government doesn't take his guns away, that it was the first step to controlling him. So P is thinking ""this woman is crazy, I can't wait to get out of here."" As P goes to leave she stops him in the doorway, makes a gun with her fingers, points directly at him and says, ""BANG! BANG!""

My next delivery, which i thought nothing of, was to some non-descript house in an average part of our delivery area. A 16 or 17 year old girl comes to the door.

(Story #10),126,16,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/18j809/my_most_awkward_deliveries_ever_backtoback/,"*So my last story was kinda heavy/serious and I am sure a few people are pissed off and will let me know it via a flood of heated comments.  I decided to balance that out with a levity.*

**Story #10: My most awkward deliveries ever... Back-to-back deliveries to a swingers’ orgy at a hotel**

This is the story of my two most awkward deliveries I ever had.  They were back-to-back delivers to a local hotel suite that was occupied by a bunch of swingers having a full on BDSM &amp; fetish-play orgy.

Midway through my shift I have to stop by one of the local hotels to drop off an order.  Not uncommon so I thought nothing of it.  I lived in a small rural farm town that was right off the interstate so there was a lot of through traffic.  We set up special deals with most of the hotels in town and it equated to a lot of orders.

Anyway, I walk down the hall and can hear some “weird” noises.  Muffled moaning, things hitting the walls, etc.  I’ve done my fair share of weird things in a hotel (*different stories for a different subreddit*) so I am not one to judge.  So I knock on the door matching the order number.  My first thought was that I was thankful it was not the room that all the weird noises were coming from.  I was just about to feel sorry for the occupants when the door opened.  I instantly went speechless.

Standing in front of me was a man in his late 40s or even early 50s in full black leather BDSM garb.  He was also wearing a collar which had a leash that was held by a big, I mean **big** (*trying to be polite here*), woman - also in full BDSM gear.  She flat out orders the guy onto his knees. Wordlessly he drops down.  She tells him to fetch the money, which he does while barking like a dog, and then hands it to me.  I was so thankful he didn’t use his mouth or ‘fetch’ the money from some unpleasant place on his master’s body.

At this point these are the only two people I see.  I count the money, hand dog-man the pizzas, listen to master-woman order him around, and then I **GET THE FUCK OUT** as fast as I can.

I get back to the store ready to tell my crazy store when the manager hands me an order.  I recognize it as the hotel and ask if there was a problem.  He comments that there was no problem it’s just the people *“worked up more of an appetite than they thought.*” I about threw up in my mouth when he said that.  Again, I wasn’t trying to judge but the thought of dog-man and his master ‘working up an appetite’ was not exactly a pleasant thought.

Reluctantly I get back in the car and head back to the hotel.  The guy at the desk gave me a knowing look and we had a moment of shared sympathy as I walked past.

When I opened the door the next time a different woman answered it in - *you guessed it* - some form of leather BDSM garb.  The thing was her tits were fully exposed.  If I had to guess I would say she too was in her late 40s early 50s.  Without being too graphic let’s just say gravity was not a kind mistress to her at all.

No joke she says, “I guess you don’t need a tip sugar,” and then proceeds to ‘wiggle’ her ‘breasts’ at me.

The worst part is behind her is a guy in a horse mask (*if I’m lying I’m dying*) being ridden by a older chick in leather chaps --- and nothing else.  The mean age of the two rooms had to be 50 something.

Keep in mind: small rural farm down.  That’s what I grew up in.  This kinda stuff was supposed to be ‘fantasy porn’ type stuff.  Not small town hotel stuff… well, I know different now.  Anyway, trying not to judge.  It was just “weird” to me at the time, that’s all.

Oh, later I found out that this swingers group was a regular yearly thing.  Last rumor I heard was they now pay to rent out the *ENTIRE HOTEL*.  That’s 100+ rooms of swingers.  Wow.

So anyway, that is the story of my two most awkward deliveries.

Naturally, I called the store on my co-workers behalf and talked to a manager about this ridiculous situation, who reacted as if I had told him that his driver ran over a leaf.  He did mention that he would call his driver, but hung up immediately after that sentence.  


After about 15 minutes, I told the girls to call the place themselves, as the non-delivery delivery driver had not shown up.  I guess the manager redeemed himself a little, as he was having the food remade for them.  


I have the upmost respect for delivery drivers (most of the time) because I've usually only had good experiences with them.  I mean, I've had a couple creepers deliver to my house, but that's when I magically disappear and make my husband answer the door.  


At work though, I've not had a bad experience until today with the various delivery drivers (and bikers) who bring us yummy, awesome food that brightens our shitty days.  I just couldn't believe this guy...does this happen more often than I realize?

How ever the most intriguing delivery that I ever had and wished I could have had a repeat delivery or two so I could further investigate their odd behavior. I was delivering to a fairly nice trailer park (seriously this place was pretty sweet) and had been there a few times before for different customers, I eventually find the address of the trailer(house?) that I'm looking for and it has all its lights off except for one dinky ""porch light"" that was actually just a crappy night light plugged into an outlet near the floor. So I approach the door and knock thinking someone just sent me on a wild goose chase but after about 20 seconds or so I hear a double clap to my left and kinda behind me. Startled, I turn around and see a pair of arms just from the elbow sticking out of the window that I hadn't noticed when walking up. They began to beckon me over. As I take the step or two over one arm retracts and reappears with cash for the pizza, so I placed the pizza on the open palm and grab the money from the other hand, give it a quick count ( exact amount in bills and change + 5 for tip) say thank you, the person does a curtsey of sorts with the box tilting it every so gently forward then, from what I could tell by their arm movement just sorta glided backwards into the dark... leaving me with the most "" Da Fuck"" sensation I had experienced up to that point. It was kinda freaky to me but also hilarious and when I asked my friends if they had delivered to that house but no one was sure. Man I wish I could of had a round at that place.

Not only do people think our work is a joke, our customers will outright abuse us sometimes.  Here's what happened a few hours ago on my closing shift.

I had a delivery to a hotel room sometime between 2 and 3 in the morning.  As soon as I stepped out of the elevator, I could smell the douche.  Doors 1123, 1125, and 1127 were propped open, and my customers were all talking loudly behind 1127.  I knocked on the door and I heard them continue to talk.  A couple of them are using fake Asian accents in a really offensive way (I'm Asian).  I knocked again, and although they noticed this time, they kept using the ching-chong voice.  

So I yelled through the door: ""Oh, you are going to look so stupid when you see how Asian the pizza girl is!""  Then they open the door.

""Oh my god, she is.""
""Wow she's hot too!""

And that's basically how the rest of the transaction went.  They paid in $2 bills, gave me $3, and some idiot was STILL using the Asian accent.  Then while I'm waiting for the elevator, the customer, holding his food, walks into the hallway and asks me if I'll dance gangnam style for him.  I leave.

I told my GM about it when I got back.  ""You should have thrown the tip back at them,"" he says, then sends me out on a double.

Nah, I'll keep my money, I thought, but I have to go get my self respect back...

I do my deliveries and then I go back to the hotel.  I storm across the lobby, go up the elevator, and approach two of the guys as they're leaving the room.

""I want an apology.""
They look confused.  One reaches for his money and asks if they tipped me, while apologizing.
""I got a tip.  I don't want your money, I want an apology.  It's 2012, that ching-chong bullshit doesn't fly anymore.""
""I... do apologize.""  A drunk guy yells in the background.  ""Go to bed, Brian!  I apologize for the whole room.""
""Good.""

Of course, as a delivery driver I have the wonderful chance to meet all sorts of interesting people at their homes on a day to day basis. Unfortunately, not all of these people are very smart, or apparently even considerate to delivery drivers or people in general. What happened was that I was going on one of my later night deliveries. A Saturday night at like 12:30 or so. And for the most part, we deliver to pretty affluent neighborhoods in my area, so I don't usually have any qualms about going up to people's houses. This was no exception, as it was quite a large house with sprawling lawn, long driveway, etc. But as I pulled up at the foot of the driveway and turned my lights off so I could walk my way up to the door, I see the door open and hear these words: ""Lucy, go get im!"" Lucy, as it turns out, is quite a large pit-bull. Now, normally I have no problems with dogs while on delivery. I once even received positive online feedback about how good I was with a customer's dog. But when one comes tearing at me barking and snapping I tend to freak out. Lucy proceeded to chase me around my car and up on top of it before the people realized it was the pizza guy. Although how they didn't know it was me before, I have no idea, as I have a giant glowing sign on top of my car. Anyways they finally called her off (although she continued to growl at me) and then the dad, whose voice I recognized as being the one who had set the dog on me, proceeds to then blame it on his kids, saying they must have let the dog out on accident. To top it all off they tried to pay with a check, which we do not except, kept me there for 15 extra minutes as they scrambled for cash and leaving me with a 30 cent tip. Not to mention I got back to the store and had two late orders I now had to take with 15 minutes to close, meaning I'd be there closing for an extra half hour or so. I don't get these people.

For those of you who have been following my series, this story takes place around the same time as part 2: the side business.

Having been working there around a year, I was the go-to guy for orientating the new people. We had a new girl start one day, and after introductions, I started to show her the ropes.  As we were preparing for the dinner rush, I heard some yelling from the other side of the store.  When I looked over, I saw the girl standing by the drink cooler, pointing at me and yelling ""Hey! Hey you! Boy!""

I stared at her for a few seconds, processing what she was saying.  I was 16 or 17 at the time and if she was actually older than me, it was only by a couple months.  Once I got my bearings, I told her something to the effect of 'You know, if you want to get my attention, just say my fucking name'.  Her response: 'I don't know it'.  After another few seconds of giving her the &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;, I reminded her of my name and went back to work.

This happened 2 or 3 more times that night, so the next day, before she got in, I told all the other employees to say my name anytime they talked to me, whether or not we were in the middle of a conversation.  She still didn't catch onto my name.  I felt like Homer Simpson trying to get Mr Burns to remember his name.

I decided to get my revenge on my way to work the next day.  I got everyone, the managers included, to call her anything but her name.  Over the course of the night, she was girl, sparky, sport, 'hey you', and any other nickname we could come up with.  We were going to continue this as long as it took for her to learn my name.  At one point, after a few days of this, she started writing her name in huge letters on her nametag and would yell 'MY NAME IS ___________""

She quit a week later. Never did learn my name, but she knew everyone else's.  What a bitch

I work at a family-owned restaurant as a delivery driver and cashier(at our store, you can sit down to eat). On this day, I was just cashiering and it was during our dead period so it was just myself and my manger, working. I was helping out a customer and had food to take out food so  by the time this mother and son came up to order, they have had a good while to decide what they wanted to eat. They come up, order some buffalo wings, and then they start to make their on salad. But this isn't just any other salad, it has to be the right salad. For *every* item the mom adds, she double checks with her son and mentions the nutritional value of it. Normally, I wouldn't care what they're adding to their salad but its already been about **11 minutes** up at the cash register. 

Yay! We're done with the salad two minutes later. Got all your veggies and meats in there? Good? Great. Now onto the pizza. Wait, we still need to decide how big of a pizza we wants, what kind of style(thin crust or deep dish) and what toppings to put on it. After about 4 more minutes of that, we're done with the order. I read their order back to them, read them their total, but wait, they don't want any meats anymore on their salad. OK, no problem. Finally done. 

Now remember this is a really hot day and I've spent a while with these customers. Finally, the mom gives her soon her credit card and says ""Alright, I need to go back my car real fast. **I left my dog sitting in the car**"" After I swipe the credit card, I'm just in disbelief that they managed to take that long ordering food and leave the dog in the car.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_1iz0oe,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1iz0oe/alright_i_need_to_go_back_to_my_car_real_fast/,

I'ts a sweet gig and in terms of *doing* the job I'm all good. Picked up a few good pointers on here - keeping spare drinks in the car, tucking a good pen behind your ear, and so forth. 

There's this regular customer - let's call him Gump - who calls our store almost nightly. He's living on a disability pension, or *something*, because he's unemployed but still has enough money to live comfortably on, as well as afford a modern apartment a block away from the riverfront. Still, I'm pretty sure he can't cook for himself, thus the regularity of encountering him.

We know each other by name and we always have a chat. He's perfectly lucid, but there are obvious complications there. For instance, he will not respond to you unless you park in his carport. It is **essential**. It's not like he ignores you in a rude way if you don't park your car inside his carport, he just doesn't know how to respond. I think. It's like your car needs to be there for the procedure to click in his head. I'm fairly sure he's agoraphobic. 

He's a really nice guy though. Occasionally he'll tell me this:

""Don't share too much information with people. People start to talk. People are like parrots. They talk and learn one thing and talk and then another one learns it and so on. Just don't tell anyone too much about yourself alright? Promise me.""

Apart from that, the guy's fine.

Here's my problem.

Up until recently, our store had an exclusive deal with him that nobody else got. He gets his concrete-set order of 2 tomato and cheese pizzas and a 1.25L coke and he gets that for $25 dollars, no one else does. It's just because he's so regular with the store. I was the driver told to tell him about that deal about 2 months back, which is when our rapport started.

Cut to this week, and a recent meeting has decided that he no longer gets the special. I just can't do it. I haven't made him pay twenty six dollars yet. I told him that the store wanted me to do it but I said I'd give him a deal. It obviously means a lot to him, and I worry that it's people like delivery drivers who are the only ones he deals with. He reminds me a bit of someone in my family who has similar problems so I just can't bring myself to basically tell him ""hey your appreciated customer loyalty had a time limit"".

The problem is, I have to make up for it, and on nights where I don't get tips (australian driver, have a base rate) it cuts into my own personal money. Albeit only a dollar fifty, but over time it adds up. It's the principle of the thing, but I'm not sure if its worth it.

I drive over to the other lady's house and she comes out with a 50 dollar bill. Fuck me. I have no change the only thing I have is that crisp hundo in my wallet. I explain this to her and she doesn't seem to be too distraught, just slightly confused. She's about 40 years old and seems to live alone. She asks what we can do. I told her that if she calls my store with a credit card they'll just charge her that way. She agrees and is very pleasant over the phone. She gets off and I confirm with my manager. She then asks how she can give me a tip and I told her that we can write it on the receipt of how much. She says just put a fiver on it. Nice. I made 10 bucks in the first 20 minutes of work and head back. Rest of the day goes accordingly. A few days later waiting for my schedule I notice that i'm not on it. I call the store and they tell me to come in at blah blah time and day. I get there and the new manager is there, not even the store owner. Telling me that i'm being fired because the lady who I didn't have change for a 50 for had written a long letter to corporate about how she wants my job taken from me etc etc. I'm dumbfounded and had never had a complaint against me. Nor in the 5+ months that I worked there did I get a write up for anything. They hand me my check and paper to sign and illegally fire me. The worst part is, is that after this I was unemployed for 3 months which sucked hard and caused my grades to slip. I don't understand how a person can just go out of their way and get someone fired. She didn't know me. She didn't know if I was supporting a kid or a dieing loved one with that job. Now, it all could have been bullshit from my employer because I never got to see this letter or any other explanation. I won out in the end though.

- I once delivered to a house that wasn't answering. I went around to a side-door, and there was a deer head lying next to it. I assume a hunter lived there. It freaked me out.

- I once delivered to a man who I could see sleeping on the couch through the window. I had to knock a good deal to wake him up. When he finally did, he answered the door, said oh, and then walked around the living room in a few circles before returning in front of me, staring quizzically. I told him how much he owed me. This happened several times before he finally handed me a check.

- I once delivered in the snow and as I was pulling up to a house, my car got stuck and I was just spinning. Immediately, a car pulled over, and a few boys my age jumped out. They got behind my car and pushed. My car got unstuck. They then jumped in their car and drove away.

- I once delivered to the high school. There were no instructions for which entrance so at first I just went to the front door, which was locked. I walked back to my car and sat the pizza on the back and called the number. I reached someone right around the time I heard yelling and at the other end of the parking lot, I saw a group of kids waving. The person who answered said to bring it down to that entrance, where they were. I jumped in the car, and drove down to them. When I got out, they said, ""Woah! You're really good!"" and then someone asked, ""Is that where you *normally* keep the pizza?"" I was mortified to see the pizza still sitting on the back of my car. I just laughed and said, ""Uh ... don't tell anyone about that."" I am so lucky it didn't fall off!

- I once got to a house and was told by the people there that they hadn't actually ordered because it was too expensive so they told the phone girl to cancel it and ordered from Pizza Hut. I just gave them their dinner for free. I guarantee they ate our pizza for dinner that night -- so much better than Pizza Hut (but, yes, much more expensive)

- So often, after ringing the doorbell, I'd hear, ""Pizza guy's here!"" and then after opening the door, ""Oh! Pizza girl!""

- I once delivered to a taxidermy shop. I didn't know it was one until I got there. Three people called me inside and they were all busy gutting (or whatever) a deer. They asked if they could pay me in deer meat. I had to bring the pizza in and set it down because their hands were ... busy.

- I once delivered to a place with a super long, super narrow driveway between two fences. When I got to the house there was *no place to turn around!* I tried at first, but seeing it wasn't going to happen I realized I had to drive down the whole driveway backwards. It was so narrow with tall grass and a wooden fence on either side. I drove slowly and carefully, but somehow veered and little and smacked into a fencepost. I was horrified. As I pulled forward, I saw the fencepost was bent and had splintered! My stomach was churning. I kept backing out, not knowing what the do. I finally called the customer and told him I thought I had hit his fence. I was so relieved when he laughed and said the fence has been like that for years. Phew.

- I was working the night of the last presidential election and that was probably one of the most fun nights I had. Every person I delivered to wanted to talk about it, and I gathered updates throughout the night from customers. I remember chatting with a high school girl about politics in general and who she was rooting for. It's a simple story, but politics rarely gets to be so much fun. It was great peeking into all the houses watching the race on the news, and getting some pizza to accompany them. :)

- I usually left my car running (though I wasn't supposed to). Once, on the way out, I accidentally hit the lock, which I didn't realize until I'd gotten back to my car. My cell phone and everything was in the car. I sheepishly rang the guy's doorbell again and explained and he let me use his phone to call the store, and then my mother (spare key was at home). The guy lived alone and was moving the following day. He had only a TV and two fold-up chairs. He had me sit in one and we watched TV together. I offered a gift certificate for free pizza, but he said since he was moving he didn't want it and it was no big deal anyway. I was super embarrassed and this guy was so nice. When my mom called his cell phone to talk to me, he said, ""It must be for you. Nobody's going to call me."" I felt terrible for him, as he talked about working the night shift and how his wife had left him. When my mother finally arrived with my spare key, I just wanted to hug the guy for being so kind to me.


That's all I can think of right now. I loved delivering pizza. I don't know if other people realize what a great job it can be. I worked for an independent local place that was well-loved in the safe, sweet little town I grew up in. I worked only part-time but made more money than I later made working full-time in an office job. I loved seeing all the different houses, and it was rare for anyone to be crabby to me.

I didn't know what to do so I just say loudly "" I'm from Domino's Pizza, were you expecting a delivery?"" hoping she could hear me through the door. She starts yelling over and over again but this time I can make out some of it ""you shouldn't be up here! You shouldn't be up here!""

   Once in the hall she smiled at me like nothing was wrong and began to tell me how it was her first time ordering domino's, that she knew she  had to order from us once she smelt her neighbors pizza box. She then explained in detail that she was ""pretty sure"" it was her neighbors pizza box but that it could have been from the next apartment building because she had retrieved the pizza box from the dumpster earlier that day.

Finally she paid me in cash and I headed back to the store. Once I arrived the guy at the store told me she had called back to complain that I owed her 12 cents and that she wanted it refunded on her next order. We both looked at each other then burst into laughter, turns out while ordering she had told him all about her expedition to the dumpster as well.

A few days ago I asked if it would be worth getting it free because the guy was late. I left out some seemingly unimportant details last time, which I will now share with you.


This driver just had a bad attitude all together. When he arrived late, he called my cell phone and buzzer at the same time and complained my buzzer was not working. For the last year, I've been ordering about once a month with the same kickass driver, he's always here ridiculously early, really polite and I like this guy. Many tip are given. 


He has also never had a problem with my buzzer. Neither has the post office, neither has my mum, and neither have any of my friends. It conveniently stopped working when this guy was approaching 40 minutes apparently.


Seems like bull shit. 


He comes upstairs, and knocks. I have a Rottweiler. She's a puppy still, but behaves like a princess and was sitting beside me when I opened the door, her nose snuffling because she is a food whore.


I try my best not to racially stereotype, but this was a middle eastern man and he showed immediate distaste in my dog and rudely demanded I put her in a different room.


I understand if you're afraid of dogs, but do not be rude to me about her. We're in my house, not yours. Most drivers that look afraid, I will ask if they'd like me to put her in her crate, but this man just ugh... He was already bugging me with his professional conduct.


So he starts making up every excuse in the book why he was late, and up until this point I didn't give a shit. I was hungry, yeah. It was only a minute, whatever. But he was just rubbing me the wrong way the whole time, asking if I'm going to feed my dog the bones of chicken wings (cooked chicken bones are incredibly dangerous to a dog). I'm sure he's ignorant to the fact, but again. He'd already bugged me.


In Canada, our wages differ from the USA, so I didn't tip him. He didn't deserve one in my eyes. Signed the receipt and he was on his way. 


Fast forward four days. A reason for me to hate this guy. I was checking my Visa statement and the charge was $3.70 more than what it should be.


This guy had given himself a tip. I was furious. It was not about the amount, but the fact this guy believed he deserved a tip and gave himself one! It starts with me, and who knows how much he could take from someone else. 


I found which store he was from and I plan to speak to the manager. I also contacted my credit card company to retract the $3.70 from my statement.


As a former retail employee, this conduct disgusts me and I can only imagine how it makes the honest delivery guy feels. I still respect the drivers and love tipping the kickass guys well, but fuck this guy.

So anyways, today I had a delivery to a regular customer, who orders about 3 times a week and comes in every so often with her two toddlers.

I'm in shock because I think I must've done something wrong, and I just pause and look down the hallway where she was. It turns out her other kid was drinking the water from the toilet using some toy/cup (idk couldn't see that far).

She comes back and apologizes and offers to give me a bigger tip if I keep my mouth shut and not tell the guys back at the restaurant. I told her there was no need and of course I wouldn't tell them, so instead I came and told you guys!

but yeah, that's it. I just thought I'd let you know, since I was having a laugh. Also, have you guys ever had the customer offer you more tip for something that there was no need to, aside from the tip? If so, did you take it? I wouldn't feel right taking it.

Guy greets me with a ""FUCK YEAAAAH! PIZZA'S HERE!"", and ushers me into the house. With the amount of alcohol in this house, I would have guessed that there was a party occuring, and I asked. But dude assures me that it was only him and his girlfriend, but they needed to get to a party the next town over, but they were too drunk to drive, as they had pre-gamed a little bit too hard.

He gets the look in his eye as if he'd just gotten the most brilliant idea in the world. ""Oh my god... Dude, do you think you could give me and my girlfriend a lift to the party? I'll throw you an extra 10 bucks on top of the food money!"" I mulled it over for a few seconds and agreed, as it was only a 5-10 minute drive from where we were. So I shoot the shit with these two for a little bit, eat some of the food I brought them, and we load up all the alcohol and hit the road. 

We get to this party and it is absolutely out of control. 50 some-odd people in the street and front yard, hundreds more inside and out back. I pull up and wish them both a good night when the guy stops me and says ""WAIT! YO! .. Do you have any plans tonight?"" I replied ""Well, not really. I was just gonna go home and relax for the night."" He replies ""FUCK THAT! You're raging with us! You can take whatever you want out of my booze!"" I thought it over for a second. I could go home, or I could see where this night was going to take me. I decided on the latter.

I enter this party and already feel kind of awkward. I don't see a single person I know, and I'm noticeably younger than most of the people here (I was 17 or 18 at the time). It wasn't too big of an issue though, because there were so many people it was easy to blend in. So I began drinking immediately; maybe I'd be able to loosen up a bit and meet some interesting people. The next few hours were pretty typical, drinks, long conversations with strangers, making new 'best friends', etc. etc.

Cue 1am. Things are rowdy. Fights have broken out already, and been broken up. And then it happened. The guy I had come with (Brandon was his name; didn't figure this out until half-way through the party), was considerably more drunk than when I had first met him at his house, and was barely coherent. He was upstairs hanging out around the balcony when suddenly, he completely keels over and falls OVER the balcony right onto the motherfucking coffee table and completely smashes the entire thing. His girlfriend is FREAKING out thinking he is dead, until he gets up. Brandon thinks someone pushed him over the balcony and becomes extremely belligerent and is trying to pick fights with anyone he sees. He gets into it with another guy about his size.  A few punches are thrown until someone breaks it up. Brandon's girlfriend is LIVID and gets into a huge screaming match with him and tells him that she's leaving. At this point, I'm not sure what to do as these are the only two people I 'know' at this party. I lose track of Brandon and I'm just hanging out by the door on my cell phone figuring out what to do and where I'm gonna go when Brandon's (ex?)girlfriend grabs me and asks me if I can give her a ride home. But this wasn't your casual ""Oh can you give me a ride home."" This was a pissed off vengeful woman wanting me to go home with her. But I hadn't been in this situation before, so I couldn't tell the difference.  Me, being young and naive agree to drive this girl home. I drove Brandon's girlfriend back to her apartment and she invites me in (this is when things started clicking inside of my 17 year old head). I timidly agree, and enter the seductresses den. We hang out in the kitchen for a little bit and she's just venting. I'm not really listening, all I'm thinking is ""Okay. What the fuck is going on. How am I in this situation? Why did she want me to come inside? I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GIRL!"" After a few minutes she stops talking and then starts coming onto me and we go to her bedroom where we proceed to do the deed. Afterwards I tell her I have to go. No exchange of numbers. I never even got her name. I felt kind of bad, cause Brandon tipped me really well. Oh well. 

TL;DR:

* Take delivery to really drunk couple, they ask me for a ride to party
* Drive couple to party, decide to party with them
* Guy gets really drunk, falls of balcony, breaks table, starts fight, breaks up with girlfriend

So I deliver to a house in an area very near to my city's college campus. A nice looking girl answers the door, fully clothed (this is relevant). Nothing seemed amiss, and she took the pizza and paid. Now, the door opened inwards, and swung to the right, so it blocked my view of the right corner of the room that was closest to me. So as we're exchanging food for cash (or maybe she was signing a credit card slip, I don't remember), I notice that I can see through the crack in the door jamb, and there is clearly a fully naked man just sitting on a chair/loveseat in that corner of the room. 


Now, there's probably some pretty obvious guesses one could make as to what was happening. However, the completely normal-acting and fully clothed girl answering the door and paying me in a non-chalant manner really contrasted with the secretly naked man hidden in the corner, silently waiting for his pizza and to return to whatever activity they had paused when I arrived.

Here's my worst/best story. ,113,19,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/16x4yx/finally_got_out_of_detroit_and_into_the_suburbs/,"I live in a typical ""white suburbia"" on the outskirts of Detroit (About 40 mins away). When I finished highschool I went out looking for work, and having a pretty good car I thought being a driver would be great. I started looking for jobs in my area and had a hard time finding anyone hiring. I started looking on Craigslist for places hiring and I found a pizza place that had a listing. I drove there that same day and talked to a manager. I got hired on the spot. 

This pizza place was right on the border of Detroit and another city that isn't too bad, it was mostly offices. Being on the border of Detroit, and having a large delivery radius, there were a ton of orders to the ghetto. I decided I would risk working there, I did grow up in a pretty shitty neighborhood so working in Detroit didn't really phase me. 

I started working there and it was pretty cool, the guys I worked with were great, it was very laid back and I did make some cash. I did have to go to the ghetto a couple times and on one of my first nights I was pretty nervous and locked my keys in my car. Fast forward a month of me working there; I'm still a newbie, occasionally fuck up, but pretty much have shit locked down. Then we catch word of [this](http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/1557/delivery_man_wounded_dearborn_pizza_joint_nixes_detroit_deliveries). Some driver in the store bordering our delivery zone got shot. That did rustle my jimmies but did not deter me from working. Around this time is when my worst delivery ever happened. 

I was taking a delivery deep into Detroit, as far as we deliver. I pull into the street and am greeted with burned down houses on both sides. As I driver further down I see a pair of burned down houses with an intact house in the middle. That's the house. I check behind bushes as best as I can from my car to make sure no one is trying to rob me, and walk out with the pie in tow. I check for a bell but it's been ripped off like on most of these houses. I knock loudly and wait for a few minutes but no one comes out. I start to turn to my car and I see a dude on a bicycle pull up. He walks up and tells me hes the one who ordered the pizza, no big deal. I check the price, it was $24 and change. I ask him for the money and he hands me a hundred. I tell him I don't have change for it but he tells me it's all he has. This is were my dipshit noobieness kicked in and I tell him let me check my wallet. As I pull out my wallet, he whips out a pistol and aims it at me. I remember exactly what he said ""White boy, these next few months in the D are pretty cold, everyone is struggling to pay bills and buy stupid shit and some niggas aint got the best sense. Do you see how easy it is for me to rob your ass? Never pull your wallet out when you're out here."" He put the gun back in his belt, chuckled a little and said ""Scared your white ass didn't I"". I gave him all the change I had, and he ended up tipping me close to $30. I never told anyone at the store because although it was a fucked up way to teach someone a lesson the dude was a pretty cool guy. 

I've worked at the pizza place for a bit over 6 months now and I got offered a job delivering a mile down from where I live. I get paid better and will probably end up getting better tips, I start on Friday. =]

I was the only driver on the other night, because my manager likes to live dangerously this close to Christmas. Get an on-line delivery order for meatlovers, meatlovers -no cheese, and some messed up custom pizza. The manager reads it as 2 meatlovers, so I end up with 4 pizzas. Normally we would eat the extra pizza if we can't resell it in 20 mins. But the manager doesn't like meatlovers so she says I should give them all four pizzas. I make the delivery ""Sorry, we accidentally made an extra pizza for your order, so you get an extra one for free."" The lady looked puzzled ""it wasn't a cheese pizza, was it?"" I didn't think that would matter, it's free. ""Yeah, it's a cheese pizza."" ""Oh, ok."" Seriously, who doesn't get excited about free pizza?

Couple of deliveries later, one of the kitchen hands puts in chicken bites instead of chicken wings. Order comes out of the oven ""I'm missing chicken wings and a garlic bread, and who are these chicken bites for?"" Wait another 7 minutes for the wings and garlic bread, and the manager sends me off with the bites anyway 'cause it's Christmas'. Get to the house, ""someone accidentally put in chicken bites with your order so you get chicken bites for free."" ""Really? I'm liking these freebies."" I think he meant it as a hint, but at least he was happy to get free stuff.

Get back from a delivery, and there's another already waiting in the bag for me to go, check everything is in there, check I don't need any drinks. Get to the house, check the docket one last time, before I get out of my car, and I realise there's a garlic bread in the bag that isn't on the order. I figure the manager will want me to give it to the customer anyway, but I called the store to be sure. Then I deliver the pizzas ""someone put a garlic bread in your order by mistake, so you get a free garlic bread."" The guy was ecstatic ""Awesome! Free Garlic Bread!""

2. $25 gift card to Barnes and Noble. ""Reading is the greatest gift"" said the old lady who gave it to me. Used it towards one school book so it was not unappreciated.

3. An unopened bottle of Crown. This was an absolutely magnificent looking house inside and out in the rich house area of our delivery zone. The man shook my hand with a greeting of ""Thanks for coming, I appreciate it."" and he leads me inside to the kitchen to lay out his 5 large pizzas for mass consumption.

**Why I never had to worry about DUI checkpoints for the longest time.**

As I mentioned before my dad is a volunteer firefighter in town and for a short while took his turn to be police commissioner.  There really wasn't much for him to do as the commish but one thing on his list was organizing DUI checkpoints with his department, the state police, and the liquor control board.

I had just made a run to a no-show and was already a bit pissed off.  Just one of those nights that nothing seemed to be going my way.  So when I realized I got caught in the line for a DUI checkpoint I was pissed.  It was early (like 10pm) but they were doing their thing.  When I pulled up I saw my dad standing in the background.

When I was next in line I rolled my window down and called out to my dad.  ""You eat yet?""

""Yeah, why?"" He asked.

""Had a no-show at my last address.  Got a large pizza. Wondering if if you wanted it.""

He thought for a second. ""Give it to me anyway. I am sure someone here will eat it.""  I gave him the pizza and he told the officer to just wave me through.

Later that night my cell rang and it was my dad.

""Hey, can you bring us to more large pizzas?"" He asked.  ""We moved the checkpoint down to Kmart.""

I told him I would take care of it.

Half our later I show up in the DUI checkpoint line, hand one of the offers a pizza and he hands me some folded up bills.  When I got back to the store to cash out I noticed there were two State Police ""Get Out of Jail Free"" cards. (*Yes, they really are a thing.  One got me out of a 65 in a 45 speeding ticket.  Not sure what happened to the other.*)

Anyway, for the next few months every time there was a DUI checkpoint I would deliver two pizzas twice.  Once on their early shift (*around 10pm*) and then once again just before we closed (*around 1am*).

For about a year or so after that every time where was a DUI checkpoint I would get waved though even if I wasn't working.  Not that I was a heavy drinker or anything nor ever drove drunk.  It was nice just to get waved around as soon as one of the officers or troopers spotted my car.

**Pledge Week 1999**

As many of you know Fraternities and Sororities love to make their pledges do interesting things during Pledge Week.  Although I could bore you with stories of what the frats made some of their pledges do, I am sure you're much more interested in what the sororities made some of their pledges do.

I was till pretty young at the time (19) and pretty naive.  I won't pretend otherwise.  So I show up for my Friday evening shift at 3:30 and start folding boxes.  Some other drivers like to do this between runs, but on a Friday night there is rarely any downtime.  I just bite the bullet, clock in early, and bust ass for a half hour.

Once 4:00 hits I start making runs.  Friday nights were usually about 60/40 split between college students and local orders.  I was a little surprised when every single order on my first run had me going to ""frat row.""  There was small cul-de-sac of apartment buildings that had been taken over my fraternities and sororities.  Wasn't uncommon for them to order pizzas for their parties but it seemed a bit early.

First drop off was a frat.  I was a little weirded out when a kid no older than I was answered the door in his tighty-whities.  His frat brothers were all huddled around the corner laughing their ass off.  I took the poor kids money and walked away.

Next drop off was just around the corner so I didn't even move my car.  Just grabbed the pizza warmer bag and walked over.  I knocked on the door and a chick about two, maybe three years older than I was answered the door.

""Oh, sorry,"" she said looking a little alarmed.  ""We weren't expecting you.""

I pulled out the slip, double checked the house letters.  Before I could say anything she corrected herself.

""I mean, we did order pizza. We just didn't hear you pull up."" She paused for a second. ""Wait one second."" She then slammed the door in my face.

Like an idiot I stood out front for about a minute before I was ready to write this order off as a prank call.  At least I would have a pizza to eat.  Just as I was about to walk away the door reopened.

My jaw hit the ground.  Here stood a statuesque blonde in stilettos, stockings, g-string, garter, and a skimpy bra.  She was just as nervous as the fratboy next door but a hell of a lot easier on the eyes.

I heard some giggling in the background and could only assume her soon-to-be sisters had put her up to this.

Like two kids on prom night we exchanged the pizza and money and soon I was off to make another run.

When I got back to the store I noticed another batch of orders for frat row.  The other driver was a bit older (*and a bit creepier*) so I told my manager that I was more than willing to make all the frat row runs.  Luckily he agreed.

The next run to the sorority I was greeted by a brunette in a stocking/bustier combo.  She was a little more confident than the first girl.

As I was geting back into my car with a cat-got-the-canary grin I noticed one of the sisters running towards me.  I feared I had screwed up the order somehow and mixed up the pizzas.

""Nothings wrong,"" she said seeing the look of panic on my face.

""Oh, i thought maybe I mixed up the orders,"" I said defensively. ""Busy night and all.""

She gave me a coy smile. Not the innocent of 'oh aren't you precious' kind but the 'I'm up to something' kind of smile. ""Blonde, brunette, or redhead?""

""Excuse me?"" I asked.

""We're going to be doing this all night. So what do you want to answer the door next. A blonde, a brunette, or a redhead?""  She then flashed me that coy grin again.

Up until this point i was still pretty clueless. As clueless as a 19 year old boy could be.  Something in that moment made it click for me and I realized this was all a game.

""Redhead,"" I said with an impish grin.

In a flash she was off half running half skipping towards the door to the apartment building.

So here is where we lather-rinse-and-repate a few times.  I made about a 12 other runs and it was getting late.  I kept checking to see if the sorority house had called again.  I was the first driver to be cut once things slowed down.  That usually happened around 11pm depending on how busy we were.

I finally resigned to the fact that they weren't going to call again.  Most of the other frats and sororities were playing similar games so I was still having a good night, but there was something unique about that house that made me yearn to go back.

As I was gathering up my next round or orders my manager came over to me with another box.  This one specified that you deliver it.  My eyes lit up and I checked the box.  Yup, same sorority.

This time when I answered the door I was greeted by a girl-next-door type redhead in an emerald green lingerie set.  I have always been a sucker for a redhead and tonight was no exception.

""You're right,"" she said.  At first I thought she was talking to me.  ""He is kinda  cute,"" she continued.  I then heard giggling and realized she was talking to her sisters hidden out of view.

Speechlessly I handed her the pizza and mumbled the price of the pizza.  She handed me money and then paused.  ""And this is your tip,"" she then placed a few $1 bills on the box one of which had a name, phone number and ""call me"" written on them.

Now, I am sure some of you are calling bullshit, but this is the god's honest truth.

Anyway, I tuck that $1 bill into my pocket away from the rest of my cash. I usually keep my tips in my pocket away. Made cashing out at the end of the night easier anyway.

So I made two more runs that night before my manager lets me know I am cut.  The whole time I am smiling thinking about this number and whether or not it was just part of the game or if I might actually stand a chance at getting a date out of the whole thing (*naive, remember?*).

So I cash out the end of my shift like I usually do.  I then up-change all my tips into big bills.  No need carrying around a wad of $1 and $5 bills when I could carry around a few crips $20s.

I get home, empty my pockets, and start thinking about how good a shower will feel.  Then I remember the $1 bill with the number on it.

Can't find it.

I rip open my wallet and look at every bill. I double check my pockets.

Can't find it.

I run out to the car and look everywhere I usually stash a buck.

Can't find it.

Shit. Shit. Shit.

I run back into the house, grab my keys, and nearly do a 2 mile burnout from my driveway all the way back to the store.

I go up to my manager and ask him if he can open up the cash drawer and let me look through the $1 bills.

""Too late,"" he said. ""Just sent the other drive out with tonight's cash drop.""

Shit. Shit. Shit.

If that wasn't bad enough, a few weeks later I am gassing up my car when this hot redhead walks by and then stops to do a double take.

""Do you deliver pizzas?"" She asked with a bemused look on her face.

""Uh, yeah,"" I replied.  It then dawned on me that she was the one from Rush Week in the green lingerie.

""I gave you my number didn't I?"" She asked still bemused.

""I lost it,"" I said sheepishly.  ""I cashed out all my tips at the end of my shift and mistakenly cashed in the dollar with your number on it.""

She laughed and then started walking away.  ""Your loss,"" she said with a flip of her hand.

I could only laugh as I got into my car and drove away.

+++

**TL;DR:** During rush week one of the sororities had their pledges answering the door in lingerie.  After multiple runs to the same sorority house the last girl gives me a $1 bill with her name and number on it.  Like an idiot I cash it in at the end of the night when I up-change all my tips.

1994, Friday, 11PM: I'm washing dishes by hand in the triple sinks that lined the back wall right next to the exit, there were 2 more deliveries that could be made as a double and the other driver, We'll call him Rectum, was taking them off the oven at the cutting table. The cooks had left and the shift manager was closing the make table. Cutegirl that I had classes with had finished closing the dining room and stopped by the dish sink to say goodnight. I had soap suds up to my elbows and medium deep dish pans stacked to the ceiling, we laughed about how there was no way in hell I was going to get done before 3am. 

She said goodnight and leaned backwards against the crash bar on the door, as soon as the door unlocked a HUGE black hand reached from outside and grabbed her by the face yanking her backwards, before I could realize what was happening three men with guns came in the back door, one stuck a gun right in my face and I went into ""fight/flight"" mode, spun on my heels and realized there was no place to go. 

There was a definite pecking order in the robbers, nig1 was yelling for everyone to get down, nig2 was standing guard at the back door and nig3 was looking me in the eyes pointing a pistol in my face, he looked scared and about to cry. Nig3 tells me to go up front and lay on the floor, Cutegirl is face down on the floor between the make table and the oven with foot prints across her back, Rectum is laying face down on the floor at the cut table and had pissed himself, it reeked of fear and piss.  

I walked past the front register and knelt on the floor in the dining room with my hands laced behind my head, I determined that if I was going to die it wouldn't be laying in my own piss, at least not that night. 

Nig1 was holding a pistol to the shift managers head demanding that he open the safe, the shift manager kept saying ""it's on a time lock, I can't open it till the timer counts down"". Nig 1 keeps yelling “Open the motherfucking safe” and to get his point across fired a shot into the wait station. I remember the sound of the shot and the brass tinkling across the floor. The silence after that as the realization that we were all seconds from death made the smell of fear change.  Twice more times a shot was fired as they waited for the safe to open, that was the longest 10 minutes of my life. 

 The safe was opened, they took all the cash and checks and fled out the back door, I was the first that spoke and said “I think they're gone”. All phone lines were ringing with pissed off customers and worried spouses, we couldn't get an outside line for another few minutes because the calls were streaming in too fast. Rectum called the police, I lit up a cigarette and sat in a booth. I was almost done smoking when I spotted someone peeking in the corner window, fight/flight took over again and I was diving for cover in the wait station when I remembered all the broken glass from the gun play, that's about the time I realized it was the cops.

So the whole place gets turned into a crime scene, after investigations were complete the GM's from the other stores in the district all came in to do closing and right at 3 am I walked out the door. 

TL;DR: all the district GM's washed dishes and mopped floors

Counter takes order, turns around and tells me ""to go round back as the customer is working in the backyard"", or something else the driver doing the delivery needs to know.

I'm in the restaurant but it's rush hour and I'm already assigned other deliveries, trying to make sure I got everything, wanting to get out the door ASAP and I might not cross the actual driver who'll go there before I head out.

What happens if I don't ? Will the counter people try again to pass the information after I head out ? Of course not, once is plenty, right ? Wrong ! How hard is it to get them to **write it down on the order** ??? I must have asked those people a thousand times over the years in more than one establishments and tried just about as much to get management to insist on that particular point and yet it still happens.

At rush hour when I'm there I'm busy already, I don't have time to fish out a specific order from those coming out the printer to write it down for the counter people 'cause they couldn't be bothered to do it while taking the order.

It ticks me off when I'm there on the street like an idiot not able to figure out where I need to go to find the customer because I don't have all the informations to get to the customer. Had one like that a little while ago: Got an address but it doesn't exist, street numbers are by four (10, 14, 18, 22 and so on)  and my bill says 16, Both houses at 14 and 18 are clearly empty (broad daylight, not a car in either driveway and I can't see anyone in either houses. After having been sitting there a sec I make the call to try and reach the customer and I get random front desk corporate lady who doesn't have a clue what I'm on about.

As I was about to drive off, it turns out the delivery was for the service truck on the side of the road and the guys were working inside the back of the truck on some telecom/phone equipment when they walked out, saw me and flagged me over. They had told the restaurant the food was for them in that truck (a rental) but the information never got to me because the one who took the order (not a delivery driver) deemed that information not important (heard her say it once back to the restaurant). I was fuming.

Sometimes I wish I could take what I know to be a shitty/impossible/hard as hell to find address, toss the keys to that person who took that order and send em out to do that delivery. Maybe then they'd know why it's important when a customer is taking the time to mention a cross street, truck color, particular sign by the side of the road or whatever else to write it down, not just take the order as usual and say it to whoever happens to be there.

Long story short, I wasn't getting paid enough, so I got a second job at Papa John's Pizza. This happened about a month into my employment, right after a new girl named Julie had signed on.


We have a touch screen system that lets us get directions, see what orders are up, what have you. The orders are green if they're behind time, yellow if they're right on time, and red if they're late. So 3 of my coworkers and I are hanging out at about 7PM, when a red order pops on the screen. We all kind of look around, and Julie says ""Oh, this Indian guy (this is important) just called back and changed his carryout order to delivery."" Jason, the lead driver, calls for a remake because the order is so old, and it's my turn to go on a delivery.


Out I go on the order. I arrived at the door and a 21ish year old guy answers the door. He speaks perfect English, even though he is quite blatantly of Indian descent. I have him sign for the order, but then, his father shows up. He asks me where his credit receipt is. We have a 2 dollar delivery charge, and we had to ring his card again when he changed the order (the first charge gets deleted at the end of the night). I tell him, just as Julie did, that we don't do credit receipts. He asks me to call the store, so I pull out my handy-dandy Motorola Droid Bionic, and he asks to speak not to my manager, but to Julie. After near shouting at her for about 2 minutes, he says to her, ""Thank you for your time,"" hands me my phone, gives me one dollar as a tip, hands me the signed receipt, and not closes, slams the door in my face.


I was dumbfounded, but turned on my heel and walked to my car. Julie was still on the phone, and I told her sorry about that. I proceeded to drive back to the store and have a successful night afterwards.

I work at a pizza place that serves by the slice.  Most of our business comes from this.  We do delivery/carry-out, but much less than your average place.  Anyhow, we just so happen to be located in a very seasonal town; during the summer, the local population will swell to 3 or 4 times the year-round average.  We also happen to be located on one of busiest streets in town, in the heart of the restaurant/bar district.  And boy, are there a lot of bars.  I'm not exaggerating when I say you could start at one end of the street, have a drink at each bar, and it's very unlikely you'd make it to the other end.

As you can imagine, we get a lot of drunken foot traffic.  My store is pretty small; at most, we'll have 4 people working at one time, with 3 being much more commonplace.  Our biggest rush begins around 12:30 AM, and really picks up around 1AM, when the bars close.  During the peak of the season, a line stretching down the street is a fairly common thing for us.  We keep as much pizza in our display case as we can, with even more prepped and ready to go into the oven at a moments notice.  Most people who come in are complacent, just want their slice, pay and GTFO with relative calm.  We do, however, get the belligerent drunks.  More often than not, these are the rich 30-40 somethings who go out with their friends to relive the 'glory days,' and, for some reason, think they are more important than everyone else.  Some of my best stories have come from them.  I hope to share a few with you.


------------------------
So this night starts out like any other; coworkers and I bullshitting, myself making pizzas for the inevitable inebriated idiots, filling delivery orders that come in, etc.  It's shaping up to be a very average night.  Nothing particularly exciting happens, and the drunks start coming in right on schedule.  The first 10 or 15 minutes goes by without a hitch.  Then, we get a guy wanting to buy 2 boxes worth of pizza.  This is pretty common; we sell by the slice, and let people buy as much as they want (or are willing to pay for).  It's a pain in the ass for us, because it wipes out a good chunk of what we have to sell, and our ovens can only cook so much, so fast.  Anyways, we box up what he wants, and put it on top of the case so he can grab it after he pays.  Drunk-in-Question (herein referred to as DIQ) decides to pick up the boxes, and hand them to his friends standing a few feet away.  No problem, we already know what he has, easy enough to ring him out.  My coworker proceeds to do so, and we send him on his merry way.  

Or so we thought.

Apparently, in the minute it took DIQ to hand the pizza to his friends, his friends set it down on top of our garbage receptacle (which, for some reason, the drunks treat as a gathering point), and promptly stopped paying attention to it.  Apparently, some unscrupulous character noticed this, and took the opportunity to pick up one of his boxes, and walk out of our store.

DIQ is now very pissed off.  So pissed off, in fact, that he decides that the other box is now his ticket to yell at my manager.  He picks it up, and begins yelling at my manager, saying that it's ""our fault that his pizza got stolen.""  My manager doesn't believe this, obviously, and tries explaining to him that once we hand him the pizza, it's HIS responsibility.  This, of course, displeases DIQ.  How could it be HIS fault?  It's not HIS job to watch it.  He rants and raves for a few more minutes; I was busy serving people, so I didn't catch most of what he was saying.  DIQ also thought it was a good idea to start hitting our hanging lights with the box, because somehow, that would help his situation.  I don't know what my manager ended up doing to get him to leave, but he got a thorough cursing out once we had closed.

---------------------------

This one happened before my time, but it's become a bit of a legend in my store.  As a result of our store being so small, we don't meet the seating requirement that would require us to have a public restroom.  We have a storage closet with a toilet inside it, but it's for employee use only.  This particular night, a group of drunks comes in, and a girl asks to use the restroom.  We tell her that we don't have a public restroom, sorry.  Drunken girl makes a bit of a scene, but goes about her merry way.  A minute or so later, one of my former co-workers notices her in the corner by the door leading to the restroom/closet.  As he goes to tell her to move away, that it was employees only allowed in there, the girl drops her underwear, squats down, and pisses on the goddamn floor.  

At 1AM. 

In the middle of a store with approximately 40 or 50 drunken assholes and overtired employees.  

My coworker, at a loss for words, promptly kicks her out, and closes the store so that they could clean up her mess.  It was then that they noticed that not only had Piss-Zilla hit the floor, she had managed to urinate on a good portion of our bottled drinks that went in our cooler; obviously, we can't sell those, so there's a bunch of lost profit.  Now, our store has cameras covering virtually every angle of the shop.  Somehow, this girl had found one of the few blind spots in the system.  She got away scot-free, while we were stuck with piss-drenched drinks and floors.

I'm a Jimmy John's driver in Indianapolis who did used to deliver for Papa John's, so I think I can still put this here.

I've been delivering in a little 97 Jetta for over a year, and it's a real POS, but I'd been successfully getting to (most of) my deliveries in it.

So I worked 11 - 4 today. No biggie. Tomorrow and Saturday I was supposed to work 11-11 both days. At about 6pm today, I was on my way to a friend's house. I was crossing through an intersection when this old guy came from oncoming traffic and busted a left right in front of me. By the time my foot was on the brake, it was over. My car got spun 90 degrees and pushed 15 yards up the street I was passing, and the guy who hit me was spun around 180 and grazed another car before coming to a stop.

All the airbags deployed. My front end was completely smashed in. Fluids and glass and plastic were all over the road. My whole car was steaming and even my good pen broke from the force! The shifter was stuck in 4th even, like it wouldn't budge.

I went to the hospital a little later to get checked out. They don't think I had a full concussion, but I hit my head and my knee and they both hurt. So I have over 20 hours on the schedule over the next two days and now I don't have a vehicle to deliver in.

I may be fortunate enough to get a rental from the other guys insurance company, and we'll see what they give me for my Jetta, but I might not be able to work for a little while.

(Story #5),100,15,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14gezk/delivering_to_the_undeliverable_story_5/,"*This is more of a story about what it means to go the extra mile for your customer... even when the extra mile is a gravel road up a mountain side*

**Delivering to the undeliverable**

As mentioned in my prior story at one point I drove a Jeep when delivering pizzas.  One day I was working and I saw the owner of the local Jeep dealership coming in to pick up a take-out order.  He recognized me and we started chatting.

I asked him whey he was getting carry-out when he lived so close (*as the bird flies he was only about 5 miles from the store*).  He said that he had been black-listed by every pizza place in town because he lives on top of the mountain and his driveway was about a mile long and all gravel.

I quipped that I would deliver to him and his brother any time.  Just call the store and ask for me or call my cell and find out when I am working next.

A few weeks pass and I get a call on my cell.

""Were you serious about your offer to deliver to our place?"" The owner of the dealership asked.

""Yes sir Mr. Owner Man,"" I said.  ""Just call in for delivery and tell them I will handle it.""

I finished up the run I was on and walked in to the store.  Manager immediately cornered me.

""Did you say you would deliver to Mr. Owner Man up on the mountain?"" My manager asked me rather sternly.

""Yes. I can handle it.  I know right where he lives,"" I said rather defensively.

""You sure?"" My manager asked still a little uneasy.

""I drive a Jeep. He owns the Jeep dealership. It's the least I can do for him,"" I said with a chuckle.

My manager realized the connection and told me that I was the only one allowed to run Mr. Owner Man's orders and he would make a note in the computer.  I reassured him that Mr. Owner Man had called me on my cell to make sure I was working and would do so in the future.

I grab the order, jump in my Jeep and take off towards Mr. Owner Man's house.  Sad thing was his driveway wasn't anything that bad.  It was just a long gravel road that any car could handle if they took their time.

Once I got to the top he greeted me, took his order, and gave me a nice $20 tip along with the payment.  I reminded him that as long as I was working I'd deliver to him.

Fast-foward a couple months.  If I recall it was probably a month or so before the big snow storm I talked about in story #4.

There was about 3"" of snow on the ground.  Nothing debilitating.  Just made the main roads slushy and some of the back roads powdery.  Anyway, part way into my shift my cell rings and it's Mr. Owner Man again.  He asked if i was willing to deliver to him and his brother tonight.  I told him yes.

""Just so you know,"" he added, ""we haven't plowed yet.""

""No problem,"" I said.  ""Just means I have to use 4wd this time.""

I grabbed the order for him and his brother (*they had two houses a few hundred yards apart*) and set off up the mountain.

At the end of his driveway I kicked the Jeep in 4wd and drove the whole way up rally-car style never lifting off the throttle.  Did a pretty good job of powering through the unplowed snow.  When I got to the top he and his brother were standing in the center of their shared driveway clapping.

I managed a $20 tip from each one.  It pays to go the extra mile... even when that mile isn't exactly paved.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_14gezk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14gezk/delivering_to_the_undeliverable_story_5/,

I delivered pizzas for almost 4 years in a rural pizza shop in a town with some very poor, very inconsiderate people. I have two stories to share, to start with. The first is kind of bad. The second is the one that I think takes the cake.

**First**. There were some local white trash folks that lived in a double-wide down in a development tract off a main road. Lots of cool people down there, but only a couple of good tippers. These people were usually okay. So I take the delivery, just a normal sub with a side. The delivery itself was about 2.5 miles. I got there quick, and got out of my car ready to deliver. Only to be met by an unrestrained, angry pit bull mix that was charging at me from the back yard. I ran back to my car, dove inside, and slammed the door behind me just before he reached me. He's very, very angry, very, very mean, and very, very not something I feel like dealing with. I took out my cell phone, and tried to call the house. No answer. Honk my horn. Someone comes out, but doesn't do anything about the dog. He's barking loudly, teeth bared, growling, snarling, and flecking spittle all over the window of my car. 

I crack the window. ""Dude, your food?""

She shrugs. ""I didn't order anything."" 

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ""...okay. See ya."" *Fuck it*, I thought. *I'll go back and eat the sub. Free lunch. Not worth arguing about.*

5 minutes later, I'm back at the shop. As I walk in the door, I tell the owner about the delivery and we laugh about the local dumbasses. 

Phone rings. The owner answers. It's the person who ordered, wondering where his food is. I explain in no uncertain terms that I'm not going back there unless they have that dog restrained. They promise they will.

Five minutes later, I'm there. They didn't restrain the dog. I honk. No answer. I contemplate whether this is what hell is like, and consider tempting fate by going outside with my hunting knife and the food. I'm too much of a pansy (and too much of an animal lover, even the mean animals) to seriously entertain the idea. But I want to *think* that it's something I'd do.

Finally, they come out. ""Sorry, dude. She didn't know I ordered."" *Well why didn't that dumbass think to ask? What the fuck.*  

He comes over to the window of the car. I hand him the sub and side. He hands me $9 for a $8.XX order. ""Keep the change.""

Thanks.

**Second**. One of my friends' aunt was throwing a graduation party for her daughter's high school graduation at a local park. Google Maps says it's 7.9 miles from the shop I was working at. Now, normally we had a limit of five miles for delivery. But for an order that big? The owner of the shop was willing to make an exception. She ordered about a month in advance. 18 sheet pizzas. 50 orders of wings. 

At that point, I was a manager, but I still took delivery shifts from time to time. I was the senior employee at the shop (I'd been working there since before my boss - the store owner - bought the place, and I trained him on how to make pizza), so I had the prerogative to say, ""Fuck the rest of you, I'm taking this delivery."" Now, this was after the movie ""Waiting"" came out. But I still made the same mistake that Dean made. ""Hell, this bill's $580.XX. Even if they only tip a pittance, that's still $20. If they tip 10%, that's almost $60."" 

The day before the big delivery, I was in work, washing, sorting, and bagging the extra 500 chicken wings for delivery. The morning of the delivery was hot. And if you've ever worked in a pizzeria that's not air conditioned, you know that an 85 degree day outside is 120 inside once the ovens kick on. I was working hard in a true hellhole. I came in early and made two extra batches of dough to cover the added need, then started cooking pizza and wings with the owner and his brother-in-law. I loaded up my car trunk with pizza after pizza, and covered my backseat with boxes and boxes of wings, and finally got en route. 7.9 miles, one way. I pull in and unload, organizing and setting up the pizza boxes on their tables. Sorting the wings and laying them out nicely. I put down huge stacks of complimentary plates, napkins, forks, knives, and make sure that everything's good to go. 

The hostess approaches. Finally, I get to know what awesome tip I get! 

Checkbook. 

I stand over her shoulder as she writes. $5... *Well shit*. $58... *What the fuck?* $580.XX. Exact change. To the penny.

I don't know how I didn't flip the fuck out. I saved it for the entire drive back to the shop. Then I blew my top. 

(And my owner, who was usually a fairly cheap guy, gave me $20. Not what I was expecting, or hoping for, when I took on the annoyance of carrying about 200 pounds of food 8 miles during a meal rush, but the guy did me a solid, I have to admit.)

So here's my first actual topic. Huzzah.

A few days ago, I was given a delivery, nothing unusual about the delivery itself until I got there. I rocked up to the house; the mother and kids just so happened to have been in the car behind me and they pulled into the driveway (woo perfect timing). I grab the pizzas and get out of the car, and waited for them to sort themselves out (the mom has bags of shopping to put in the house, both kids are trying to have a conversation with her at the same time, etc).

I noticed that they'd clearly emigrated over to Australia from Britain pretty recently; the mother had a very distinctive British accent. So you can imagine my surprise when in the middle of the conversation, the mother turns to me quickly and says ""GIVE US JUST A SECOND MATE"". Instant fake Australian accent. The father comes out of the house to pay for the order, and he's got a fake Australian accent on too when speaking to me too, because I heard him revert back to British when speaking with his wife. The kids have something in between. They weren't sarcastic or anything- they were very passable and I wouldn't have picked them as fake accents if I hadn't already heard them speaking to themselves. I didn't call them out on it; I thought it was rather amusing.

It got me thinking, though. Why would someone feel the need to put on the change of accent, and pretend to be from somewhere that they aren't? In Australia, I wouldn't have thought appearing to be British would be much of a problem - here's a few Australian Bureau of Statistics numbers to chew on...

Country of birth 
- Australia - 15,017,847 - 69.8% 
- England - 911,593 - 4.2%

Ancestry 
- English - 7,238,533 - 25.9% 
- Australian - 7,098,486 - 25.4%

Source: http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/0	

But then again, I'm in a very sheltered part of the world, hell a sheltered part of Australia even, and 99.9% of the people I've met are very laid back about ones country of origin.


So, I guess my question is, how common is this elsewhere?

One day, about a year after I was hired, Brian got a brilliant idea to run his side business out of the store.  He was a pretty small-time pot dealer when he wasn't running the shop and came up with a ""brilliant"" idea to combine sales and distribution while he was on the clock. 

Every so often, he would get a call on his cell, drop everything and run to the office, slamming the door and talking in hushed tones.  Minute or 2 later, there would be a comped order placed and Brian would get super defensive about the pizza box until it was delivered.  He sold his bag-of-weed pizzas for a while and thought his system was fool proof.

One day, he learned of the gaping flaw in his plan:the new girl, a fairly attractive 19 year old who will be known as Jenna.  It was a particularly busy night and we were pretty slammed.  Jenna, who was not yet privy to Brian's side business, dropped a pizza destined for a group of stoned-looking teenagers who were waiting in the lobby.  Jenna didn't want to keep walk in customers waiting for too long, so she started looking through recently boxed deliveries for a similar pizza.  Brian was distracted by something and wasn't guarding his ""special"" pizza.  Wouldn't you know it, the ""special pizza"" was the same as what the kids had ordered.

Jenna swaps the labels, gives them the pizza and sends them on their way.  When the remake was done, she boxed it in the special box and put it back on the hot rack.  When Brian finished whatever it was he was doing, he grabs his special delivery and heads out.  20 minutes or so later, he comes back absolutely furious.  He was grilling all of our drivers to find out where the weed went.

We didn't know whee it went until later that night, as I was about to clock out and go home.  One of the stoner kids came back in, asking for another pizza like what he got earlier and stealthily palmed me a $20 tip for the awesome pizza from earlier.  I put his order in the system and head home with a $20 heavier wallet.

Turns out, the kid got his pizza and flipped out about having no weed in the box.  Him and Brian got into a fairly intense argument which ended up with an agreement being made.  Brian would sell them weed if they promised never to set foot in the store again and never speak of this to anybody.  Ever.

And so it was, Brian's side business ended without police intervention.  Dude got super lucky it went to the obviously stoned customer and didn't go to the uptight, conservative church or any of our other 'normal' customers.  Pretty sure that would have ended very, very badly for him.

I rush over to this address. Doesn't exist either. I call again. I ask them to say it slowly. Our call center and Myself got it wrong.

""You don't have to do that, I really appreciate it.""

""$20 tip it is!""

I turn back and she's holding my pizza bag. That voice in my head is like ""Just go, the store will never notice. It's not worth whatever is going to happen.""

I get the pizza bag from one and I turn around and the other one (somehow) is between me and the door. She holds out her arms and says ""Can I get a hug, Pizza Man?""

I regretfully go in for the hug, and as I'm trying to escape her death grasp, I see her laughing and leaning in to try to kiss me.

I turn my head and she nails me right on the side of my face. It was sloppy and wet. Like a snail trail. ugh.

One of the regulars never tipped, the other tipped pretty well. It was very close by so I didn't mind too much. 
 
One day, there was a small complication with the order. Three people were ordering together, two of them with credit cards. It was our policy to charge $1.00 for CC orders on delivery. I don't know why, but they were pretty insistent. The person who had the $1.00 on their bill called to cancel. Rather than re-run the remaining card, my boss told me to ask her to add $1.00 to the tip to cover it. 
 
So I get to the school and go to the front desk. The front desk woman is usually the one who orders- she is also the one who doesn't tip. She didn't order this time though. I ask if she knows who ordered, and she did not. I try calling the number the customer gave us and the number they called from (by checking back at the store.) Dead ends. My boss had also neglected to get their names, as I think she assumed it was one of the two regulars that had called in the order, but this was not the case.
 
A little annoying, but I am in the front office. I ask if she can call over the intercom. She says no, to my surprise. She doesn't want to disrupt the class. Which I can kind of understand, but also, it would take ten seconds. 
 
I was getting annoyed at this point and I ask her what she can do for me. She basically shrugs me off. So I decide I'm going to have to go door to door in the school to try and find who ordered the food. I leave the office and knock on the first occupied classroom I see. They didn't order and don't know who did. I'm about to talk to the second teacher when the woman from the office shouts down at me that I can't just walk around the school. I tell her that since she's not helping me, I pretty much have to. 
 
Luckily the second teacher knew who ordered. The first woman came, paid cash, and went on her way. The CC lady managed to take some fifteen minutes to come find her food, then could not get her head around the concept of just putting a dollar in the tip section (in addition to whatever else she wanted to tip, I added optimistically). Spent a good five minutes trying to get this through her head and was on the verge of just paying it myself when she finally relented. 
 
All told, it took about half an hour from the time I parked my car to complete the delivery. ",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_19y7g4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/19y7g4/probably_my_worst_delivery_the_elementary_school/,

The two people actually live in the two separate apartments, but we were very obviously just trying to get our two free pizzas at the same time. 

So we placed our orders and the grand total was about $5 for the delivery fees. Usually when I get free things in these situations I calculate what the cost would have been at full price and tip accordingly. I decided to ignore the pizza price/tip size ratio though and just asked my friends to donate $1 or $2 to the tip pool and see what we could come up with.

I work for a small chain of pizzerias in a pretty decent neighborhood. On most days, I absolutely love my job. I make good money, get to meet lots of people, and have awesome hours. 

I usually do between 10-15 deliveries a night (three hours shifts, woop), which means I make anywhere from 40-80 bucks, which is pretty awesome for only a couple hours of work. However most customers live within spitting distance of the place and usually order it to be picked up.

Yesterday was Valentine's Day, which is a HUUUUUGE day for us (we have a heart shaped pizza). The dinner rush starts at 5, and all the drivers show up (I think there was six of us). After knocking out the deliveries from people that ordered before the lunch rush, we all returned about the same time, only to find out that the quoted/estimated delivery time was two and a half hours, almost my entire shift.

For most places this would be because there's tons of queued deliveries, but for us, there was only 10 delivery orders placed, and even though those people called first, they have less of a priority than people who come pick it up (which was about an hour wait).

We had drivers in the back get the ingredients from the fridge and make a makeshift prep table and make all the delivery orders, while the rest of us just did stuff like fold boxes and sweep up (we couldn't really help make pizzas since the back is really small and we didn't have the room for another table).

All the drivers sat in the back for two hours waiting for enough room in the ovens to clear for the deliveries (which had already been made and sitting for about an hour), they all came out at once (there was probably closer to 20 total at the time) and we were off.

When the drivers got back, the place went from potential-fire-hazard-crowded to a ghost town in a matter of only a few minutes, each of us with 3 or 4 deliveries. I got one $2 tip. Sucks man :(

I had to drive down a road in the woods for a while, before the driveway, which was long and bendy and *dark*.

I actually saw some people through the window, deep in the house, so I knocked on the window, but nobody acknowledged me. I waited a little bit longer and then decided to go grab my cell phone from the car so I could call them. The house was a big log-cabin-type thing with a porch, which I was parked right in front of. It was silent outside. The whole thing was just making me sort of nervous. I never had any reason to feel scared, but there were times when I'd be at a house, at night, in the dark alone, thinking how easy it'd be for somebody to purposely lead me here. The fact that no one was answering even though they were there, and expecting a pizza, made me really uncomfortable.

At that moment, the front door opened and someone said, ""Hey, sorry, we had music on, couldn't hear ya!"" and I heard the voices of a bunch of people chatting and laughing and so I figured it was safe. I warily walked past the man on the porch and gave them the pizza and got the money and then dashed back to my car, leaving very quickly.

Hello TFTPG, it's that time again.  Late night's been picking up, the customers have been drunk, and the stories have been funny.  Here's 2 for you guys.

--------
**I wanna be your ~~Shakira~~ Ninja Turtle**

So it was your average night, nothing out of the ordinary.  Deliveries come and go, customers enter and leave, pizzas get made, tips get tipped...  You get the idea.  

Anyways, a delivery order comes in.  I make it, cook it, cut it, and send it out for delivery.  Time goes by, and our driver comes back, laughing his ass off.  Apparently, this customer decided to answer the door in what can only be described as half a step above a ticket for indecent exposure were he in public.  Many laughs were had, and processing the receipt happens.

It's here that we notice that in addition to the tip, [our delivery guy has been given a note.](http://imgur.com/jQqfp8n)

Cue hysterical laughter from my boss and I, a thorough dose of WTF from the driver, and a prompt taping up of the note for preservation of all time.

------

**Of Irishmen and Ketchup**

As I'm sure many of you were aware, yesterday (a sunday) was Drinko-de-Mayo.  Naturally, this means (almost) everyone goes out on the night before and gets royally shithoused at the bars, then has sloppy drunk pizza to finish off the night.  

As you can imagine, things were busy.  Nothing that we couldn't keep up with, but it was fairly busy.  A group of irishmen came in at one point; one of these men will be the focus of our story.  I'll call him Paddy McShitfaced, because that's exactly what he was.  PMS, here, was what I like to call ""infinite wallet"" drunk.  You know the type; drunk to the nines, refusing to acknowledge this fact, and spending money like he's the heir to the Guinness brewery.  PMS here decides to buy a whole pizza's worth of slices.  No argument from me; box 'em up,  take the cash, hand 'em over, and fuck right off.  

After an initial rush, it's died down a bit.  PMS and his friends are sitting in the ""dining room,"" being drunken assholes, eating pizza and whatnot.  PMS is FAR more drunk than the rest of them.  He's sitting on a stool, but the way he's moving about on it, it didn't look like he'd be there for long.  I was hoping that his face would have a nice introduction with our tile floors, but it was not meant to be.  

At this point, I'm finishing up some cleaning and checking off things for our nightly closing checklists.  PMS comes up to the counter, mumbles something in heavily Irish-accented Drunkenese, and by some miracle, conveys that he wants some ketchup.  We, unfortunately for him, do not have ketchup.  I tell him ""Sorry, we don't have any.""

Oh no.

In the most perfectly accented, beautifully said sentence I've ever heard, PMS says to me ""Are you taking the piss, mate?""  He said it so well, I think even [Brick Top would have been proud.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WcG3JRIF05w#t=192s)

Unfortunately, that would be the last (semi)-coherent sentence I'd get out of him.  At this point, PMS has flown into a drunken rage.  Words are coming out of his mouth, though thanks to the heavy dose of heritage and tequila, I can't understand a damn thing he's saying.  I think the general gist of it was ""FUCK YOU MATE, GIVE ME SOME GODDAMN KETCHUP.""  Because, clearly, yelling at me is going to make a bottle of Heinz appear out of fucking nowhere.

PMS and I go back and forth, him demanding ketchup, myself telling him that we don't have any, and lack the processing facilities to create some on a moment's notice.  At this point, PMS' friends have decided to try and calm him down, to no avail.  PMS is still making a scene, and it's at this point that my manager (whom I will refer to as Angela, because anonymity) informs his friends that they need to leave.

Now, let's just pause for a second so that I can paint you a picture.  Angela is a 20-something, 5' 4"" girl (Though she could totally kick my ass in a fight, girl's scrappy).  PMS had to have been at least 6' 2"", 240lbs of pure, unadulterated, drunken asshole.

PMS does not take kindly to this.  He steps towards Angela, who was behind the counter, and acts like he might take a swing or something at her.  At this point, I've decided enough is enough.  I say to him ""You take another step towards her, and I'm calling the cops.""  This had 2 consequences.  First, it got PMS away from Angela, which is what I intended.  Secondly, PMS interprets that as my request for a boxing match.  PMS comes over to where I am behind the counter, and starts shouting about how ""Y'WANA FUCKIN HAVA GO, MATE?""  Cue arm swinging and such, lights being smacked (seriously, how are these things still intact?), and more macho bullshit.  I reply with ""No, but I've got no problem sending you to jail for the night.""  

Thankfully, it is at this moment that his friends have somehow convinced him to leave the store with them.  PMS stumbles over to where his box is, grabs it, continues shouting about god-knows-what, and with a final ""FUCK YOU,"" leaves.  Once outside, however, PMS decides that rather than finish the pizza he paid for, it would be better off being half-assedly tossed at the window next to me, and left on the ground.  He proceeds to do so, and earns a solid middle finger from myself.

A few minutes later, one of PMS' friends comes back in, apologizing profusely for the disturbance, and actually goes outside and cleans up the mess that his friend made.  Pretty nice guy, if I say so myself.

Her: I'm so sorry sir. Let me go call my manager to get this sorted out. 

Me: It's okay, I'll take it anyway. 

Her: But, it's not the right pizza.

Me: Y'all busy tonight?

Her: Yes sir. 

Me: Pizza's pizza. 

I hand her a $20 on a $12 pizza, tell her to keep the change, and let her leave. I call up the store, let the manager know what was wrong, and tell him that his driver handled it well, and I did not want to have to make her drive back out here when they are busy.

1375129118.0,74,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,1jaskd,[UPDATE] So I got into a car accident during work the other day...,92,18,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1jaskd/update_so_i_got_into_a_car_accident_during_work/,"For those of you not familiar with my story so far, you can read it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1j706n/so_i_got_into_a_car_accident_during_work_the/)

 So yesterday was my first day back at since my car was totaled on the job. I had missed a few days of work at this point and was slightly on edge because I didn't know what ""gossip"" or anything my coworkers knew, but on a serious note I was worried how I would act under stress or if my driving would be alright. I also had a plan to talk to my boss about moving forward there so I had to fit that into my shift at some point.

 It was busy right when I walked in, so I had to put whatever worries I had out of my head, at least for the time being. My first order back was to a new development area that had yet to be added to either the store's map, or google maps, so that was fun to figure out. After talking to a few coworkers about the location, I was on my way just trying to spot the street in a general area I was semi familiar with. It turned out to be a new swimming pool and as I was handing the new customer the food I realized I'd forgotten his salad. I apologized and told him I would be right back with it. As I was leaving, he ran up to me and told me his daughter had dropped one of the pizza's and asked me to call the store to see what we could do. In a panic since I knew we were busy I told him the best thing to do was to call the store himself so he could get the replacement out asap. In a way I was relieved because I had to go get his salad anyway so bringing another pizza made it less obvious that I had messed up. 

 When I get back to the store I'm immediately asked what happened to that pizza, so I told them they dropped it on accident. I was then told by my condescending boss that in the future, I should be the one to call about these kinds of things, not the customer, because they trust the driver. I told them I understood and tried to explain it was just stress from being back that caused me to work worse than I usually do. I offered to take the pizza and another order close by when they were ready so I just had to wait around the store while it was super busy. The other order I had to take also had a salad that I had to make, but I wasn't told about it by the kitchen until the order was ready so that delayed me even further, causing more condescending looks from my boss. It hadn't started out well.

 The rest of my shift was relatively easy from there, aside from a $250 12 large pizza order that took a while but really wasn't that bad. My co workers asked about my car situation throughout the night, and I updated people up to the point where I wasn't given much hours this week. A few of the nicer drivers ended giving or switching some shifts with me so I got some good hours back this next week so I was pretty happy and thankful about that. Adjusting to my temporary rental car was kind of weird, but is the grand scheme of things pretty minor.

 Towards the end of the night (I was closing) I was looking for an opportunity to talk to my boss and act out on some advice I was given from some of the fine people in this sub. On a bit of a dramatic note, this women who used to work there came into our bar as we were getting near closing and she and my boss were the only one's in the bar. Apparently my boss and her had an affair when she used to work there so the night was getting kind of weird. He started rushing us to close ASAP (which was about an hour or so early) which is very rare for him, so we got increasingly sketched out. I've seen his wife and kids in the store before so I really just wanted to leave but I knew I had to talk to him. When I did go up to him as I was leaving, I ""thanked"" him for giving me less hours than usual so I could recover, but that I'd like to work more so I can start raising money towards buying a new car (I know insurance will get most of it but this whole thing still makes money tight) and making up for the hours I missed when I was recovering. Everything I said was either responded with ""uh huh"" or ""ok"" or ""yep"" as he clearly just wanted us to leave so he could do whatever with this women, so I left.

My pizza place is in a fairly sketchy neighborhood. We try and be fairly permissive with our customers, who often arrive drunk to pick up pizzas, or smell like herbal supplements, or accuse our maglite toting drivers of ""comin' to break out windows.""

But.

We have some regulars who order the absolute minimum (eight dollars) they can for delivery. They live maybe two blocks away, so nobody cares about driving there.

Until a couple of nights ago. They showed up after our lobby was closed trying to order a pickup. They walked in the employee door, and when I shooed them out, they tried to get it delivered to the parking lot. When I shut that down, and told them just to go home and we'd bring it to them there, they got suspiciously quiet and didn't order.

The next night, while I wasn't working, they ordered delivery again, as usual. They ordered an 18"" supreme, some wings, some soda, etc. Must be having a party, or something.

Driver brings it over and comes back, visibly freaked the fuck out, without the payment for the order or the bag. Jeepers.

He tells us that when these guys opened the door, they said, and I quote, ""What up white boy? Give us the food or we'll cut you."" And threatened him with a knife.

Hilariously, almost all of the people at that house are white, and Ortega himself told me he was ""half white, half Mexican, is that why you won't serve me?"" 

Ummmm.

We obviously are not taking orders from them anymore and the cops are on it, but in the mean time, they keep calling trying to trick someone into taking their order.

One night I took a pizza to a familiar house, and they were in the garage, a guy just walked out from the side door to the garage and since its a garage (which I'm so used to just going in) I simply knocked, and walked in. 
Of course, I forgot this was also the house with suspiciously expensive cars and that curious smell. I think it was about 7, big black guys stare at me... a skinny white boy who realized he just walked in to see them partitioning and weighing out quantities of I don't know what (did my very best to keep my eyes to myself)
To my surprise, they were pretty polite to a guy who just did something REALLY stupid. They... quickly... paid for the food (one of them insisted that I get a tip, even though the delivery was a little late) and rushed me back out.

* On one delivery, which was so close to the border of our delivery area the computer wouldn't register the address of the customer, I had the pleasure of being the one to take it to them. I get all the way out there, which was probably a good fifteen or twenty miles, and the lady who answered the door gives me this deadpan stare and without even responding to my greeting says ""I can't tip you."".


* I had this other delivery, for a factory worker who told us she wanted her delivery at a specific time, I show up a couple of minutes early, trying to be nice, and end up waiting for ten minutes having no idea where this person was. She finally arrives, and everything went well, aside from her payment. The amount owed was wasn't to the dollar, and instead of tipping me a couple of cents, she borrowed some coins off a co-worker, leaving me empty handed.


* On one glorious day of marketing, I was putting fliers on the windshields of cars in the parking lot, (I apologize to anyone this annoys or offends), this lady catches me as I'm putting it on her windshield (she was coming out of the store so I had no idea it belonged to her) and she literally screams at me ""DON'T YOU DARE"" gives me a glare like I just ran over her dog, and proceeds to go on a several minute rant on how she hates Dominoes.

* Also, I had a delivery where I forgot the customer's Dr. Pepper. I apologized profusely and offered to refund it, etc. They turned the offer down, tipped me well over $20, and offered me a ""bowl"". To this day I don't know what a ""bowl"" is...

* I can't go into many details on this one, but the owner of my store liked to put it into the computer that I earned more tips than I had, but wouldn't actually pay that amount. He also liked to skimp on paying what we actually earned hourly, either altering how long we had been clocked in for, or asking us to clock out early and keep working, etc. He would also fire for working overtime.

* This one is also a fun one. I was swapped from delivery to working entirely marketing. By doing so, I had zero opportunity to earn any tips, right? Well, because of this, I would clock in as an insider, so that I earned the correct hourly pay. My clock-in permissions were altered to where I had no choice but to clock in as a driver, essentially causing me to earn $2 less per our... I had a lot of fun playing my 3DS those days.

* The schedule was posted every week, and my schedule generally meant nothing. Sometimes I was scheduled and was told not to come that day, and some days I wasn't scheduled and ended up staying all day. I pretty much had to ask the manager daily if he wanted/needed me. Kinda ruined any planning for fun...

* And lastly, I had a delivery to a friend of mine's house. I delivered it, and received no tip, much to my surprise. This happened multiple times, and the family even started asking for me to deliver it personally...

* Oh, and I thought I should mention this as well. I was fired without any notice, I simply wasn't scheduled anymore, (I checked every day or so, or had my friend check for me, and even asked the manager but never got any reply). The manager was also terminated, and the new manager had no idea I was even an employee. I found out a week later, from my estranged mother that I had been ""terminated"". The new manager offered my job back, but I had had enough at that point. (She also wanted to schedule me for the only hours I didn't want)

The house was on a really dark street and I couldn't read the numbers and I was starting to trip so driving was difficult.  I find the house and there's old, broken kids toys everywhere in the yard.  It was starting to remind me of a horror movie.  I knocked on the door and it immediately slammed open to reveal a waspy middle-aged woman who looked like a skeleton standing there.  There were half a dozen kids yelling and running around the house like caffeinated wolverines a couple of young adults dry humping on the couch.  I couldn't move because the scene was so surreal.  The lady barked how much at me and I just handed her the ticket.  She gave me exact change, not bills, twenty something in change.  I didn't fucking count it I just grabbed it and left.

**Drunken Santas and Narcissism at its Finest**

So this one happened just this Saturday.  It was a slow night, just my manager and I getting ready for the standard late-night rush.  It just so happened that there was a barcrawl going on that night, and as a result, there were many drunken fools stumbling around in Santa hats/suits.  Naturally, several of them came in for the staple alcohol-absorbing slice of pizza.  Nothing too remarkable from these fools, aside from one woman who decided to dress up as Zombie Santa, and felt the need to reiterate the fact that she had, in fact, dressed up as Zombie Santa every third sentence.  Annoying, but nothing especially remarkable.

So it's getting towards the time when the rush usually kicks off, and we're finishing up preparations.  A car pulls up out front, the door opens, and in walks a woman who had to have been in her mid 40's.  What was different about her, though, was that despite the fact that the temperature was in the mid 30's, she was wearing a very tight, short dress, and draped in [a fur coat that was about as ridiculously over-sized as this.](http://i.imgur.com/94BJi.jpg)  It was then that we noticed that she had some 20-something year old dude with her, recording literally everything she did with an iPhone.  She refused to acknowledge us for a bit, obviously drunk, and posed for her personal paparazzi while my manager and I looked on with expressions not far off from [this.](http://i.imgur.com/6KlJl.jpg)  

Anyways, our pizza princess finally decides to order, and makes a spectacle over deciding which slice she wants, using the opportunity to point at literally every single one with the intention of showing off the (likely fake) jewelry decorating her wrist.  Princess finally decides what she wants, pays for it, and leaves in relatively calm fashion, though not before striking a few more poses for her paparazzi.  Confusion ensues.

-------------

**Drunken Politics and Pizza**

This happened the weekend following the 2012 Election.  As I'm sure you all know, Obama won.  This story starts like all the others; my manager and I preparing for the late night rush, nothing too out of the ordinary.  Anyhow, the rush starts, and it's not a particularly busy night.  A few locals come in, we serve 'em, they linger/leave, and everyone's happy. 

Now, remember how I said that we get a lot of 40-50 year-olds reliving the glory days?  We have a few of those who live here year round.  One guy in particular stands out.  You know that old guy at the bar who tries to pick up the younger girls, and just comes across as a creep?  Yeah, we've got his oompa-loompa cousin.  Imagine [Chevy Chase](http://i.imgur.com/nND4I.jpg) with a spray tan that would make the cast of Jersey Shore jealous, and you've got this guy.

Anyways, Creepzilla comes in, drunk to the nines.  I greet him, ask him how it's going?  This would turn out to be mistake number one.  Cue verbal diarrhea of anti-Obama, pro-Romney blathering.  I ignore the most of it, until he asks me who I voted for.  I try and dodge the question by saying ""I prefer not to discuss politics at work.""  To him, this immediately means that I voted for Obama, and he starts going on about how Obama's ruining the country, socialist, etc etc; your standard Fox News rhetoric.  I shrug it off, and keep working.

Creepzilla, on the other hand, starts talking to my manager.  A bit of background is necessary here.  My manager is gay, and it's pretty obvious to anyone with an even semi-functioning gaydar.  Now, Creepzilla asks my manager who he voted for.  My manager says something similar to what I did, with Creepzilla following up with the question ""Well, what's important to you?""  Manager replies with ""My rights as a human being.""

OH **HELL** NO.

Creepzilla proceeds to go on a rant about how human rights were less important to the economy, job, herp, derp, etc.  Basically, he told my manager that gay rights are the least important thing for this country right now.  

It was here that I almost punched him in the face.  The only thing stopping me was the fact that I do enjoy being employed.  I don't know how my manager didn't leap over the counter and beat his ass into submission.  Literally the most offensive thing I've ever seen/heard, and I'm not gay.  

Creepzilla eventually left, and was thoroughly cursed out after closing.  I didn't think it was possible to chain together as many variants of the word ""fuck"" as was done.

I was nearing the end of my shift (PJ's), and had a quick order out to a complex about 4 minutes north of our store.  I grab the order, check out the contents, (thin crust, 1 garlic cup, extra pepperoncini's), take out the order, and get a 5 dollar tip on a 13 dollar order!  I come back to the store, see nothing else going out and I'm 4th in line, so I go to clean the bathroom and take out the trash.  

After taking out all the trash, I go to check out from the manager, and notice the address I just took the order to on the screen and ask what's up.  My manager tells me that the customer called the store, complaining that his order didn't have either his garlic cup, or the extra pepperoncini's that he ordered.  Our front end had offered him to credit his for free pepperoncini's and a free garlic cup for his next order, but he said that wasn't good enough and wanted to speak to the manager, whom he told he would never tip a driver again.

So I told the manager that I was the one who took the order, and that I had definitely check the order for the ""missing"" items before even leaving the store and they were all in the box.  He said he would give the customer a call-back, checked me out, and I went home for the night.

I know my manager believes me when I told him the sides were there, so I'm not expecting (or at least hoping not) to be disciplined or anything, I'm just more frustrated at customers who think they can lie in order to get free things.

Fast forward ten minutes and I answer the phone back at the shop. The guy I've just delivered to has a problem with his pizza, says its undercooked or something, so I let my boss know and he sends me with a replacement.
I get back to the guys house and he comes to the door with his box, only two slices left in it, yelling and screaming about how of he gets sick he's going to sue us. At this point this douche is all but shooting the messenger, or in this case the pizza boy, telling me that I and my boss are fucking useless, and keeps on rambling. I just give him his pizza and leave.

Back at the shop, the phone rings again. It's the same dick trying to feed all his douchey friends for the price of one Pizza. My manager answers this time and tries to smooth things over (obviously wanting to look after his ""good customers"") Another replacement is made, and the boss gives me a garlic bread to give him to make up for the situation.

I was taking a delivery to the ghetto part of town (also the very edge of our delivery range). When I arrived, it all seems really normal. The location was a church (a very beat down church, but nothing looks nice in this part of town) and across the street was a bunch of guys playing a baseball game in a well lighted field. My immediate assumption was this big order was for the guys in the game.

Well, I got out of the car, took the order out of the trunk and started walking towards the church when I see two guys come out from the side of the church. I ask them if they were the people who ordered and they told me the person was inside and to knock on the church door. So, I did. From the inside, I could hear someone playing the piano and singing and a little kid ask if it was the pizza delivery guy. I said yes and he responded, ""Okay, one sec"". This entire time, the guy I talked too was standing next to me, knocking on the door as well. After a minute of waiting, the dude just straight up snatches the bag out of my hands and takes off with it and his two friends. I get into my car, call the restaurant, then call the sheriffs department. I gave a statement to the deputy and then go back to the restaurant. I found out later that the church is abandoned, the number we had doesn't lead to anywhere and it was most likely a set up.

Not dancing, not really even moving with the beat of the electro-rap they're playing, just gyrating her ass up and down, side to side, as fast a possible. She continues to do this for the entirety of the song.

A solid 3 minutes later, she gets off the stage and walks directly over to me. She asks if I'm from ""sandwich shop"" and what the total is. She then attempts to haggle with me over the price for the food, which was about $11.00 if I remember correctly. After explaining tax and delivery fee, which she forgot to add into her math she worked out before I got there (which I like to imagine she was working out while she was on stage) she reaches into her bikini top and hands me $13 in ones and tells me to keep the change.

**The cougar in 205**

About two months into my time as a driver I started picking up on a pattern of orders every Friday night around the same time to the same apartment.  Pretty much like clockwork around 7:00 and order for a medium veggie lovers, a small order of breadsticks, and a 2L of soda would come in for apartment #205 in one of the apartments a few miles from campus.

This particular apartment complex was a mix of older college students (*think grad students*) and young working professionals. There were also a few random older people.  Anyway, I digress.

Most of the time my nights were a blur of delivery after delivery.  Never really remembered places or faces.  However, once I would pick up on a pattern for a regular, I usually went out of my way to bump them up my priority list and usually gave an extra smile and maybe slip them some extra coupons or something.

First time I really took notice of the woman in #205 she looked like she had just gotten from home and changed into something comfortable.  Sadly this was in the days before yoga pants so it was sweatpants and a loose t-shirt.  She was attractive, not drop-dead-gorgeous but just your typical grown up ‘girl-next-door.’  If I had to guess she was probably about 5’6” or 5’7” because she was about eye-to-eye with me standing up a step.

So we exchanged pleasantries, I offered up some extra coupons (*dork move, I know*) and went about the rest of my night.

The following week she answered the door in a pair of tights and a loose shirt.  When she bend over to put the pizza down on the steps behind her I got a nice view of her spandex-covered ass and even a shot up her shirt to some under-boob.

I was kinda distracted but managed to give her a smile, collected my money, and left.

I ended up missing a friday shift the following week, but the next week I rang her doorbell and there was a delay.  I didn't mind waiting and after a a few minutes she answered the door in a robe with a towel wrapped around her hair.  She still had a sheen of water across her face and arms.

Like before she bent over and placed the pizza on the steps behind her. This time I got a flash of bare ass.  Sadly it was too dimly lit to see much else.  However, when she spun around her robe came undone and her left tit flopped out.  She quickly covered herself up and giggled.  She then muttered something about not owing me a tip.

I just stood there like a deer in headlights.  At this point I was 19, had only ever been with one girl.  Totally missed how hard this woman was coming on to me.  She was probably late 30s... so maybe not a *real* cougar, but to a 19 year old she was.

Near the end of the night, I get an order through for a pizza, couple of sides and drinks, total comes to £21.20. Fair enough, I think, and I prepare £3.80 change as they're going to likely give me £25 (but I have an extra fiver in case of £30). I always assume they won't tip because this is in the UK and is a whole other topic.

So I go there and the guy gives me £40 (2 x £20)

What the hell. I'm not a walking till, why would you think I have nearly £20 as change? And of course you don't have anything smaller.. fucks sake, I'm not getting paid to come here twice, you know.

Fine, whatever, you need £10 back. ""I'll be back in a bit"", I say. I get back, another delivery. I take it and when I return to the store, I remember the first guy needs his change. So I go there, give him his change (""no, it's no bother, have a great night!"") and get back.

A few hours later, another order comes through. Guess what, it's only the same house again. I hope and pray, but alas, it's me who has to take it. Thankfully, it's paid, but I can't help thinking ""this is the third time I've gone to this house in an evening...""

Long rant.",82,14,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1dgvwx/i_just_want_to_vent_about_work_without_getting/,"At my job lately a lot of hours are getting cut, people are quitting, getting fired, lives are being affected, stress levels are very high, and yet the pizzas must be made. Lately, the In-stores have been getting more vocal towards the Drivers, because they feel that they do more work than Drivers do, while the Drivers are in the store. Some Drivers are great, they help out a lot, get on make, cut, dock/slap, re-stock, whatever, without being told, but since the anti-obamacare policies are starting to kick in, some of those great drivers are no longer, they are smart enough to move onto bigger and better jobs. 


So, ""The Replacements"" are good guys, but there are some that have been brought over to the Darkside. We have this one guy (he is like a cancer that won't go away), who got hired the same day I did (8 months ago; I'm about to get into management, while he can barely answer the phone), let's call him ""Mr. Purple""... well Mr. Purple happens to be one of those people who has some kind of disability and plays it up to no end-- he wants special treatment, doesn't want to contribute, wants to get out EXACTLY when the schedule says his shift is over, never does anything right, and anything he touches turns to complete and utter shit. He once mis-boxed so many pizzas, that I was re-making them for like 15 minutes (it takes me &gt;2 minutes to make a pepperoni from sauce to oven), IMHO, the guy is a walking embodiment of pure incompetence. Even the most patient managers I have ever known have lost their shit with him after only working with him for one 4 hour shift. I have no idea why he is still employed there, I hate it, I hate when he works a shift with me, because I just know that it will be a horrible time.


Recently, Mr. Purple has began infecting the other new drivers with his attitude of entitlement. He believes that he is entitled to his job, and entitled to not do anything but get pizzas to their destination. He is super cut-throat on dispatch, to the point where he will skip other drivers, re-label boxes, drop pizzas ""accidentally"" (*of course*), and do nothing except literally stand there and wait by the cut table for a delivery to be ready, meanwhile phones are ringing, people are running back and forth, taking care of business. He is a statue amidst the chaos. and what do the other new-hired Drivers do? They copy him, they just want to stand around and shoot the shit, while they calmly fold boxes over and over, waiting for a pizza to deliver.


Mind you not all of them are like this, there are some that are hungry to learn, hungry to get things done (maybe just hungry for a pizza!). As a soon-to-be shift manager, I am trying to get those guys up to speed on different aspects of pizza store operations, at the same time. I don't like leaving anyone behind (prior-service, we get it engrained into our psyche that no-man gets left behind, you are only as strong as the weakest link, yaddayadda) 

Basically, I sense an impending storm on the horizon, with certain new healthcare policies taking effect, people quitting left and right, new hires not being properly trained, and managers that only care about their bonuses, becoming a shift manager is going to be a tough cookie to swallow. I don't know if I can or want to deal with it, especially for the ""wonderful"" amount of pay I will be getting.


Oh yeah, and to Mr. Purple, according to the VA, I'm 80% disabled, I rarely ask for anything close to special treatment. I have a bad back and a bad knee, among other things. Here's a straw, suck it up.

Pretty rough experience.,99,36,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/16r96e/my_story_from_december_pretty_rough_experience/,"It's mid-to-late December, and I'm making deliveries on a pretty steady night. Not too slow, but not too busy. Around 7:00PM, I'm making my way back to the Chinese restaurant I work at heading east as I see flashing police cruiser lights speeding away around the curve just about a quarter mile ahead. I think nothing of it because that happens frequently in my town. 

As I get closer to the restaurant, I see another cruiser speeding down a tiny 20-MPH road into a neighborhood across the street from where I work. I knew it wasn't the same cruiser I saw from before, because I couldn't have caught up to him. 

Now, this neighborhood is a retirement neighborhood with a lot of elderly people, and firetrucks and ambulances go into this gated community on a daily basis.

*But never do police.*

By now, I'm intrigued. I've always been fascinated by police and other emergency responders' work, and I became curious about just what was going on inside the neighborhood. 

I walk back to the kitchen where the orders that are ready to be delivered are, and I grab three orders. One is for that neighborhood. I strap the bagged orders in with my passenger seatbelt, and I'm on my way. I make it to the guard shack at the entrance of the neighborhood and I'm expecting friendly small-chat with the guard before I make the delivery (Residents frequent my restaurant, and my ex-girflriend also lived in that neighborhood, so the guards knew me pretty well).

I pull up to the guard shack and I see one of my favorite guards. 

I roll down my window, and read out the address to her, and, with a very straight face, waives me on. I begin to think that this is odd, but I shrug it off and went on through. 

I turn onto the street, and discover where all the police cars went. At least four cruisers, two firetrucks, and one ambulance block the street with their flashers shining off of every house in sight. I'm ordered by police to turn around and get to my delivery via another route (the neighborhood is laid out weird, and there are multiple ways to get to houses). Before I leave, I snap [this picture](http://imgur.com/hr9nF) and tweet about it, wondering if my friends know about what had happened. My old band drum major from high school I knew lived on that street and I thought about texting her to see what had happened, but I decided not to. 

A gut decision that I will never regret. 

I take my other deliveries, close up the restaurant, and head home. At about 10:00PM that night, I get a call from a co-worker whose husband is the captain of patrol for my area's sheriff department. She explained that she had saw my tweet and wanted to clarify to me what had happened that night in the neighborhood. 

My drum major's father had taken the life of his wife that night, and I had just stumbled upon a murder investigation. 

My stomach was churning and my chest tightened. I physically hurt after hearing what had happened. Never once did I think that in my delivery job would I witness such a horrible act. Never once. 

**TL;DR made a delivery on a street where a man had just murdered his wife.**

Edit 1: grammar.

Edit 2: I understand that this isn't the most fascinating story. The part that I believe to be intriguing was the fact that this event hit so close to home on many different levels.

Just a quick note: this happened in the early 2000s when I was about 18.  Names have been changed (either to protect the innocent or because I don't remember them). I'm going to apologize in advance for the length, but there is a tl;dr for anyone who wants the 1 sentence version.

Quick bit of backstory: Brian decided that he was going to hire another shift manager, Holly, instead of a normal in store employee, so I was showing her the ropes on the in store work and he would show her the manager's side of things.  By the time I left, I was basically doing the 3/4 the work of a manager, had my own level 5 (manager) password, had a Papa John's jacket and windbreaker (gifts for managers at the time) and was the highest paid non-manager employee, so I can understand why he would hire someone else as a manager.  Holly and I got along pretty well and we became friends in the week or 2 I was training her.  What you should know about Holly is that she is one of those people who does whatever she wants without considering the consequences, enjoys shenanigans and is a bit of a firebug.

On my last day of work, I ended up staying til closing, ""making sure Holly was ok on her own"" (read: shooting the shit with a few of my coworkers I had become friends with).  Being my last day, I could do pretty much anything I wanted without worrying about being fired.  Among other things, I ended up climbing on top of the walkin and digging through all the stuff we had in storage.  Along with a ton of promotional stuff, I found a cache of phones, old terminals, broken printers and keyboards and the original server (it was something like a 386 CPU, 4MB memory, 100MB HDD and like 24 serial ports).  

It's 9 or 10pm and it's the 2 of us and a driver on the clock and other employees would come and go randomly to say their goodbyes and hang out while getting stoned.  As I'm digging around through the storage area over the walkin, I'm tossing stuff down to Holly.  After a nice sized pile had formed, Holly grabbed a few bucks from the till and ran down to the supermarket.  For what reason, I didn't really know, but while she was gone, I may have tossed few hot bags, a dust-encrusted pizza peel and pizza cutter in my car because it was obvious they had never (and would never) be used in the store.  When she got back, she had 2 cans of starter fluid, a shopping cart, and one of those grins that people get when they are going to do something crazy.

Without saying a word, she grabbed a few phones and printers and threw them in the cart.  Wheeling it out back, she sprayed them down with starter fluid and lit it up.  For the next hour or so, we sat in the back, tossing things onto the fire and ""writing"" on parking spaces with starter fluid and lighting it.  When we had nothing but the server left, we popped the top and sprayed the inside with as much starter fluid inside as possible.  When it got tossed onto the flames, there was a few seconds of sizzling then ***FWOOSH!*** Flames must have shot 15 or 20ft into the air.  Looking back, I realize how lucky I was because we were sitting &lt;10ft from the cart and would have been severely burned if it had been aimed at us.

When all was said and done, there was a 3-4ft wide, 1.5"" deep crater in the asphalt under the shopping cart, which had to be crowbarred out of the road and various curse words and reproductive organs burnt into the surface of the road.  I'm not exaggerating, the wheels had melted and the legs (I'm not sure what else to call them) had melted about 1"" into the asphalt.  I had the 2 drivers and 2 other employees help me use a crowbar and hammer to break this thing free.  I tried to take pictures of it, but it was dark enough my shitty cell phone couldn't get any good pics of it (see part 3 for examples of my daylight pictures).  Remember, this phone was from the late 90s or very early 2000s and was one of those sign-up-for-a-2-year-contract-and-get-a-free-flip-phone phones.  I can tell you, the contents of the cart looked worse than [this](http://i.imgur.com/2HW4CWL.jpg).

We tossed everything into the dumpster and closed the shop for the night.  It blows my mind that the fire department wasn't called about the huge, billowing black plume of smoke rising over the shopping center, illuminated by the huge sodium vapor lights in the parking lot.  That would have been exceedingly bad for my coworkers and I! 

I'm told there were questions from a few employees (Brian included) about what happened out back.  The story Holly came up with was that a few homeless guys must have started the fire and stayed the night before moving on.  Apparently no one questioned it, despite being in a middle/upper-middle class area, with very few homeless people.

About a month in, I had to go on a delivery after 2 of our drivers called in sick and another had just gotten into a car accident.  Fortunately, it was a Tuesday or Wednesday, so it was pretty dead and I was able to leave the shop with the ASM working alone.  

Anyway, it's pitch black, I get to the customer's house and start walking towards their door.  About 5ft from the porch, the motion sensor kicks on and the yard is flooded with light.  Out of the corner of my eye, I catch some slight movement.

It was a bull moose.  &lt;10ft to my left, just staring into my soul.  I had only heard stories of moose, but this was the first I had seen one in real life.  All the stories involved giving moose plenty of space and to not startle them or get between a female and her calf.  I'm a little freaked out, but press on.  

Then I see it.  Standing a foot or 2 behind the bull, partially hidden in the shrubs, a female.  Now I'm starting to panic.  I can't see the baby, but I know it has to be there.  Sure enough, to my right, just outside the range of the spot light was the baby.  I am directly between the mother and the baby.  I am sweating profusely and hyperventilating.  I run to the door and ring the bell a few times.  When they finally answer, I start stammering and rambling about moose going to trample me and practically throw the pizza in their face.  I'm sure all the blood had drained from my face as all the possible ways those moose were going to kill me on my way back to the car.  I didn't even count the money

I sprinted back to my Jeep and floored it out of the neighborhood. Thankfully there were no cops and I didn't get trampled.

Worse than almost getting trampled: motherfuckers gave me $25 check on a $24.50 tab.  Never delivered pizzas after that, until the store manager got us the contract with the school district for doing their school lunches.

Others will say whatever it takes to get their pizza fix.

* We get people calling in at least a couple times a night saying, ""But I'm just down the road from (boundary)... only a few blocks away!""  Well those boundaries are set where they are for a reason - at intersections that might take a few minutes to cross.  Going just a little bit further can really slow the drivers down.  Besides, we have to draw the line somewhere.

* Its a dumb store policy that if the customer is out of our area, we have to offer to meet them at the boundary (like in the parking lot of a store nearby).  I say this is dumb because it is bait-and-switch.  A customer placed an order expecting food to be delivered to his home, now he has to hop into a car to pick it up.  He might agree but then think it over and realize its a dumb idea, and cancel without bothering to tell us.  Not to mention, even if he does go through with it, either he or the driver is going to be waiting a few minutes at the meetup location.

I'd say 50% of these types of deliveries have problems, and it's bad service, which means lower tips on average.

* Some ""customers"" pull their own bait-and-switch.  They know they are out of the delivery area, so they give an address that's in town and tell the store the driver should call when they arrive.  When the driver makes the call he finds out they're way out of town ""but we'll give you a really big tip"".

Some drivers fall for that, I don't.  If they're willing to lie to the store, they're willing to lie to the driver.  There have been instances of a customer leading the driver on, ""just a little bit further... I guess I underestimated the distance..."" for 10-15 miles, only to stiff him when he arrives.

So, we are having a very lazy Sunday morning shift, in which I only had 5 runs total. 

Anyways, there was this really weird lady wearing black and white everything. She seemed religious since she had a lot of religious paraphernalia. I don't know if that contributes to her crazy, but it was just bizarre. She parked her car outside of the place (our business is located on a strip mall and so she was parked in the middle of driveway).  She comes up to me at the register and asks if we had any ice cream. I replied with a puzzled, ""sorry but this is a wings place."" She didn't order anything and just sat at a table talking with a young couple that were waiting on a to-go order. She leaves, in which for good, but it was actually to park her car. I thought that it may have been their mom or something so I just went back to talking with my co-workers. I turn around and see her whipping out a Chinese checkerboard (except according to a coworker walking out to get a refill, it wasn't Chinese checkers) and having these people play with her. She gave them religious medallions and stuff of the like. I knew I had to go in the back and rush out this order as quick as possible so I could get these people out of this awkwardly, uncomfortable situation. I give the order to them and the managed to get out of playing this game with her.

So the phone rings, I answer with ""hi, thanks for choosing [BRANCH], my name's hfbs, how can I help?"" as is my standard way.

A kid, sounded around 14 said ""hi hfbs"" like he knew me. I'm racking my brains, trying to think if I know the voice as it could be someone from another branch or something. I'm saved the bother as this is the conversation that followed:

Him: yeah, I ordered a pizza earlier with meatballs on..    
Me: yeees... (logging on to the system to try and find the order).   
Him: *stifles laughter* and I'm pretty sure one of the meatballs was a testicle.   
Me: -_-... I sincerely doubt it..    
Him: *trying and failing to hide laughter*    
Me: anything else I can help you with today?    
Him: *hangs up*    

Like really... I have his number in front of me and it's at my discretion to ban orders placed from it in the future. I'm just glad it was a quiet moment he decided to waste my time in.

Second story: we had a phone order come through, a CSR took it. 3 pizzas for collection, pay when they get here. That'll be ready for collection in 10-15 mins, sir. Nothing unusual about that. We make them, send them through and put them on the hot rack. That was at 7.40 tonight. At 8.50, they still haven't been collected, so I tell the CSR to ring them. They say 'oh ok, it's not us collecting them, it's a friend, but I'll let them know, thanks'. It's now 11.40 and surprise, surprise, they haven't been collected. Great, that's £40 of pizzas thrown away. Sigh...


Last tale: the phone rings, and I answer as above. I get a very angry 'well you can start by fucking sorting your fucking computer system out!' 'I beg your pardon?' I say, in shock at the sudden anger. Like, I'm perfectly happy to listen to complaints, but I won't tolerate abuse. Anyway, the guy just kinda laughs and says 'nah hah sorry, can I order a pizza for delivery please?' Like wtf? Why immediately get on my bad side if you're going to act all matey and order from me? I just don't get it..

So yeah that's my night. The asst manager left a couple hours early because her bf was being obnoxious so I'm left in the lurch on a Saturday night. Great.. -_-

I was driving my first deliver of the day and it was to a very close house that was known for good tipping so a nice start. I was making a left turn into a side street and another car ran a red light and collided with the front of my car mid turn. He must have been going around 40 mph so my car got pretty messed up, in fact it's totaled.

 Nobody was hurt so we were thankful of that, but I obviously could not continue driving that day. After talking to the other guy (who took full guilt, apologized, and ensured me that him and his insurance would take care of everything) I called my family and gf really quick to assure them I was ok, and then I called my work back and told them what had happened.

 Now my boss is a well known dumbass and is not well liked within the store, so I knew dealing with him would be a bitch. After calling him, the first thing he told me to do was to take off my car topper so it wouldn't look bad for business (understandably) but before asking if I was ok or anything. He then asked if the pizza was ok and THANKFULLY THE PIZZA WASN'T BADLY INJURED!! So he had another driver come and pick it up (who got a $10 tip, unrelated but am I entitled to that tip? not a big deal but still something). I was then told to to bring my bank back into work when I had taken care of towing my car and dealing with the police. 

 When I do go back to work a few hours later I start talking to my boss and he starts giving me complete shit advice about seeing a sketchy doctor that could write in any injury I wanted, allowing me to sue the other driver for injuries. He also said that since this effected my shift I could sue for loss of wage. While some of those may by arguably just courses of actions I could take, I believe he was distracting from seeing the store itself as a liable target.

 This was not my first pizza job, but at the other job I had, I had to register my car and show proof of insurance and what not. I believe this is common practice, but I did not have to do this at my current job because my boss is a lazy shit. I've been told that since I was on the clock during this, and on top of the stuff I just mentioned, they could be liable. I would rather not even attempt to draw the legal system into this, but our more recent interaction have caused me to reconsider.

 I went to the hospital later that night just to be safe and make sure I didn't have internal bleeding or a concussion, and it turned out I had had a concussion. I was given some pain meds and told to rest for a few days which I complied too. My next shift was 3 days after the accident so I thought I would have recovered enough to work. My boss told me to give him advanced warning if I couldn't make it, but I had been feeling so up and down I couldn't predict it.

 When the day of the shift comes around, I decide I'm not feeling well enough to go back  yet so I call him maybe 6 hours before my shift shift would start. I told him I wasn't up to working and I got yelled at over the phone about causing him a last minute headache and he angrily hung up after giving me the night off. 

 Fast forward to today and I go to check the schedule and he had given me almost half of the hours I usually have, which is frustrating because now more than ever I need to start raising money for a new car. This could be him  giving me time to rest but i would rather work until my fall semester starts. Thankfully the other driver's insurance got me a rental car for the time being so I can still work. 

 Bottom line, my first shift that I'll be going to is tomorrow and I'm gonna talk to him but I'm not sure how to approach it. I would like to keep my job but I don't have too if it means keeping my dignity.

So, this happened about 15 years ago, when I was working in a call center as a cold call telemarketer.

One shift, a sketchy chick (think trailer park queen) calls out, ""Who wants lunch?""

Of course we are all hungry at this time of day, but, since we have a crappy job, none of us have any money for lunch.  We all say so.

Trailer Park Queen says, ""Don't worry, I got it.""

Then she places a (very loud, so we can all hear) call to a large pizza chain restaurant a couple of towns over.  No way they deliver to our area.  She requests to speak to the manager.  Of course the manager isn't there at this time of day, so she asks for his name. Then she asks for the name of the manger for their restaurant right down the street from us, gets it, hangs up.

Then she calls the local chain restaurant (again, with enough volume to make sure that we can all hear what she is doing), and asks for the manager by name. Of course, we work the late shift, so she knew that there was a good chance that that manager had already gone home for the day, which she had.

She tells whoever let her know this that (manager's name) had said that, since her last pizza order was really messed up, that she should mention that the next time that she ordered, and get that order for free.

Well, long story short, it worked.

We got a steaming hot, extra large pizza for free.  Trailer Park Queen was very proud of herself as she accepted it on behalf of all of us at the call center.

Until we all let her know that we didn't approve of stealing, and that we wouldn't touch that pizza if we were starving to death!

We were all disgusted that she would even go there, and she was really proud that she ""beat the system"".

She ended up taking that (by now old and cold) pizza home to her trashy family.

The worst part is that none of us, though we all (6 of us!) really tried, could convince her that what she did was wrong.

Here's acouple stories of my days as a pizza guy
#1
So I've got about an hour left on my shift and didn't feel like driving all over so I agree to take the motel order and then come back and fold boxes. I get to the motel and realize I'm delivering to the room on the corner of the first floor, which is awesome cause I don't have to venture to far from my car. Knock on the door and say pizza guy and here ""I'll be right there"", about 10-15 seconds later there stands before me a naked man covering his junk with a towel, hopping up and down on one leg while the other has blood pouring down it onto the carpet. As calmly as I could I tell the guy to close the door and get decent, he comes back with pants on this time, I get a $3 tip and a story.
#2
There was a gated community just down the street from us and for some reason they refused to give us a remote for the front gate, which meant that I'd have to buzz them from the gate or if I was lucky I'd be able to follow one of the residents in. Well I got lucky and was able to drive right in, I got even luckier because the customer was one of the first houses. I get all of food and drinks and knock on the door, a few seconds later I'm greeted by this beautiful woman (early 20's brunette lowcut top) who takes the food and drinks and sets them on a table next to the front door, she comes back and starts making small talk/flirting (awe yeah, everyone loves the pizza guy) then grandma no bra with the see thru blouse comes to the door screaming how she never buzzed me in, tosses the money at me and slams the door. On the bright side she actually through enough money at me to where I still got tipped.
#3
I'd been delivering about 3 months at this point and hadn't experienced crazy customers yet. So it's my first delivery of the day and it's in a nice part of town, so I don't bother to roll the windows in my car up. I grab the guys order and knock on the door, hand him his pizza and drink and he hands me a $20 on a $19.92 bill and then tells me he wants the change. I tell him no problem I've got some change in my cup holder I'll be right back, walk over and lean into the car and grab a dime and as soon as I turn around the guy is right in my face demanding his change, I hand him the dime and leave. When I got back to the store I told my manager who showed me how to leave comments about the customers so other drivers knew what to expect.
#4
So it's about 8 PM on a thursday night and I'd sent out to deliver to customer who'd complained about every order they'd received from us. They'd say that we'd given them the wrong order, food was to cold, the usual b.s. complaints to get free food. My manager made sure that the order was 100% correct and told me to call her when after I delivered their food. I call back about 10 minutes later and so do they, since theirs was the only delivery I had I went straight back to the store. I see my manager is fuming, apparently everything was wrong and tastes horrible, so my manager remakes the exact order and sends me back but not before telling me that no matter what this customer is banned. So I put the pizzas into the heating bag and head back into the night. I made sure to park to where they couldn't see me coming, got out and grabbed the heating bag, made sure that it was secured tightly and started throwing it around, I did this for a solid minute and then I walked the order up to the house. They called and complained and for once they were right but they cried wolf too many times.

EDIT: I can format good. also spell good too!


**1.)** Today, a lady and her son came into my work. She stood there silent looking at the menu for a solid five minutes. She looks at me and says, “so you dont have a turkey club sandwich?” 

……no, sorry. 

“what about a chicken caesar sandwich with fresh artichoke?”

……no ma’am. 

“So….not even a tuna salad sandwich?”


…..no. 

“Do you even have mustard and mayo for your subs?”

…….no.

“Ughh what the hell kinda place is this?!?”

….Its a…. It’s a pizza place. You know, with pizza. And pizza subs. And other pizza items. Hence the company name….

“So what kind of subs can you make?”

([In my head] Were you not looking at the menu for five minute??) 
Well I can make subs that use pizza toppings. Like pizza subs. Sausage subs. Ect. 

“(smacks lips) Whatever. I don’t want anything.”

**2.)** My company offers students k-12 a special incentive to work hard in school. If they receive straight “A’s” on their report card, they can come in, show their report card and receive a small 2 topping pizza for free. Pretty simple. Straight “A’s”….free pizza.

So this lady calls the store and I answer. She sounded like one of those people who just fails at life. Like in every aspect. More so, she sounded like one of those people who should not be allowed to repopulate. Like one of those people you just know they are a terrible parent and all around terrible human being.

Here’s how the conversation went.

Me: Hi, how can I help you?

Her: Yeaa tell me bout dat strate a programm you all runnin

Me: Ok, Well if your child receives straight A’s on their report card, they can bring it in and receive a free small two topping pizza. 

Her: fine…so heres the deal. my kid got all a’s and then he got a B in gym class, you gunna let dat slide. Imean cmon its jus gym class. 

Me: No ma’am, the program is for straight A’s only. 

Her: Oh thats bullshit, and you know it. its just stupid gym class and your seriously not going to let that slide??

Me: No. If the program was straight A’s and a “B” in gym, then yes he would be eligible for the free pizza. 

(At this point she was getting pissed off, and I was laughing. Honestly, a “B” in gym class. 99% of gym was just showing up. More importantly, if your kid isn’t getting an ""A"" in gym class, I would suggest the last thing you should be doing is getting your kid pizza. So the conversation goes on…)

Her: Ok…well fine then tell me da classes that have to be a’s to get the pizza

Me: All of them. Every single class.

Her: So what like englesh and maff and historie? 

Me: Every. Single. Class. Straight. A’s.

Her: Your srsly not goin too let that gym class slide?

Me: No.

Her: Ok…. well obviously you are stupid and dont know whatchu talking about. So why don’t you get me somewon who can properly answer my questions like your manager… 

Me: Ma’am, I am the manager, and if you and any issues or questions, you can take them up with me directly.

Her: Oh well i bet you just luuuuvvvv talkin to me den. So fine if you aint gunna let my kid slide then maybe you can give my kindegardenar his free pizza dat he deserves.

Me: Possibly, did he receive straight A’s on his report card?

Her: Well see dey dont go on the abc system. Its P and PP and smily faces n shit.

Me: Ok, well is it the equivalent of straight A’s? 

Her: Well he got mostly p’s and a couple of pp’s. so yea i guess.

Me: So he got a few proficients, and a couple of partially proficients? Doesn’t sound similar to straight A’s…

Her: Ok your are stupid you dont know what your doring. this is dum my kidz deserve a fre pizza and you are just being a dick abut it. 

*Click* 

She called one of our other stores complained about how rude I was and then tried the same thing at the other store. I mean, seriously?!? Obviously, we are all just stupid and don’t know what we are doing.

So about a week later this lady comes into my store with her two kids and they both have their report cards. She comes up to the register and I started helping her. She said, “Yea some stupid manager was being a dick the other day, but he said my kidz can get a free pizza”. I looked at both of the kids report cards. Sure enough, a “B” in gym and a few partially proficients on the other. 

At this point, I extended my hand out to this lady, “Hi, my name is Joe, Im that dick manager, and no, I said I was **not** going to let it slide.”  She rolled her eyes. Eventually she just bought a pizza for her kids, which I watched her sit there and eat it herself and give none to her two kids.

**3.)** I had a lady call me up in tears, crying and yelling that I fucked her over and that I’m a piece of shit. I asked what was wrong… She ordered pepperoni on her pizza and she got sausage….. and some how I’m a piece of shit because of it.

**4.)** This lady walks in and orders a personal size pizza, I ask her if she wants it cut in 4 or 8 slices. She stops and goes ""I could never eat 8 slices!! So 4!!"" .........Seriously.

**5.)** I had a guy call up, clearly stoned out of his mind. I sat on the phone for a good 10 minutes while he made up his mind. 

After he finally decided on a pizza, I say ""alright anything else?"" 

He just stops and goes, ""FUCK YEA!!! FRENCH FRIES MOTHAFUCKA!!!""

""We don't have french fries sir...""

""BULLSHIT!! You used to.""

""No, we have never had french fries...Ever.""


**Just a side note**
I know what its like to work first hand in customer service. I know how it feels to have to deal with an asshole customer. And because of it I’m probably one of the most last back people when it comes to issues. If my food is wrong, I don’t complain. I've never been one to complain. When your food gets messed up, sure its not what you asked for, but at least you have a meal to eat. 

**To Customers:**
Just remember, sure you may be having a shitty day and everything could be going wrong. But those who provide services and products to you are usually have a shitty day too because they have to put up with ~~people~~ assholes like you…

**Oh and never forget the Golden Rule… “Don’t fuck with the people that make your food.”**

While my wife was watching duck dynasty last night, I was reminded of another story from my old manager Brian.  As usual, this happened in the early 2000s, when I was 17 or 18

Rob picked up a new set of knives that he saw advertised on TV (think miracle blade infomercial), so he brought them in to show them off.  And by show them off, of course I mean recreate the infomercial.  Brian takes some money from the till and sends me down to get whatever I thought would be awesome to cut like a ninja.

I grabbed an assortment of watermelons, cantaloupes, pineapples, and a few other things I can't remember off hand.  As I was leaving the produce section, something caught my eye. There was a sale on coconuts.  Yes, I must get some.

I head back to the store, my arms full of produce and a huge smile plastered on my face in anticipation of what is to come.  When I got back to the store, unfolded pizza boxes were spread over the floor in the back and the knives were laid out nicely on the prep table.  

What was to come could only be described as real life multiplayer fruit ninja.  2 drivers would toss fruit and 2 of us were ninjas.  These things cut through everything we threw at it like they weren't even there.  We even took onions and promotional basketballs from the store to use.  The basketballs would usually bounce off the blade, so we went to trying to stab them out of the air.  It was reasonably fun, but not like slicing fruit.  Rob couldn't quite get through an onion, but I was cutting clean through them every time.  At one point, I cut the onion twice in mid air, earning me $10 from one of the drivers who bet it couldn't be done. I was having the time of my life. 

It didn't take long for us to cover the floor in bits of fruit and a surprising amount of juice.  Once we had exhausted our supply of soft-ish produce, so I whip out the grand finale.  I embed my knife in the coconut like 1/3 of the way through the shell, sending milk flying.  Rob winds up for a mighty swing and makes contact with the shell.  I don't know exactly how he did it, but he bounced the blade off the shell and bent the blade at about a 45^o angle.

Brian, who was a few beers deep offered to fix it, so he went down to the hardware store and bought a hammer far too large for the job at hand (using money from the till, of course).  He took the knife into the office and after several minutes of banging, declared it dead.  He gave it back in 2 pieces--snapped the blade off at the hilt.  Rob does the only thing a rational person would do to the thing that broke his brand new knife--he used the coconut as a baseball and the hammer as the bat.

When he hit the coconut, it basically exploded.  Shrapnel and milk went flying.  It would be weeks before all the pieces were found and cleaned up.  Now that our fun was over, it was time to clean up.  Brian had the drivers clean up while the rest of us ate watermelon and pineapple.  

**TL;DR We were playing fruit ninja before it was cool and before [duck dynasty](http://www.aetv.com/duck-dynasty/video/duck-digest-samurai-si-8056387987?pfilter=ALL%20VIDEOS#8056387987) stole our idea and put it on tv.**

The light turns green, and I try to blow him off by leaving him in the dust. I look in my rear-view mirror to see that he is, in fact, climbing into the bed of my truck. While it's moving, no less. 

Naturally, I freak the hell out in my own way. I am convinced, for whatever reason, that I will be fired for this.  I decide to pull into a parking lot and ask him what he's doing, but before I can decide on the best parking lot to do this I see the place I'm delivering to.

1358016640.0,54,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,16g491,Questions have been asked about how I can make $200 per shift in tips,75,21,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/16g491/questions_have_been_asked_about_how_i_can_make/,"Hi everyone!

Sorry for the long-winded explanation in advance.  Should be worth reading and proposing as an idea to your bosses.

I've been getting questions about how I am making so much money in tips on a nightly basis...trust me...it isn't my good (har har) looks winning me any prizes!  :)  I am also starting to realize, we have it really good at our store, so please don't downvote me if your store doesn't pay as well.  I'm offering you some ideas that I think have really helped us and might help you earn more.

First, our store (Papa John's in Canada) pays the drivers a delivery fee of $3.25 out of the $3.50 charged to the customer.  We don't get an hourly wage (don't have to mop or clean up, just fold boxes when not busy and cut pizzas if the cook staff is busy).

Secondly, in Canada, we have a ton of customers that use debit or credit to pay for the food at the door (probably 50-60% of customers pay this way).  Here is what we have done...Our owners (all former pizza delivery guys and store managers) set up the debit/credit machines to prompt for a tip in this format:

15%

20%

25%

Flat Amount

NOTE:  It is laid out in this order as well.  Very important.  Many customers will pick the first option in front of them, so do not put Flat Amount first.

As most of you know, many customers cannot do math quickly in their heads at the door.  We take that guess work out of their hands and put easy options right in front of them.  Most customers pick 15%, but on a $50 order that is a $7.50 tip.  So now your average tip for that delivery is $10.75.

Of course, over the night, you will have lots of cash transactions and some people selecting the Flat Amount option, but at the end of the night, if we end up with anything over a $7/delivery tip/delivery fee average, that is considered a pretty good night.

Also, I have been in sales for many years in my day job, so when the customer comes to the door, I try to be friendly with them, chat them up a bit (definitely does not always work), and be polite.  Building rapport with customers is a must, in my opinion.

I hope that helps you all with some ideas that have worked for us.  I know it certainly helps when you have the premium shifts (closing Friday and Saturday nights), but some small things can add up to be big things.

I'd like to open this up to other drivers to offer their ideas about how to increase your earnings.  We are all delivering to make some money, so let's share some ideas.  Please don't criticize others for their input.  Let's all try to get along.

Good luck everyone!  Safe driving out there!",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_16g491,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/16g491/questions_have_been_asked_about_how_i_can_make/,

I only carry on suspicious runs or to particularly shady neighborhoods late at night. 

My tale of how I thwarted a robbery and got a $15 tip at the same time goes as such.

It was a half hour from closing time when we get an order to a really nasty part of town through our online ordering system.

“Great… Hey Bubba looks like we got one more to 123 Fake Steet.” I call out to my manager.

“Okay, well with how long that’s going to take you I’ll probably have most of your closing work done for you so we can just get out of here as soon as possible. By the way, I’m not taking any more orders.”

I’m completely fine with this because with cooking time I’m looking at getting back to the store 45 minutes after we close. I cut and box the pizzas and clock out the delivery.

I look at the driver’s notes and see “Deliver to back door.” 

“Welp, looks like I’m packing on this run doesn’t it?” I think to myself, and tuck it into my holster and cover it with my hoodie as I get into my car. I’m driving all the way to the delivery thinking of what I’ll need to do in case I actually need to use it. I just had a terrible feeling about the whole thing.

I get to the house and go to the back and it’s just pitch black outside. So instead of keeping my gun in my holster, I place it in my bag hand underneath the food pointing at the door then proceed to knock. The guy takes a while to answer the door and I’m getting nervous. “Dude, this town’s pretty safe what are you freaking out over? It’s not like you’ll *actually* need to use it.” I think to myself. 

The guy finally answers the door after what seemed an eternity of waiting. I tell him what his total is and he says, “How about you just give me the food and leave peacefully?”

“What are you talking about?”

“You retarded whiteboy? I’ll shoot you.”

“Not before I will, you still have to reach a gun…” at this point I should mention the door was wide open and his hands were empty, “… and my finger’s already on the trigger.” I say this as I use my hand that was inside of the bag to handle the food to lift the bag and expose the barrel pointing right at the guy’s chest.

He stammers a little and just hands me a $50 bill and I hand him the food with my free hand. The next thing I know the door’s being slammed in my face. 

I get in my car and peel the fuck out spraying rocks everywhere just to get out of there as soon as possible. As soon as I get to a main road that’s well lit I call Bubba and tell him what happened and ask what I should do. He told me to just get back to the store as soon as I can and to leave the police out of it because nobody was hurt.

It took me almost 30 minutes to get back because I was shaking so badly I kept stalling my car at stops and grinding gears left and right because I couldn’t seem to work my clutch pedal correctly. That’s the story of my scariest experience delivering pizzas. The best thing is after this happened his address was entered into the *very* small “do not deliver” list we have that only exists for customers who use or threaten violence.

Just a quick note: this happened in the early 2000s when I was 17 or 18

After the fight club dissolved, our new assistant manager (Rob) came up with another idea on how to spend our down time: street racing.  The shopping center where we were located looked very similar to [this poorly drawn, not to scale diagram](http://i.imgur.com/7v4RP.jpg).  There were close to 3 dozen shops on the long side of the center, including a fairly large hardware store right where the shopping center label is on the map.  According to Google maps' measure tool, it was just over a quarter mile (almost 450m) from the end of the hardware store to the end of the super market's loading docks and between 40 and 50 feet (12 and 15m) wide.  You can get an idea of how it looks in some of the pics in part 3.

-----------------

Anyway, the drivers would hop in their busted ass-cars and see who could make it from one end to the other first without hitting anyone or anything.  They would also see who could burn the most rubber and do the most donuts. Watching an early/mid 80s Civic try to burn rubber was always funny :D

It didn't take long for Brian to figure out how to make some $$ off this new hobby.   He took some $$ from the till and got 2 stopwatches so we could keep times and (try to) settle disputes.  He started to take bets on races and pulled in a fair amount of money, especially from one driver who had a *serious* gambling problem.  

The best race I could remember was between Rob and another in store employee, Dave.  Up until this point, no one dared race Rob, and for good reason, but Dave was not scared of a challenge.  Rob was the only son of pretty wealthy parents and drove around in a Porsche (I think it was a 968, but I can only remember certain details about it), while Dave was a middle class 17 year old who drove his parents' new minivan.  Everyone but one person bet on Rob to win, because seriously, it was a minivan vs a porsche. 

They took their places at the far end of the parking area and waited for the flag.  We all held our breath as they peeled out and started racing down the ""track"".  Rob pulled ahead slightly at the beginning, but to everyone's amazement, Dave quickly caught up and overtook him.  Dave ended up winning by nearly a car length.  After checking the betting board, we were even more amazed at the winner of the bet--our driver with the gambling problem--Dan.  Dan was pretty stoked about winning because now he could finally finish paying off his bookie.  There were accusations of collusion, but Rob was adamant he didn't throw the race.  He blamed it on the shop that had just worked on his car for screwing something up.  After taking it back and having them look it over again, he challenged Dave to a rematch.  This time, Rob won by a pretty significant distance.

Street racing went on for most of the summer without any serious injuries or damage.  There were 2 or 3 times when a dumpster got kissed by a bumper or car door and a couple very close calls where cars almost got sideswiped or T-boned.  The drivers may have been stoned, but apparently their reflexes were still pretty sharp.

To this day, I still don't know why none of the adjacent stores complained to either the landlords or the police.  The guys who worked in the chinese restaurant 2 stores down wouldn't because they enjoyed sitting out back, laughing at the retarded white boys and placing their own bets.  I would have fully expected the uptight conservative women in the christian gift shop next to us to complain, though. Whatever their reasons, I'm glad they didn't because it was a lot of fun to watch and gave us a much-needed break from work.

**tl;dr We raced busted ass cars in the parking area behind the store.  In one race, a porsche was beat by a minivan**

Enjoy.

&gt;So I was delivering pizzas for Domino's, sitting on 4th Street SE, when I notice this car going the wrong way down the one way right at me. I'm stopped at a red light, so I honk and flash my brights, but sure enough, she doesn't see me and slams her mirror into mine.  

&gt;I'm on the phone, ""I just got hit!"" I tell Matt, and then the driver fails to stop! She leaves the scene. So I grabbed her license plate, and called 911. I delivered my pizza, and then as I'm driving down University, I see her in front of me! So I follow her, call 911 again, then she turns the wrong way on University!  [It's a one way]

&gt;After I send squad cars in her direction, I get a call to meet them where she's pulled over. I arrive to 4 squad cars and 2 open bottles for one 30-something year old white woman. ""She's drunk as a skunk,"" the officer tells me, ""definately getting a DUI."" No real damage, cept my mirror. I'm debating if I should bring the insurance company in or not. Calling daddy tomorrow, but fun night reguardless!  

That was posted the night of the accident.  I found out she didn't have insurance and if I wanted her to pay for any of the damage I'd have to take her to small claims court.  So I got an estimate on the mirror and there was a side swipe I didn't really see cause it was dark and it came out to be 1500 dollars. I paid the 50 bucks or whatever it was to file a claim with the court.  

People's Court, the television show, contacted me and offered to fly me to NYC and pay all the costs in the judgement.  I was on board, but the woman told them on the phone that she was guilty and intended to plead so.  So, no show.  

Anyway, we go to court and I meet her.  She apologizes, which was super awkward. Then we go up in front of the judge. She admits guilt but doesn't have 1500 dollars to pay me.  She wants to work out some sort of payment plan, he says we can talk about that in the hall, she offers 50 bucks a week, I say that's fine, and we go back in and tell the judge.  He rules that's what will happen and we go our separate ways.  

A couple of weeks go by, and I don't get anything in the mail. I try to call, she doesn't live there anymore, apparently.  I go back to the court, they say I have to pay another 50 bucks to maybe garnish her wages.  I'm poor, my car doesn't need fixing THAT bad, I cut my losses and go on with my life.  

Now here I am today, getting bitter on reddit about how this all played out.  Fuck you for reading this.

The second order, was a large anchovy, sausage, mushroom, and green pepper pizza.

On my way over to the hotel I read the ticket wrong and mistakenly went to the incorrect one. I still had plenty of time before the order would be late, so I just drove to the one specified on the ticket. I knock on room 210 like the ticket says, but no answer. There was one of the housekeepers one room over and informed me that the room I was at was not rented out. I walk down to the front desk and gave them the customers last name on the ticket, and they inform me there are no guest reservations with that particular last name.

I walk into the store and see where the hell I'm going, 1 college, 1 nearby, 1 in another city right over the boarder. I think great I'll do the college first because it's right behind us, then do 1 nearby, then the last one. So I get to the dorm and call the guy from my car because I assume he's not downstairs. Well he is downstairs and I say great I'll be in there shortly. I walk in and see he's paying by clipper card but it's odd looking and I didnt see a clippercard slip on the reciept. 

So I say alright you need to call the store, tell them you're paying by clippercard. He says, oh but I did. I assume the new girl(first day training btw so don't really blame her and the owner was most likely helping out his son with pizza). I say alright well we need to call and tell them you're paying by clipper card. So we call and he says he wants to pay by clippercard, and I know its the owner this time. he asks what's the number on it, he says the number under the barcode( which idk the purpose of but isnt the right number it should be S000000) alright he's told that's not the right number it should be the s000000 number. Well surprise he doesn't have a s000000 on his clippercard. So he hands over the phone to me because the owner wants me to explain wtf is going on to him, so I tell him it's a guest clippercard. He says well do they have any other way to pay? I ask and his friend says he has a cc up stairs but doesn't want to use it. 

So we hang up and I try to come up with solutions because I care about the customers and don't want to deny them food, meanwhile the kid is bitching(pretty sure he has some form of autism by the way he was acting) and finally his friend comes back down with the cc and so we call again and as I'm about to give my boss the cc number, the kid says I want to talk to the manager. I say hold on (because I have 2 other deliveries in my car and just wanna leave) but he says no I wanna talk to him now. Great! I sit there talking to the front desk and his friend saying you know, I could've left and done my other deliveries my boss would've understood just sayin'. I'm trying to help you guys out. Then I overhear the kid saying it's been over an hour and 1/2 since they ordered for the pizza to arrive. (mind you it was about an hour over when I got there so I SAT THERE FOR 30 MINUTES TRYING TO HELP THIS KID OUT. His friend understood this and while his friend is demanding the pizza for free.

He finally hands the phone over to me so I can tell my boss his friends cc number, and then my boss tells me he will charge them 1/2 price for the pizza. I tell him that, everything is okay hunky dory and I continue to apologize and the kid says it's not your fault but he's never ordering from us again, I thought THANK GOD!

boss later voided the order just because he could and didnt wanna hear shit from this kid again.

When I was about 16, I delivered for a local pizza shop. I just went in, talked to the manager, and got the job that same day. But it appears to be different now.

My son got called for an interview at a local Hut. He went in, talked to the assistant manager (manager wasn't there), and was given information on the pay, insurance, and what his duties would be. He was told to come back tomorrow so he could talk to the manager. He comes 6 minutes before the time he was scheduled, and he literally sits there for the manager to arrive. It probably took an hour for the manager to arrive, but he sat there waiting patiently. When the manager arrives, he goes through the same stuff, he asks a few personal things as well. Towards the end of the interview, he is told that they can't hire him now because they got new employment instructions, and they weren't sure what the new procedure was.

It was a pretty busy Thursday night for my pizza shop. Usually it was hit or miss for us and we could never predict when business would pick up. So the store essentially was just drivers rushing in and out making orders etc etc. I got an order for a single medium sized pizza not too far from the store. Probably a 3 minute drive. Grab the goods and head out the door. I make it to the little house in no time. I walk up the steps and knock on the door. No answer. I check the left window and then the right window which had lights on. SHE'S SITTING RIGHT THERE! on the couch on her computer. What the hell, i'm staring at her, if the window was open I could have reached out and touched her. So I knock again and still no response. She's busy messaging on facebook. This is getting weird. So I find the door bell and try that. Nothing again. The whole time i'm just staring at the back of her head. I call her phone and she picks it up and I can see my number on the damn thing. She puts it down. Wtf. So I call my manager maybe he can call her phone and she'll see it's us and maybe realize we are there. He calls and she does essentially the same thing she did with my call. God dammit. It's been about 8 minutes or something. I tap on the glass and she's still not responding. I'm finally getting frustrated and bang on the door, not like an asshole but I cause vibrations. She turns around and sees me and smiles. HOLY JESUS THANK YOU. She open's the door and starts talking, it hits me, she's deaf! She had the typical deaf person speech impediment from not being able to hear her voice. I buckle with guilt for being frustrated. I apologize for not being able to get her attention and she just keeps smiling and hands me a five. I walk away feeling like a horrible person for being so upset. There was no way of knowing she was deaf. She didn't specify anything on the online order so yeah. I learned to develop a little more patience for people who don't get to the door right away.

I absolutely love them and sometimes there are nights when I get to talk to kids at every house and they are always so funny. Most of them just tell me cool stories or I compliment them on their cool clothes because they always have cool clothes. One time I had to go a really far way for a delivery but it was worth it because I spent like 5 minutes talking to this little boy about Lady and the Tramp and he showed me a magic trick. 

Some of my favorite pizza delivery stories involving kids: 

* This was one of my first ever deliveries. A kid peeks out the window after I knock and yells ""THE PIZZA GUY IS HERE! IT'S A GIRL!"" and then another kid replied ""bout time we got a girl from Pizza Hut"" 
* I was delivering to a house and there were 3 or 4 kids looking out the upstairs window of the house across the street. They all started cheering for me and asking me to bring them some pizza. I smiled at them and waved and then gave the person their pizza. As I was leaving they all yelled for me again ""BRING US SOME PIZZA!"" and I said ""Sorry I don't have anymore :("" ""It's okay!!!"" They were so cute haha. 
* My absolute favorite: One time my manager told me he thought this lady was lying about having a coupon so he asked me to make sure I got it from her. She opened the door and I asked her if she had her coupon and she said she'd have to go inside to get it, but left the door open. A little boy about 5 or 6 years old came running up to the door, stopped and looked at me for a second, yelled ""PIZZA LADY SEXY!"" and then ran away.

In my town we have several 'regulars' (ok...just about everyone is a 'regular' save for the uni students, who vary year on year *unsurprisingly*) One regular lives in the caravan holiday park permanently. The first time I delivered to her it took an hour of running to and fro in the *pouring* rain, a good six phone calls to the increasingly stressed, totally useless customer because I found her (In wales streets decided to tell logic to fuck off, and call the houses whatever the hell they feel like. So there is *no* logic to the housing, numbering can go 1,2,3. Or 1,4,5,6,12A,15. Or my absolute favourite 1, Bronglais Way,7, Church View,3,4,[insert another name])

By now I've delivered a good seven times to her over the past two months or so, and she frequently just tells me to step inside. They always order a lot (£30+ worth of -cheap- pizza) and it's a pain to get out of the old bags, especially in the cold and rain.


Today, same as usual, it's cold enough for my fingers to go numb along the two hundred metre walk from car to door (she lives up a little hill inaccessible even in company smart car.) And she tells me to step inside. I follow her to the middle portion of the caravan to put the pizza on the side. Her cat decides to say hello and wind about my legs.


Go on...*guess* what happens. I stumble, I trip, Pizza miraculously was already on the side but as I crash down backwards my flailing arms knock a rather large knife off the side, and my writhing to avoid squishing the cat mid-fall brings me perfectly aligned to -watch- the knife fall point down, and hit the floor *centimetres* from my belly.


So yeah, sadly no gun-nut stories like you guys, but I reminded myself tonight a very good reason to stay out of customer housing, it keeps me away from sharp instruments, deliveries are the one time of my job I'm kept away from the hot kitchen and knives (it's a running joke I will burn, singe and otherwise knock myself a dozen times a shift on the ovens and hot pans and whatnot.)

[bit of a rant],71,20,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1j642m/we_got_spanked_last_night_bit_of_a_rant/,"I wasn't really expecting it to be busy because it's in between some major paydays.  At a previous job, we always got busier around the 15th and last day of the month than on the weekends in between, so I was kinda figuring on it being slow... not only that, but I only did 2 deliveries between 11am and 5pm, so yeah, I figured it'd be slow.

Next thing I know, there are 4 deliveries.  We had 3 drivers on last night.  I take 2, come back, there are 8 deliveries on screen, my boss hands me some boxes and my receipt and says 'Here take these two west sides'.

West side, in my city, means travelling at least 10-15 minutes over to the other side of the city which is separated from the 'main' one by a huge ravine that has only two bridges, one in the middle and one a bit farther north.

So I grab everything and go, we were so busy that I trusted them to have been boxed properly and all.  I deliver the first, everything's fine, I'm at the bottom end of the opposite side, and I look at the second.  It's not actually in the same area, it's on the ass-end of the other half of the city.  I call the customer to let her know I'm on my way, and she says it's all good and thanks me.  It's been almost an hour since she ordered at this point.

I drive like a controlled maniac and without speeding too much, manage to find where her house 'should' be... but the road doesn't exist on my gps.  It's in a fancy new development of the city, and I drive around looking for the road, but it's just not there.  I phone her and she gives me directions and says 'Yeah, we've lived here for 2 years and the road still isn't on any maps!'

Now, is it just me, or is 2 years a long enough time to realize that maybe if your road doesn't exist on maps that maybe you should start going for pickups?  Or at least leaving a note in the delivery instructions that say 'XX road at the end of X road' or something?  Not just 'house # on rock'.

And naturally, I haven't been making much in tips for this day so far.  Those two deliveries took me an hour and a half (we're the only one of our franchise in the city of almost 100k, so we do everywhere), and I managed to make a whopping $4 in tips for that time.  It's ok, though, it was only about 730, still early, but it was fuckin busy through to 10pm.

The owner said summers are usually really slow, but she's been doing a lot of extra advertising on tv and flyers and stuff.  Clearly it's paying off.  But we just hired two new cooks, and they're not from Canada so we have communication issues (which I'm sure will get better).

All I can say is, I'm glad at least I didn't get yelled at by anyone.  One of the other drivers got lectured by an irate customer at the door.  I forgot my debit machine on one run (leant it to another driver who's machine died, and then forgot to grab it for my run), so I just left the pizza and went back later.  Thankfully they didn't turn the lights off and not answer the door the second time, hah.

Around here, delivering isn't considered extremely dangerous aside from just the act of driving. Tonight was different.

It was a relatively slow night, regular orders and nothing too crazy happening so there was only myself (managing), one waitress, one cook, and one driver. Note that this driver happens to be a 24 year old male who has been on two tours to Iraq and has a concealed carry permit that he makes good use of. 

Around 8:00 we get an order for a delivery on a fairly major street in town. So the driver takes his bag and as he's walking out to his truck behind the shop he notices an unfamiliar trailblazer sitting in the alley. There's really no use for anyone to use our alley at this time besides us, so he decided that he would rather be safe than sorry. He drives to the house, but before he gets out of his truck he puts his handgun in his waistband. He goes up to the door and does a routine exchange, but as he's walking back to his truck he sees the trailblazer from the alley come around the corner. Some teenager hops out of the car, goes up to the driver and says ""Give me your money."" My driver pulls the gun off his waistband and asks the kid, ""Is your life really worth twenty bucks?"" The kid ran off and no one was harmed.

Nights like tonight really make me wonder about no weapons policies for delivering. Obviously the safest option is to throw the money and run, but it's not the only option.

The owner of the place is an immigrant and one of the nicest, most level-headed people I know, though he does not tolerate bullshit from anyone. We get along just fine, though, since we both share the same desire for professionalism. The overwhelming majority of our customers are decent people, but last week we had an unusually bad experience with one of our customers. This happened on a Sunday afternoon during another one of our usual, 90 F, humid-as-hell New England heatwaves.

My boss picks up the phone and we get a delivery order for a 12-inch veggie pizza ($16.80, which includes meal tax and $1 delivery fee), to be paid in cash (no card # provided). Boss says the instructions are to call the provided telephone number right before I get to the address, telling me  that the pizza was supposed to be a surprise for the caller’s grandmother. Okay, whatever.

 I drive the pizza to one of our town’s trailer parks, pull up to the address’ driveway, and I dial the number. My cellphone tells me that the number is from California. (RED FLAG # 1)
   
Me: “Hi this the delivery driver, you asked me to call you?”

CrazyCaliforniaLady: “Yeah, bring the pizza to her and tell her to call this number.”

Me: (notices that the voice on the phone is a woman in her late 40s, I thought this was for your grandmother? RED FLAG # 2) “Okay. I can do that. So who is going to pay for this pizza?”

CCL: “Just bring the pizza to her and have her call me. Tell her it’s from Helen”

Fine, whatever. I hang up the phone, ring the doorbell, and am greeted by a woman in her late 70s. I tell her that someone named Helen had ordered her a pizza as a surprise. Naturally she’s confused, didn’t have any money with her, and asks me to step into her trailer. I give her the phone number provided to me and she fumbles around with her telephone.

After waiting for a few minutes, I call my boss, tell him about the situation, and he instructs me to call the number back again. I call the number, and I get a message from Magic Jack telling me that the number “is no longer in service” (RED FLAG #3)

I call back my boss, he tells me to leave the pizza to the 70-something lady and drive back to the shop. I drive back and my boss is unsuccessfully trying to call back CCL. No money has traded hands at this point, and we were both confused and hot from the heat. 

After 5 minutes of waiting around, my boss tells me to drive back to the trailer park and get the name and number of the old lady with the pizza. (Why is this so fucking complicated?)

I haul my sweaty ass back to the trailer park, back to 70-something’s house. When the door opened, the old lady has the untouched pizza box in her hands and gives it back to me. She has this look of horror and exasperation on her face, as if she had experienced a lifetime of putting up with a whole lot of fucked-upness and bullshit.

OldLady: “Please, take this back, I’m so sorry. This has happened to me before. This lady is crazy, she has done this a couple of times. She’s crazy! I apologize for this” (RED FLAG #4)

I take the pizza back to my car, dejected, unsure of what to believe in anymore, and I drive back to the shop. I tell my boss what 70-something told me, and he has seemed to given up and chalks it up as a loss (this dude is pretty zen). 

15 minutes later, we get a call from a private number (care to guess who it is?). My boss picks up the phone. CCL is angry. She says that we messed up the order. My boss wants to know how the fuck she’s going to pay for the pizza. Boss asks her where she is and how she plans on paying. Boss is now angry at her. Frustrated, Boss gives me the phone to talk to CCL.

CCL: “YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CALL ME BEFORE YOU GOT THERE AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TELL HER TO CALL ME.”

Me: “I went to (address), I called you and I told her to call you with the number you gave me. Where are you and how are you going to pay for the pizza?

CCL: “IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE FOR HER! IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDMOTHER.”

Me: “It doesn’t work that way, you need to give me the money in-person, how am-“

CCL: “IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE! SHE WASN’T SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE MONEY”

My boss yanks the phone back. He demands that she give him her credit card number, she refuses. Boss enters Super Saiyan mode.

Boss: “YOU ASSHOLE! I am trying to run a business here! You tell me now how you are going to pay for this… DON’T CALL ME ‘HONEY,’ I AM NOT YOUR ‘HONEY’ YOU ARE ASSHOLE! Y-… YOU ARE ASSHOLE! Tell me… TELL ME NOW how you are going to pay for this or I will call the police… I WILL CALL THE POLICE if you do not pay for this pizza… What… WHAT IS YOUR NAME (her name wasn’t Helen)...""

After all that yelling and shouting, no money was earned, I wasted money on gas, and tempers were flared. My boss decided not to press charges, figuring that it would be best not to go down that path. We did, however, give away the still-warm pizza to the next people who ordered delivery, much to their surprise.

Yesterday:

It was my first delivery of the day and I look at the screen immediately after clocking in and see I'm going close to a customer who never tips.

Great...

That is until I clocked out the order and noticed the tip was the same amount as the total. I brought it up with my manager and he called them up and asked what they wanted to do then told me to go. I showed the customer the receipt and what had happened and he crossed out the ridiculous tip and handed me a 10 saying, ""You saved me 25 bucks man, I figured the least I could do is throw you half of that for being honest.""

Today:

I took a delivery to the ass-end of our delivery area, three houses down from where [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1j7rug/you_think_youre_funny/cbc6wip) to be exact. I tell her the total and she hands me a check for the exact amount.

Shit... There's $2.29 down the drain.

I suck it up and deal with the rest of my night until I'm about to count my money down for the night so I can get out of there. It was then my manager comes up to me and gives me a 5 and tells me the woman I delivered to out in the sticks drove all the way down to the store because she forgot to tip me at the door. I asked my manager if she thought it would be out of line if I called the woman back to thank her and got the go ahead.

I called the woman back and thanked her for the consideration. It seriously made my night and was probably the nicest thing a customer has ever done for me.

(It came out to just over 165.00)

Well lucky me being the only cross trained driver and cook, I helped get the order together, box it and bag it, took forever because all the  requests (Sauce on side of some, double on others, pizzas cut into 16) and I finally had it into 3 now full bags and the 2 liters on the side. I looked to my manager to let me know which driver to get and explain the order, how to get there, helping get it to the car and what not (I was the 'veteran' driver and what not) She tells me I have it as I made and boxed it all and the other driver in front of me wanted to go home. 

So here we go, I start to drive to the ghetto where the order is, thinking some game was on and someone was having a party. I drive up to 8712 eskimo way (Fake address) and see no cars, it is an empty house, ""Great, I'm either about to get robbed or its a fucking prank"" Well I look at the ticket to call the customer and confirm the address and I notice it says  8112, not 8712. Ha funny, I'm an idiot. 

I drive up to what is now the correct address and see 3 guys sitting outside, the door open, a few cars ""Ah yes, not a prank!"" I get out and walk up to them and let them know the total, and they go ape shit. Yelling for everyone in the house to come out (Like 3 others) to find out who the hell ordered 165 bucks in pizza, they all deny ordering and ask me who called. I repeated the name and the original guy admitted that was him, but he didn't order it. He asked me to call the number they gave, and I did. He kept asking me for the number and to put it on speaker and I told him no. 3 calls from me, 2 from the store and 2 from my manager and no answer. Damn prank call wasted my time and got my hopes up.

First thing first:

1.DON'T TALK about a tip, unless a customer asks you about it. If you get stiffed, suck it up, don't let it ruin your day and maybe you'll get tipped big on the next one. 

2. Odd and even numbered buildings and houses are on opposite sides of each other. This is the case 99% of the time. Sometimes some developer will do something ridiculous like build an even numbered building on the odd side. Bring a flashlight for night shifts, it helps out alot! 

3. In cities, NEVER park in a pay lot, they will boot you no matter what. Find visitor parking or park in a fire lane. Always put your hazards on and make sure you have a car topper or something that proves you're not an asshole parking illegally. If you get a parking ticket, pay it or contest it, don't forget about it! 

4. Always look for a call box for apartment complexes or lofts. You can search up the customer's and they can buzz you in. I try to avoid sneaking in to complexes and often call up just in case they are paranoid about unwanted visitors. 

5. Turn your AC off if possible and leave your car on for quick drop offs. This will really help you on gas expenses. 

6. If you need a credit card slip filled out, don't say ""just sign here"", because some people will take that literally and stiff you. I always say, ""fill it out"". For cash orders that need change, ask ""How much change do you need back?"", not ""Do you need change?"", because they'll laugh at you and be a little offended. 

7. Make small talk with customers, find common ground and talk about it. I'm not sure if this helps with a tip, but sometimes it does. 

8. DRIVE SAFELY! After driving for two years, i have never gotten a speeding ticket or traffic violation. Delivery drivers aren't ambulances or police cars! 

9. Have your phone charged and working at all times. Don't be afraid to call a customer to get info. Watch out for your minutes if you aren't using a company phone. I went over big time just calling customers for 5 second calls. It adds up. 

10. It doesn't hurt to check with the kitchen and staff to make sure your order is perfect. We are essentially motorized waiters, it is our job  to make sure orders are correct and delivered properly and efficiently.

1369246098.0,41,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,1eujoe,Please Give me Feedback on my White Label Delivery Service,57,16,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1eujoe/please_give_me_feedback_on_my_white_label/,"Hey, /r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy, I've had this business idea rolling around in my head for a while, so I thought I'd bring it to you guys for feedback and ask some questions:

*Description*

Some restaurants, like Lin Cho's Chinese, are too small to hire a delivery guy and keep him busy, but customers still ask if they deliver, of course, and so they'll have to say no and give up business. That's where my business White Label Delivery (WLD) comes in.

After signing up for our service, Lin Cho's will need to use some kind of POS system to push delivery orders into WLD's queue for that area. The system will assign the order to one of available drivers in the area by notifying him through our app on his smartphone. 

If the driver waits too long or drives too far away, the system would first warn that the order may be reassigned to another driver because of X reason; then if the driver does nothing to respond for a given amount of time, the order would be reassigned to another driver.

Eventually, a delivery guy picks up the order from Lin Cho's.  In order to preserve Lin Cho's branding, the WLD driver will place a velcro-backed patch to his shirt with Lin Cho's logo on it. The driver will then complete a delivery as normal. 

*Benefits of this Service*

- the customer who ordered gets a seamless experience: as far as he knows, Lin Cho's actually did deliver him his food

- Lin Cho's is able to increase their revenue by increasing by a small fixed and variable cost, compared to hiring a driver full-time, but being unable to keep him busy

- the drivers who deliver for WLD will be able to keep busy and hopefully complete more orders than they normally would, which means more tips for them!

*Questions for You All*

So I've come to the experts here in delivery; I have a lot of questions for you all because I've never been a delivery guy, so please feel free to tell me what you think or even just ignore my questions if they're totally off-base:

1) If you were a restaurant owner with or without a delivery service in place, would you even consider using this kind of service?

2) If as a restaurant owner you would use this kind of service, what kind of cost would you expect with it?

3) As a driver, based on just the concept alone, would you work for this kind of company?

4) As a driver, what kind of compensation do you anticipate from WLD?

5) If you were me, running WLD, what would you look for in the first few people I hired to be delivery guys?

6) If you were me, what could I do to help not just hire the right people, but keep the right people around for a long time?

7) What have I overlooked?

Thanks everyone ahead of time!

_____________________________________________________
The GM hired a new girl to be an insider. I could already tell there was something off about her. Imagine: inappropriate, pill-popping meth head. (Turned out to be true.)
Before she completed her first week in the store, she already went in for the kill. She began sleeping with our GM. Not only that, but she moved into his place. They now relentlessly confess their love to one another, and they are already leafing through brochures for their *honeymoon*. 
She hasn't even begun her third week of working for him.

:

**Little Description of These Two**

My GM is loony. Imagine a gangling 6'4"" dude with head-to-toe kindergarten-doodle tattoos, beady eyes, and awkwardly thinning hair. He is 100% obsessed with female attention. I would know this. I'm female.

This chick who he hired is this twiggy sapling, stretching no more than 5' off the ground. She has no behavioral filter whatsoever. Imagine her face as a jack-o-lantern. That's pretty much it to a tee, ginger and all.

:

**Moving On...**

No one really gave her too much mind in the beginning. She was just really, really obnoxious and defiant. But then she began targeting me. She messed with my pizzas at the make-line and began to childishly mock me in front of the GM (let me remind you that I have no idea who this girl even is). She went one step further and intruded on my smoke break with my shift manager *and* the GM, letting me know that she thought I was a complete bitch and a sarcastic ass. She pulled me aside afterward (I assumed she was going to apologize) and basically told me that I was completely fucked in the head, and I'm an annoying mental case whose voice is so annoying that people can't do their work. She also mentioned, with a smirk on her face, that I wasn't going to last long in the store.

Bitch, please.

:

I informed the shift manager. He promptly wrote her up. A few days later, the form he filled out and all of the blank ones were missing from the store's office. The GM explained to the shift manager that ""It's really binary_brain's fault. The other girl is just giving her pay-back."" (Yeah, it's a messed up story. The GM originally wanted to date me, and we did hang out a lot, but then he got creepy and I told him I was more comfortable with a manager-employee relationship, blahblahblah.)
Everyone caught wind of what happened, and we now have a personal vendetta against her and our boss.

***That was just within the first week.*** Lately, it's been worse. The GM has given her complete control of the store. She antagonizes everyone; she barks orders to even the veteran employees; she doesn't follow dress-code, or any code for that matter; she leaves work all the time and takes joy rides in GM's car; she keeps all of the store's keys--**THE KEYS!** She has the store key, the key to the cash drawer, the office keys... WTF. 

She has lost the store tons of money due to making shit-food, and we have lost so. many.. customers... all due to her attitude and poor service. Did I also mention she was fired from her last job for stealing money?


I told myself I would give this situation a little over one month to sort itself out. I have &lt;2 weeks to go. If it doesn't settle down in there, I will bring up the issue to corporate. The DM already has an idea of the situation, but he and the GM are good friends.
This girl and the GM are going to bring themselves to their own demise with their desperate behavior. I can't wait to wave goodbye to them both.

:

**TL**;**DR**: Boss bones girl employee. Girl goes Hitler on pizza store. Soon it will be time for justice.

__________

**Update 1:** I decided to visit the store today on my day off. I gave everyone a pat on the back and asked them to relay what's been going on in the store:

""She *still* has the store keys...""

""She is messing up all these orders...""

""I'm gonna punch this girl...""

Even B., who is a quiet and humble senior, had his own quips about it.

Then I heard that girl squawk, ""If you're not clocked in and you're in the store, **get out**!""

Everyone sort of stood there, dazed.

""Oh my God! she's not listening to me, GM! She won't get out of the store!""

I had to be escorted out of the store by the shift manager. All of the customers' faces read, ""Oh my gosh, woah...""

I sat in my car and waited until one of my good buddies left the store to make a delivery. I got in his car and he told me about the unbearable drama that's been going on in the store.

""She's a bitch, but the only time I truly hate her is when you're anywhere near the store. She suddenly becomes a demon."" He went on to tell me, ""You know how the new kid was outside today shaking the banner? Well, he's already been fired. GM's lady was nagging about him all day and telling GM to fire the new kid, and he finally did it. He sent him home.""

I was going to wait until the next week was up before I called someone higher-up to discuss the situation, but my GM's former District Manager is already hurrying to get me connected to my current DM to discuss the situation. Hopefully something will be done.
___
**Update 2:** Ugh, there's too much drama here. GM called me at like 1am. Apparently, his lady ditched him at work and never came home. Now he's all sad. He was apologizing during the entire phone conversation, and saying how he'll fix everything. Ummm, no. I'm still going to the DM about this. I don't want an avalanche of drama freezing up the store.

The funniest part of the conversation was when he said, ""Yeah, I'm all right, I got it all figured out now. I can read women pretty well. I sorta think she was trying to manipulate me.""  DERP?

______
**Update 3:** I finally talked to the DM last night. He said he'll definitely look into it and talk to other employees. I'm eager to see what happens. 

______
**Update 4:** Nothing much has happened. The DM simply gave my GM a slap on the wrist, and now the GM knows that someone in the store has tattled.

Basically what happened when they met up: The GM came into DM's store to actually complain about *another employee,* who was standing up against the GM's lady and telling her to stay away from the make-line because she was ruining too many orders. The DM said, ""Actually, GM, I want to talk about something else with you. I'm getting complaints from a few employees in your store about your girlfriend. From what I hear, it is getting in the way of the store.""

My GM had the dumbest response: ""What?! That's stupid. If anything, my girlfriend is helping the store. She is amazing! She will run the store some day.""

Yeah, right.

The store is a lot more quiet now, but there is so much tension. Now the new drama comes from the GM and his lady getting into petty relationship squabble in front of employees and customers. 

Still, the DM did tell my GM that if more employees complained, he *would* have to take action. I found out a couple days ago that one of the veteran employees gave DM a call and complained. So now we're all holding our breath and waiting for results... again. 
_________________
**Update 5:** Since the DM wasn't pulling his own weight, I spoke to the next higher-up. I basically recited what I've already told Redditors. He simply said, ""I'll get back to you.""

Half and hour later, my DM and his boss walked into the store and waited for my GM and his girl to come in for work. I had to do a delivery, but the jist of it is that the GM was pulled aside and informed that his lady friend could no longer be in the store for work nor leisure, and therefore she would at least be transferred. She was gone by the time I got back to the store. 

That was a week or two ago. I found out that she was fired from the other store shortly after the transfer. ***HA***.

She still has an iron grip on my boss. It's clear to everyone that she's been influencing him to buy pills and heroin. He's also been messing up way too many orders as a GM. I'm always the one dealing with the angry customers. He leaves two 16-year-old noob employees at the make-line in order to talk to his girl on the phone 24/7. I hate working with this guy, because I have to juggle everything around in addition to training the new guys. I've been working there for like 3 months. **:/**

But I guess I don't have to worry about being around him so much, because I'm the only driver whose hours have been cut cleanly in half. Coworkers are talking about taking the next step and trying to get the GM terminated. I'm personally hoping that my GM's lady finally dumps his ass so that the entire store can move on. 

__________________
**Update 6:** MUAHAHAHA

The girl was fired. My boss was demoted and transferred to a different store. It should have happened a long time ago, but at least things are looking up. My store has new management, and everything is improving ten-fold. We finally have AC; cleaned the store top to bottom; new phones; fixed heat racks, etc. All within the first week my new GM began working with us. He's even training me for management. Oh my stars!!

Oh yeah, and a funny side note is that the ex-GM and his lady got married. Yes, married... A few days after he discovered she was sleeping around with other guys for pills and heroin.

**Story #9: The origin story of ""The Blacklist""**

Most of y'all have enjoyed my deliver stories and it's been mentioned a few times in comments that the store I worked in had a running ""blacklist"" of houses that we either did not deliver to or were shifted to the bottom of the priority list.

About three months into my first stint as a driver for a national pizza chain I started to notice a pattern of regular customers who did not tip.  We're not talking tiny tips, or being picky that I wasn't getting that I thought I *deserved* as a driver.  I am talking flat out exact-change and no-tip.  I even got berated once for not having ""change"" to give back the customer his 32 cents.  Seriously?

Anyway I was one of two full-time drivers (*we split shifts on all seven days, there were also two or three other part-timers that helped on weekends or picked up mid-week shifts when needed*).  On a particularly slow mid-week shift we started talking about the whole ""exact-change/no-tip"" thing.  We compared stories and even addresses.  We realized that this was a habitual issue not just something unique to my own experience.

Around this time we were ""upgrading"" &lt;insert rolling eyes&gt; to a new order management and dispatch system.  While setting things up we noticed we could customize the order taking screen.  There was one line item for delivery notes that was ""public"" (*in other words it would show up on the printed receipt*) and another that was ""private"" (*you could see it in the GUI but that line would not print out on an order receipt*).  Realizing this we both exchanged knowing looks and began referring to ""Delivery Note #2"" as the ""Blacklist Line.""

Once the new system went live we started keeping track of things like which customers were great tippers and super nice (*high priority customers*) and which customers were assholes, impolite/rude, and/or were exact-change/no-tip types (*low priority customers*).

After about three months we had a pretty smooth system going.  If a blacklisted customer ordered I would refuse to take it and leave it for one of the drivers with less seniority. If they got a good tip they would make a note on line two.  

I guess I should explain that it wasn't like once a customer was blacklisted that was it.  It wasn’t a once-and-done thing. We kept updating the entries (*both good and bad*) on a regular basis.

Anyway there was one particular customer I and the rest of the drivers had finally gotten to the point of refusing to deliver to them **period** under any circumstances.  I deleted their address from the system and made a note in that said they were habitually rude, did not tip, were sometimes not home when they ordered delivery, and often complained for no reason what-so-ever just so they could get free pizza (*like saying the cheese was stuck to the top of the box when I checked before getting out of the car, or the pizza was late and cold; stupid petty things that were pretty much bull-shit attempts at free pizza*).  The manger was already tired of this customer's shit but still had to abide by the whole ""*customer is always right*"" shit.

So one night asshole customer calls in and the poor girl taking orders didn't know what hit her. She says that we (*as a store*) are unable to deliver to them.  (*It wasn't uncommon for people outside our delivery zone to try and call in an order on a busy night.  So we noted those customers in the system too*).  Well asshole customer goes off on her.  She starts crying and hands the phone to the manager.  He gets the customer's story and then tells the customer he will call them right back.

I come in from an order and get cornered by the manager.  I could tell he was pissed but he gave me a chance to explain the situation.  A few minutes later the other full-timer comes in and confirms the story as well as why we made the decision to not deliver to asshole customer any more.

Manager calls asshole customer and flat-out tells him out it is. A heated pseudo-argument ensues and the managers ends by saying, ""Our delivery service is just that - a service. It is customary to tip delivery drivers because they are using their own vehicles and paying for the gas out of their own pockets. If you don't want to tip a delivery driver then don't order delivery. Thank you and good bye."" He then slams down the receiver, looks at me and just mutters 'what an asshole' under his breath.

From then on ""The Blacklist"" became an accepted thing and during an all-store staff meeting the following week the system was explained so that everyone else who worked there (*who were all expected to take orders over the phone*) understood what ""Delivery Line #2"" meant.

A few months later I ended up leaving the store (*on good terms*) and went to school out of town.  After finishing school and moving back home I decided to pick up delivering again part-time while I continued on in grad-school (*this time in town*).  A total of four years had passed between my first stint as a driver (*back in 1999*) to my second stink (*in 2003*).  On my first day back as a driver I noticed ""The Blacklist"" was still going strong.  Needless to say I was pleased.

**TL;DR:** A fellow driver and I at a national pizza chain instituted a “black list” of customers that were habitual problems and/or the “exact-change/no-tip” type.  Manager found out about the list after dealing with the king of all assholes on our blacklist and not only endorsed the list but also had us explain the list to the rest of the store.",,False,,t5_2uh13,1360871325.0,,,True,t3_18j58q,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/18j58q/the_origin_story_of_the_blacklist_story_9/,

**edit**: I performed a tally poll today in honor of the Olympics. Whites won the games with 8-1 tip to non-tips. They also accounted for 80% of my total tip value and 90% of my tips above $3. Hispanics came in second place with the best tip ratio (4 out of 4, including miscellaneous, I think there was a Philippino in there) and accounted for about $12 dollars. Blacks came in last place with a 3-3 score and about $5 in tips. I can continue posting my results, but from today my numerical values put black people at both the lowest tip to non-tip ration and the lowest amount per tip. 

If I'd raised the bar to $3 or $4 to qualify as a point, then white people and hispanics would have been about the same and blacks would have had 0 points. If anyone is interested I can keep posting my numerical results for the next week or whatever. I like stats so I'm going to be recording it anyway.

**edit 2**: Day two of the Olymtips. Few white people served today, they increased to 12-1. I seem to have delivered to all the black people, as they rose to 5-11 (for the day, that's 2 tips out of 10 deliveries), falling below the 30% tip ratio, but also wasting my time arguing with my manager about free food for 20 minutes while I was standing there holding pizzas. I considered removing a point for douchebaggery, but then I remembered what my name is. Hispanics broke their perfect record today falling at 7-1, but are still giving an outstanding performance. 


So far, black people make up 84%+ of my tipless deliveries. Also, the black tips totaled six dollars, while hispanics totaled 10 and whites 14. I'll admit that I've underestimated hispanics. They're performing well above expectation.

**edit 3**
So the Tiplympics has been going on for about a week now. Black people are at 69 deliveries and 22 tips, once again hovering around the 30% mark. White people are at about 30 deliveries and 26 tips. Hispanics are still doing exceptionally well at about 22 deliveries and 20 tips. 

Remember, the bar is set at $1, which is below the average tip I need to even make the job worthwhile. Thus far black people make up about 90% of my stiffs and $1 tips. White people and hispanics make up about 98% of my $5+ tips. In fact I remember the two black people that gave me a $5 tip in the last week.

Oftentimes, I will be too lazy to drive to the store to get soda when I run out, so I'll place an online order from Dominos.com for a couple 2 liter bottles of soda and get a medium pizza as well.  Went fine at first, I always tip decently, etc.  Three of the past four times, the delivery guy shows up with just the pizza and tells me they didn't give him the soda at the store, so he could take it off the bill for me or go back and get it.  Since the order was placed specifically so I can get soda, I always ask him to go back and get it, but I tip him before he leaves to go back to the store just in case they send someone else back to bring the soda or whatever.

Each time, the same guy, who has already been tipped, has brought the soda back (usually within 20 minutes but once it was over an hour later when it's clearly supposed to go with my pizza) and awkwardly hung at the door after handing it over and I've said thank you, obviously waiting for a tip.  

Am I really supposed to tip twice in these situations?  Or situations where the pizza order is messed up and the guy has to come back with a different pizza later on because of store error?

I've been driving for almost 6 years total. This was back in college though when i was in my first couple years...not my current job:

Typical Sunday morning shift that started with a timed order to a church. Nothing really atypical of this at all...dropped off another order on my way and headed up to the address. Well...there were no houses or churches at the address and in fact i'm pretty sure that address didn't exist. This was in about 2004 so smart phones and GPS were not nearly as common. I was running late now but i had called several times and got no answer. It was a church so i supposed that no body was actually in the office and they were waiting for me in the after service room. Well, i finally tried a church down the same road with a completely different address and as i pull up a guy comes out and says "" she's been waiting for you, you better get in there"". He was nice enough but the lady in side...wellllll

She takes me into the kitchen and as i unload the pizza, she unloads on me. ""You're almost 15 minutes late! I have hungry people here! blah blah blah.."" I'm taken aback and i explain that it is truly not my fault as the address was wrong. I inform her that it's probably not her fault either but yelling wont' solve the problem. She does not care for my tone at all but we call the store to work something out. The store allows her to get 30 dollars off....she cuts a new check and i get out to the car. I look at the check. She had taken 100 dollars off. I informed the store and my manager said that this was not the deal. I went back in to ask her about it and got a very snide, rude and condescending comment about how she wasn't paying for it. That was it for me...i was a young college kid doing this part time! I said screw customer service and screw this lady. I said something along the lines of "" it's nice to see you practicing all that forgiveness as a christian"". 
She really ddn't like that. I'm pretty sure she didn't say anything else. She handed me the original check for full price and stormed off. So, my manager still took the 30 dollars off her order and there was a small tip on from the first time anyway! I'd never act like that again at my current job, but i certainly felt validated for putting her in her place back then!

* THE WORST: Delivered to a very fat man wearing nothing but an open robe. I didn't see his junk because his stomach was covering it, however I couldn't NOT see the horrible greenish scaley, snotty growths all over his legs. He smelled unwashed, and his apartment reeked. He didn't say a word to me, just paid me and took his food. I told my manager when I came back that I would never deliver there again. Relatively, though, I admit that this is far from the worst thing that one can experience as a delivery driver. Whenever I remember this story I always think of the Jimmy John's delivery driver who was murdered in Milwaukee while he was working a few years back.


* Flashed by a large drunk girl twice in the same delivery. She hopped out from behind a wall the first time (as a different girl was paying me), then came out on to the balcony as I was leaving. That was the only time a girl flashed me :(


* One time, as I neared the house I was going to deliver to, it started hailing out of nowhere. It went on for 5-10 minutes, and I kid you not, there was so much of it that it covered the ground completely, and it looked like snow. I had to wait in my vehicle right outside the house until it subsided, and I could see the people inside watching me. When it finally stopped (as suddenly as it started) I was able to deliver their food. They didn't tip me.


* Another time there was an actual tornado warning. The tornado had actually touched down just west of the town. A guy called up and asked if we were still delivering with the tornado going on. I told him sure, if my life meant that little to him, why not?


* I live in a college town in WI that has what they call ""Beer Gardens"" every year after graduation. It's the busiest day of the year for us, hands down, and we're right in the middle of all the college bars, so it gets pretty crazy. I was never so happy to see cops everywhere in my life. I came out to my car once to find a bald douche bag about to start pissing on my car. I told him in less than polite words that it was my car and to not even start. He walked over to the next car and started peeing on it instead. I had to walk about 15 feet to find the nearest cop and direct him to the idiot pissing on cars.


* The majority of black people in our town are unsettlingly stereotypey. Usually, the only time I got tipped by a black person was when they were a college student, which is hilarious since college students are often terrible tippers. Honestly, though, I can't even hold it against them considering how much I made in tips on average. But there was the one guy who gave me money, then started turning around to go upstairs before I could even offer him change. I started to leave, but he turned around said ""Hey man, the total was $XX.XX! You owe me at least a quarter!"" I gave him back a little more than what I owed him, since I never carried exact change. Really??


* ""What are your specials?"" became the most hated phrase ever. A lot of that was because of hearing it so often, but it was also because of the way it was said. It was never ""Hi, I'd like to order a couple of pizzas for delivery, but was wondering if you had any specials for something like that?"" It was always, ""Uh, yeah, like what are your specials?"" Cue me reading off all 10 of our specials, 9 of which didn't apply to anything they wanted, and then 85% of the time they'd end up ordering a single pepperoni pizza. Fuck you if you do this.

Just a quick note: this happened in the early 2000s when I was 16 or 17, making about $6/hour.  I was not part of the fight club.

There was about 2 weeks one spring when we had an assistant manager (who shall be called Josh) who was really into fight club.  He thought it would be a good idea to start one in the back of the store.  I should also mention this: Josh was an asshole and an alcoholic.  Not your everyday asshole, either.  Everything he said was fact, everything he claimed was true and anyone who questioned him was a liar.

The drivers--who if you haven't read parts 1 and 2 were usually high on weed, coke, mushrooms and/or some other drug--thought this was a great idea.  Boxing gloves were brought in and rules were laid down.  It was pretty much 'no sack taps' and 'when someone tags out, the fight stops'.  One slow summer night a few days later, it started.  2 of the drivers were given gloves and they duked it out behind the store in the parking lot. Once they had boxed themselves out, 2 more drivers took up the fight.  It went like this pretty much every night for a week when we had some down time.  It began to get a little out of hand after that, though.

During one of the fights, one of the drivers ""accidentally"" sack tapped Josh during a fight.  This, combined with a few too many beers, would have turned a friendly fight into a brutal beating had the other drivers not stepped in.  Whether or not it was accidental, I can't say, but the driver swore it wasn't intentional.  Either way, the gloves came off and it became a brawl.  They were wrestling on the floor, throwing punches and trying to pin their opponent.  

It was a few minutes before the drivers could get in and break it up.  Josh walked out and was gone the rest of the night.  Brian sent the driver home to nurse his fat lip and bloody nose.  This was the end of out fight club.  When Josh came back the next day, he had a shiner that was being poorly covered by makeup. Instead of manning up to the pokes at looking like a woman, he just told everyone to fuck off and quit.

I apologize for the poor quality, but [these pics](http://imgur.com/a/oaVDV) were taken on my late 90s/early 2000s cell phone.  The indoor pics were from the fight that ended fight club and you can see where the drivers started to jump in to break it up.  IIRC, Josh was in the white shirt.  The outdoor shots were other driver-driver fights.

- Trip planner to find the fastest order to take multiple deliveries.
- Touching address to bring up that location in the maps app.
- Drink/call/misc reminders. Oh dear god how I would love this. It will remind you of drinks ordered before you leave, tell you to call when you roll up, or just tell you whatever extra things the customer requested at appropriate times.
- Checklist so they can see what orders have already been dropped off.
- Cash/tip calculator. Basically it will keep track of how much cash you should have, how much you actually have, and tallies tips from all orders and tells you how much you have in tips so far.

Now, this location had a fairly diverse delivery area, and we had customers from all sides of the financial spectrum, but this guy was by far the most interesting. We very seldom had orders from him, and I only delivered to him once in the ~8 months that I had worked for this place. 

Now, this guy owned some sort of what could only be described as 'random stuff business'. It wasn't new either, oh no. You couldn't call it a second hand store either. It was more a...collection of interesting items you could say. To top it off, it was off a busier road in the middle of a residential area. It was just the most awkward place to put a business. Anyway, I deliver to him one day and he is just the most awkward fellow. He didn't say much to me, and when it came time to pay he gave me a handful of bills and then told me to wait outside for my tip. He comes back a few seconds later with a CARTON of Marlboro Reds. I begin to interject, telling him that ""Oh, no, I don't smoke!"" but he pushes it into my hands and goes inside. 

Confused, I get back into my car and head back to the shop. I get there and show my manager what my 'tip' was and he looks at me and starts laughing. Opening it up though, there was a pack of reds full to the brim with change along with several origami folded dollar bills with change inside some of them! (Explains why it was so heavy in any case)  Ended up with a ~$10 tip, and some interesting origami bills! 

I have other stories from that store. Because of the area we had some very...colorful characters to say the least.

I would always run in and out of the store and to the door.  This was just good work ethic but also made me sweat and people noticed and seemed to tip me more.  When it was raining I would make sure to get soaking wet before I went to the door and I'd try the sympathy card.  

Also I had a pen and bumper sticker that went a little like [this](http://images4.cpcache.com/product/289085694v6_350x350_Front_Color-White.jpg).  This didn't help much but I still have the bumper sticker on my car and hope that some people read it and start to tip drivers (I don't deliver anymore).

Probably one of the more messed up things I did...though I don't regret it but some would frown upon it.  I worked at PJI and was one of their 3 good drivers (everyone else pretty much sucked).  Well us 3 had the managers code so we could check out more than 2 deliveries at a time and we could view every ones runs and at what time they checked him out at.  Well when the 3 or just 2 of us where working together, we would work together.  We would text each other the next deliveries coming up by saying directions (N, NE, S, etc.).  With the managers code we could check to see what all the other drivers where checking out and when.  We all knew how fast the other drivers where and could very accurately gauge all their times for when they would be back from the delivery they just took.  So we had a system going to where when we checked if one of us where lined up for something good we just wouldn't say anything.  But if I knew one of the other 2 would be back before someone else and the next run was a South run (99% stiffs) I'd send them a text it would go something like ""**5**(amount of time they need to waste before getting back to the store)**SE**(Where that run was going)""  With this system we would keep ourselves out of the bad areas.  We also would use this system to fuck over drivers who took bullshit runs.  What we did might have been bull shit but we never took bullshit runs.  Also the other drivers where just terrible and would take 15 minutes or so more time than they really should have been taking also they would clock out retarded runs and leave things they should have taken.

But what we are all really here for is Story time right? SO I worked at this little Pizza delivery shop for a summer, it was the closest one to my house, not the greatest pizza but it was passable. I was paid in cash under the table, and generally like everyone who I worked with. One day we get a delivery to 41 Blue lane (can't remember the actual street name). So we make the order, I check out map wall and located the street in question. Easy peasy so far...

So I get to the street in question and from the street I am one there is a trident of streets essentially. The One to my left I notice immediately is called Blue lane, so I hop on that. So I am driving down the road, 35, 37, 39, 43, 45...wait a minute, I check a bit further and the numbers start going down, this can't be the right way.  I double back and there is no 41. So I check the other side of the road, and obviously don't find it. So I double back again all the way to the trident and see that the road straight on from where I started is also called Blue lane drive, so I head down that and find a building labeled 41. I knock and am greeted by a nice looking lady and her son, they did not order any pizza. At this point I am baffled, and realize I had left my Cell Phone at the shop. So I head down the only other spoke of the trident available to me. This one started around 51, 49, 47, 45, 43, 39, 37...wait what? So I just start driving forward trying to figure out what to do when I notice the numbers have started to count up again. Huzzah! Finally I find 41, but when I pull into the driveway I see the house owner with his cellphone in hand on the porch...shit. He had called my boss, who had tried to call me and obviously didn't reach me. So I deliver the pizza, get no tip (which was fair, it took me forever to get there) and then return to home base only to be chewed out by my boss. She screams at me asks me if I was on drugs, and pretty much fires me on the spot (Ironically one of the only times I wasn't high and delivering). So I just take my cash from the till and leave, never to return. I still call them up for pizza deliveries sometimes for nostalgia's sake (And because they are the only non-chain that will deliver to me).

A second question; for take-out is a $2 tip on the same tab cool?  When I use take out it's because I need to go buy some cigs or booze too, so ordering the pizza before I leave makes it so I don't have to wait and can enjoy them all together.

After reading a couple of stories, I have some doubts on whether or not this job is worth it though. Couple of things I'd like some input on.

1) Been reading that a majority of drivers get compensated for gas at most other pizza places. This is not the case with JJs and I've come to notice that I end up spending **half** my tips just on gas. Is this normal?

2) When I got the job, I was under the impression that all I'd have to do was deliver. Heard stories of pizza driver friends that they just chill watching tv while they wait for a delivery if its slow. Not the case with JJs. Have to step on the sandwich line whenever I'm not taking a delivery and have to be taking phone orders too. Neither that I'm fond of. Is this normal for you guys?

3) The orders are too small. Almost everything I take is sub-$10-15 which means 1-2$ tips. Even if I take 25+ delivers in a 3-4 hour shift thats still only average about $30-40 tip money once I""m done. Half of which goes to gas. I've read that a lot of you guys average orders of at least $20. So that means somewhat alright tips (I'm assuming).

I, and some other post-film-school-obviously-now-working-in-service compatriots, are working on putting together a series of instructional videos on service jobs. The catch is that theses videos are not for service workers, but for potential customers to teach them how to properly behave (if such a thing can ever be hoped for). 

The first video we're doing is on delivery drivers and I was hoping some of you here might be willing to help just a little. I've been delivering for almost two years now, but I've only delivered for the one business I work with now (Lou Malnati's, deep dish Chicagoland franchise), so I'm curious about the experiences from drivers at other restaurants/stores/franchises and how they may differ from my own.


Specifically, I'd just like to hear from you this:  if you could tell that obnoxious customer they just committed one of your most hated pet peeves and suffer no repercussions, what (besides poor tipping obviously) would you call them out for?

I have an 11:00AM class, so there's no problem with me getting back at 2:00, 2:30, whatever (we close at 1). On this particular night (this was in November), I had to drop off my manager. He had a car, but it broke down, and he can't afford anything else at the moment, so he gave me a pizza to drop him off. It's cool. 

So, I drop him off, and I head towards the highway to get back to campus. I turn on to the frontage road, and start heading north, and there, in the middle of the *frontage* road was a van that had obviously rolled several times. Its tires were missing or really bent at an angle they shouldn't have been bent at. There is no front grill guard. Half of the roof is caved in. Also, the horn. I think the car alarm was set off, because every 3 seconds we'd get to really loud beeps. 

A drunk driver had rear-ended this van on the freeway, causing the driver to lose control, and sent it rolling off the freeway and onto the frontage road. The drunk driver ended up wandering into the HOV lane and subsequently into the barrier. 

The van was an airport shuttle that was carrying an elderly couple.

So, I park my car in the middle of the three lanes about 30 yards away from the accident on the frontage road. There was light traffic, and I'd rather someone hit my parked car than kill the rest of us. I get out, grab my flashlight, and I immediately see the elderly couple in the front row of the van. The lady is holding a towel to her head, but appears to generally be fine. Maybe a concussion. The guy's right side (closest to the doors of the van) was covered in blood. He was missing his arm. It was severed right below his shoulder. There were tendons, bone, and muscle just hanging out. He was fading in and out of consciousness. The driver of the van had given another person a belt, and they devised a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. I wish I could have helped more, but they really had the situation under control. I just held the flashlight.

When they finished with the old man, I went to wrangle the driver. He was in shock, and decided he would pick up the car parts scattered about the highway. Mind you, there's still traffic, and people can't see that well at night. I wrangled him back to the sidewalk of the frontage road, and we waited for the police there. We talked about what had happened, and he ultimately seemed more calm when the police arrived and started interviewing us. 

An ambulance pulled up, they removed the elderly guy from his seat, and hauled him off to the hospital. The lady came second, and although she could stand up, they put her in a stretcher and hauled her off too. 

The thing I remember most was what this lady said. She was another first responder (citizen, not police/fire). While the guy was tightening the belt tourniquet, she walks up with a trashbag and says ""Sir! Sir, I have you arm."" 

http://www.nbcdfw.com/traffic/stories/Mans-Arm-Severed-in-Early-Morning-Crash-180990591.html

The article got two things wrong; a lady found the arm, and it was severed just below the shoulder, not the elbow.

Which means I don't get to see anything outside of my 300(ish) sq. ft. work space all day. 

I've been thinking about making this post for a long time, but never really gotten around to it.

There at lots of things I do on my end that can potentially make the customer tip the driver more (or so I like to think). 

Whenever I take an order on the phone, I always automatically find the best coupon on their order, and tell them exactly how much money I saved them. Sometimes I get a ""thank you"" but not that often.

There are a few specific customers who I (and my fellow insiders) work with to facilitate any possible disabilities they might have. 

There's this one really sweet older gentleman who has pretty severe Parkinson's, and will only talk to me or the other woman I work with. When we've finished taking his order, we always ask him how much he wants to add as a tip because he can't write it on the receipt himself (he shakes a lot and has trouble). The tip is usually 5 or 6 bucks. Not bad on one pizza and a 20 oz. Diet Coke, right? Anyway, with any new drivers who bring him his food we always have to emphasize the absolute necessity that they MAKE SURE he has a firm hold on the food before they let go.

There's another guy who lives in a community for adults with special needs. Really sweet guy. I love answering the phone when he calls. This man is apparently the nerdiest looking white guy ever.

This one other guy who only ever comes in to order and pick up his food always takes the time to chat to us ladies while qr make his food. He's apparently really allergic to black olives, so we clean all blades before cutting his pizza.

I opened the box, and while I ordered my pizza to be well done, it was pretty fucking burnt and they didn't cut it well.  I wouldn't take away from the driver's tip, but I would have asked him to take the pizza back with him and canceled my order. 


Honestly, what are the factors that I should consider when tipping?  Should I make the guy stand around for an extra few minutes while I take a quick peek at my pizza to make sure everything is correct?  What percentage should I use when calculating my tip?  What factors should I consider when sending a pizza back with the driver?  Do places make the driver pay for pizzas that are sent back?

* Had a co-worker who was only with us for a few weeks, if I recall correctly. He was, unfortunately, incapable of doing much of anything right. He was yelled at for turning the pizza bag sideways while carrying it (with pizza in it, of course), which ruined the pizza. That's not a huge deal, but he went on to do it about 3 more times. I still remember one of the shift runners who is still a friend of mine saying in such a sad, disappointed way, ""It wasn't really his fault, he was just a fuck-up.""


* A guy who I knew when I was younger ordered from us for awhile when we used to run these boneheaded specials. Basically the special would be something like ""Large Gourment Pizza or Build Your Own Pizza (unlimited toppings) + cheese sticks for $23"" or whatever. 
Well this dickbag would use that to order a large pizza with triple black olives, triple green olives, triple chicken, double cheese, double onions, half alfredo sauce half salsa, etc. Bascially a $50 pizza for less than half the price. On a few occasions he would send it back because ""the cheese slid"". YOU DON'T SAY? The 10 lbs of toppings on your disgusting piece of shit pizza managed to shift due to the slightest tilt? What a surprise. And they actually replaced it for him on more than one occasion. *Sigh.*
He apparently also complained that his pizza wasn't cooked all the way through on one or more occasions until the manager explained it wasn't possible to cook it properly due to all the shit piled on top of it. They eventually got rid of the stupid specials he was taking advantage of. He was the ONLY person who abused it. 
On the one occasion that I had to deliver it to him, the interaction was something like this:

**Me:**  That will be $23.50

**Him:**  Here you go. Just let me check the pizza quick.

**Him:**  Oh hey the cheese is sliding off of it.

**Me:**  Okay. *Shrugs*

*I turn and walk away back to my car.*


* I delivered to a guy who literally looked exactly like James Brown from his infamous mug shot photo. He asked me if I was the guy he had ""sold some shit to awhile back"". I told him no, no I was not. On a different order he basically bullied another driver into giving him $5 more than what he was owed in change, accusing the driver of ripping off his son who answered the door and paid. After that driver came back and told our manager the customer was called and told he was not to order from us any more.


* I once had to clean the entire pizza oven and the area around it with the help of one other person. It was an annual thing, I believe, but if it was planned for that specific night, none of us non-managers knew about it beforehand. It took forever, and by the end of the night every article of clothing I was wearing, including my shoes, was ruined.

I was working at Jimmy Johns and had just gotten another job in my desired career so I was just counting down the last few hours of my last shift until I quit. The manager on duty was a doofus (JJ LOVES to promote dumbfucks that are mindlessly loyal to the brand) so he made me do all the bullshit cleanup while he read drudgereport since it was my last night ever.

Dick.

Orders were slow so time passed even slower as I slaved in this fucking stupid fucking store. But we finally got down to the last hour and I was looking forward to getting the fuck out of here forever.

That night was a Friday so they closed at 4am. Of course the last order of the night had to came at 3:58.

And of course it had to be to the outer boundaries of our area.

And of course it was to this university apartment complex with an unpredictable numbering sequence (in small, black numbers that were nailed against a dark brown wood wall) that made it difficult to find the exact address to deliver to.

So not only was I gonna be driving for a minute, I was gonna have to get out and walk to find the address somewhere in a block of 30-40 apartments. Did I mention the person only ordered a $3 sandwich?

I kept my cool, trying to be a professional, finish strong and all that. But the person that ordered the sandwich had no understanding of where her apartment was so I spent 20 minutes walking to find it.

When I got to the door I had on the biggest fakest smile I could muster even though I had to knock three times to get some recognition. But when the occupant got moving I heard the heaviest, most foreboding footsteps ever.

What opened the door was at least three hundo and had more teeth and acne than face, but it didn't stop her from flirting with me. I, a guy, gave her the smoothest chitchat I could muster trying to see if I could get a little extra love from this...woman. By now it was about 4:45am and my boss was calling me to see what was taking so long since he couldn't leave until I got back, but fuck him. He made me do bullshit work so he could be lazy and sent me out here on this fucked up delivery voyage. His bitchass could wait.

So this thinggirl I was talking to finally said she had to go to bed, but asked me for my number. Even though I'd been calling her from my cell, I gave her a fake one saying it was my home phone (people still had them back then even though I didn't) and to call me anytime. It smiled, reached into her pocket, and pulled out a plastic bag full of change.

She tried to go back inside, but fuck her. I told her it was company policy for me to count it out in front of her, so she waited while I slowly counted out $3 in change...to the penny. She immediately, waved, smiled (I think), closed the door and trundled back inside.

I, stunned, just stood there for a minute. I'd just spend 20 minutes flirting with one of the ugliest women I'd ever seen just so I could get a bit of a better tip and still got hosed. With the drive back it was gonna be a 60+ minute delivery with nothing to show for it.

I don't know if they were her flowers, the complexes flowers, or a neighbor's or what. But they were sitting right there in the dark next to her door, taunting me. So I pissed on 'em. I pissed long and hard, trying to plaster the flowers to the wall of her apartment. When I was done, I slowly zipped up and went to go look for my car.

Karma's a bitch though cuz when I got back, my manager had punched me out and left, figured me for sluffing off. I didn't even get credit for the last 20 minutes of my shift. Whatever. Fuck that place. Fuck that bitch. Fuck doofus. And fuck Jimmy Johns.

TL;DR Shitty manager makes me do shitty shit and last delivery of my life is to a fugly broad that stiffed me so I pissed on some flowers by her door.

This other driver is notorious (amongst numerous other things that irk me) for ...,35,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/19rcwz/i_keep_getting_stuck_with_another_drivers_chores/,"I keep getting stuck with another drivers chores and I'm sick of it. This other driver is notorious (amongst numerous other things that irk me) for opening but never taking out the 'day trash' before they leave, so since I usually get 'trash' assigned at night, I wind up with double the amount of work to do. What really burns me about it is that I have been keenly aware of this person repeatedly 'forgetting' to take out the trash for many, many months now, and have steadily stepped up my responses over time by first asking and then 'nagging' them in private, then later in front of management, then outright demanding that management *make* them do their job so I do not have to. It's not that they are too busy. The driver that regularly opens on weekdays almost always takes out the trash and will outright tell me if they ran out of time and couldn't get to it. I have no problem with that. My problem is that most days are just like today...

I come in at 4 and the opening driver is complaining that ""I've only had one run from 11 until 3"".  Since I usually have trash, the first thing I do is go find the trash cans to see if it was taken out. It hasn't. One big can in back is completely full (mostly sauce cans). The big can in the front of the store is almost full. A stack of several various food and sauce cup boxes sits on the floor in the front. And the 'tall kitchen' waste can by the registers where we throw receipts and label sticker paper in is full. Next I check the chore sheet and am surprised to find that instead of trash, I have dishes, and no one is assigned trash for the evening.

Later when that driver is jockeying to get sent home. I mention in front of the closing manager ""Don't forget to take out the day trash before you leave"" and nothing much is said, but I get that 'look'. I figure that since the manager is now aware of it, AND I don't have trash anyways, I'll just leave it at that. On a side note though, I was supposed to have dishes, but since I was expecting heavy rain all thru the rush and to be busy and late getting off by 8, I opted to pay an insider $7 bucks (which he wanted paid in Girl Scout cookies that I have instead of the cash I offered. (Weird details, but that is how it happened and you'll see why that detail is important in a minute...)

Anyways, It is raining, but not that much and we are able to keep up. Later I notice that the day driver has been sent home, but the trash remains, and it's now overflowing. I'm disappointed, but hey, I did my part, right? No effect on me, right?

So I take my last runs and get done just after 8. Just as I am grabbing my cash to check out the managers says to me ""Since you don't have dishes anymore, and no one has trash tonight do you mind taking it out?"" I flip out... 
""I PAID to get out of doing dishes, and {the day driver} was told that *they* need to take the trash out and YOU heard it! I'm sick of getting stuck with {that persons} work even after I point it out AND remind them to do it!""

So after I get done bitching about how this happens time and time again and how I will take even more overt action to change things (I won't reveal that at the moment) I agree to take out the trash in the rain for the good of the shop and so as not to push the burden off on yet another person later who is at no fault...

So, that all said, I have some questions:

What do you think about a driver who does this over and over again, even after having been called out on it repeatedly? (Please be brutally honest and verbose, I expect that person will be reading these responses elsewhere. :D 8-) )

What ways do you suggest that I retaliate (with the blessings of management of course!)? Mind you that anything I do must not affect the normal operation of the store and must not make extra work for anyone but that driver.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_19rcwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/19rcwz/i_keep_getting_stuck_with_another_drivers_chores/,

I'm going to pretend like I'm him while typing it out, so just pretend it's an old Russian sounding dude saying this.
So it was 11:45 and I was just arriving back at Papa Johns after finishing my route. It was a Saturday night and I wanted to get back home to the wife and kids. It was only me and my manager clean up as it was a very slow day.

All of a sudden, we get a call from a very rude lady. She needs two large pizzas and a 2 liter bottle of Coke as soon as possible. This lady lives at the edge of our territory, about 30 minutes away. I look at my boss to see if I can just tell her we're closed.

He says no, we must serve this lady. It is policy. I sigh to myself, but it is my job.

So we heat up some pizzas in the oven that was going to be dinner for me and my manager, and I grab the Coke and head out to the customer's house. At about 12:25 I arrive. I answer the door and immediately she complains why I had taken so long. She demands free pizza. I say no, that is not policy and I cannot do that.

She gives up, and just wants the pizza. I give her the pizza. I go get Coke from car. When I arrive to the front door with the Coke, the woman starts to act crazy. She specifically ordered Fanta, she says. I show the woman, on the receipt, she had ordered Coke. My manager took the order, he heard Coke.

She demands free pizza for this. I tell her again, ""This I cannot give. You can either take the Coke, or I will take the Coke. No refund.""
This woman is still acting crazy, so I decide to call boss and explain situation. He says, ""You must drive back here and grab a Fanta and deliver it to her.""

This is the moment where I had given up getting home while my wife was awake. I tell the woman it will take another hour before she gets her Fanta. She is fine with that.
I drive back and I grab the Fanta. My boss says sorry, it is policy. I understand. There is no problem.
I have never shaken soda before. There is no reason, it fizzes and explodes. I had a reason this time. I shook that soda up and down, left and right. I shook it with one arm and drove with the other. I released all my anger onto that soda for 30 minutes. Shake. Shake. Shake.

I walk up to the door while still shaking the soda. There is no anger anymore. Just shake. The woman opens the door. I give her the soda. I tell her to have a good night.
She is thoughtful enough to leave a tip. 2 dollars. I take, thank for business, and go back to my car.
On the way home I receive a call from my manager.

""Can you believe it? Now the woman's making up a lie that the soda exploded in her face to get a refund. I can't believe people these days. Sorry for keeping you up late for this bitch, James.""
""No problem boss, see you tomorrow.""

I knock on the door and a cat walks up but no answer. It happens sometimes but I can usually call the customer to get them to come to the door. I call twice, no answer. I call my boss and ask her if I have any more I need to take or if I can just wait and see whats up for a few more minutes. I waited and got a text maybe five minutes later from the lady I was delivering to. It said: ""I'm driving"". I text back and say, ""Hi this is -myname- with -storename- and I have your pizza. I call my boss again saying what happened and she says to just wait till she calls me back to the store. I left the lady a message saying to call my number for the delivery again and just walked the 3 houses down to my buddies house. I just sit and talk for maybe fifteen or twenty minutes before my boss calls me back and tells me I have one more up. I drive back (at this point her delivery has been up for an hour and fifteen minutes, well after the suggested time). I am halfway on this other run when I get a text in all caps saying, ""WHY DIDNT YOU LEAVE MY FUCKING PIZZA ON THE STEPS I WANT A FULL REFUND""

The problem is that this 30 minutes is the same regardless of whether you're taking 1 or 7 orders. So if you're taking more than 2 orders it's easy to go over 30 minutes and then get yelled at for going too slow when you get back to the store.

So tonight I was taking 3 orders and on my way to my last one. I had to drive all the way up this one road that is one lane plus a bike lane on the right. Of course as I turn onto the road I see a car in front of me driving slowly. Usually this isn't a problem, but the car was going 20 mph in a 35 mph zone.

I didn't want to be a dick by honking at them, if they want to go slow that's fine, so I do the most reasonable thing I can think of and speed up to 40 or so and pass her. There was no cars/bikes in the bike lane, so I simply passed around her and continued on my way.

I get back to the store and am immediately called into the manager's office. He asks if I passed someone in the bike lane, I tell him yes I did because she was going about half the speed limit. He tells me that some lady called in and was furious that one of the store's drivers was ""driving recklessly"" and ""zoomed passed"" in the bike lane. So I get a warning not to do it again.

Two days ago, on a cold winter's day, I had a delivery to the city (east orange st). As I pulled up, there was a man and woman, aged roughly 25, smoking outside the address (rowhouse). I hopped out of the car and verbally established that they were indeed who I was looking for. As I walk up to the set of steps that she was standing on, I notice that there are a few drops of blood on the ground in front of me. Dry, mind you, but blood. No big deal, I'm thinking. It's downtown in the cold, somebody probably got a nosebleed or something. We make the exchange, she hands me a twenty and asks for six back, netting me a cold hard dollar. She apologizes for the shitty tip, which she said was due to her being pretty poor at the moment. As I bid her adieu, I begin to notice that they are more than just a few drops of blood. Just as I'm beginning to think about how bad that nosebleed must have been, I turn around and find a pool of blood on the sidewalk. A straight up, 2 foot by 2 foot pool of blood. The middle wasn't as dry as the outside, so it was still pretty fresh considering the temperature (25f). The woman took notice that I took notice and said ""I got bit by a dog last night."" I nodded approvingly, hopped in my car, then noped the fuck out of there. On my way to stop #2 I began to wonder... Who the fuck gets bit by a dog then lays on the sidewalk outside while they bleed to death? Also... she seemed pretty alright in her light coat in the 25 degree weather and wind to have just lost that much blood the previous night. Also, where the fuck did she get bit? She was using both arms and standing. She walked towards me and I didn't notice a limp... I decided that for a dollar, it was worth calling the non emergency number and letting them know there was a big ole pool of blood on the sidewalk outside their house.

Order was for $50.80.  Guy comes to door and asks if I have change for $100, I'm not sure as it is early and can't remember if anyone paid with cash.  Take out my fold and remember, oh yeah, someone did.

He's so busy looking at my fold to see if I have change, he's trying to hand me 2 hundred dollar bills.  He's saying, ""Just give me $30"".

I say, ""That's $200"" as I try to pluck 1 out of his hand.  He tries to put both in my hand and I repeat, ""That's $200"".  He looks down, hands me one.  I give him $30.

Then I realize he just gave me a $19 tip so I ask if he's sure that's okay.  He says ""yeah"" looking at the hundred in his hand like he should give that to me too.  I walk back to my car.

He seemed fully sober and lucid.  His 6-7 year old son is running around and he was interacting/controlling the kid in a totally normal manner.  He wasn't foreign so I assume he understood our dollars value.

I'm really happy with the $19.20 tip, but wonder if he wanted to give me the hundred too.

1375426984.0,29,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,1jjv3v,My experience driving for a pizza place that delivers almost exclusively to the ghetto,36,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1jjv3v/my_experience_driving_for_a_pizza_place_that/,"Selling Pizza to Crack Heads: My Time as a Driver

After working at this place off-and-on for only about 6 months in total over the course of a few years, I have enough strange stories to write a novel. I can’t give away the name because they might have my address still on file and some of the people there would fuck me up if they knew I was talking shit about them. 

Anyway, everything about that place is shady as shit. Even though it is located in an already slightly dicey area, this place stands out. The entire building is maybe 500 square feet. It looks more like a garage than a pizza place. It was known to shrewd teenagers as the place that will sell beer to anyone, even after 1:00 am, which is illegal in where I live. Also, it was always rumored to be a drug front. There would be at least 3 people loitering in the parking lot (which is more like a driveway) and they all looked like ex-cons. When I started working there, I discovered that they were the employees. And that they were in fact crazy ex-cons.

I started working there in summer of 2010 because I needed a job immediately and it seemed like a place that would hire anyone. The first driver I met was named Lonny. He looked really rough, and he was. He had just gotten out of prison for stealing from some ghetto muffler shop that he used to manage. On my first day a black woman came in and picked up her pizza. About 15 seconds after she left, Lonny leaned out the entrance and yelled, “fuckin’ coon BITCH! Fuckin’ nigger BITCH!” Again, I’m not kidding about any of this. The manager was about 4 feet away, and didn’t even act like she noticed. He put his hand up to his mouth when he did in an attempt to disguise the fact that it was him yelling it, which was pretty funny because there was no one else around. Years later, I was talking with my dad’s friend who happens to be a private investigator about where I worked and he flipped out. He was shocked that I worked there because he had a client who worked there and was robbed by three black dudes in ski masks who ordered a pizza to a vacant house. They pulled him inside and beat him almost to death with crowbars and baseball bats. It turned out it was Lonny.

There was another lifer that worked there named Craig and he could get away with whatever he wanted because he was the fastest driver by far. He would get twice the runs as anyone else. He was definitely a lifer. He had been through a lot at that place. When he wasn’t at work, the boss would use him as an example. She would warn me of the dangers of getting out of the car without first calling ahead and confirming that the people that ordered the pizza actually live at whatever address they gave. “Craig’s been shot 3 times on delivery. 3 separate times.” I was baffled by the fact that Craig continued to drive after being shot 3 times until I overheard a conversation he had later. “I was tryin’ to get a job at Minuteman Pizza cuz you get more runs there, but they don’t hire people with felonies. I got like four o’ them motherfuckers.” 

The owner would come in every night after midnight and take over. Let’s call him… Shteve. He was a normal-looking old guy, to my surprise. Not hood at all. But he was aware of all the pot smoking, white-trashiness, and general lack of professionalism at his business and he didn’t care. I think that he actually preferred it that way because he could treat his white trash employees like shit, which he very evidently enjoyed. The misfits that he hired weren’t the kind of people to quit and get a job at Starbuck’s. I’m talking about a certain class of employee that is a couple notches below Waffle House server. They really needed that job. The kitchen staff was mostly fat lesbians. The owner would always give them the most shit. Really intense sexual harassment, it was pretty despicable; although I did laugh when he suggested to an especially butch one that she should “fulfill her life’s destiny and get a job at Stanley Steamer with all the other lesbians.

It was pretty clear that Steve purposefully cultivated his base of ghetto customers. That was his niche; if it weren’t for the fact that other places didn’t deliver to shitty neighborhoods, he wouldn’t make any money. One time he said, “alright, Andy. Now you’re going to a crack house” as he handed me my next delivery. He wasn’t kidding about it being a crack house. One of the other drivers told me that she delivered to a crack house one time and the guy attempted to pay her in crack. Steve was a total asshole to people on the phone, too. One time he took a delivery order, was frustrated because the guy on the other end was hard to understand, and went totally nuts. He said, “if you fucking crack heads on Pontiac Ave. call back here again, I’m gonna bust your head open with a ball bat.” Then he hung up and said to me, “alright Andy, here’s your next one. It’s going up to Pontiac Ave.” 

Years later, I was getting a beer with a friend of mine at a bar near the pizza place. On the way back he said, “you didn’t work at THAT place, did you? Didn’t you hear about when ” It turns out that an acquaintance of ours who is like 40 stopped by there on time back in the 90’s to get a pizza and ended up leaving with his pants full of shit. He went in, and the guy at the counter (from the description it sounds like Steve, although I’m not sure) was doing card tricks, trying to swindle customers out of money. “I bet you twenty bucks I can pick your card out,” he said. Our friend, thinking that he was kidding about the bet, played along. After he picked his card, our friend laughed and acted impressed to be polite. He was just there for his pizza, after all. He wasn’t really interested in the bet. But the guy working behind the counter demanded his money. Our friend laughed it off, thinking that the guy was just giving him a hard time. Then there was a gun pointed at him. “Gimme my fucking money!”. If he wasn’t so petrified, he probably would have given him the money, but he just stood there. “Eh, I’m just fuckin’ with you. Here’s your pizza.” If I hadn’t worked there, I wouldn’t have believed that story. 

The pizza is a solid 2/5.

Think like a normal Friday night, except with less workers because it was Monday and we were very rarely busy on Mondays. Monday was my day off, but I wanted some more hours before I took the next week off so my manager said I could come in for a couple hours to clean. Needless to say, not much cleaning got done that night and everyone was glad that I was there to help.

Anyway, on with the actual story. I come back in from a long distance double during the rush and take a call that just came in. Everything's normal and the order goes through fine. 

I then notice the line on hold, so I decide to check how long they've been holding to see how hard I should be apologizing. 10 minutes. Well, fuck. Now this may not seem too long to some of you, but this is a small store in a small town and a 10 minute hold is completely unheard of, especially when it was the only line on hold and someone should have helped the person by now.

So I get on the phone and start with the apologizing and ass-kissing. Of course this lady was understandably completely pissed off, and started yelling at me for having been put on hold for so long. So I take her order of two mediums and she would like it delivered. Great. This is still in the middle of the rush so our delivery times were looking like 45min-1hr, so I told her this. She did not like that. After some more yelling she changes her order to carry-out, the order goes through, everything is hunky-dory, and I go on with my night.

Later on while the rush was starting to wane, I was helping with the carry-outs. This guy comes up and I'm having trouble finding his order. He tells me he got sent to pick-up two mediums, but doesn't know what was on them or what name they were under. Very helpful. So he calls his, I assume, wife to ask her what she got on the pizzas and what name it should be under. He gives his phone to me to talk to his wife to help figure this out. Guess who? Yep, it was Mrs. 10min Hold. After she started yelling at me and I realized who it was, I got him the right order and sent him on his way.

Later on, it was finally cash-out time. Got about $35 in tips, good night around here. Then I'm informed that I'm $30 short. After about 45mins of trying to figure out wtf is going on, I realize that during the rush I probably screwed up while using the till. I'm not very good with the till. A little more digging and we found that while I was $30 short, another driver was $25 over and the till was $85 over. I'm still not entirely sure what happened there, but in the end I was even.

TLDR: 2 hours of cleaning turns into a 6 hour shift of fun on my day off.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_1iwfmt,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1iwfmt/im_not_even_supposed_to_be_here_today/,

Everyone involved just walks back with the biggest confused faces I've ever seen.

Awesome second: I go deliver to some apartments. I immediately recognize the address and the name. He's this old man who has trouble walking around. He always asks the driver to knock 4 times (""everyone knocks 3 times these days"" he says.) So I get to his door, knock 4 times, he calls me inside. He's walking, with a cane, from his couch to the table. I place his food (A sandwich, wings, and a soda) on the table. He's extremely polite, hands me the total amount, exactly, then gives me another $7. ""You probably need this a lot more than I do"", he says. I see an old Western playing on his TV so, just to make some small talk because he's taking a bit to sign the receipt, I ask him what movie it was. Boom. He knows the name of the movie, which year it came out, who's in it, where they filmed it, who directed it, the first time he saw it, etc. It was awesome. I love kind old people with stories. As I walk out towards the door, he calls at me stop. I turn around and he's pointing at his candy jar. He offers me some candy, and tells me to take as much as I want.

The new girl will be referred to as B, and the creepy guy as Creepy McFuckface/CMF.

So I'm working the ovens tonight when B gets off the phone, freaking out after taking an order. Apparently the guy who was making an order, Creepy McFuckface, spent the whole call badly hitting on her and asking for her number over and over. She was the one working carryout so I recommended she had someone else deal with this guy when he came in.

So later on only me and another driver were in the front, as the insiders were in the back prepping or something, and a guy comes in. Now before this guy even said a word I knew exactly who he was. This guy OOZED creep. Anyway, CMF walks in with a big shit-eating grin tells me his name and asks where B is. I decided to play dumb and pretend she didn't exist. He, of course, didn't believe me and would not drop it. He then leans over the counter and asks me if J, the other driver, was B and was just pretending to be on the phone with a customer. I give him my biggest confused and WTF face and tell him that no B works here. He finally starts to pay for his pizza and so, of course, hands me a $100 for a $20 order. I go to the back to tell them I need to break a $100 and so my manager, S, comes to the front with me to get CMF his change. Of course as soon as CMF sees S, he starts grilling her like he did me about B. S played along as if a B didn't work there and this annoyed CMF, who was rightly convinced that we were all lying to him. I finally just walked away and left the manager to deal with this guy, as food needed boxing. 

Later on we get a phone call. Luckily, I was the one to answer it. I go through the usual spiel and ask him what he would like to order when I notice he had just placed a carryout order a little bit earlier. I started to ask him if he had tried to place a carryout order online, as it is often screwy, when he cut me off and said ""I don't have a carriage hahaha"" and hung up. This confused the crap outta me and I was just going to write it off as a crank call until I noticed the name on the screen. Yep, it was Crazy McFuckface. The fucker was trying to catch B on the phone. Thankfully, that was the last we heard from him tonight.

The whole situation really skeeved me out. It was the first time I had personally seen a whole creep story played out in front of me. It was also the first time I'd seen a guy creep on an insider actually, IN the store. I'd heard plenty about phone-creeps, but I had never seen one try anything in-store. I had assumed that because me and most of the drivers were big burly guys that they wouldn't try that crap actually in-store. Apparently CMF was incredibly ballsy and/or stupid.

This whole thing tonight really got me thinking about how unfortunate women are in service positions, having to put up with that crap. Now I've had some creepy ladies hit on me, but none of them were anywhere NEAR this guys level.

I had never been a driver but for this story I went along on a delivery. 

We got a call on a Saturday night that a local church wanted 100 pizzas delivered the next morning.

...

I, being a brand new shift manager, was of course chosen to deal with the prep and proofing that was required so it would be ready to make in the morning. Fine, whatever, no biggie.

I go in with my GM around 6 A.M. and we get to work (just the two of us). Eventually (an hour or so later) all the pizza bags in the store are filled and we go to load them in the truck.

Now I'm kind of excited because I figure this is an expensive order (being gourmet each pizza was ~$18) so of course that means big tip! Plus I'd never delivered before.

I ride with my GM to the church... and no one is there to help. Fine. Cool. We bring them inside and arrange them all nicely, chatting with the old women who were inside.

After all the set up was done, napkins arranged, etc. we brought the bags back to the car and came back. They had paid with a card already over the phone so we just went back to make sure everything was good and hopefully get a tip.

One woman noticed us standing there awkwardly and came over and asked if there was a problem. She said they didn't order anything else so we were good to go.

I could hear my GM's teeth grating I swear... He inquired about gratuity and the lady said ""Oh don't worry I included it with the total!""

GM said it wasn't and she said ""that's ok, you guys have a great day!"" And with that she ushered us out the church and closed the door.

When I pick up an order, I don't always tip, and if I do it's not much.  The reason being all they did was ring me up and hand me my pizza.  Is this a dick move by me?

About a year and a half ago now, I'm working a closing shift at Pizza hut on a Saturday night. It is midnight thirty, and I have the last two runs in my hand and leaving out of the store.   Delivery 1 is in a nice neighborhood, delivery 2, not so nice but I have delivered there before and he tips $5 everytime.  

I go to delivery one, the house is midway through a dead end street, you have to take two left turns to get there, smack dab in a fairly large neighborhood, so while i am in the middle of a nice place, it is pretty quiet and what feels to be middle of nowhere although there are houses up and down the street. 

Anyway.   I round the last corner to get to the street with the house I'm delivering to, and i see a bunch of bodies/animals, whatever it is scurrying around the street, crossing the street, rolling in the grass, etc.  I'm like WTF, but not really, as upon further inspection I see a teenager run out across the road, in front of my car...  when he makes it to the other side he does some soldier, McGuyver shit ducking into a roll and pressing himself bodily against the grass like he is has a full set of cammo on and I couldn't possibly see him.   as I drive by him (my windows are down) I yell, ""you aren't hiding very well!"". I continue looking for the address. then i see another couple of teens doing the same thing darting across the road, running through bushes.  Imagine scared deer in headlights trying to cross the highway. 

So as I notice these kids playing what seems to be commando in their neighborhood at midnight thirty on a Saturday night, I also notice, they are about 17-ish, there are about 10 of them, and everyone of them is completely naked. 

yes, that is correct, about 10 17 year old boys, completely naked, playing commando in the front lawns of the neighborhood.   

so as I'm driving I realize I have passed up the house, I turn around, go to the house I need to deliver to, which happens to be the place where the first kid balled up on the grass trying to hide from me.  or hide from whatever. 

I get out of the car (4 pizzas to deliver) and make my way to the front door. ring, knock, ring, knock.. no one has answered.  walk around to the door under the open garage, ring the doorbell, knock again... no answer (there is a clothed teen playing on the computer as I can see him through the open window in the door so he is clearly ignoring me. 

so I hear some noise to my right, one of the naked teens is walking through the backyard into the carport, says one second, and goes inside the house.  He comes out about 5 minutes later with a pair of shorts on, hands me the money, takes the pizza, and I jet. 

As I'm driving out of the neighborhood street, making the right, there is one last naked dude, sitting in the middle of the road staring at my car as I drive past.  I hold out my hand and give him a high five as i drive off to delivery number 2.  

To this day I cant explain why I high-fived a naked teen boy at midnight thirty while driving in my car.

I'm a male with long hair. Like nipple length long. I moved to Utah recently and started working as a driver (I've been doing it for years). The owner is Mormon and has a huge problem with image. I'm pretty sure he cares about us looking like missionaries more than sales (not joking). Anyway, he has demanded that I tuck ALL my hair under my hat to give the illusion of me having short hair. I've outlined company policy to him which states ""hair touching the collar must be restrained in a ponytail or similar"" but he isn't having it. He even apparently hired a lawyer to see if he could make me do this. All the girls can have their hair any way they want, I have to shove it all into my hat uncomfortably. He even put me in a situation where I had to sign a contract saying if I come to work with my hair not in my hat again I'll be terminated, and if I didn't sign it immediately I'd be terminated.

Now I've compiled for a couple months but now that's it's 100+ degrees every day my head is a swamp. This bias really has to stop, and can't be legal. Is there anything I can do at this point, post contract and all?

One of their store policies was ""delivered in 30 minutes or it's on us.""  One of the trailer parks on the outskirts of town would order several pizzas on the weekends and my brother was usually the guy who went out to deliver them.  On several occasions he would arrive well within the 30 minute time limit to deliver the pies.  He would ring the doorbell and knock on the door, with no answer.  The lights were on in the trailer and he could clearly see the inhabitants through the front window, but they would simply refuse to answer the door.  He'd then pull out his personal cell phone to call them to let them know he was there...he'd hear the phone ring inside the trailer from the front door and they wouldn't pick it up.  After several minutes of this my bro would get fed up and leave, as he had other deliveries to make on the way back to the Hut.

A few minutes after he would leave the trailer park he'd get a call from his manager saying that the people in the trailer park called to complain that their pizza hadn't been delivered yet and that they should get it for free when it finally did arrive.  My bro would then have to drive back to their trailer and give them their pizzas.  Of course they'd neglect to tip him as well as ""he was late"" and therefore it was 100% free.

This went on for several weeks, and my brother's manager suspended him from delivering for a week because he thought that he was simply taking joyrides on his way out to the trailer park, even though he was never late with any other deliveries.  He continually took the side of the customer because ""the customer's always right.""  My bro was pissed but what could he do?  He needed the money and he had worked his way up to delivery driver from dishwasher and didn't want to have to start over looking for a new job.

When the manager started to notice that the same thing was happening to the other delivery driver on the weekends at the same trailer park he started to get suspicious.  One night he went out to deliver the pizzas himself and finally saw what was really going on.  For months this trailer park had been getting free pizzas.  I couldn't believe how long the guy let this go on, but whatever.  He finally adopted a no delivery policy to that trailer park and the problem pretty much cleared itself up.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_1b2bwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1b2bwq/trailer_park_delivery_hijinx/,

Now I don't about the US, but here in London if you pay in pennies (or cents if you like), you're putting the person who has to verify it through a bad time, literally like torture. So we had about 150 1p coins stacked up ready for when he comes. My friend shied out, so I had to collect and pay the poor guy.

So anyway, he arrives on time and everything, I act cool as if its no big deal. Thank him and hand him the money + all the pennies. Just as he is about to take them off me, my hand slips and out roll a couple of pennies and manage to get underneath the shoe racks and God knows whatever nook and cranny those blasting 1989 pennies could find. I couldn't take it anymore: ""Sorry about that mate"", and I proceed to slowly shut the door on his face, not knowing what to do. 
I just...left him there, not only to count 150 pennies, but to find them as well. I then proceeded to take our order inside, like the douche I am.

I didn't run into anyone insanely evil that I recall, but I did notice a bizarre discrepancy in the way poor people and rich people tipped me and it has remained with me, changing the way I treat service people, and the way I tip them, ever since. In the upper-class neighborhoods, I literally got nothing every single time but in the more rundown streets, I received reasonable tips and never felt like I had been stiffed. 

One afternoon I ended up at the most rundown apartment building I had ever seen. There was a chain-link fence around the yard which was full of dead, overgrown grass and weeds. I encountered two children as I went toward the stairs, one was very young--too young to be out alone I thought. That kid wasn't wearing shoes and had a dirty-looking bandage wrapped around one hand. There was another kid, older, maybe nine-years-old, with her. I heard him utter at least one f-word as I passed them. I went up the outside staircase onto the balcony in front of the upper apartments. The one I was going to was the last unit.

At my store, we're not allowed to apply any discounts unless you tell/ask us to. So if you order a large pizza and we have a special for a large pizza, I won't put it on your order unless you ask for that special (or even if you ask if we have *any* specials).

That being said, I've noticed that a majority (80% or more I would wager) of people that don't tip also don't use any discounts. I understand if you are hard-strapped for cash and can't tip, that's fine, but if you spend an extra $4-$10 on your order because you didn't use a special, it doesn't make sense. You could have given a few of those dollars to your driver and *still* saved money.

I realize there are people who *do* use coupons and don't tip, and while I don't really think that's a nice thing to do (if you can't afford an extra couple of dollars, you shouldn't really be ordering delivery), I still understand.

Just today we got an order for a large pizza from an address just outside of our delivery area.

I ran over to a CVS right next door while they were doing this to buy her the cigarettes. 

I took her order, dispatched myself from the computer and left for her house. -Side story before I get to the awesome part. I got there and was going to ring the door bell but there was a giant ass spider on it so I knocked. Anyways, she answered the door and told me to come in. She was probably in her 30's, total milf by the way. She asked, ""did you bring me cigarettes?"" I said, ""I sure did."", and then to my surprise she hugged me and said, ""oh my god, I love you so fucking much"". So I gave her the receipt to sign and put a tip on. It was a $15 dollar order and she gave me a $15 dollar tip. Sweet, right? 

I handed her the pizza and her cigarettes and was about to leave when she opened her arms for another hug. So I hugged her, cause why not. I got out the door and she said, ""you can come back later tonight and party with me if you'd like babe"". Yup she said babe, so I said ""alright!"", started laughing and got in my car. Needless to say, the guys at the store got a kick out of it. That is the greatest moment of my delivering career.

His manager and cooks absolutely hated making these because they had to make 9 pizzas just for a $10 order (yes, they're small, but still time consuming). So, the manager apparently told the cooks to make them really sloppy with sauce and cheese hanging over the edges and sparse toppings and such. They never did anything unsanitary or unhealthy with the pizzas, but he just made them look unappealing. The explanation my brother received was that if people ordered them once and saw how gross they were, they wouldn't order that specific product again and NPC would be end up discontinuing them (like they did with those stupid overstuffed things).

I'm driving to deliver a pizza to this townhome complex. The streets are very narrow and the houses don't have garages, so they park on the street. I drive a 1998 Nissan Altima, and I'm driving down the street when a white Ford something or other (crossover) appears coming the opposite way. 

Now, this happened at about 8 at night, so it's fracking dark. I'm struggling to see the house numbers, and to try to make it easy on this Ford, I'm driving as close to the other cars as I can. Any closer and I'd be clipping mirrors. I pass her, and I hear a screech of tires, followed by a loud ""hey, asshole!"" I instantly said WTF to myself, pushing in the clutch and turning around at the little circle at the end of the street to try and find the house again. 

I parked and walked up to the house. I realized that the owner was, you guessed it, the bitch in the Ford. Opening my door, I take the pizzas and walk up to the townhome where her and her friend were walking in. They suddenly decided to be all nice (my car was in plain view too, they knew it was me they yelled at), and started trying to find money. Note: this is a pet peeve of mine. If you order a pizza, have your money ready so as not to waste both my time and yours. Well, in the process of looking for said money, the guy friend of the two women breaks out presents for each of them, and I am left standing at the door while they open presents for 5 minutes, then proceed to continue the search for money.

When she finally ended up getting the money and giving it to me, she attempted to make small talk, such as talking about the DNC that is in the general area where I live. It was overall a very puzzling experience, as she tipped me nicely, but screamed obscenities at me.

1359164989.0,20,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,17ajyu,Sometimes ya gotta call it likes ya see it... Cross Post From TalesFromRetail,26,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/17ajyu/sometimes_ya_gotta_call_it_likes_ya_see_it_cross/,"I was the General Manager of a large, sit down pizza chain restaurant for about year. I have stories upon stories, but this one particularly pissed me off.
My store was located in a college town, which was fairly liberal, but we also had our share of people crawling out from under rocks in this hick state to come dine in our fine establishment. One particular day I came in to work, and had an email from our 1-800 complaint line. We had 48 hours to call and resolve the complaints, so I immediately contacted the customer to find out what the issue was.
When the man answered the phone, he sounded like the typical ""good ole boy from down in the holler"", but he was friendly enough. In a nutshell, he and his wife had come in and weren't pleased with the flavor of the ranch dressing. They informed their server, the server replaced the salad but they felt like the server should have taken the salad off the bill as well. Not our usual policy, but whatever, I wasn't going to argue over $6.00. This particular store was a problem store on a lot of different fronts, including false customer complaints. People would try to get free food by complaining about a previous order, even though no previous order existed. So, we had a verification policy. Just verify that they were indeed a customer and I would gladly extend the refund. I explain this to the man, and he understands and agrees. He doesn't have his receipt, but I can look it up by time or by server.
""What time were you here, sir.""
""Between, 4:30 and 7:30.""
""That doesn't help much, do you know who your server was?""
""No.""
""Do you remember if it was a boy or girl?""
""No.""
""Ok, does your wife remember any other details?"" (I'm a little flabbergasted now.)
He mumbles something to his wife across the room, and then...
""It was the big, gay ni**er.""
That's when the record stopped. I am completely stunned, not sure if I heard what I thought I heard.
""Excuse me?""
""You heard me, it was the big, black fa**ot.""
Now, I am sure that their is a perfectly acceptable, way to respond to that type of comment. However, it escaped me at that moment. I was sitting there in silence, and I am sure he thought he had stunned me. He didn't. He pissed me off. Badly.
""Did you hear what I said, boy?"" he asked me. And that's when it happened.
""Yeah, I heard you. And I know exactly who you are talking about.""
""Then what's the problem?""
""The problem is that he's my assistant manager and also my friend, and you're a bigot. This conversation is over.""
""You're not giving me my money back?""
""Hell no! And you are not welcome back in this store.""
""I don't understand the big deal...""
""The big deal is that it's the 21st century. Their is no room for that kind of thinking. We've progressed way beyond that.""
He started to scream something at me, but I just told him to have a nice day and hung up the phone. A few minutes later, he called and asked me for the District Manager's number. I told him I would save him some time and would give him the home offices number instead because the DM wasn't going to want to hear him spew his hate either. ""How do you know?"" He asked. ""Because she's my mother! Where do you think I learned how to behave?"" I replied.
So, I gave him the home office number and he indeed called and told the head of customer complaints exactly what he told me, verbatim! Since I was the store manager, I was carbon copied on all the email transactions. The head of customer complaints was absolutely stunned that this guy talked like that and saw nothing wrong with using derogatory terms toward anybody. He wanted to speak to the Director of Operations for the company, and the DO called him. He also confirmed that this guy kept using the same slurs over and over. After it was all said and done, the customer said he had no intentions of coming back. Which was fine with me.
Then the DO sent me an email stating that he didn't think I should have told him he was not welcome back in the store. This email was carbon copied to everyone... the owner, the customer complaint department, our corporate rep, the DM. Everybody. I responded to everyone with a short, direct email. ""What he did and how he acts is not OK and I refuse to let him believe otherwise."" I never felt better about doing my job.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_17ajyu,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/17ajyu/sometimes_ya_gotta_call_it_likes_ya_see_it_cross/,

It starts to snow just as I arrive to work around dusk. It hardly ever snows in the area and when it does it's usually just a dusting. Not this time. I take my first delivery out and it's a tripple. A minute or so after leaving it REALLY starts to snow. I'm driving a VW Golf, front weel drive, little to no weight, and overall not a good car in the snow. 

About ten minutes on the way to the first house I lose control and slide off the road. Keep in mind I'm only doing about 10 MPH. I'm very slowly sliding towards one of those ""can on a stick"" style mailboxes. I'm going soo slow and with no control whatsoever so I can see what's going to happen. I hit the post just hard enough to push it over and come to a stop a couple feet past it. By this point I am laughing hysterically. I get my shit together and get out of the car to look at the damage. I find the house number on the box and walk up to the door of the house to talk to the homeowner. This middle aged woman answers the door and is PISSED AS FUCK! But not at me. I tell her my name and contact info and that I would gladly pay to replace her mailbox. She was on the phone with her husband having an all out shouting match while her toddler is screaming at her. She blows me off and never bothered to contact me about the mailbox. I plow on like a good little delivery soldier.

My speedometer read somewhere between 0 and 5 MPH but there's no way I was going that slow. That's when I truly understood that the speedometer tells you how fast the wheels are rotating, NOT how fast you are moving.

I ended up getting over $10 TIPs for all 3 of my orders that day. When I got back from that run the manager closed up shop due to the inability of the drivers to get anywhere.

So this all starts some ~20 months ago, when I first started driving. It was my first month of delivering and I get a delivery for a guy we'll name 'John'. It's not too far from the store, he's a little mentally challenged, somewhere in his late 20's, still lives with his mother, in an unkept house. At first I only delivered there once a month, but that steadily increased to about once every 2 weeks. Then I come into work one day and there is a card waiting for me. Apparently 'John' come into the store during lunch to leave me a card. Deliveries increase to about once a week, and John asks me for my name every time, even though I wear a name badge. One day I'm handing 'John' his delivery and he mentions he enjoys drawing. I make the obligatory ""Oh really? That's cool."" He promises to draw something for me for 'next time'. When I come into my next shift, there it is, my drawing from 'John'. It is a drawing of me, even though it doesn't have my name on it, because he can never seem to remember my name. It made for a very awkward conversation on my next delivery to him, ""Yeah, I did get your picture, thanks!""

Around October/November last year I take a fair amount of time off work for exams and such. I come back before Christmas and 'John' now orders twice a week, from what I see on my 3 shifts per week, he may order more often. I'm lucky to avoid delivering there as 'John' orders early in the night when we have 2 drivers on. But a week or two before Christmas I get a delivery to him, and he hands me a small pile of drawings and 2 Christmas cards. One card and 2 drawings are for me (even though he still doesn't remember my name), and one card and 2 drawings for the rest of the people at the store. By this point in time, when he orders the managers make a point of saying ""Hey DeliveryGirl, your best friend just put in an order"" to tease me. I should also note, he still asks me for my name every time I deliver.

Again I take some time off for Christmas and new years, but when I get back I mention we should only have 1 driver on slow days of the week. So the manager makes me the 1 driver, and if my friend 'John' orders, I have no choice but to take it. He seems to be ordering many times a week, or he drops into the store during lunch and leaves notes for me. He starts leaving notes asking if we enjoy his pictures, if we would like more, and he asks for me to write down my name for him. On deliveries I say to him ""Yes, we enjoy your pictures, and my name is DeliveryGirl."" Now I'm swapping deliveries with the other drivers to avoid 'John' which no one complains about because he's near the store. The other drivers come back with notes for me, 'John' now asks for my home address and birth date. This week I delivered to 'John' and he hands me a note asking me to write down my name, birth date, and home address. I tell him I'm not comfortable giving him my personal details but my name is 'DeliveryGirl' and I point to my name badge. He says he wants to send me pictures in the mail, and I tell him if he hands them into the store they are given to me. Is there something my store can do to prevent me from delivering to him any more? He seems like a harmless guy, but I'm starting to get anxious when I see his order.

TL;DR - 'John' is mentally challenged, orders once a month at first, now orders several times a week. He draws pictures for me and regularly leaves notes for the staff to give to me. He asks for my name every time and recently asks for my address and birth date.

At the pizza place I work for, the shop owner loves to take over night shifts to keep labor costs down, and at times to further his own ""fun"". He'll show up to work and then instead of staying to work the front he'll go downtown to ""talk to local late night businesses and market his shop"". Our shop stays open until 3 am on the weekends and one saturday around 2:55 am my experience with the shop took a bizarre turn. Normally we have a rule with the shop that we will take orders until 15 minutes before closing just so that we  can have enough time to close everything down and be out the door. When the owner is there however he will without question take orders until exactly closing time to maximize his profits(whether that means the other employees stay past closing and drive up his labor costs or not(brilliant right)). This saturday in particular was one of those nights. Five minutes before we closed with myself, the driver, and the owner the only persons in the store, a man called asking for a delivery. The owner took it and after about 2 minutes of discussion he looked at me and asked me to take the phone.  The guy on the other line said hello and then asked if he could trust me, I said sure. He then told me that he wanted to order a couple sandwhiches and a calzone but that he was going to leave his apartment for about 20 minutes and would be back, but wanted to have food waiting when he came back so he wanted to know if i could just walk into his unlocked apartment and leave the food on his billiards table. I said I could, I lived a block or so from him and knew that where he was would be pretty safe so regrettably I took the order.  This was allready something I was nervous about, mostly from a security stand point because in a college town you never know what to expect (I've had customers try to pay for their pizza with heroin(or at least what I thought was) before)). So I make the food and drive up the street,the guy on the phone told me that his apartment would be unlocked, that there would be money on the pool table and if I could just leave it there  and take the money things would all be square. I get to the guys apartment, open the door and what do I see but the apparent customer banging his girlfriend on  said pool table.

Answer:

8 deliveries x 8 miles = 64 miles
8 deliveries x $1 = $8

$8 / 64 miles = 12.5 cents per mile

If it costs you more than 12.5 cents per mile to operate your car, then you are being underpaid.

The average price for gas here is $3.47 today. Say your car gets about 19 MPG city. (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.htm)

$3.47 / 19 MPG = 18.2 cents per mile just for gas alone. You are DEFINITELY being under reimbursed for your car expenses (and that is even ignoring your costs for tires, oil, maintenance, depreciation, insurance and licensing.)

1354678422.0,17,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,14awi3,Have I got some stories for you guys...,21,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14awi3/have_i_got_some_stories_for_you_guys/,"I can't believe I just found this subreddit.  I am no longer a pizza delivery guy unfortunately, I miss those carefree days.  I did, however, deliver pizzas for about 10 years all throughout high school and college.

I began working at a ""Pizza Place"" in a small town in the midwest when I was 15 answering phones and folding boxes and being a general bitch boy for the store. It was owned and operated by a family of carnies(no joke)  and was the definition of a mom and pop store. Once I turned 16 I was promoted to delivery driver and never looked back.  There aren't many more perfect jobs when you're in high school than pizza delivery.  You literally get paid to drive around and get stoned and listen to music.

Anyways, like I said I lived in a very small town, village rather, and this pizza place basically served the entire town. We had a Papa John's too but who orders that shit when you can get carnie pizza that is legitimately delicious in a greasy, hear yourself getting fatter kinda way. Can you say hand pinched sausage on a pizza? Fuck yes.  So to say this place had regulars was an understatement.  After about a year or so I could hear an address and picture the house and the person who would answer the door, and usually what they ordered.

There was this guy who would order at least once, usually twice a day. We were open for lunch from 11:00am to 1:30 for delivery and again from 4pm to about midnight.  This guy was in his late 60's most likely. War vet.  I knew this from the pictures in his bedroom (you read that right) and the fact that he told me about how he got hurt every chance he got. He lived in a shitty neighborhood with his 90 year old mom and he was a raging alcoholic. Everyday at lunch he would order a half a sandwich and two tall budweisers for delivery. It started out normally enough, delivering his food without tip.  Sometimes his mom would answer the door. She wore a visible diaper and I have no idea if she could speak any other words besides ""no tip, no tip, no tip""  as I handed her beer and sandwiches. Then the strange shit began.  The dude had obviously sustained some kind of serious injury in his life to his back or legs or both.  Some days he would answer the door, albeit very slowly, in an upright walking position. Sometimes though, he would take about five minutes to get to the door while scooting on his butt from his bedroom to the front door. I would tell him his total, lets say it was $7.95, he would look perplexed and say how he was a quarter short and begin scooting back towards his room.  So of course I'd tell him not to worry about it and be on my way. He got keen to this, and the amount he was short by gradually increased from spare change to a dollar or two each time.  I never really said anything. Once when his mom answered the door, he was sitting in a chair by the door, invited me in, handed his mom the sandwiches, smacked her on the ass and told her to get in there and eat before he ""had his way with her again"" or something like that. 

Gradually his mobility got a lot worse.  It became common knowledge that instead of knocking when he ordered, you just walked in and went down the hall to his room because he was basically in his bed 24/7. Then he had an epiphany of sorts.  He lived in a small ranch style house and his bedroom window was on the front of the house at one end. One summer, when I would deliver his pizzas, usually around noon, in the heat of the day, he would just open his window and have me walk right up to it.  I began to notice that even on days when it hadn't rained in weeks, there would be puddles and mud just underneath his window........and the thick smell of death was usually in the air.  That's right, this mother fucker was pissing and shitting (in god knows what) and dumping it right out his window in the front yard and I was walking through it and standing in it and collecting his poop dollars. And usually losing money on it. 


TL;DR- I basically paid an alcoholic, mother-fucking, Vietnam War Vet to deliver him pizza and beer and stand in his excrement

1352702214.0,20,self.TalesFromThePizzaGuy,131vzp,Not letting non-tippers get to you,28,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/131vzp/not_letting_nontippers_get_to_you/,"Nights where you get lots of non-tippers (like tonight where the roads were very bad) can be frustrating especially because if you let the non-tippers ""get to you"", you get mad and make other mistakes that cause people not to tip, leading you to a money-losing night and maybe even quitting out of anger.

Unusual conditions like tonight's conditions bring out a different crowd, people who don't usually order. Unfortunately it seems like many people who pick up the phone fon Labor Day (for example) or on a night when the roads are practically impassable... *and call my store asking food to be delivered to them* for the first time in months... are the sort of people who don't think about (or don't care) whether the guy bringing them food is making enough money to get by.

You can't let bad streaks get to you or you're not going to last in this job.

A handful of strategies:

**Saving up enough money to weather the bad streaks**: if you're going into work thinking ""I have to have a good night or I won't have enough to pay my rent"" you're gonna have a bad time and your coworkers are gonna hate you for acting like a dick.  You need enough cash reserves to pay a month's living expenses *and* a major car repair at all times.  If you don't have that much, you'd better hustle 'til you do.

**Giving non-tippers the benefit of the doubt (to spare your blood pressure)**: Old people and welfare cases generally don't tip, just an example.  I know some pizza guys get indignant about this... ""if they can't afford to tip, they shouldn't order food delivered!""  Well I make an exception for hard cases like these.  Restaurant food might be a rare treat for these people, yet they find it hard to get out for whatever reason, and they're getting by on a fixed income. Old folks in particular are from a different era, they probably don't understand how important tips are.

Now if said 'hard case' is ordering several times a week, I drop the benefit of the doubt.

**Don't retaliate to their face**: You can't use two personas - friendly server vs. S.O.B. who's not taking guff from bad customers - and not let the latter leak into the former.  It's going to stress you out because there is a non-money aspect to the job, making people happy.  When you make others happy (eg. by delivering fast, hot food) it makes you happy, even if you're not getting tipped.  So you have to be very underhanded in how you retaliate, while (to their face) sympathizing with the customer.

Probably the ""nastiest"" I get, with credit card slips, is offering to give them their credit card receipt, catching their attention, and repeatedly circling a big fat ""ZERO"" on the tip line of the customer copy.  This has gotten some tips from people who meant to tip but honestly forgot to write anything in.

**Anecdotes**

There's one guy who used to order from our store, I called him No-Tip Tommy.  He's one of those hard cases I talked about, who ordered way too often.  He usually ordered a large 'combination' pizza, but sometimes two pizzas.  If I saw his address coming up, I'd steal his pizza and run it over to the local bar, telling the folks inside, ""I've got this order with no name on it, did anyone order (whatever)?  Please say yes so I can go home.""  Someone would take it and I'd get $15-$20 of pure profit.  Meanwhile No-Tip Tommy has to wait an hour to discover his pizza has gone missing and flips out.  The last time this happened to him, he lost his shit over the phone and never ordered again.

Another hard case orders a ton of food at least once a week.  He's morbidly obese and I think he eats it all by himself.  I'll take his order and steal a pizza out of it, giving it to a more appreciative customer (who'll throw in a few extra bucks).  Then when I get there and take his exact change I'll ""discover"" a pizza is missing.  Why, that's an outrage, sir.  I'll have the store make a new one and send it out right away, no charge.  Another delivery fee for me, plus the tip from the re-purposed pizza.

I naturally continued while I was in college because I grew addicted to that constant cash flow and I would be the worst server ever.

One night while delivering for Hungry Howie's, I was on my way back to the shop schmokin a bowl.  As I was winding my way through campus I noticed this girl stumbling through the parking lot of the chemistry labs. As she passed under the light I noticed her shirt was ripped up and her hair was a fucking mess and she was only wearing one flip flop.  I drove on for like two seconds thinking to my stoned self, ""wow. that girl is drunk."", and then I was all like ""HOLY FUCK! DID SHE JUST GET RAPED OR SOME SHIT?"" So I bust a quick U and pull up beside her and ask her if she's alright.  She bends down and gives me the squint and then comes running up to my passenger door jerking on the handle telling me to let her in. I did. She jumps in my car and just starts yelling DRIVE! DRIVE! DRIVE! So I'm thinking the rapist or whatever is around so I drive.  She notices my bowl and asks to hit it. I oblige.  I ask her wtf is going on. She tells me the following story: 

She just busted herself out of the hospital which was about 1 mile away up the bike path which is what I assume is the route she took.  She had apparently gotten super wasted(duh) and fell and hit her head or something in her dorm room. She didn't get along with her roommate, who she was drinking with, and her roommate called the ambulance.  What a terrible friend.  So the cops and the ambulance show up and take her to the hospital because she was underage. They hook her up to an IV and all that jazz and take her purse and get her info. She wakes up unattended, rips the IV out and takes off.

So I drop her off at her dorm and heads back to the shop. On the way back I notice a cop car driving super slow down the bike bath.  He sees me drive by with my car topper gettin it's shine on and pulls me over.  He tells me that a drunk 20 year old girl escaped from the hospital and someone saw her get into a pizza delivery car.  I told him it wasn't me but I'd ask the other drivers at the store and took his number. He told me she's an idiot because they had her purse and cell phone.

Fast forward like a month, I get a delivery to a classroom on campus and call the number on the ticket. A dude comes out and meets me outside the room but asks if I can help him carry them in because there's like two stacks of pizza. I walk in to a room filled with about 200 people. I'm stoned. It was an awkward situation.  Anyways, I have them sign the credit card receipt and I'm on my way.  I make it like 5 steps out the door and I hear a ""HEY!"". I turn around and its old drunkie poo pants. Don't ask me how she even remembered me, let alone that night.  She thanked me profusely. We exchanged numbers and hung out a few times.

&gt;So it's a not so busy night at work. But we're doing pretty steady business. We slow down later, I get a cute little visitor. And everything is normal.  

&gt;Well then this crazy woman, aged about fifty years, short messy blonde hair, green jacket, scarf, red backpack. She orders a pizza, tries to pay with her watch. Jake, my assistant manager running the shift, denies her. She doesn't leave, but yells at her reflection in the window for the next ten minutes.   

&gt;""What is she still doing here?"" I ask.  
&gt;""I don't know dude.""  
&gt;""She's prolly waiting for you to feel sorry for her and give her food.""  
&gt;""Well I'm going to give her some wings to get the fuck out of here.""  
&gt;""It worked!""  
  
&gt;So Jake throws in some wings for her, tells her, she leaves. Ten minutes later, she's not back. So this other girl comes in, asks me if I'll show her how to make a pizza, I said Jake can show her, I'm just a driver. She's cute, Jake's happy. So after Jake shows her, she's drunk and eating her pizza in the lobby. We're outside having a smoke break, and her buddies come in and take her around the corner.   

&gt;""She said she'd go to the bar after I'm off, that ruins that,"" confesses Jake.  
  
&gt;I check around the corner to see if they're nearby, Jake goes inside. I notice a bag and coat sitting out by Jake's car. I'm wondering if those kids left it. Take another look, realize the crazy old bat from the begging of this story is sitting in his back seat talking to herself some more. I lose it, run inside.  

&gt;""Jake!!! Holy shit!! Jake!! That crazy lady is in your backseat!""  
 
&gt;I'm cracking up while Jake runs outside. He sits in his front passenger seat, and talks to her in the back on the same side with his legs hanging out the door. I grab my pizzas for my delivery, already content with this situation, but it only gets better when I walk back out and see her still in there.  

&gt;""You kick her out?"" I ask.  
&gt;""The bitch was fucking touching herself in there!""  
&gt;""NO WAY!"" Many, many more laughs follow as I notice her pulling her pants up.  
&gt;""Her pants were off?!""  
&gt;""Yea dude, she was going at it while I was sitting there.""  
&gt;""Holy shit! That's awesome!""  

&gt;So I take my delivery, call my roommate who tells me his crazy story about some girl puking in the hallway while he was working at the Mall of America. I get back to the store and see the lady still in Jake's backseat.

&gt;""Holy shit Sean! She's still in there! I gotta go!"" I run inside.  
&gt;""Jake she's still in there!""  
""&gt;I know dude, she said to take her home then. I'm just gunna let her fucking sit there til I get off.""  
&gt;""I'll give her a ride home if she gives me a blowjob."" Mentions the other driver.   
&gt;""Nevermind, I'm not that desperate.""  
&gt;""Jake, I think she's still going at it. I saw her grabbing the ceiling and throwing her head back.""  
 
&gt;Jake runs back outside, she's going around the back of the parking lot. I follow out as Jake's coming back.  

&gt;""Dude, the Papa John's truck delivery guy is yelling at her. He's saying she's crazy and to get the fuck outta here,"" he tells me.  
&gt;""She left her bag and jacket here.""   
&gt;""Yea dude, I know.""  
&gt;""I'm so happy! That's awesome! Let's go watch.""  
 
&gt;We go over there, I tell the truck driver the story so far.  

&gt;""She's fucking crazy, I think she pissed herself.""  
&gt;""She's wearing my sweatshirt and hat!"" Jake exclaims.  
 
&gt;So we try to get the sweatshirt and hat back from her.   

&gt;""I gotta keep warm.""   
&gt;""We need the stuff back, you left your coat over by Domino's, come on, we'll go get it.""  
 
&gt;So she follows us back over to our store, telling us she's the nicest person in the world, and asking if we think this is funny. I was thinking, ""Yes,"" but of course didn't say that. Jake just said he wanted his stuff back. So we're back at her stuff, telling her she'll be warm, her coat is there. She starts putting it on over his sweat shirt.  

&gt;""No, you gotta give it back,"" we tell her.  
&gt;""I gotta stay warm.""  
&gt;""You have a jacket!""  
&gt;""I gotta stay warm, leave me alone.""  
&gt;""Just give me my sweatshirt,"" Jake demands, ""and my hat!""  
&gt;""I'll mail it to you.""  
&gt;""I don't fucking know you.""  
&gt;""My name's Trish."" She walks away.  
 
&gt;So we start calling the police, and she starts running. Hops on a bus on the corner by Stub &amp; Herbs, and we keep asking for the stuff back, the bus driver calls a 'squad', in his terms, and she panics and gives the stuff back. We go back to the store, Jake looks in the back of the car, comes inside.  

&gt;""Dude, she pissed in my backseat.""  
 
&gt;After the other driver leaves, he calls the store to tell us she's at Sally's drinking now. And that was pretty much the rest of my night.

Right now I'm in the mid-south(TN), and make enough that I could probably afford to move into a house with a few friends.

Been reading since the beginning.

Anyway, I'm not actually a delivery driver. I work at a Wendys. But I had a question.

Long story short: My (girl)friend-ish (Not really sure how we stand. Whatever, irrelevant) is basically broke right now. She can barely make ends meet, and tonight she is *literally* starving. The only food she had left were a few crackers, until she gets paid again.

I don't mind ordering a pizza for her, but the thing is I KNOW she can't tip the driver. However I was going to pay online for all of it, and it DOES have a section (On Papa John's at least) to add a tip to the credit card.

My question is this:
One: Since the delivery address and name are different from the person ordering and paying, would that be a problem?

Two: Would the driver actually GET the tip? Would it say on their order how much the tip is? I was going to leave probably 4 to 5 bucks on the pizza (About a 8 dollar pizza), and I'd be pretty pissed if the driver didn't actually get it, or if they pressured her for more.

I was working yesterday, and we had a delivery come in to the NE5 section of our map (note: every delivery driver hates it up there). When the pizza comes out, however, my coworker and I find that it's an original crust, not the thin crust that was supposed to be made. We remake the pizza, and by that point there was a double ready for me to take. I grab both pizzas (the remade one is approaching 25 minutes since ordering at this point) and head out the door.


When I got to the first house, I found that it was a very nice older gentleman that always tips well (did not expect this). We had a laugh about the pizza screw up, and then I went on my way to the other delivery. Now, this delivery was only about 20 minutes old. It was a small order ($11), so I didn't expect a huge tip. After knocking on the door, I was greeted by a gentleman in his 40s. He handed me $20, and I ask (like I always do, as per protocol) if he needed any change. Here's the kicker. He laughs loudly and sarcastically right in my face, and then gets super serious before saying, ""just give me my goddamn change."" I was shocked, because I had been nice like I always am.

The quick-service eateries, located mostly in such southern states as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee, serve a variety of pizza styles, as well as such items as buffalo wings and pasta. The pizza parlors are franchised from YUM! Brands, the world's largest fast-food restaurant company. NPC was founded in 1962 by former chairman Gene Bicknell, who was one of the first Pizza Hut franchisees. The company was acquired by private equity group NPC International Holdings in late 2011.

I think this may be related to the fact that most people I deliver to are college aged (I just graduated so I am too). My hypothesis is that having facial hair makes me look older and that being an ""older"" pizza man is less threatening in regards to any perceived hierarchy by the customer. This could make them feel successful tipping me because they have achieved more than me in fewer years. On the other hand if I'm shaven I look very young so it is assumed that I am a fellow student that works while going to school. I feel like this may make some students who don't work feel lazy, or it may be because they don't feel justified in tipping a peer for whatever reason.

There are obviously a ton of variables, so at worst any inferences I make from data that I may collect will only be true to myself - which is why to do it properly I would need more data from a diverse group.

I've been at this since about the beginning of June. So since i'm relatively new i still have trouble with some roads. Especially the ones out on the countryside. Well there is this small little community Just at the edge of the delivery area. I head out there but when i get to the place the house should be, its just not there. The thing is that the road looks like it dead ends into a T. So i'm passing this one house i think like four times before i just stop in front of it and get on my phone. Well it turns out that the road actually continued to the right of the T and the left half was a different road. 

So real quick i wanted to say that the mailboxes are at the edge of the road. So i never really looked into the yards of the houses im in front of. Also i just remembered there were no obvious street signs. 

So once i realize where i need to go i just looked over and there are three kids on the side of the street just staring at me. Me being 20 and no good with kids just kind of waved at them with an awkward smile then turned around and went to find the house. Well i delivered the order and had to pass the house with the kids again to get back to the store. 

I didn't think anything of it but when i turned the corner i see this man in the road waving me down. I'm really confused but stop to see what is up. He comes up to my window and starts like yelling at me. Asking me what i was doing. Why i talked to his kids. Saying i'm lucky he hasn't called the cops. I'm freaking out but calmly tell him i'm from a pizza shop. I showed him my hat and shirt and then thankfully i still had the ticket from the one order in my seat. I explained i was lost and that he can call my manager if he wanted. Then even gave him the phone number.

Luckily he quickly defused and was actually pretty cool with me. I said no worries i understand it was bad on my part. And i told him that i understand he was looking out for his kids. So it ended good but for those few moments i was scared out of my mind. 

Also few things to clear things up. No i do not have a sign on my car. Umm the neighborhood was nice so its not like they had a lot to worry about when it comes to their kids playing. And he did not end up calling the manager.

Last night I get a call about 45 mins before the end of my shift, juuust before the mental cutting off point (half an hour before closing I tend to refuse people outside the free-delivery radius, since I don't want to wind up getting back at stupid'o'clock). The guy, speaks perfectly good english,nice and clear, has *absolutely no idea where he lives*. It takes five minutes or so of hmming and rustling and the general grumpy 'jeez can't you just like, read my mind?' noises until he cautiously  offers up a post-code and the most I can get out of him address wise is ""Turn....turn left, past PJM (the student village) and keep going up the hill, just keep going up and left, I'm...the house with a C on it?""


Already knowing -exactly- how this is going to pan out, I give a shrug and take his order, guy buys two large pizzas and some onion wings. We cook, I....try to deliver.

Initially, I follow the postcode. After a month faffing with a crappy map and my sense of direction I gave up and bought my own satnav, and 9 times out of 10 the postcode alone can get me within a stone's throw of the house.


This time...the postcode leads me into the university, where I -know- no one lives, save for student accomodation (and they're all named, we -pick- where to live so he'd know his house name). I then follow the directions, up past PJM, keep going and bearing/turning left. After driving through pitch black backroads for twenty minutes I wind up in some kind of farm-cum-holiday inn, more or less stood in someone's garden before realising. Still no building with C.


Getting kinda pissed off, it's raining, freezing cold, wales in winter, I forgot my gloves, delivering to god-knows where, I draw theonly logical conclusion, he must have meant the student accomodation! On campus, so presumably with the university postcode, there's a bunch of student flats, typical accomodation, and one 'group' of them have alphabetical names (block A, B, C etc). I don't know -why- he doesn't know the most popular residence name on uni, but that -must- be where he is right? So I bomb back across the countryside to the uni again, hop out of the car and...well...block C has 14 flats in!


So I call. And get no answer. I call again, nothing. Giving up, I ring *every single doorbell* on that place. Four people come down (sunday. People are out drinking), none of em ordered pizza.

Calling again, I make my way back to the car. Still nothing, Call my boss,tell him I'm coming back if I don't get a response (We have that kind of relationship xD I tell him stuff, he nods and keeps making food.) Call again...this time actually disconnected by him mid-ring. So fuck him, I drive back.


In total? an hour and 20 minutes driving around a town that can be crossed fully in 2, trying to find this guy, and five call attempts, one of which is physically disconnected.


In the five minutes it takes me to drive back to base and get into the dry and warmth, my phone has been rung *six* times by this guy, and *as* I walk into the room he calls the pizza-place again with a really whiny, needy tone asking where his pizza is. Completely ignores my questions of why he didn't answer his phone and gave the uni postcode, and keeps asking to speak to the driver (I always refer to myself in third person on the phone and 'the guy back at the shop' when I'm at their door, easier to manage bitchy customers). By this point  it's coming up to 45 minutes past when I -should- have clocked off and we stopped delivering food, and I've -more- than lost my patience, so I tell the guy the driver tried to call him repeatedly, followed his instructions, the postcode, and common sense and couldn't find him -anywhere-, the driver came back,dropped off the pizza and left; while pointing out he hasn't actually paid for anything yet. He tries to complain he's ordered food though, and starts going through the motions of trying to order -again- ""Buh-buh-but...I...can I get a large..."" I interupt him with the sweetest voice you could imagine ""Sorry sir, be we aren't delivering anymore, goodnight."" and hang up.


My manager shrugs and lets me take the food home, which is sorta a bonus, don't really like our pizza, but food is food. The phone operates on loudspeaker so managers can hear -everything- and he knew I'd done everything as best I could, can't delivery without an actual address.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_14zkww,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/14zkww/where_the_fuck_do_you_even_live/,

A lot of the regular customers give decent tips $3-$5 which is cool. But a lot of the tourists or some other locals will give the worst tips. A couple of examples:

We deliver to a couple very high end resorts, and I'll go in for a $35 delivery and they'll give me $1 and the coins.

Deliver to a house on a $51 delivery, give you $100 bill and ask for $49 back.

This I hate the most: We have a contract with some stupid ass company in another state that has a contract with a couple hotels, the customers call an 800 #, and the company connects them to us. On the menu in the hotel, it says there's a $3.50 ""packaging fee"" that the company they call takes. (Some of the hotels are far enough away that I would get it, but we don't double it if it is, so I don't get it.) Then when I deliver it they give me exact change and close the door.

I also don't mean when it's some babysitter or someone paying in change cause it's all they have. Which I can understand. My coworker says he'll just stare at them blankly til they close the door, or if he's really upset call them back when he get's back and ask if something is wrong with the pizza since they didn't tip. It's a local restaurant, and he's been there ten years so he's safe. But I don't wanna piss off the customers and lose my job over saying something. What do you guys do when you get stiffed?

I wanted to share a couple quick things that have happened recently with you guys:*

This past Thursday I was holding down the fort until the night crew came in, which was around 4:30. We do pretty big orders with this local Christian camp called Round Lake, they usual order anywhere from 50-120 pizzas every weekend. Well, Thursday Round Lake must've been having a meeting of some sort because they ordered 6 pizzas. This isn't really too big of a deal, it takes ten minutes to make them and you can have them all through the oven in probably 15 or 20. The problem was that they wanted their pizzas around 10:00 PM, and we were only open until 9. That meant someone would have to stay over a full hour after we close to make and deliver these pizzas. I talked to my manager and told them the situation and she asked me to call them back and see if delivery at 9:30 would be a problem, which it wasn't. 

Well, the night crew came in around 4:30 and (there are two people working nights during the week, Thursday ""E"" and ""M"" work) M got upset because of this order. Apparently management never called to check and make sure he would be able to deliver the pizzas. M said that he had plans for after work and now this was going to interfere with them, he was going to have to cancel all these plans. I could see both sides to the situation, but it wasn't my problem so I just said sorry and left.

Sunday rolls around and I am holding down the fort with another worker until the evening crew comes in, E and M again. M comes walking in and finds out that he has two deliveries (a total of 88 pizzas) to this campground again, one at 7:15 and one at 9-something. M was pretty upset, apparently on that Thursday delivery his car broke down and he was out until midnight. Every since Thursday he has been having car trouble, management knows this and doesn't care. They could easily call someone else in to drive, but they are throwing these deliveries on M. 

I am working with M tonight, and once again he is driving. We'll see how tonight goes.",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_1ic9rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1ic9rz/management_sucks/,

After navigating through some allies and going the wrong way down the closed one way I arrived at my destination. I walk up and knock on the door but the door was wide open, lights were on, and the TV going. I noticed a foot propped up and bandaged. I was told to come in and since I saw the bandaged foot I assumed its owner wasn't very mobile. I sat the food down next to an old woman who told me she had broken her ankle. I took the money and left. I was probably in the house for less than a minute. I leave and drive back to the store.

This is were the story gets bad. After a few blocks I felt something weird on my legs. Since I was in a bit of a hurry I didn't think much of it at first but the odd sensation persisted. Becoming increasing anxious about what was going on I stopped at a stop sign and clicked on the dome light to see what was going on and lo and behold my legs have scores of fleas clinging to my socks and leg hair! The god damn things were all over! I couldn't fucking believe it. That woman's house had to be infested with fleas for me to end up with so many of them on my person in so little a time.

Most dudes stuck to the ""brooooooo"" card, with several of them calling me a dude. Hahaha. S'all good. This run was not one of those times. 

Some backstory:

So, I am usually in house, managing, but one of our drivers' licenses got suspended, so I gladly switched with him to drive a Saturday night because boy howdy I love money.

Anyway, so, I had a number of stupid shenanigans occur, like taking the farthest five runs back to back. I figured, give the good dels to the guys who do it every day. I can take the shitty ones. No biggie. I just felt like getting out of the store.

Well, I finally took a phone order for a guy who was maybe fifteen blocks away. Sweet! And, I was the next driver up. Sweeter! He was *way* too familiar with me on the phone, but, whatever. Food service amirite ladies blah.

So I decided I'd make this guy's food because I am pretty dang fast. 

Mind you, I get flirted with on the phone decently often. Dudes not expecting a lady + booze = painfully awkward douche whimpers. Whatever. Doesn't matter much.

Except I forgot I was delivering it. Blergh.

I make him his food and get it to him from point of order to it being in his hands in fifteen minutes. Yessss. Expecting a decent tip.

Three dudes answer to door. And the one looks me up and down and says, his friends chattering behind him, ""You sounded hotter on the phone.""

Guy is missing a tooth.

I steeled my gaze and told him the total, gave him his pizza, and walked off, looking none too impressed.

&gt;So I'm driving back from a delivery, when I pass a car flipped on it's side and people swarming outside of it. I pull over, call 911, they ask if they need an ambulance. I get out of my car, ask if everyone is okay, the woman driving is out of the car and okay. 

&gt;Well as we sit there waiting for the trooper and tow, I offer the woman a warm spot in the car being all Minnesotan and everything. She asks if I have any gum, and I ask, ""Well have you been drinking tonight?"" She confirms that she has, and everyone else had left the scene. I recall advice given to me by Domino's employees, if you're ever in an accident and have drank anything, get out of there if you can. You'll be towed and impounded, but you avoid legal troubles of driving under the influence. So I offer her a ride to her boyfriend. She accepts. Boyfriend super pissed off at her and telling her she deserves a DUI, and I'm thinking, ""does she?"" 

&gt;Well I drop her off and her boyfriend thanks me. Then I call my girlfriend, she says, ""She deserves a DUI."" I'm starting to agree, why did I get her out of there? I'm happy no one was hurt, but someone could have been, badly. Even I could've been caught up in that accident somehow, so maybe I should've just gave her the spot to sit and await her fate. I think her boyfriend was taking her back there anyway, so maybe justice all worked itself out. But I guess I aided and embedded a drunk driver, which might've been pretty retarded. She seemed sober, completely, so maybe it was nothing. She just might've had some drinks earlier and sobered up. But still, was it right or wrong? Bleh, beats me, can't change it now.

I've been driving deliveries for almost seven years now, but this story takes place in the beginning of my delivery career.

I was a nineteen y/o female that had been working as the night manager for a sub shop in the heart of a big ten school campus. There are many things that can happen in this situation, especially when the store is close to the sports venues...not to mention bars and it's open for an hour after bars close (but that's another story). 

So when we were short on drivers and I had acquired a car I said, ""Hell yes, I'll deliver and make more money with less responsibility!"" (Because that's how it works at our sub franchise). 

My second shift as a driver was a Saturday day shift, which is usually pretty slow. A delivery comes in from the hotel down the street--this is normal as the staff often orders because weekends are too busy they can't get out. Seeing no room number or last name (*note--many people are never trained on how to take a delivery order at our store) I assume it's staff but they have no idea. The number is the general hotel number so I go back to the store and tell the three people to get a last name, room number, and/or real telephone number when he calls back. (The bosses were too cheap to pay for caller ID)

Fast forward two hours when a competent employee shows up and gets the man's room number. Relieved, I run over with his freshly made meal just preparing to be bitched at. I knock on the door after I have prepared my apologies only to discover not an angry man...but a very naked one that smelled like he just took a bath of whiskey. He also an old man...in his late 50's if I'm being generous.

He swings open the door and I'm shocked...so I continue with my original plan to apologize about the lateness of the delivery. He asks how much he owes as this image is being burned into my poor memory. I say ""it's on the house"" as I realize he's slowly counting ones and I just want to get out. 

Perhaps he realized I was panicking, and then quickly handed over a large bill that included a 40% tip. I still made a huge point to my co-workers the importance of getting correct information. Two hours is a long time to wait for a sub...it is also enough time to get creepy drunk or assume the person at the door is ""paid companion"" and not the food delivery girl. (It was around 4 pm when I showed up). 


There are so many stories as a delivery driver, but for the females out there--have you experienced something similar?

I used to deliver in the uk, and it was a rare and pleasant surprise when I got even 50pence tip.

Similarly as a customer, I near enough never tip. I'm a student, and rarely order takeaway anyway, but to my knowledge no one else really tips either, occassionally I'll just round up to a pound, and once I tipped about £3 quid, but that was purely because I had 15 20p's to get rid of.

So, you all know that there are three types of pizza guys: delivery drivers, managers, and insiders. This rant is about the latter.

We have two insiders at our derpy little pizza place, and for anonymity's sake, we shall call them Brandon and Joe. Brandon is a nice guy, if not a touch nosy. He's a bigger guy with Asperger's, but he does his job well, answers the phone promptly, etc. My one gripe with him: he eats all the time. If there's anything that didn't make the cut (no pun intended), he'll be on it like white on rice. Occasionally, this will lead to him being preoccupied and missing a phone call or something. No big deal. 

My REAL gripe is with Joe. You may have wondered why I mentioned the fact that Brandon has Asperger's. Well, it's because it seems like Joe does too, except...worse. He has no goddamn mouth filter. He'll be rambling about something (what he saw on Ellen last night or whatever, no joke) and completely forget to answer the phone. Furthermore, he's threatened each of us at least once. Now, take note that he doesn't have the grunt to back it up, but he still does it, even if it's half in jest.

For example: I have my keys on a carabiner. I was standing by the oven while he was folding boxes, spinning my keys on my finger. They slipped off and landed by his feet. He turns around and says, ""speaknott, if that had hit me, I would have smashed all these boxes over your head."" Like, what the fuck?! And he's always talking about how much faster he could drive than the rest of us.

I have too many stories to count and finally made an account the second I saw this subreddit. Here is one of my favorites...

   We had a fairly regular customer that would order from our shop quite a bit. Typical ghetto female, always complaining, trying to get free stuff, never tipping etc. One day she calls up and as I am confirming her address as I do for every customer she informs me that she moved. No big deal, I ask her for her new address. Turns out she has moved just outside of our delivery area.

  ""I'm sorry ma'am but you are now outside of our delivery area. I do know the store that delivers to your new address, would you like their phone number?""

 She instantly turns on that ghetto attitude and is already yelling at me.

 ""No I called the right store! You guys always deliver to me! I have been ordering from you for years!""

  ""I understand that ma'am, but your new address falls under a different stores delivery zone. If you go ahead and call them they will be more than happy to deliver you your order.""

  ""I called **your** store and I want **your store** to deliver to me!""

  At this point I was fed up with this customer, as I had to deal with her crap all the time in the past. I just wanted to end it.

  ""I'm sorry ma'am but there is nothing I can do. You moved out of our delivery area and we cannot deliver to your new residence. Our will not be delivering your pizza today. Call (other pizza shop) and they will deliver to you. Now is there anything else I can do for you today?""

   Click. I breathed a sigh of relief because I thought we were finally done dealing with this pain in the butt customer. *sigh* However all is never how it seems.

   Come the next day I get a call from my District Manager.

   ""Alphamale063 did you refuse to deliver to superghettofemale yesterday?""

   ""No sir I did not refuse to deliver to her, she moved out of our delivery area and so we could no longer go to her. I tried to give her the store's number that does deliver to her, but she wouldn't accept the fact that we would no longer deliver.""

   Cue District Manager explaining to me the importance of long standing customer and how my lack of customer service lost us the possibility of lots of future sales. Told me we should always go above and beyond for my customers. (Same DM has written me up for approving deliveries outside the delivery area in the past). At the end of my lecture he told me call up said customer, and deliver whatever she wanted for free. To make things better, he also wanted me to **refund** her for the order. That she never placed. I begrudgingly phoned her up and told her what we would do to ""make it right."" Obviously she took advantage of the situation and (in a very smug tone of voice) ordered a 50+ dollar order which my store paid her to place. It was an awesome day.

I've been working at a local pizza restaurant for over a year now and usually receive 3 dollars per delivery + the tip I get. We don't have a delivery fee so this comes out of the owners pocket. That being said, I don't make a lot of money because my shift is only 5 hours and I usually average about 10-14 deliveries in this time (we're not incredibly busy).

Now, the other driver who works full time is taking a vacation so I'm filling his shoes for our busiest days and working full time until he gets back (about 2 months). I am paid 7 dollars per hour and get to keep the tips as well; I work 11 or 12 hour shifts depending on the day, from opening til close.

Here's the thing:

-The work load has increased a lot. Even though the owner ""helps"" me when we're busy, I would say he takes at most 5 deliveries. 

-There have been plenty of times where I leave with 3 deliveries and there's 2 more orders that were placed 10 minutes ago, come back, and the orders are now 40 minutes, and he's been there the entire time just chilling in front of his computer. This results in me being late (we tell them 45 minutes), not getting tipped, and probably losing the customer.

-On saturday I took 28 deliveries and would have made the exact same amount if I was getting paid 3 dollars per delivery.

-Yesterday I took 23 deliveries and given my 11 hour shift, I only made 8 dollars more than I would have.

-I'm working a lot of overtime and not being accommodated for that. That being said, the money I receive is all cash and under the table, so that is definitely a perk.

TLDR: I went from making 3 dollars per delivery to 7 dollars an hour working 11-12 hour shifts and not making much more than I would have with the previous wages.

Wasn't retail, but pizza delivery. Same kind of punishment.

There were 2 deliveries that might've resulted in your stereotypical ""porn intro"" scenario. I was an awkward kid and didn't catch on to what was going on.

No Sex 1: I was making a delivery on a hot summer day, a Friday. It was a simple delivery and I loaded up this order with extra sides because it was a slow day and I wanted more tips. When I rang the bell, a girl wearing a bikini with no top opened the door. Her friend was also wearing a bikini, both very attractive. Being an awkward kid, I shied away while they were(in hindsight) trying to get me to come inside and fool around with them. I pathetically took their money while they gave me that ""are you fucking serious"" look. I drove back and told my coworkers what happened and I received all of their ""are you fucking serious"" looks.

I may have missed out on a teenage boy's fantasy.

No Sex 2: Another delivery, open the door to see 2 attractive girls clearly high. They were very flirtatious and clearly partying despite being in the middle of the day. They specifically asked me to come inside and ""spend some time with them."" My response was that I was due back at the restaurant to take more deliveries. I heard about them from some friends and it was so blatant I could've had an amazing time with them, but again I was an awkward kid.

I'm married now and love my wife, wouldn't give her up for the world. I still wonder why I was so oblivious though when I was a kid. I still wonder if I should've jumped into those ""dream"" scenarios.

I paid my way through college delivering in Amherst, MA for Domino's. I attended UMass, the largest campus in our delivery area which also included Amherst College and Hampshire college. Having a reputation as a party town, Amherst draws in a lot of spoiled people and it shows. Despite mostly stingy customers and aside from the ebs and flows it was great money. 

It was really interesting observing all these people, mostly students, and their interactions but it was disappointing to find that they were almost universally cunts. I've always been respectful, I treat people how I want to be treated but there's no other word to describe them. There's no avoiding the ugliness and it came from all angles - customers, pedestrians, drunks, drivers, drunk drivers, and even sometimes coworkers.

I've come to take a different view on humanity than I had before this job, it's certainly had an influence but I'm sure I've also grown as a person and learned more of the world too. Still, seeing the amount of blind hate and abuse slung by these kids at each other, myself, and my fellow drivers I've realized that we take our civilized nature for granted. There will always be miserable people that try to pass it on and there will always be narrow minds. The way they express their angst just depends on where you are in the world. Be you terrorist, spoiled princess or orange bro from New Jersey - we are all capable of feeling and expressing the same malice. The key is to realize it and catch yourself. Sorry for the tangent.

There are plenty of things I liked about the job. I got to rock out, sing, and have plenty of alone time in general as I drove. Most of my coworkers were good people and they kept my insanity from growing worse. I was even propositioned for sex a couple times and flirted with plenty. No sexy stories aside from a girl sneaking a kiss in on me after I gave her a ride home, unfortunately I'm completely aloof. More so a minute delay than aloof - but that's long enough to turn a good deal sour.

I worked for four years on and off. I did overnight shifts 12 to 5 as a student, and full time 12 hour+ shifts up until I quit recently. The most deliveries I've had on one run was 13. The most in one shift, 62. Longest shift, 16 hours, St. Patties day. This is the 4th time that I've left Domino's.

Didn't really mind since I was taking a double and it would be to fairly nice neighborhoods. 

As my manager was bagging up my orders, I was double checking everything to make sure it went smoothly as possible. After he was done, I told him that the  drinks he bagged up should be order 276, not 273. Also told him there needs to be two canned orange sodas for 273. Pulls out two Sprites, and I'm confused and keep telling him orange soda. After about the 3rd time, he finally gets. Double check all the salads and drinks and I'm off to my first house. 

I organized everything in my car so I had one order on side of the car and the other order on the other side of the car(as to not mix up the two deliveries). Drop off the food and drinks at the first house and make my way to the second house. As I pull up to the gate guard for the neighborhood I'm delivering to, I get call from my work. I pick up and the connection is shitty and my manager tells me that I gave the customer the wrong food and go deliever that food(again). Then come back to the store for the remake food. I'm honestly confused because, I thought, I knew what I delivered. Make a U-turn and pull over to check the bag with the 276 ticket. I open it and see the pizzas for 273.  Great.

Make way back to the other house. Apologize for the mistake and they ask for the correct salad. Again, confused. I told them I already handed them their salad(the salad I handed them said 273). I go back to the car, bring them the salad that says 276, and guess what, that's their salad. So even if I somehow didn't fuck up on the pizzas, I would have to double back to both houses to deliver the correct salads.

So on Saturday I worked a double at a family owned store. . 11:30 to 3 as a cashier and 4:30 to 8 as a driver. I'm a little tired and didn't sleep but nothing I can't manage. By 7:30, I'm ready to crash but no worries, suck it up for the next half hour.  7:48 hits and I'm the next driver up but there's another driver who doesn't get off until 9:30. A cashier who has been there forever, but was his last day, tells the 9:30 driver he can go home. I bring it up with the cashier but he didn't see that I had worked as a cashier, otherwise he would have sent me home. Ok..........whatever, shouldn't be a problem. One last delivery won't matter. Make an extra buck. Hopefully I can go home after and hope they can manage with two drivers(wasn't really busy with deliveries). Get back, manager wants me to take one last delivery, look at where it is and it's really far away. 

Real quick, some details:

I've delivered to this guy before. He's 8(""5 mile radius"") miles out and when I delivered to him, he didn't tip me(and other drivers as well). I understand getting stiffed happens but when it's really far out, a tip would be nice. This family owned store also owns quite a few other stores and they have a store that's a lot closer to him than us. 4.5 miles to be exact. Basically, the other store tells the customer to call our store if they live on X road. Why they do this, I don't know. Technically, the owners have it as to where we deliver out there and the other store doesn't, even though inefficient as it is.  The owners said ""Quit then"" when the drivers and managers brought it up.

Back to the story:

I let my manager know this guy doesn't tip and he sees that I'm a little flustered. He tells me to tell him(my manager) how much I get tipped. I'm heading out with his one $20.11 pepperoni pizza. Don't need the GPS on how to get this guy's apartment. I get there and his light isn't on. I knock, turns his light on, and he answers the door.

Usual greeting, know what's coming, ""So, that's going to be $20.11"". Hands me a $20 bill and I hear him going for the change. Gives me $1 in dimes and nickles(and the rest is tip...thanks..). Still fine. Not going to lose control. Before he closes the door, I very calmly and nicely say to him ""Hey, just to let you know, our ____ store is a lot closer than our store. If you want to get it faster, you should just call them(or something along those lines). It's about 8 miles out here and 4.5 from our ___ store"". When I first said ""___ store"", he starts shaking his head at me the entire time I'm talking.  He says ""You know, you guys say __ store is closer, they say you are closer"". Repeat distance to him.  Doesn't really listen to me. Say good-bye, and leave in a fury(after he closes door).

Oh, you thought the story ended there? Nope. I get back and my manager looks at me. Not mad though. Tell him I got tipped $1 in dimes in nickles and explained that to the customer how he should order from __ store next time. My manager tells me ""I know. He called the store"".  I'm speechless. I asked what about and he told me the customer said ""Why do all your drivers tell me to order from the other store?(Because you're an asshole who doesn't tip)"". My manager explained the distance but how we still have to accept deliveries from where he was. My manager ends it by telling me that he(the customer) ""loves our store"".

I clock out and just ponder the ""loves our store"". I've worked at this pizza place for a while and he's never been in the store. All the delivery guys at my store hate him and the food is literally the same food from the other store. All that is different are the delivery drivers. 

Sorry, that this is so long and I may seem entitled. Just needed to rant and had a bad night.  I know it's not his fault that our ""radius"" is the way it is, and more in fact the owners for not budging to change it. Still, I hate the fact this guy can't understand the distance between the stores(The other store would accept his delivery if he insisted) and tip, if at all, really shitty for driving all the way out there. I hate putting people down on where they live but where he was, he could afford a few dollars for tip. Hope you had a better night than I did.

However, last week, they were still needing drivers, and having been on otherwise good terms with the management and staff over there, they rehired me and my first night back was last night.

What are the ""rules"" for delivery? Are they universal? Is one rule better than another different way? What are the 'rules' at your store?

To me, the rules are:

1: Rotation is sacred. (You don't jump or skip rotation with out permission of those ahead of you.)

2. The oldest COMPLETE order goes first. (We always try to take the 'top (oldest) order on the screen but if it is waiting on a remake (usually at least a 6 minute delay) then you take the next order. If they arent just coming out of the oven out of order, we usually will wait a minute or two for that.)

3. If a driver forgets and item for a delivery, THEY (and they only!) will have to take the forgotten item back. Drivers shall not be punished for other drivers mistakes. For clarity, this only applies to items listed on the ticket, if the customer says something was 'forgotten' (they forgot to ask for it or the phone person forgot to enter the item) then that item is put on a new ticket and is delivered IAW rotation.

4. Nothing gets you out of rotation except being taken ""off the road"". (this prevents drives from skipping known stiffs by getting 'busy' doing something else in the store such as taking a phone order, making pies, being told to go prep something, or supposedly taking a crap. Unless the manager on duty (MOD) says you are ""off the road"", then we will skip you and leave 'your' order on the rack for you to deliver. 8-)

5. Drivers never 'cross' the store. When deciding which orders go together to make a double or more, never combine orders that will make you pass the store again to make another delivery. In other words, never take a run going north with one going south, or a east and a west. A run VERY CLOSE to the store might be an exception to this, but don't get greedy!

OK. So what did I forget, and what do you all do differently?

However, you guys (and gals) are awesome, and I am hoping you might be willing to share your wisdom with me.

Here's my dilemma: In most contexts, I think that tipping as a percent of the bill make a lot of sense.  Serving three people takes more effort than just serving one and should be rewarded accordingly.  However, I always feel weird about tipping delivery people.  No matter how much I order, they still have to bring it all of the way to my apartment.  I have my online accounts set to automatically tip 20%, but it feels inappropriate when my order is small.  I just ordered dinner for myself tonight, but that wasn't the delivery guy's fault or choice.  I ended up calculating 20% and rounding up, but I still felt guilty giving a tip that was so small in absolute value.

*In an ideal world, how do you think this should be handled?*  Should there be a minimum tip for small orders (i.e. tip 20% but no less than $X).  If so, what is a reasonable minimum tip?  Of course, I assume that this would vary depending on the distance driven, weather etc... Basically, I would love some guidance on how to tip fairly for the driver's effort.

Do you UK drivers expect to be tipped? Are you annoyed if we don't? Will it impact my service in future?

If I ever pay by cash, which is rarely, because, like screw keeping money laying around, I'll usually round it up to save the dude some hassle.

Our stores blew up, that was the day I found out that the order times on the screen only go up to 99. We were understaffed and underprepared, and by about 6pm most of the PJs in the area had shut down because we all ran out of sauce and dough. We sold thin crust only until we ran out of that, too.

I heard that this existed today.  I'll start posting these as a series.  I hope you enjoy them.  This is just the general anger I used to feel.  I've got a couple of crazy stories coming after this.  

&gt;This has been on my back burner for a long time. But I have a bone to pick with the many people that order pizza from the Domino's at the U of M. From now on, any ""you"" I use will use refers to kids who live in the dorms, football players, leaders of student organizations, black people, asian people, and drunken douche bags that don't know how to order a pizza.

&gt;Let's start with the inciting incident for this late night rant. A man calls us up 20 minutes before close. I take his order........

&gt;-Thanks for choosing Domino's, this is antonehenry. Is this for carryout or delivery?  
-Hi, I would like a large pizza with pepperoni.  
-For carryout or delivery?  
-Delivery.  
-Okay, what's your address?  
-Pioneer Hall.  
-Alright, your address is 615 Fulton Street Southeast.  
-Oh  
-And is your phone number 555-555-5555?  
-Yea.  
-So you would like a large pepperoni, correct?  
-Um. Hold on. (chatter with friends for a full minute) Uh, yea.  
-Alright, would you like any cinnastix or coke with your meal?  
-Hold on. (give it another 30 seconds or so) No dude, we're cool.  
-Alright your total is $15.56, are you paying with cash or credit?  
-Whoa! Why is it so much? Isn't it like $4.99?  
-If you have a coupon.  
-We have the daily card or whatever.  
-Okay, well a large is $6.99 for a one topping.  
-Dude, we got it for five bucks last time.  
-A medium one topping is $4.99 after 10.  
-Oh. One second (faster this time) We'll get a medium.   
-Okay, pepperoni?  
-Yea, well... Yea, that's cool  
-Okay, total is $9.12, will you be paying with cash or credit?  
-What? Why? I thought it's six bucks?  
-Sorry, we have a $1.50 delivery charge and add tax. The delivery charge is not a tip for the driver.  
-That's fucking gay.  
-Yea, it's not in anyone's best interest at the store. I believe they use it for insurance costs.  
-Hold on. (bitching about price in background) Okay.  
-Are you paying with cash or credit?  
-Credit  
-Your card number please?  
-Hold on. Okay, it's a Visa.  
-The card number please?  
-(Gives number)  
-Alright, we should be calling you in twenty minutes. Make sure you are by the phone.  
-Cool.  
-Have a good night.  

&gt;Lucky me, this turns out to be my delivery. So I call the guy. He doesn't answer the phone. I call about four times. Still doesn't answer. Gets to be 1am, we are officially closed. And since this is a common event, and we want to go home, I proclaim, ""If he calls for his pizza, tough shit. We're closed."" So of course, the other driver cashes in on the extra pizza, takes on bite, and the phone rings. It's 10 minutes after close. The other driver gets it and tells him his order was canceled. Sorry, but answer the phone next time. Guy calls back 2 minutes later and I answer.

&gt;-Thanks for choosing Domino's, I'm sorry but we're closed.  
-I know, I just called.   
-Oh yes, I'm sorry but your order had to be canceled.  
-Yea, but I sat by the phone the whole time. No one called me.  
-Your delivery was supposed to be mine, I called about four or five times.   
-My phone didn't ring. I was in the lobby, no one came.  
-We can't get into the dorms without getting a hold of you first, I told you I would call. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened with your phone.  
-Well dude, no one called me.  
-I promise you I did. I'm sorry. It's not in anyone's benefit to not be able to make a delivery. We don't get paid and our customer isn't happy.  
-Okay. Are you going to charge my card still?  
-Nope.  
-How do I know that?  
-Your card was charged, but we void the payment on all canceled orders.  
-Okay. (very distraught at this point)  
-Again, I apologize.  
-Yea. (hangs up)  

&gt;Now, I understand you may sympathize with this man. And that's just fine. It's kind of a bummer that he's retarded and not be responsible enough to answer a god damn phone when he orders a pizza. So let's just start going off in general now. You call us. You order your pizza as if you are completely unfamiliar with the process what-so-ever. You have no idea what you want when you make the call. Even when you have a god damn coupon, you can't decide what toppings you want on your one topping pizza before you call and then you have to take three minutes to decide on pepperoni. You don't speak audible enough for me to hear you. You jump in and start rambling about what you want and when and where after I ask for your fucking phone number. You answer the question ""what's your card number"" with ""it's a visa"" every single god damn shitting time. Learn to fucking listen. And this is just my gripes about taking an order on the phone. When I call you, about 60% of the time you answer on the first call. You say, ""oh i'm sorry, i don't answer numbers i don't know,"" but you just order a pizza 20 minutes ago. I tell you I will be there in three minutes, and ask you very politely to meet me at the front door. You take seven and then give me a three cent tip after I delivered your pizza in seventeen fucking minutes and you got it for 6.97 when normally it would be 14 bucks. You just saved 7 dollars and the most you can ever afford to give me is two bucks. Fuck you. Seriously, fuuuuuuuck you. Tonight you order 24 pizzas that were delivered at 9:30 on the dot, just like you wanted. Your order total is 128, when at full price it would be 250 at least. You give me 10 bucks. Less than 10% on your discounted price. You order 35 pizzas on Friday. I was there right on time again, you give me less than 5%. Fuck you again. And I really don't get why because you play football it means you have every single fucking right to take up to 10 minutes to get your athletic ass down to the door to get your order of wings and cinnastix. You request that your wings be well done, and to put light cinnamon on your cinnastix, but you can't muster up more than rounding up to the next dollar on your half priced munchie snack. Again, fuck you.

&gt;Now, don't get me wrong. There are lots of great customers out there. And consistent average tippers. I welcome and love these people. I make decent money for an easy job. It's just how clueless and blatantly insensitive some of you mother fuckers are that will lead to me putting you into a coma with a baseball bat one of these days. Just in case you wanted to educate yourself, here's a breakdown of how you can tip me and feel good about yourself without being an ignorant cunt.

&gt;-1-2 pizzas at menu price. 2 bucks is average, 3 bucks is good, 4 bucks is great, 5 bucks is amazing.  
-1-2 pizzas at half price. Throw in an extra buck, you just got an awesome deal.  
-3-4 pizzas, throw in an extra buck.  
-5-6. extra buck.  
-Orders of 40-50 bucks. Shoot for 15%, 10% will be okay, 5% is a royal ""fuck you"" to the driver.  
-100+ bucks. Please for the love of satan, at least 10%
-Anything higher than that, don't insult the drivers. We work hard to bring your 100 pizzas up to the door, after making, baking, and cutting them all. Show some fucking respect. We respected you enough to get them to your doorstep on time.  

&gt;Oh, you don't have enough money to give a good tip? THEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO ORDER PIZZA. Go buy a frozen one, it's just as good as Domino's. Or spend it on groceries so your family or your poor ass can spend your money just a little bit more wisely. That is never a good excuse not to tip. Never. Go pick it up, or go to the grocery store. 

&gt;Line of the year by far though. This family has ALWAYS tipped a dollar. My co-worker, Anon, has delivered to them for at least 5 years. The wife gives him a dollar recently, as per usual, ""I'd tip you better, but, you know, the economy."" 

Well there's a look into my 24 year old mind toward the end of seven years of delivering pizzas.  I hope you enjoy the read.

I've delivered to this guy a few times before, generally really nice guy, and we would usually deliver his food and a 6-pack of beer (I always figured delivering booze was illegal, especially being &lt; 21 at the time...). Anyways, I think this guy has cerebral palsy or something, generally asks us to fill out his check for him to pay us as his hands were curled up pretty badly. So this one night he asks me to come in and help him with his check, put the booze in the fridge, etc. As I'm filling out the check for him, he asks me, ""Do you know how to roll a joint, bro? I had this sweet joint-roller but my friends snagged it last time they left and I'm shit outta luck."" Naturally, being an 18 year old pizza delivery driver, I was very familiar with marijuana, but not rolling joints. This poor guy, he asks me to roll him 2 joints and hands me his weed and some papers. I rolled the 2 ugliest joints of my life. Ever. Like HUGE chunks of tree in there rather than broken up nicely. I realized what I was doing, but didn't have the heart to tell the guy no, leaving him to suffer. After I finish rolling, he says, ""Thanks a lot man, keep one for yourself, have a great night!"" I felt awful. I tried to refuse as he led me out the front door but to no avail, ""No, no, no, keep it!"" he says... Today, I can roll some killer joints.  I have this thought that will pop into my head from time to time about how this skill is going to come in handy some day. I still feel terrible about the crap joints I rolled this guy. After that, never saw this guy again, our pizza shop had a change in ownership and closed down within a month. Side note: got back to the shop feeling terrible, told my coworker, and offered the joint to him as I didn't feel like I had really earned it. Coworker starts to tear(cry)-up as only a fellow stoner could, telling me he was driving 3 hours that night to go see his girlfriend and had nothing for the ride.
  TL;DR - Learn to roll joints before you deliver pizzas.

I got there this morning at 8 and found out that we not only would be massively under staffed (6 instead of 12), but that last night the close shift had done effectively nothing to prep for the next day. There were piles of dishes to be done, the prep board was empty, no dough made. The buffet opens at 11. In short, were fucked. To make matters worse, the manager today was one who I hadn't worked with, and handled the situation like a 5 year old. Rather than be proactive, she whined and complained. Did nothing to help, and took to yelling at employees who messed up, despite the fact that she had put people on stations they had never worked.

So its about 1:30, the shift began at 8:00. We're hungry. Yesterday's manager had told us we were welcome to take the remaining wing pieces (the little bits that are too small to serve), and cook them for the staff. We get our wings going, and she comes out of her office and Flips. Shit. Gives a 5 minute rant about how the customers are more important, and that that was unacceptable. We offered to buy then and she said we weren't allowed to because the customer's money is more important(wtf?) So what do we do? Call and order two pizzas for delivery from another company. Deliverer came right through the front door, we paid and cash, tipped well, and ate our fucking pizza. Without explaining the manager's reaction, was this correct? And does have you ever done this?

Backstory: Only driver after 8:30 because the other driver called out and I had one of the people upfront doing deliveries.

Story: After the girl that was helping me do deliveries leaves, we get 5 deliveries, thankfully they are fairly local, &lt;1mile radius from the store. I have 2 to the university, 3 elsewhere. So I mentally make my route and plan it but because I'm tired, and having to drive a soon to be ex-coworker home and she's bitching her ass off. So natually my route didn't go the way I planned. I make one of my deliveries to the university I try calling the student 5 times and she doesn't pick up. I call my boss and says go do your other deliveries. 

I do my rounds and drop off the annoying coworker. 

I call my boss and ask, Hey are you able to reach the girl?

Boss: Yup she should be waiting for you

So I get there and I call, she says I'll be right down, I'm thinking great! 5minutes pass and i don't see her so i call her again and she said shes on her way, a few more minutes pass and she finally comes down, and want to guess why she didn't answer me the previous 5 times?

I got the ticket and when the food was ready I headed to the house. When I got there a 40-50 y/o woman answered the door and she was extremely bloody and bruised. Her nose and her left eye were bleeding heavily--I will remember it forever. She gave me a $100 bill to pay for the food, and to call the police/paramedics. I didn't have a cell phone so I went to the house next door and the neighbors were very concerned and the male neighbor went to her house to console her while his wife stayed with me and got ahold of the police. I had to stick around about an hour and tell my side of the story. Apparently her and her husband had gotten in a fight about what food to order and after she ordered the pizza he got extremely heated and beat her before heading out to a local wing place. That was my most traumatic experience delivering pizza.

I get back to the store and explain what happened to everyone. They all thought it was hilarious. As I'm leaving on my next delivery, the previous order calls my cell. So I answer and realize it's them and told them that since they didn't give us the right address or answer their phone, I had sold it to the other guy. I told them we could remake it and have it right out to them. Then they hung up. I tell the manager on duty what happened and take my delivery. 

When I got back I find out they had called the store to complain, and the manager had given then a $20 credit to make them happy.

**""No.... I didn't""**

I got a delivery to an apartment building where you can open the first door to a little entryway where they have the mailboxes and a box with a button for each apartment. The second door is locked, but can be buzzed open from an apartment or unlocked with a key. There are a ton of buildings like this in my city.

I hit the button for the apartment that ordered the pizza. Usually, they'll just hit the button in their apartment to buzz me into the building and I take the pizza to their apartment. In this case, I waited a minute or two until finally a scrawny nerdy little guy in his late teens to early 20s comes down the stairs *wearing only a tshirt and boxers*.

He comes into the entry way and I hand him the credit card slip and a pen to sign it with. I notice that he lets the door close behind him. I take the paper and pen from him and give him his pizza.

""The door closed... did you bring your keys with you?"" I asked him as he tries to open the obviously locked door.

""No... I didn't."" He says in the most nasally, high-pitched, Steve Urkel-type of voice you can think of. ""Maybe I'll try to hit some of the buttons until someone lets me in"" he tells me.

There wasn't really anything I could do for the guy. I wished him luck in getting back into his building as I left.

He's from Brasil, he came here with nothing but his wife 12 years ago. 

He ended up at the pizza joint I work for now and has never left, until today. Today was his last day, everyone was coming by to say farewell to their co-worker, favorite employee, friend. Everyone who has ever worked with him when they first met him, thought he was a jackass. They weren't wrong but didn't know that he would grow on them. 

This Brazilian would become your friend, in the brief 8 months I've worked here, this man has become one of the best people I know. I am honored to have been able to work besides this legend. He will be missed. 

He's leaving us to go back home to Brasil with his wife, and his two kids. His plans aren't final but he will either end up working on his parents farm or start his own business. He may come back, he may not, but one thing is for sure, no one will forget the name Claudio. For there will be stories about this legend. About how strict he was, or how much he touched your junk or sexually harassed you, or just some random story about this man. 

I was only able to give him a small gesture, I went to a cake shop and bought an 8 inch strawberry shortcake and them write YOLO on it.

 YOLO was his favorite saying, and I decided to be all sneaky about it. I had the cab drop me off about 100 ft away from the store so he didn't see me through the windows, and I walked towards the building I saw a driver leaving. I asked her, ""Hey, where's Claudio?"" she said, oh saying good bye to a customer upfront. I  think fuck yes! perfect! Then I move in the employee entrance, go straight to walk-in and tell other driver working, hey gtfo of my way. I put the cake in a spot that he wouldn't be looking at if he went in. So I quickly leave through the same entrance, then walk around to main entrance and act like nothing happened. A little later I bring the cake out and say my spiel about how we all pitched in and got him this cake. (no one pitched in but I didn't want to take all the credit). The look on his face when he saw the cake and what I had put on it, he was overjoyed.

Now, the part of town he lives in is pretty far from the store; almost out of range, so I knew that I wouldn't go home anytime soon.

I went into his run-down apartment and pushed the buzzer. Of course, he took his sweet time getting to the door. I mean, come on, if you were expecting me, you should be ready! After 3 buzzing attempts, he finally said ""Yuh?"" (I could tell he was beyond stoned).

I said ""Uhh, delivery,"" and he buzzed me in. I went to knock on his door and he took his sweet time ANSWERING THE DAMN DOOR.

Finally he answered it, and let me tell you what I saw:
Skinny white dude with chinstrap beard, red tshirt with some tacky dragon print on it, those white trash jeans that are like really long, baggy shorts. Do I need to mention that they had numerous pockets? And lastly, he was holding a **baby**!

He goes ""How much?""
""26""
""Uhkay""

He reached into his wallet with one hand while still holding the baby. I'm surprised he didn't drop him. He pulled out a 50 bill.
Now, we can't take 50s unless the order is worth about $50, mainly because drivers can have no more than $20 on them in case they get robbed.

I said ""I can't take a 50.""
""Oh man, why not?""
""I can't make change for it""
""Uhkay""

He pulled his wallet back out of his pants and handed me a twenty and a ten (why didn't he do this before?)

He then said ""Just give me 4 back bro""

In my mind, I snapped, but I kept cool only because he had a kid in his hand, and I had to stay professional.

So, I ended a delivery to a terrible part of town that's really far from the store, I had to deal with a stoned idiot who was holding a kid, and the delivery time ended up being late!

I didn't get out of the store until after 1:30 because of that guy.

My assistant manager said she will speak to the head manager and never got back to me so after awhile i got fed up and told her that i was doing my last delivery for the night that i had stayed wait too long and that i have been there since 12. As i was walking out of the store with my order i overheard the head manager tell the assistant manager that if i leave before the rush was over to ask for my hat and my shirt which pretty much means to fire me on the spot. I had never been in a situation like that so i honestly got a bit scared and pissed off at the same time. On my way to the delivery i told my girlfriend what happened and luckily she calmed me down and told me not to make a big scene or anything and lose my job over this even though is unfair. After that i worked another hour and at around 8:40 i asked to speak to the head manager to sort this thing out and i was told she had left so i asked then when in hell am i suppose to leave if she left and the assistant manager told me that she didn't know but it wasn't going to be anytime soon. At that point i was ready fly off the handle but didn't want to argue anymore and i was honestly tired so i just pleaded with her and showed her that the rush was over and we were no longer busy. She finally agreed to let me go but i had to first clean all the dishes before i left. I ended up leaving at 9. I felt humiliated and confused because those people are generally are nice co-workers that you can get along with but that day they were total jerks. Yes i know that if there was a rush and it was very busy at the moment i should have sucked it up but in my opinion that's really not my problem to deal with if i already did my work. Just like they don't care what happens to you or your car while working i shouldn't care for them when i finished doing my job and on top of that i took time out of my day to help the store out when it had only one damn driver. Now for the very important part. I managed to record the assistant manager admitting to me that the head manager ordered to fire me on the spot if i left before the rush was over even though i was there working since 12 noon. I also wrote down the numbers of my supervisor and the person in charged for training in my general area(he used to be our supervisor that's why i got his number too) I planned to call them and tell them what happened but i'm having second thoughts about doing that because i don't want to put my job in jeopardy and i don't want to come off as a bitching idiot whining about nothing. On the other hand this thing is eating me away because i feel it all the way in my core that this is wrong and to not stand up for this kind of treatment will just lead to a miserable working environment. My fellow delivery drivers and those who have walked this path before i would greatly appreciate your advice on how to deal with this situation that i'm in now. Thank you for your time.

tl;dr I when into work early, tried to leave afterwards, almost got fired for it but i'm trying to do something about this injustice.    ",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_15xohi,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/15xohi/almost_got_fired_for_something_i_dont_feel_is_fair/,

(and related practices),1,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1j5l64/do_you_charge_customers_full_price_if_theyve_no/,"i ALWAYS punch in a coupon when they order. smaller (aka REASONABLE) sale amounts are just kinda morally the right thing to do, and better savings make for better tips. sorry, but i can't in good conscience tell someone ""your total comes out to $18"" when they only ordered a single pizza for delivery, even if it is a specialty. i usually give them the $10 3 topping or the $12 basically-whatever-pizza-you-want coupon, even if they don't mention having a coupon or asking for specials.

also every now and then they make a note in the driver remarks to bring an extra dipping sauce or whatever, like they think they're free like parmesan. i'll go ahead and take one and tell them ""these aren't free... so this is me hooking you up"". i feel that can't hurt in adding an extra buck to a tip, maybe.

sometimes i'll throw in napkins if i think they could use it (like their getting it delivered to someplace that's not their home). and of course i'll offer parm and pepper from the bag i keep in my car if they tip well.

and i think the only other thing i can think of that i do is sometimes if we fuck up, even if it's a carry-out order, like if we don't have their pizza and they have to wait again for a re-make, i'll go over the manager and offer them a free soda while they wait for the inconvenience. i realize most of the shit i do is considered ""company theft"", but my employer pays me dick, so i really don't give a shit. i just like to encourage good tipping and i kinda fucking despise disappointing customers because ""it's policy"" when in fact we're just not being reasonable (like how this one promotion we offer that's on window decals and on every pizza box says ""50% off when certain baseball team scores 7 or more runs, order online at blahblah.com!"" yet my GM interprets this as the offer is only good when they order online, yet at the same time, that coupon is CLEARLY in the POS in-store. so sometimes people call in and they're having issues ordering online and just want the baseball deal and ask for it over the phone and my boss will just basically tell them ""tough shit, it's online only"". grrr that pisses me off so much. 

ok, rant over.

It was a pretty good day today, but now; Story time. (It's a pretty good one... I reminded myself of why I don't work at Focus.) Once upon a delivery to Focus Communications, located off 1st Avenue in Rock Falls, IL; I stopped the car, got out, and it was business as usual. I strutted past (I assume) a few supervisors, talking to a girl about doing a good job etc over a cigarette break. I slid inside the lobby to deliver a pizza to a nice girl, when one of the 'supervisors' walked past me and said she'd get whomever the pizza was for. She walked inside a glass doorway where the employees work, did not* find the customer for me, and instead, immediately started carrying on about someone using a door that has a sign on it marked 'Use Other Door'. Me, not giving a fuck realized, wait a minute, I might have used that door, and that might of been what a note on the door said, but the letters were very faded, and I didn't read it. The lady, is rather upset, almost too upset. I thought, 'What could I have possibly done to that door? Seemed fine to me. It can't be that big of a deal.' Then, through the door, I overhear the lady speaking rather aggressively about punching somebody in the face. Woah now, back it up. I looked at the 4 foot nothing, large, sassy, aggravated, white lady through the glass door, who's face was red. About a guy. 'Maybe me'. Opening ""the wrong door"". To wherever. She said 'I seriously watched him walk through the door marked 'USE OTHER DOOR' right in front of me.' At this point, my jimmies are kinda rustled, and the very nice lady whom the delivery was for walked through the door. As the door shut I heard this lady say, again; 'I'm SERIOUSLY gonna punch him in the face if he does that ONE MORE TIME. Obviously it's not me, so I proceeded not giving a fuck again, and very politely, yet charismatically said to the miss as I gave her the order, ""Have an awesome day, and try not to get punched in the face. :D"" She tipped me 6 bucks, gave a short mildly humored exhale, said 'you too!' and I left. Walking past the 'supervisor' outside, a tall middle aged man said 'thank you have a nice day' to which my reply was; 'You too sir, and try not to get punched in the face."" His face was rather irritated as he looked at me and replied 'Punched in the face? What!?' To which I, in turn, replied; ""Well, sir; that's just what that shorter lady who was out here earlier said she was going to do to somebody who used a wrong door. Hope it wasn't me."" As I promptly got into my vehicle and left, I checked the mirror and saw the man bustling to put out his cigarette and go inside to find out whatever happened. Apparently, the supervisors that work for Focus Comms. are all notorious for thinking they can do/say what they want and act like they're better than their peers. I hope I did something good there, and maybe she got a talking to, or better (worse for her, actually). But I'd also like to say, as much as I joke around about punching somebody in the face from them irritating me, I'd never do it. I'm the poster child for jackass screw ups here, but if my boss, or supervisor, wherever I worked, were to tell someone else, that they were going to punch me in the face, (Without* having a funny, joking, work-relationship); I'd have to call that bluff. And if anyone reading this happens to be working for anybody who would do something to that effect, I'd just like to let you know, or perhaps remind you; that you don't have to put up with bullshit like that. And for any managers or supervisors reading? Don't be a fucking dick, because what goes around, typically comes around; and no matter how big you think you are, more often than not you'll find somebody bigger than you who's not afraid of telling it like it is.

If you want better tips, 'forget' something like dessert or one of the drinks. Be super nice and say ""Don't worry, I'll go and get yours from a store round the corner"" or ""I'll go back and get it as quick as I can"". Hell, even give them the wrong drink so they don't go thirsty.

When you come back (about 4 mins later as you've just been on the other drop you had to do) and are real nice, I've found they tip much more than if you had the order right in the first place.

It works best if you've got another drop nearby on the same run so you can use that to kill the time.

A bit sneaky, but worked really well for me! The crucial thing is that you forget something that doesn't spoil their night, so desert or a drink is cool, by the time they'd be eating it, you're back with it anyway.

Anyone else found that this works?",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_1ikdah,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/1ikdah/getting_an_order_wrong_for_tips_it_works/,

 Once upon a delivery, I was going to a house up on a crowded residential area, it was a nice drive up until i hit the house i was deliverying too... it was a place different from all the other houses because it had this tree that made everything look darker... 

to describe it is Extremely complicated! there was a tree with Huge leave and the Drive way was full of what i can only presume to be Dog Feces and mud mixed together to make this satanic sludge which smelled of dead dogs. To add to the horror it was infested with Flies and Mosquitos, just flying around and im standing there in front of the gate (inside my car {in pure fear}) calling the guy to come out...

He comes out as a guy who looks like he hasnt showered in weeks! i cant blame him though he looked pretty pudgy! but i should blame him form Making me walk to his front yard and wait for him at the gate so he can ""get"" the money! 

after about 7 minutes of scrounging around he finds some and i wouldn't Believe my eyes! the money he gave me was putrid and muddier than the driveway! but there was a bright side! he tipped 20 dollars for making me wait so long! i was thinking that this guy was crazy for giving me 20 dollars and, out of COMPLETE STUPIDITY, I asked Him Why his Driveway was so dirty and why are all these flies here... noticing Ive pretty much insulted him, I was a bit embarrassed when he said that the tree has leave that parasitic animals like mosquitos and house flies love because it smells like decaying bodies and that his wife and him are trying to find a guy to cut the tree down with had a wasp infestation as well! 

I was Naturally surprised by what i was thinking! i thought he was a guy who slacked off in life and didn't give a shit about what he looked like! but I see now that he was just hungry... remember if you do pizza delivery, FOR GOD SAKES dont judge the customer!

A few times people paid with credit cards and left the tip section blank. I gave my self a $10 tip twice out of the many. 
The time I remember best was when I had to deliver to an compass, where not only did I have to walk a good 5-8 minutes to get to his room but he wasn't even in there. This girl had to track him down and i had to wait another 10 mins. On my way back to the car I decided to give myself a tip. Did it again a week later after some Asian dude called me a ni**er  and laugh and slammed the door in my face. I was leaving this job the next day. I never got caught or called on this by my boss so I guess I got away with it. 
I was a pretty bad delivery driver by the way wasn't great with with the township i was delivery in. It wasn't getting to the house that was the problem it was figuring how to leave. I only did it for 3 months. One of the funnier things about the job was that the very last delivery I made was to the same house I delivered to my very first day at work. It took me for ever to find this guys house because it was dark out and the house number wasn't visible. 

So any way has any one else given them selves a tip?",,False,,t5_2uh13,False,,,True,t3_yilr8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/yilr8/tipping_ones_self/,
