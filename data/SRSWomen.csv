This morning I had to run to a nearby store and decided to take the bus instead of walking. I'm minding my own business, reading a book, when a guy sits next to me. No big deal, the bus was kind of crowded. Then he starts talking to me, and its blatantly obvious that he got all of his ""how to talk to random women"" ideas from PUAs. I'm trying to ignore him, but he won't shut up. Then he mentions some article he read on Reddit and how blah blah blah.

I perk up, smile my sweetest smile, and ask him what's the most hated group on Reddit. He kind of hems and haws, but with a little ""No no, who do you think everyone hates there? Really hates"" he finally answers SRS.

I just smile, bat my eyes, and say ""yeah."" 

He looked confused, then the lightbulb went off and he looked horrified. He quickly moved to a seat further back and left me to read in peace.

1345149155.0,185,self.SRSWomen,yc7xq,I deconverted an MRA from work. I probably shouldn't gloat but I'm so happy!,237,52,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/yc7xq/i_deconverted_an_mra_from_work_i_probably/,"So, I work at a book store and like my job and my coworkers. A month or so back as I was ringing a woman out, I noticed her purchases were feminism related and started a chat with her about them, something we're encouraged to do if we recognize books or subject matter we're familiar with. She told me she'll be college freshman and will be double majoring, hopefully one in women's studies, and wanted to do more reading. I reccomend some other books to her, a few blogs, and we talk for a minute or so about the schrodinger's rapist blog post. She thanks me and leaves and I become aware my male coworker is staring at me, and not in a nice way. Our store is now dead and he says to me in this disgusted voice, ""Oh god, don't tell me you're a feminist.""

I say back to him, well yeah, I am.

He immediately launches into an MRA rant about the oppression of straight white men. I let him go and tell him, maybe we can talk later.

I didn't report him to management because this guy is smart, if naive. Maybe silly on my part but oh well.

On a lunch break a week or so later, he brings it up again. I say to him, ""What do you think about me?"" He's flabbergasted at first but I push and go, ""Do you believe that on a fundamental level, I'm as capable of doing this job as you?"".. He says yes. So I go on and ask, ""Do you think our pay should hinge on what we do, or should our genders be factored in?""... What we do of course, he said. ""Should men be treated one way, and women another?"" And he said no, thats not right.

""You're a feminist, then.""

He was shocked and a little angry at me, but I persisted. I told him he could call it what he wanted but if he believed that stuff, those are feminist values. He brought it up again a couple days after and seemed kind of troubled so I reccomended a couple books. I also reminded him, I have a husband and son, both whom I adore, both are men. Feminism is not the hatred of men, nor will it ever be.

This afternoon as our shift ended he asked if I'd talk with him over lunch. We went to lunch and had a long discussion about feminism, toxic masculinity, the patriarchy and its effects on men and women and by the end he was like a different person than the guy who gave me a death stare for saying I was a feminist. He also lamented that the MRM sees eye to eye with feminists on so much stuff but won't cut the toxic masculinity and won't stop blaming feminists when they're fighting the same fight. He thanked me a lot and said he'd start ""working on"" some of his misguided friends. One thing he said that stuck out was, ""We've really made feminist into a bad word, haven't we?""

It was just really satisfying and awesome to see it all click into place for this guy. I'm glad I trusted my gut here to educate rather than ""turn him in.""

(TW, obviously) ",206,34,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x9ozi/i_beat_the_shit_out_of_my_rapist_and_got_away/,"When I was 14, a freshman in HS, I was raped by a 24 year old dude whom I trusted. He was my guitar teacher. We were friendly, not friends really, but he was a ""forever alone"" type living in his parents basement and I felt bad for him. 

He was lamenting about how he can't get a woman who isn't ""nuts"" or immature blah blah and I told him that no mature woman is gonna go for a dude who lives in moms basement with no direction in life. Harsh? Sure. True? Absolutely. I mean, if a 14 year old can see that, why couldn't he? From there [he clocked me in the face, knocked me out (I was shocked, I played hockey my whole life and that is the only time I knocked out from a punch) and raped me.](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Boy-That-Escalated-Quickly-Anchorman.gif) I eventually fought him off and left. He was a very meek, very introverted dude. Not the ""type"" to rape. Yeah right. 

It went unreported. Of course. The problem was that I was having a shitty time at home, my stepdad was emotionally abusive, my mom was being controlled by him and I just felt like I didn't want to add to her problems. Pretty fucked up, right? 

So, I deal with it the best I can. I was in therapy already and it came out that this happened a couple months later. My therapist urged me to report it, but at that point what could I prove. I'm still dealing with it to a certain extent but 3 years ago I got my revenge that I didn't even know I was seeking. 

I grew up in Chicago. The bars and clubs were plentiful and so were fake IDs. I was 20, outside of a club and neighborhood I normally don't hang out in. Too many yuppies for my taste. I had just been hit by a car a few days prior. Nothing broken but I did have nearly stitches in my face. I wasn't letting that stop me from going out, no ma'am. I was with a trusted friend and his awesome wife. We're just hanging out on the sidewalk, enjoying a blunt, when all of a sudden, I see Mr. Rapey. 

I tried to ignore him. I really did. I got this feeling of rage in my gut and I tried to turn away. He talked to me. I tried to pretend like I didn't know who he was. Then he crosses the line. You see, my friend is a big dude. Maybe 6'4"", 250lbs of muscle. He has a ""thug"" background but has since cleaned up. He is a very put together guy. Dresses nice. Wears a bit of jewelry. Super sweet. His wife and I were dressed for the club in the summer. Skirts, heels, hair did, the works. So this fuck face says to me ""Ugh look at your face. Did your pimp over there beat the shit out of you?""

I had enough. I was already pumped full of adrenaline. I punched him in the jaw so hard it knocked him over. I kicked him. I spit on him. I really let the fucker have it. I was wearing my favorite Louboutins, too. It felt good when I got to rinse the blood off later on. I'm not normally one to be fighting on the street like that, but this was a long time coming and he just couldn't keep his mouth shut and walk on by. I have no idea how much times passes. It feels like hours but was probably less than a minute. Suddenly, I'm being pulled off of him by cops but he looked pretty bad. I thought ""Well, this is it. My first assault charge. Worth it."" 

So a few minutes later, I'm handcuffed, in the back of a cop car, the police are talking to him, my buddies, and all the people around us. My friends have ZERO idea why I snapped like that. If they knew, I know the dude would have ended him. He's like my big brother. But I wanted this asshole to myself. There was no way I could make him feel as violated as he made me, but at least I know he had some new scars to show off. 

Some time passes and I'm told by an officer that he won't be pressing charges. The officer, a woman, asks why I did what I did. I told her that he raped me 6 years prior when I was just a kid, that I regretfully didn't report it, and that I tried to ignore him that night but he just wouldn't stop provoking me. I also let her know that I KNOW kicking someones ass doesn't solve anything but it made me feel better so the charge would have been worth it. I swear she held back a laugh. 

She asks me if I want to go home. I do. I'm covered in blood and my make up is smeared from crying and screaming and general freaking out. She uncuffs me and I ride backseat, asking her about her life as a female cop. She tells me a lot of awesome stories and makes me laugh. I thank her for the ride and let her know that she's an inspiration. 

I get home and it's still early. Midnight on a Friday is early in Chicago. I shower off, fix my hair and makeup, and put on a fresh pair of heels. I called a cab and met up with my friends. This time in a neighborhood not populated by yuppies and one specific psychopath.

Now, he's friends with a guy I'm seeing(who wasn't included in the group text), and today I brought it up with him and told him how it made me upset.  His response?  ""Yeah, I heard about that.  He called the next day to say sorry and ask if I was mad.""  THE FUCK?  Why didn't he say sorry to ME?  Why didn't he ask ME if I was mad?  No, he apologized to someone who wasn't even involved with the incident that I just happen to be seeing.  Now I'm even angrier at him than before.  His guilt had nothing to do with disrespecting me as a person, but disrespecting someone else's ""item"". 

None of the other guys in that group of friends act that way, but now I'm starting to wonder what they really believe and say when the girls aren't around.

So last week, in my pop culture class there was a pretty bad incident. Long story short, I had messed up on a brief presentation to the class. Once the class was aware of what had happened, about 25 individuals decided to shout ""Boo!"" at me. Then two boys (not mature enough to be called men) decided to ""Boo"" me the rest of the time I was talking. I don't think the professor heard them, as they weren't very loud. I couldn't see them as they were sitting behind me, but I could hear them. 

 After class, as I'm walking to the door, a boy approaches me. I'm assuming he was one of the people who ""Booed"" me the entire time. Either way, he shoves into me hard enough to almost knock me over and says ""Dumb ass fat bitch."" 

I emailed the professor, explaining what had happened. He sent me one back saying he ""would handle it.""

Class started today and a woman was sitting with him. He introduced her as his girlfriend, who just happened to be a legal advisor for a feminist organization. He explains that after an incident with a few students, he's decided he's going to have her go over our state's laws on assualt, as well as our school's policies on bullying, sexual harassment, and assault. 

Nobody at my school has *ever* explained my school's policies regarding any of that. And it was so great that he made it clear that that behavior wouldn't be tolerated at all; not by him, the school, or even by legal bodies (depending on how far it escalated). 

Also, it looked like the boy who shoved me will no longer be in that class. 

So I just wanted to share that there are some people out there who get it. I felt empowered, just in that someone listened to me, and took action in such a clear way. 

**TL;DR** Get shoved into and insulted in class, professor makes it clear that that won't be tolerated. ",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_zfiwn,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/zfiwn/just_wanted_to_share_my_professors_response_to_a/,

* Identifying as multisexual as a man is an identification that is valid and respected.

* Identifying as multisexual as a woman indicates that I am confused, greedy, and selfish. It is open to public commentary and debate as to what my sexuality realllly is.

* Looking good because *I* want to look good is a grievous offense and subject to public discussion.

* Not looking good because *I* don't feel like looking good is a grievous offense and subject to public discussion.

* As a man, displaying emotion is a sign of being well-adjusted, mature, and in touch with oneself.

* As a woman, displaying emotion is a sign of weakness, instability, and invalid since the emotion is purely driven by hormones.

* As a man, the default assumption is competence. When I do poor work or I am slow, it is excused as being outside my knowledge base.

* As a woman, the default assumption is incompetence. If I do poor work or work slowly, it is assumed to be a lack of knowledge, and the lack of knowledge is attributed to my gender.

* As a man, my opinion is welcomed and solicited even on subjects that do not affect me or that I have no knowledge on.

* As a woman, my opinion is irrelevant regardless of whether the topic affects me and even if I am highly knowledgeable on the topic.

* As a man, my appearance is secondary to my personality and actions when determining my worth.

* As a woman, my appearance trumps all other attributes when determining my worth. If I am not pleasing to the eye, I am not valued.

* As a man, my bodily autonomy is respected. I will not be picked up, hugged, or otherwise inappropriately touched without my permission.

* As a woman, my body is the world's toy. My wishes for my own body are trumped by others' wishes for gratification, entertainment, or harassment.

* As a man, walking anywhere alone (at any time) is accepted as a necessary part of my day. I am left alone to go about the things I need to do as a part of my day.

* As a woman, walking anywhere alone is seen as soliciting attention from strangers. Often, it is taken as solicting descriptions of violent, degrading sexual fantasies.

* As a man, my weight is considered to a personal issue and understood to be a result of many social, behavioral, genetic, and other factors. My weight is never considered in a judgment of my character or worth.

* As a woman, my weight is a public issue. It is subject to comments when it appears to have changed, and if it is too low or too high for a person's liking they will tell me and give advice on how I should correct my weight to their ideal. If my weight is not to the liking of someone, they will look down on me.


This is just a short list, but I figured I'd post it. I've been presenting full time as a woman for a little over two months. I've entered an entirely new world. This is some of what I've learned about it all.

Your period might not be. Maybe you work around sick people all the time and blood doesn't bother you anymore. Maybe you emanate a pink mist from your loins 2-3 days a month and it smells like roses. But MY period is gross.

If our vaginas are blooming flowers and each is unique, with its own array of colorful petals, mine is the rafflesia (at least while I'm in menstrual town). It is dark red and smells like rotting meat (regardless of how much perfume I use or how often I wash it) and brings all the housecats and dogs to the yard. My period is gross.

Do you get clots? I do. I've read they aren't supposed to be bigger than a quarter, but my average clot is at least that big. I've dropped some that were the size of a large chicken egg. I was in the shower this morning and HEARD one thump against the floor of the tub. Then it clogged the drain and I had to do some amateur plumbing. My period is gross.

I regularly throw away underwear. The only size tampons I buy are super-absorbent and I never rely on just those; I also have to have overnight pads. Otherwise, I will submerge all my belongings and all my loved ones in blood, like a bad creepypasta. My period is gross.

I'm happy for you if your period allows you to run down the beach in white pants, laughing. But when I'm on my period, I feel like I have ebola flu. I have actually vomited because my stomach pains were so strong. I'll take an aspirin, sure, but that doesn't change the fact that my period is gross.

Did I mention my intense craving for meat when I'm on my period? I have eaten an entire sushi tray and then had a steak in my quest for iron. When not on my period, I don't even like red meat. If you are think I'm awful for eating all those innocent animals, let me emphasize MY INTENSE CRAVING FOR MEAT. I will eat you, too. My period is gross.

Anyway, one of the first threads I saw on /b/ was about feminism. Clicked it and read through it and...honestly? It has better discussion than I have seen on Reddit(outside the fempire) about women's issues. This is the moment I truly truly realized that Reddit is indeed, a shit hole.

Some quotes that caught my eye:

&gt;""most men who sleep around are doing so because they are raised believing that using women for sex is somehow 'alpha', when really, most men simply degrade women.""

&gt;""I am so surprised this hasn't been flooded with Alpha bullshit yet. Nice to know that all anons don't hate women as much as it seems. Most of it is just pissed off boys/men who are going through a bad break up or have become bitter with their previous failed relationships. So they decide to take the simple route of coping by blaming the opposite sex and degrading their value.""

&gt;""There aren't as many about men. Women sleep around and express their sexuality, and they are considered 'sluts' (A word I refuse to say any longer).
Men sleep around and they are considered 'Pimps'.
This is true in nearly ever culture.
When I started seeing Mandy, my gf, I found out that she had relations with a lot of the guys in my dorm.
At first I was horrified and very judgmental. The longer I was with her though and really listened to what she said, I realized that calling women names because they decide to live however they want to is just a way to suppress them.
Mandy can sleep with whomever she wants now, provided she uses protection, and I know she will still be with me, that sex and commitment are not the same thing and me trying to control her body is no better than the conservative politicians""

And while some of the way things are said might be a bit callous and raw(to be expected there), people are being honest. 

Can you imagine if a dude in a popular subreddit just came out like 'hey I'm a feminist, any other guys out there feminists as well?'

I'm not posting the link because I don't want said shitlord here in the Fempire. But it's basically the top voted link there right now so if you feel like pulling your hair out, have a gander. But he basically spends the entire thread justifying his fetish by saying that his exclusive physical attraction to Asian women is only the starting point, and that he will still value a woman's personality. Then he goes on to describe in detail what he finds attractive about Asian women by breaking us down into body parts. HE BREAKS US DOWN BY BODY PARTS. Eyes, body shape, hair...UGH. And then he goes on to talk about how the culture is overall more 'kind and polite' and he goes on and on about how he LOVES those Asian eyes, KOREAN IN PARTICULAR.  
And he expected validation from a subreddit of Asian WOMEN who spend their entire lives being objectified both because they are women and because they are Asian, subject to amazingly negative hypersexualized stereotypes of Asian women. I mean, SERIOUSLY? I tried to explain that by having this fetish and objectifying Asian women, you are contributing to an overall greater scale of racism, continuing to paint Asian women as an 'other' in society, making it even harder for Asian American women to straddle the tenuous line between assimilating and appreciating our unique cultural heritage.  
I got the response that I am being unfair, unreasonable and that I am shouting down a differing opinion. When I wrote practically an essay giving sociological reasons why racial fetishism hurts minorities no matter how many times the nice Western men come in with their privilege to DICTATE to us that it's OK, and they expect to be patted on the back for their SENSITIVITY. SO MAD.  
Sorry for the rant, but I knew the fempire would let me be mad for a little while. Shitlords are even worse when they're racist shitlords who want you to be the perfect fragile flower. Oh, with perfect almond-shaped eyes and straight-cut bangs. *gnashes teeth*  
So tired of being cat called with 'two dolla sucky fucky' and 'you can love me long time', and the only thing people can think to talk about when I meet them is 'OH I LOVE ASIAN FOOD, I eat General Tso's chicken all the time'. Motherfucker, that shit isn't even real Chinese food, that's American Chinese food. I grew up on authentic stuff and I'd never had 'orange chicken' before I got here. STFU about how much you love those 'weird Chinese dresses'. My culture and my heritage are not for you to appropriate. My body is not for you to fetishize and fantasize about. I AM A PERSON BEYOND MY CULTURE dammit. Stop making me the racial other. STOP IT STOP.  RRRRRRRR.  

EDIT: SRSWomen, we have pissed off the shitlords. A shitlord made the name Doryfishie2 and posted to /r/gonewild with a picture of me that he (I AM ASSUMING SHITLORD) took from my posting it on /r/BiGoneMild. He then posted in this thread saying 'if you're so against racial fetishism why are you posting to Gonewild' and linked it.

So, I just wanted to share my story because I am SOO FREAKING PROUD of myself! So, all this summer I have been interning at a local theatre. I was originally supposed to just be doing press and social media for them, but I ended up having to take over lights and sound for a show. When I just did press the owners (my bosses) were always nice to me, a little condescending, but whatever. But, as soon as I started doing lights and sound, they started being CONSTANT assholes. Mind you, before this, I had never even SEEN a light or sound board, much less been using them. But I figured out how they work in a week, and I have been running the shows ever since. BUT. Despite all my hard work and the fact that I'm totally inexperienced and untrained, they are constantly giving me negative feedback, and refusing my requests to actually BE TRAINED. I was constantly getting yelled at for ""messing up and ruining the show"" and being belittled in front of the cast, and the owners encouraged everybody to call me ""then_you_do_this the intern"" instead of just, I don't know, MY FUCKING NAME. So last night, I was running the show, and I got a really snarky text from one of the owners (who is the lead in the show), telling me ""The cast needs to be louder than the band, that's IMPORTANT and you should know this.""

(disclaimer- the cast was totally louder than the band)

Well, I had fucking HAD it at that point. So I strapped on my shoes (which were 5 inch tall platforms covered in spikes, which make me about 6'2"") and went backstage, and found the owner who texted me. I tapped him on the shoulder, and said (with acid dripping from every word) ""You wanted to speak with me?"" The look in his eyes was one of pure TERROR. He immediately started stuttering and stammering and saying that he just thought they sounded muffled, but not to worry about it! I just said ""Look, I know what TWO of the knobs on the soundboard actually do. Unless you're going to sit back there and teach me what everything does, you need to stop giving me attitude.""

It was SUCH A GREAT FEELING! I had let them walk all over me because I wanted a good recommendation, but fuck it, Nobody professional should act like that.

But I wanted to share why I'm so proud of my fiancé right now.

He works for a unnamed gaming company, and he's become increasingly frustrated with directions they are going. Namely objectifying women all in the name of increasing profits. They have ignored his input of actual productive ways to improve the business, and have gone the easy route of using sexy ladies to become the face of the company. He's an incredibly valuable employee to the company, otherwise they would have just fired him. But they have removed his admin privileges and forced him out of any decision making roles that he previously had. They obviously don't like his criticisms of their decisions and want to silence him as much as possible.

So, he did what any person fed up would do, go to their main competitor and see if they wanted to hire him. And they do! Right now the contract is being written up and will be sent in a couple of days. Being the only person who knows actually how to run the business, as he has been there since day one, he's relishing on the fact that the business might collapse in his absence.

Since we've been together, he's becoming more aware and vocal of how women are represented in gaming and in the industry. Now he's fighting against the shitlords. It's absolutely amazing the shitlords will not win this battle. Him and I are ecstatic to see them fail, essentially, they have brought it upon themselves.

And given I have pale skin and dark hair, it's pretty easy to spot. I'm not against shaving or hair removal but I feel pretty indifferent about it. I do it when the mood strikes and the fact is my fiance has no problem at all with my body hair so I really am under no pressure at all to shave or otherwise remove hair from myself.  I'm pretty femme and surprisingly this choice hasn't really gotten much attention except from some nice comments from men and women complimenting me and saying they wished more people felt free to skip the social beauty rituals they disliked. 

While standing on a pier, just chilling in my shorts and tank top in my hairy legged, hairy armpitted glory and fishing with my fiance, three guys decided to start yelling insults at me from the beach. I stopped and walked over to the edge of the pier and waited till they finished. On top of being called an ugly c**t, I got called an ape and the last guy to insult me screamed at me that I looked like Chewbacca. 

I yelled back to them, ""Yeah baby, and I still wear heels that are bigger than your dicks will ever be!"" (woop, thank you pinterest for that insult). 

Every single person on the dock (mostly men, but a few other ladies) started laughing their asses off and the guys who had been harassing me first looked confused and then completely horrified and embarrassed and fled the scene. The entire time I was maniacally laughing and it was definitely one of the most satisfying moments I've had in a LONG time. 

Just wanted to share my victory! COME AT ME BROSEPHS.

Also because I'm still traumatized from 2x I want to make it clear I'm cool with smaller penises and a penis and its size doesn't determine gender, I just knew when they were trying to shit on me that that was the button to push so I pushed it. It's not a statement about how I feel at large.

We were talking about how different it is between California and Alabama. And then this happened.

&gt;    Testing. 1,2,3.  Is this thing on?
&gt;
&gt;    I was taking a break from writing a post about introducing D/s to a vanilla relationship when I came across this image. I sat and looked at it for a moment trying to sort out exactly what it evoked within me. Then I looked at the notes.
&gt;
&gt;    At the time of this post 13,491.
&gt;
&gt;    So, I clicked on the notes expecting that there would be outrage, someone crying foul, a bit of righteous indignation and the like. Nope. Like, after like. Reblog after reblog. I gave up after scrolling through four pages of notes and not finding even one comment saying “What the fuck is this?”
&gt;
&gt;    I am not easily offended. I get off on the weirdest and kinkiest shit. I really don’t care what two consenting people do to each other, even when the squick factor makes me throw up in my mouth a bit. I’m all for expressing whatever you want to express, no matter how offensively stupid and thoughtless it is.
&gt;
&gt;    However, this post has struck a nerve. And yes, I’ve talked about some of this before but it bears repeating to make a point.
&gt;
&gt;    This week here in Melbourne, a young woman on her way home from the pub, walking a distance of less than 500 meters, disappeared from the street, only to be found a few days later buried in a shallow grave on a dirt road outside of the city. She had been raped and then murdered. 
&gt;
&gt;    What could she have done to have kept her assault simply a rape instead of her murder as well? Did she fail to remain calm? 
&gt;
&gt;    In 2008, after leaving my long term boyfriend and moving into my own apartment, I agreed to meet him one last time to talk. I made sure to be careful, as he’d been physically abusive in the past and I chose to meet him at a neutral location (a friend’s apartment). I knew better, but there were drugs involved, and at the time, I was in a bad place and risked common sense for a need. Bad choice? yes. Consent to horror? No.
&gt;
&gt;    He brought a friend to ‘teach me a lesson.’ My boyfriend sat on the sofa, doing the drugs I thought we were going to share over conversation, while his friend beat me unmercifully and raped me.  I did not fight. I did not struggle. I choked on my own blood, tried to keep breathing, focused on surviving, looked into my ex-boyfriend’s eyes and plead for help.
&gt;
&gt;    When M., the friend, was done with me, Colin took his turn.  He was high on coke and more violent than I’d ever seen him. I was barely conscious when the police kicked down the door. The two men went to jail, I was taken by ambulance to the hospital with a number of significant injuries. 
&gt;
&gt;    Colin had the audacity to say aloud to me as the gurney was being taken from the apartment, **“I hope you’re happy with what you’ve done here.”**
&gt;
&gt;    His message was perfectly clear, his going to jail, his doing what he and his friend had done to me was my fault. I was to blame. 
&gt;
&gt;    I know that had a tactical team of cops with rifles and shotguns not broken down that door and stopped what was happening that my rape would have turned into a murder no matter how calm I had or hadn’t remained.
&gt;
&gt;    Oh, but you’re overreacting you say. The t-shirt in the picture is meant as a joke. Fuck, you can’t take a joke? 
&gt;
&gt;    Nah, I can take  joke. I can laugh at shit that is inappropriate, off color, at times I have a chuckle when I really really shouldn’t. I’m not really that much of a buzz kill.
&gt;
&gt;    So why am I getting torqued over a stupid t-shirt that isn’t really supposed to literally be taken as about real rape, real murder?
&gt;
&gt;    Well, who is to say that?
&gt;
&gt;    Rape isn’t a joke. Murder even less so. There have been times when I think I would have been better served to have died on the living room floor of a friend’s apartment with my face bashed in and my ribs bashed, bleeding from the inside as well as outside. The baggage after surviving something like this is so very weighty. The end of the assault is just the beginning of whole other kind of fresh hell.
&gt;
&gt;    I hadn’t even gotten to the place in my life at that time that would turn out to be the worst, most traumatic experience that would come my way. That came a year later after Colin had been dead at his own hand so that he wouldn’t have to go back to prison.
&gt;
&gt;    Yeah, I know life sucks. Get over it. I’m not naive.
&gt;
&gt;    What gets me about this post is the likes and reblogs. The number of them that appear to be women who are reblogging this. I am gobsmacked.
&gt;
&gt;    It is sexist, sure, but I expect this from men. Not all men, but a fair number who have no earthly idea about the experience of abject fear and terror, of hanging on to every moment not knowing if it is soon to be your last. Of that secret hope that it would just end, be over with, that the murder would free you of your fear and your pain and the horror of what was happening.
&gt;
&gt;    But women? I really don’t understand that in the least. Someone kindly explain what is ‘likeable’ about his image. Seriously. Please do.
&gt;
&gt;    If anyone thinks that in addition to it being a woman’s responsibility to not get herself raped in the first place, that it is also her responsibility to not get herself murdered, well, here’s a thought for you - go fuck yourself.
&gt;
&gt;    And no, I’m not going to sit down and shut up. No, I’m not going to lighten up. No, I won’t fucking take a joke.
&gt;
&gt;    I will speak up for myself, the woman I was lying on the floor, half beaten to death before I was raped and beaten more afterward. I will speak up for the young woman in this god forsaken metropolis found in a shallow grave on the side of the road and for all the other myriad women who have prayed, begged, plead their way through a rape, hoping against all odds that it wouldn’t turn into a murder or possibly that they wished the murder would come quickly to save them from the awful reality of what they were enduring.

I was minding my own business; waiting for her. 

I am sure you could ask any woman on the street if they have experienced sexual harassment while going about their business in New York and hear a similar story. And my story, like so many others, started with a man intruding upon my space, while using sexually aggressive language that was neither asked for nor welcome.


**""Fuck off""**

  
This was my response. Concise, prefunctory, New York style language. Clear and to the point: I wanted nothing to do with this man. I was enjoying a perfectly lovely evening. The weather was gloomy, but I have always liked the rain. I had no issue waiting outside for my friend. I have every right to spend time in the public sphere without fear of harassment or violence. But this is not reality.

*""B-tch, I'm trying to give you a compliment""*

Being badgered, pestered and harassed is something no individual should be forced to experience. It's not a compliment. I do not know you. I have never seen you before. I do not find your slurred speech attractive and your attempts to describe my body using vulgar language is not a turn on. Which I told you. But apparently because I am a woman, you have the right to harass me and fly into a rage when I tell you your advances are not welcome. When I tell you that I do not want to talk to you, and to please leave me alone. 

You paced back and forth swearing. Onlookers stared. No one spoke for me. No one tried to get the attention of the police officer just inside the station. 

*""Who the fuck do you think you are, b-tch?""*

WHO AM I? I am a woman. I am a person. I am a human being, with rights, dignity, and autonomy. I am not something to be objectified. I am not something for you to project your own hatred towards women.

*""B-tch, if you ever talk back to me again, I will kill you""*

So many people like to believe that the feminist movement is over. Women can vote, they can work, we can demand control over our bodies and destinies. But the feminist movement is not over. Because occurances like mine are a daily experience for countless women. Because I can not try to go to the movies with a friend without having my life threatened. When I heard those words come out of your mouth -*""I will kill you,""* something in me snapped. In an instant, every single word I have ever read by Selma James, Judith Butler, Wendy Brown, Simone de Beauvoir, Catherine MacKinnon and so many others came over me in a rush. But the one question that blared in my mind was the words of oft-vilified Catherine MacKinnon: **""When will women be human? When?""**

**""There is a police officer in this station, and I am reporting you. Now.""**

I turned on my heel, deaf to your slurs, deaf to your shouts of *""what the fuck do you think you are doing""*. What am I doing? I am showing you that I am not an inanimate object. That I am not weak. That I am not something to be demeaned and intimidated. The police officer and I tried to find you. A gentleman on the street pointed us in the direction you went. This man saw everything, but did nothing. We searched for you, but you were gone. And then I let myself cry. In the middle of the crowded street outside Union Station, I silently felt hot tears run down my cheeks. I only nodded when the police officer said he wished he could find the guy. My mouth pursed in a hard line when he said that you were *""just an idiot""*. That you *""probably just had [your] ego bruised"".*

And in the back of my mind, the words of those feminist theorists that I so admire whispered to me that you were not just an idiot. You are the symptom of a society built upon the oppression of others. And the mentality of this police officer does nothing but normalize the casual attitude of violence against women. 

I still met up with my friend. I still got dinner with her, still went to the movies. You will not rob me of my dignity or my happiness. I am a survivor of sexual assault, and I have counseled and supported so many other women like me. I am the survivor of an abusive parent, under whose authority I at times genuinely believed I would die. I have survived so much and you will not break me. You will not rob me of my identity or autonomy. You do not have that power over me.
On my walk home, I ran through the scenario countless times. In my mind, I sized you up, wondering if I could have taken you in a fight if you had tried to attack me - because I do not believe anyone would have intervened. I am a 5'8"" 165 pound varsity crew athlete and the strength and conditioning coach at the college I recently graduated from did not fuck around. I am strong. But despite that strength, I can be harassed and threatened. My very life can be put on the line. 

I am strong, and I am intelligent. I have a college education. I have written over a hundred pages of feminist theory which have won me the respect of colleagues and awards from my department. I work at one of the most powerful lawfirms in the country, and YOU will not bring me down. You, with your drunk, slurred speech, with your dismissive attitude towards my identity as a human being.

You are all too common. I can walk down the street and find another man just like you, harassing another woman just like me. But there is an important difference between you and I. You live your life filled with hate towards women, under the belief that you can intimidate us, threaten us, demean us, and rob us of our dignity. And you are wrong. We will not let you take away from us what is most important: our identity. We are human. We have a voice. And it will not be silenced.

A lot of us are not even subscribed to SRSPrime because it gets so depressing, and really, this treehouse is a semi-safe space from all that regular reddit crap. If your submission of a horrible reddit comment gets deleted, this is why.

The notable exception to this rule is 2X (and other *supposedly* female-oriented subreddits), because it's helpful to talk to a community of actual non-men when your thread on 2X just got invaded by the friendly neighborhood mansplainers. 

If you find yourself wanting to highlight a particularly horrible reddit post or comment, put it on /r/ShitRedditSays. We will mock the redditry away. 

Not in the mood for a circlejerk, and want a proper discussion? Take it to /r/SRSDiscussion. We'll dissect and analyze and fuckin destroy the shit.

A man rolled down his window, explained to me that he's new to the area, and asked for directions. Although I was already put off and a bit alarmed by someone honking at me-- generally such behavior is followed by some form of harrassment-- I figure, hey, what the hell, I recently moved here myself, couldn't hurt to help someone out if I can.

I pointed him in the right direction, and he asked me if I lived in the area. I replied that I'd just moved here myself, and gave vague answers about my living situation ('couch-surfing,' 'not sure where I'm actually staying,' 'my living situation is in flux,' etc.) He gestured to a house up the street (the house at which I'm staying for the next month or so), told me he saw me walk out of there, and asked me if that's the place I'm staying in now. I shrugged uncomfortably and told him no. At this point, he started to idle his car and moved over to the passenger's seat. He started pestering me with increasingly specific questions about where I live and work, and I started to get a bit freaked out and explained to him that I needed to go or I was going to miss the bus. He offered me a ride and I declined. He then grabbed my shoulders and started pulling me into the car, telling me that ""he could help me get to work on time if I could help him get off."" I started to seriously panic, told him to let go of me, and he wouldn't. I tried to squirm away and he screamed at me, ""do you have a boyfriend, huh?"" I replied that I did, and he said, ""well, that explains why you're being such a cold-hearted c*nt."" He reached over with one hand to start to do something with his car, and I wrested myself away, ran as fast as I fucking could, and ducked into a side-alley where he couldn't drive.

I'm really shaken up over this. First of all, I felt like my boundaries were invaded in a million different ways, and it terrifies the hell out of me that this guy watched me walk out my house and could potentially figure out where I live. Second, even if I didn't have a boyfriend, why would that make this shitlord any more appealing to me? It's not as if I would want to be forced into a stranger's car if I was single! Third, and worst, the power dynamic between the two of us was really scary and intense, since he was in a vehicle-- he could have easily used his body to pull me in, or chase me down, or even hit me. I know that's not necessarily where this encounter would have gone, but it made me feel weak and really vulnerable. I was orally raped several years ago, and while I don't often think about it, things like this are really triggery for me-- my jaw was forcibly unhinged during the rape, and whenever I feel sexually vulnerable, the muscle memory makes it hurt all day. I've been really feeling it this afternoon.

1343238583.0,101,self.SRSWomen,x53yh,Fuck TwoX. So much. And fuck cultural appropriation. I'm so tired and so sad and so angry. ,145,44,214,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x53yh/fuck_twox_so_much_and_fuck_cultural_appropriation/,"http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x4fwu/can_we_talk_about_white_girls_and_cultural/  
This would be a rant but I'm so tired and angry I just want to cry. I didn't experience hardcore racism till I came to the US. And then I discovered that my culture is not respected as a culture. Chinese people aren't real people. They're Communists, they're prostitutes, they run the laundromat and the damn hibachi buffet place...they're not allowed to be actors, or poets, or teachers, or leaders--silly doryfishie, what were you thinking? 
So for five years I've been fighting the system and it feels like I'm fighting everything every minute of my life. I'm fighting for the right to walk alone unharassed. I'm defending my ability to speak English. I had to work twice as hard--at a WORLD RENOWNED UNIVERSITY--to be considered half as good as the white kids. White kids were late to class all the time, and nothing happened. I was late once because it was raining and I got SOAKED by a car, and I got told off like nobody's business--and I am 22 motherfucker, how dare you speak to me like a child.  
And then the cultural appropriation--I had LITERALLY never seen this. EVER. It was beyond shocking to me that people were so casually consuming other cultures without care, intellectual study or examination. My friends who genuinely took the time to read and learn about other cultures, sure. But the girls who dressed up as slutty geishas for Halloween, or slutty Pocahontas? Who used chopsticks to hold up their hair? I saw a girl using chopsticks once stick them both vertically into her rice while she put her hair up--with TWO MORE CHOPSTICKS. I was like...that's like me putting my hair up with a fork. Seriously, you look silly. And placing your chopsticks vertically down into your food is extremely rude and bad luck--it's how Chinese traditionally made offerings to the dead, it looks like incense sticks.  
This would be a longer rant but I'm so tired and so angry and so sad that I just want to cry. It feels like this country hates me some days. And the fact that I chose a black man for my life partner--we are SCREWED. There are people who have physically threatened us for walking on the street together, because they are that racist. And the white guys who keep flirting because they can't believe I picked a black guy over them. I just...ugh. I'm working so hard and it feels like that there are a lot of people who don't respect that and who don't respect minority cultures. I'm not saying you need to have white guilt. What I am saying is, please pick up a book or two, or hop on the Internet and make sure you don't get a Maori tattoo that is sacred to that culture. Or put chopsticks vertically in your food. And please, please don't reduce minority people to the goods of their culture. I am far more than dumplings, chopsticks, qipaos and Communism. I am far more than the outward markings of my culture. Please don't over simplify me and PLEASE don't hypersexualize me and other minority women. There are real problems to it.  (and also please don't demand that I educate you or else your racism is justified. It's not my job to enlighten you.)   
On the bright side I'm finally ragequitting TwoX. I was like, no I'll give it one more chance. I saw this thread and I was like FUCK IT. 

[edit: Ladies, I didn't realize--this is me being derpy today. I thought that just putting the link in the text post would keep the 'in other discussions' tab from popping up on the thread on TwoX. Someone in that thread has noticed it's here on SRS, and said that our discussion makes them want to join the KKK. Such wonderful people. Because wanting my culture to be respected and not shat on by shitlords apparently justifies the desire to commit violent acts against all minorities.]  
[edit 2: I actually am reading through the blog that so pissed off OP in the other thread. I have found: an awesome video of an Asian spoken word artist speaking out against unfair casting practices by La Jolla playhouse; numerous examples of people using racial slurs being called out; examples of minorities being whitewashed in the media; hypocrisy among liberal activists being called out. I get why OP didn't like that blog now. Who likes having examples of their mistakes being shoved in their face? Who among us actually has the guts to confess that they have been doing bigoted/ableist/supremacist (and so on) things? I know I hate admitting when I'm wrong but I frequently have to do so the more I learn about this world of ours. I can see why people don't wanna though. It's hard. And I'm not a saint. but my mum didn't raise a quitter. ] 

[edit 3: I woke up this morning to so many positive comments, messages and wonderful responses overall from the ladies of this subreddit. I can't tell you how much your support means to me, as is the wonderful conversation that we're having in this subreddit. I wish the OP would actually read this 'circlejerk'.

I was very much aware of the recording and made a pretty decent amount of money that night. 

Now I'm getting messages from people I thought were friends telling me how ""gross"" it is, how I won't be able to find a ""real job"" (I have **TWO**, but thanks...), how sad they are, how I am all sorts of gendered slurs, etc.

Seriously, what the fuck?!  Telling me that even though the media makes me hate myself it's ok because I have men regularly telling me I'm beautiful?  Implications here being that when dudes yell shit at me on the street/at parties/anywhere else they're actually engaging me as another human being instead of some fucking piece of dirt and also that I should derive ANY of my self-worth from what men think of me.

UGH I'M SO PISSED.  And all these dudes commenting saying that yeah, they wish women would tell them how great they look.  You assholes!  If you grew up thinking that 99% of your value came from the way you look, you probably wouldn't be begging to be catcalled.  And guys talking about the one time in their lives that a lady told them they look nice was the best fucking thing ever -- yeah, that's probably because she engaged you as a human, not as a fucking piece of meat, you shithead.

Not to mention, I didn't see any comments telling these douches off (maybe I didn't scroll down far enough, whatever).  And right now my inclination is to apologize for being so angry/ranty.. FUCK THAT.  I hate that shit too.  I should be pissed.  I'm just so goddamn sick of people (ESPECIALLY MEN) thinking that I only have value when men GIVE ME value.  So fucked.

1344668381.0,96,self.SRSWomen,y1fsn,Homemade pore strips? I tried 'em.,108,12,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/y1fsn/homemade_pore_strips_i_tried_em/,"So, for those of us in the Northern hemisphere, the end of summer is approaching, and if any of you have had to spend any significant time outside, you may have noticed that summer, frankly, is a shitty time to be a human being who has pores and also hormones and who also likes to spend time outside of a hermetically sealed box. 

As part of my personal change of season detox routine, I used to buy pore strips and use them not just on my nose, but also cut them up and use them on my chin and forehead (just above and between brows.) The amount of built-up makeup/dirt/sweat/other crud they pull away is always disgustingly satisfying, but DAMN are those things expensive. Made of unicorn skin &amp; printer ink expensive. 

This year, I decided to try the homemade version, because 1) we had a weirdly humid summer, and my pores are not happy about it and 2) I like spending money on beer more than I like spending it on cosmetics. I thought I'd share my procedure &amp; commentary below, for those here in SRSWomen who are interested. 

1. Gather your supplies. You'll need 1 tbsp of unflavored gelatin (like Knox), 2 tbsp of milk, 1 bowl, 1 spoon, and 1 large blunt instrument of your choice.

 2. Mix the unflavored gelatin and the milk thoroughly together in the bowl. Microwave for 15 seconds, then stir again until the consistency is even.

 3. Spread that shit all over your nose, chin, and anywhere else you feel needs it. Don't get it in your eyebrows, on your lips, or the soft skin right under your eyes. It's gonna smell funky, a bit like burnt marshmallows; just roll with it.

 4. Go do something else for 20-30 minutes. If your roommate/significant other/obnoxious family member sees you &amp; makes any comments about the color and consistency of the substance currently all over your face, brandish the blunt instrument at them. Avoid WAR FACE, however, as it may disrupt the drying process. 

 5. When you feel the edges of your strip/mask/etc starting to peel away, it's time to go into the bathroom. Look at yourself in the mirror. Make your WAR FACE to get the peeling going all along the edges. Now take a deep breath, grab a big chunk of peeled edge and rip that sucker right off.

 6. Cry. 

 7. Keep ripping.

 8. Cry some more.

 9. Did you put any on the soft skin right under your eyes? Cry EXTRA HARD. 

 10. Marvel at all the shit, seriously, oh my god how long has that crud been in there, oh my god it's EVERYWHERE, that will be sticking to the underside of your strip/mask/etc. If you don't see any gunk, look closer; all those tiny things that look like small whitish brown hairs are, in fact, tiny little dirt columns. That used to live on your face. Yup. 

 11. Scrub off all the last little bits you couldn't peel away with a damp washcloth. Marvel at your newly clean, soft skin, or just stare in mind-boggled horror at all the dirt some more. Up to you.

Sorry for lack of pictures, but as cool as this turned out, I don't want to run the risk of doxxing. =/ Obviously, don't do this every day, since some facial oil is healthy. But for a good deep cleanse that doesn't cost $12 (or more!), this is awesome and super cathartic.

Okay, cool, they're doin' their thing, I'm doin' mine. I will not initiate first contact. It does not need to happen. 

NO BUT WAIT. As a female, I don't get to enjoy solitude! Up comes Mr. Knit Penguin Hat, separating from his cardgame posse. I could have told him to go away, but hey he was just offering me peach rings. I like peach rings. 

Then he starts talking at me, asking me if I play certain video games, if I like Doctor Who, Skyrim, manga/One Piece (then acts really indignant and demands I read One Piece), etc. At some point he's like ""omg I need to show you a video,"" *takes* my laptop, goes to Youtube, and proceeds to show me clips of Dragonball Z and some of those shitty ""comedy"" videos that are a dime a dozen on Youtube. 

Oh yeah, and at some point he says, completely out of nowhere, ""I have a strange urge to bite you right now."" I say, ""...what?"" AND THEN HE FUCKING TAKES MY ARM AND LIGHTLY BITES IT. I don't know if this is his standard pick-up line or if he just bites all his casual acquaintances, but I don't think I'm unreasonable to think that's seriously crossing a boundary of personal space. At one point I scooted closer to the wall (I was sitting in a booth thing), he moved to where I was just sitting, and remarked ""this seat is warm."" I say ""...I'm sorry,"" and he's like ""no, I like it."" This is the point where I decide I definitely need to GTFO, so I say I need to leave to go ""explore the campus."" Of course I really didn't need to explore anything, but I would have felt ""mean"" just saying I wanted to leave. I maybe should have been more assertive, but honestly I think if I called him out on his creepiness, he might have gotten aggressive. It's not like the room wasn't crowded, but better safe than sorry, I guess? (Plus, I don't mean to sound ableist, but... I really think he could have had Asperger's, so I didn't want to be an asshole.)

Aaaaaaand now I'm just sitting between two walls, hiding before I can finally go into my next class. I washed my hands and the arm he bit, but I still feel vaguely icky. 

**TL;DR My first social experience (if you can call it that) at college was horrible. Now I'm just going to come every day in like sweatpants and a ponytail and not do my makeup and keep my head down and ignore fucking everyone.**


EDIT: I just realized something else he said that's a bit creepy in context with all the other weird shit... He asked me if I spoke any ""exotic languages.""

Today was a really fucking great day for me.

I just got back from the surgeon's office. They removed the dressings, took out the packing, removed the catheter, and taught me how to dilate. 

The surgeon verified that my clitoris is sensate. Uhm, sooooo, this was basically like a HUGE question mark before today. It was the major criteria by which I selected this surgeon. To feel today that it is indeed sensate means that along with everything else being kosher, I'm happy as fuck right now. 

It also doesn't look half bad tbh. I mean, it's bloody, swollen, and gross *now*, but I can tell... it's not gonna look any different from any other vagina after healing is done. I also have really good depth which means that sex should work out pretty well when the time comes.

It may not be all that long, as I'm still getting used to my fake nails and typing is kinda a pain in the ass.

Yesterday, I went grocery shopping. I was minding my own fucking business, when a shitlord decides to harass me. Now, first let me explain- down South where I live, you generally smile at strangers or occasionally say hi. I don't know why, you just do. And I'm fine with this, as I like being nice to people and not making their days shitty. So I'm walking to my car, and I smile at some random dude walking by me. And he smiles back, all is good, until he says ""Nice rack, b**ch"". I had to stop for a sec and think about if he actually just said that. I literally stopped in the middle of the parking lot, and I assume he took that for a good thing because he started approaching me, leering the whole time. Which is when I clearly said ""Go fuck yourself"" and practically ran to my car.

Now, my question is: What the everloving fuck does some random bro think while saying to a woman ""nice tits"". Not only is that completely unsolicited, it's also just.. I don't know. I don't have words for how incredibly skeezy and disgusting that is. And on top of it, it actually triggered me some. I actually had to fight off a panic attack because of this fucking shitlord just because he felt the need to objectify me in a goddamn Kroger parking lot.

And this, ladies, is why I'm an ardent feminist. Because men shouldn't feel like it's their god-given-right to judge my body based on their arbitrary rules. Because I want to feel like I can go outside without being accosted based on my physical attributes. Because I don't think **any woman** point blank should have to be objectified based on her body by some creepy bro.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_yoxhm,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/yoxhm/no_really_really_shitlord_tw_for_harassment/,

I name an abuse and I hear: ""Oh, it happens to men too."" That is not the equality we are struggling for. We could change our strategy and say: well, okay, we want equality; we'll stick something up the ass of a man every three minutes.

You've never heard that from the feminist movement, because for us equality has real dignity and importance--it's not some dumb word that can be twisted and made to look stupid as if it had no real meaning.

As a way of practicing equality, some vague idea about giving up power is useless. Some men have vague thoughts about a future in which men are going to give up power or an individual man is going to give up some kind of privilege that he has. That is not what equality means either.

Equality is a practice. It is an action. It is a way of life. It is a social practice. It is an economic practice. It is a sexual practice. It can't exist in a vacuum. You can't have it in your home if, when the people leave the home, he is in a world of his supremacy based on the existence of his cock and she is in a world of humiliation and degradation because she is perceived to be inferior and because her sexuality is a curse.

I get yelled at out of cars on a fairly regular basis. My usual response is to yell slurs at them and flip them off, they usually scarper. I'm just waiting for the day when this approach backfires.

1360463314.0,86,self.SRSWomen,1885pz,I had a hilarious encounter with a PUA last night,109,23,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1885pz/i_had_a_hilarious_encounter_with_a_pua_last_night/,"Well, I'm assuming that's what he was, it's the only explanation I have for his behavior. 

He was a fantastically douche-y hipster guy, so for narration purposes I'm going to refer to him as Douchenozzle. He was with two friends, who I'm going to refer as Turd #1 and Turd #2. 

Anyway, I went out to a local bar with three of my friends (let's call them C, R, and S). We were sitting at a table, enjoying our drinks and telling each other what we did over winter break, when Douchenozzle and his sidekicks sat at our table completely uninvited. Immediately I'm like ""Oh god, what now?"". This particular bar is pretty decent, but there are some characters in there, and I've had some weird experiences. But I don't think anything tops this.

As soon as he sat down, Douchenozzle announces ""My friend here bet me that I couldn't guess your cup sizes, so I wanted to prove him wrong.""

My friends and I were completely taken aback. I mean, who *says* that kind of thing? To total strangers? What?

I told Douchenozzle that, since he was apparently only here to talk about our breasts, we weren't all that interested in him. R told the guys that she didn't appreciate being objectified, and how would she like if we tried to guess all their penis sizes? At this, Turd #1 sat next to her and tried to put his arm around her. I couldn't believe that. R looked at him like he had about five heads and he sort of backed down. I got the feeling he and Turd #2 weren't entirely comfortable with the situation but were going along with Douchenozzle.

C asked Douchenozzle what exactly made him think that was a good line. He told her it ""wasn't a line"". What the fuck does he mean it's not a line? What, is he doing research on breast sizes for science or something? Please.

So we told them to leave again, and Douchenozzle told us no, he didn't really believe that we were offended, and that he really wanted to guess, and he figured S for a B-cup. I can't believe he had the audacity to say that! Of course we were offended! I mean, we were kind of laughing because he was so pathetic, but we were laughing *at* him, not with him. So we all started yelling at him, and people started standing around and watching, and Turd #1 and Turd #2 started telling him they should go. He still didn't want to leave, so I sort of pushed him away from me with my foot, and he looked at me like he was really offended and angry that I did that, but still didn't move. We were all still yelling, and he was still refusing to leave. I wanted to dump my drink on him, but it was kind of expensive, so I finally just took a handful of ice and started throwing it at him and his friends.

And they LEFT. Not just our table, the BAR. I felt so victorious. 

But yeah, I'm thinking he got this awful tactic from some pick up artist shit thing. It totally seemed like he was trying to make us feel bad by judging our breasts, so that we would be competing or something. I get the feeling he wanted to show off his awesome ""game"" to Turd #1 and Turd #2. They didn't seem all that comfortable with it, and he was doing most of the talking.

I mean I've seen the huge sidebar with all the other SRS subreddits, but for some odd reason it never occurred to me that those were like SRSWomen, that they were safe. I just thought they were ""other subreddits,"" and that they contain the same poopy content as most of Reddit. 

I kept hearing about ""The Fempire"" and I was like 'wait.. that must mean there's more, right?' 

Haha I dunno why it took me so long to figure it out, I was so focused on the singular awesomeness of SRSWomen. 

But anyway, I am SO HAPPY. I've been looking through the SRS subreddits and I haven't seen anything, as of yet, on their front pages thats racists or sexist or anything like that! And there are so many /swoon! SRSGaming?! Are you serious? :D 

I'm just super happy haha Thank you all for making my Reddit experience better. I mean, all my subreddits are just like r/adventuretime, r/foodporn, r/siberianhuskies, and stuff like that. I love all those, but this makes it all so much better.

Commenting on my appearance, calling me ""miss"" and ""little girl""... Oh well... it went okay but the comments really threw me of my game.

It's not the first time I experience these type of things in an official setting, but I still get upset when it happens when I've really prepared for something.

Up until this year, I'd only ever had monogamous relationships with men.

At the beginning of this year, however, I fell into a relationship with a woman who brings more to the table than any of my boyfriends ever did. Imagine having a best friend, one who loves you and whom you'd do anything for, whom you can hang out with for hours and never get sick of, and do all the fun stuff you love to do no matter how embarassingly girly or childish it is. Then imagine that friendship turns romantic and sexual, and the sex is awesome, and your interests match up just right, and suddenly you have all of the benefits both of a wonderful romance and a vastly satisfying friendship.

She's also introduced me to polyamory. I've been sex-positive for years and have no problem with non-monogamy in its many forms, but I'd never been in an ""open relationship"" before. I knew that I found the idea of group sex and her hooking up with other girls with or without me hot--and to my surprise, I found absolutely no feelings of jealousy stirring in me. 

Strangely, I did initially feel a little weird when she mentioned wanting to hook up with a guy. Last night, though, she was talking about a boy she'd been talking to on OKC and how much she wanted to get laid by him, and as I was laughing with her I realized that when I thought about her with other people, I felt only excitement and pleasure on her behalf. She's made me feel so special and loved that there's no room for jealousy.

There's none of the bullshit in this relationship that I experienced with cis guys. It feels tremendously comfortable, yet exciting, and I never feel pressured or marginalised or belittled the way I inevitably did by all of the SAWCSMs I'd encountered.

Could I really have found the perfect relationship for me? Could things really stay this good? I'm sticking around to find out, that's for damn sure.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_xe4xc,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/xe4xc/am_i_allowed_to_say_this_here_i_feel_like_im/,

I got on the site and clicked the option for live chat, and a Scarleteen volunteer chatted with me and helped me calm down. She discussed my options with me and made suggestions. She stayed on the chat with me until I was ready to take the next step then instructed me on how to make a post on the boards so that she could give me more in depth information.

Finally, FINALLY, we get it all down to the turn signals.  The left signal turns on, but doesn't flash, while the right signal flashes exactly how it's supposed to.  We're majorly concerned about this because we have a CA Highway Patrol inspection of the motorcycle tomorrow and we need those flashers to work.

Over the weekend, my SO and his mechanic buddy spent hours on it in a hot garage, trying to wire it differently every which way to get the signal to flash. They couldn't figure it out.  When they had had enough for the day, they called me over and I brought dinner.  They told me everything they did and that they couldn't get it to work.  ""Well, could it be the bulb?,"" I asked.

Their reaction was pretty much a patronizing pat on the head.  ""Silly girl, you just bring us the dinner. You've not a clue what you're talking about."" Dismissed. As per usual when you're a woman in a garage.

But, something told me I was right.  This wasn't my first time in a garage.  My dad is an ace mechanic and I've spent countless hours watching him working on bicycles, motorcycles etc, with him teaching me tidbits along the way.  I've always wondered if he would have taught me more if I had been a boy, but that's a story for another post.

So today I finally got the chance to be alone with the motorcycle and test my theory, and guess what? IT WAS THE FUCKING BULB.  So, I spent all day driving around to various parts stores tracking down the right bulb.  With the correct bulb, both turn signals flash properly.  Feels good, man.  Feels real good.

The first red flag came when I received the textbook. It's clearly self-published, and while I wouldn't normally have a problem with it, it's clear that he made up a publishing name and is publishing it via Amazon, pocketing most of the money from each sale. It's riddled with grammatical and typographic errors, and it's so disorganized and jumbled that reading it gave me a headache.

I could deal with that, I thought.

Then I started doing the assignments. For this class, we were required to type out notes from the book -- basically, we re-typed his book, then wrote a summary on it. There was no grading scale, just an arbitrary ""I liked it, A/B"" or ""I didn't like it, D/F"". Again, I thought this was a little weird, but I was getting good grades in the first half of the class, so I didn't challenge anything.

Then we start getting into the subject matter for real, and my jaw is constantly on the floor. The book is filled with statements like

* females dress sexually in order to attract males
* misandry is real, because Hallmark cards make fun of men
* ""[Female students] are so innocent of the politics behind the gender monologue in this country! A very few are canny enough to know that victimhood is a political resource, a resource for power. They believe what I show them and, in private, are adamant that it is too soon for these truths to be revealed.""

(There are more examples that I can post if anyone's interested.)

Combine that with the fact that this guy gave me a C in the class for not toeing his line and eating up his /r/mr bullshit while giving a football player (a star football player at a D-1 institution, might I add) an A for saying ""women don't always mean no"" in an academic paper, and you can possibly feel a bit of my rage.

If you hang out with me for more than a few minutes, you'll know that I am a feminist. I don't try to hide it and I'm doing my best not to flinch when people make fun of me for it (which is really hard, but I'm learning). 

Anyway, I was hanging out with a dude friend, and we were chatting about this that and the other thing, and he says something about men and women. I'm spacing out and only half paying attention to what he's saying, so I replied, ""I don't know what you mean by *that*."" Because I really didn't know what he meant by that because I wasn't paying attention.

And immediately, he exclaims, ""I was saying that women are better at x and than men! Women are *better at it,* OK? Gosh, I was just trying to have a conversation about gender with you!""

I snap out of spacing out and look at him and immediately start laughing. ""Wow, dude! What is your malfunction, man?""

""I'm trying my best to respect your feminism, OK? You don't need to be so aggressive about it!""

I'm still laughing. ""Dude, what the hell? I was not trying to call you out on any sort of sexist bullshit you said, I was completely not paying attention to what you were saying and I really *didn't understand what you meant by that.*. Holy shit, man, way to overreact!""

He softened at this and was like, ""Oh...really?""

I then spent the rest of our hang out time teasing him, saying stuff like, ""Gosh, men are so *sensitive.* They always make something out of nothing! You need to learn to not let the emotions get the better of you, man. No woman is ever going to want to be with someone so *irrational.*""

This has happened more than once since I started openly talking about feminism. Whenever the menz in my life get upset about ""feminism,"" THEY always bring the topic up FIRST. I'm usually just sitting there, minding my own business, playing Portal or whatever, and THEY come up to ME and THEY turn something completely innocuous I say into a ""feminist issue.""

So, my second day nannying, I started my period at their place and I sometimes get a little nauseous from it. I was in the middle of cooking breakfast for the child, and thought it would be best to inform the father (Single-dad) of my situation. He seemed to be understanding and said he would finish the breakfast, and said next time I can just pour some cereal if that happened again. About 9 hours later, he calls me and says I'm not a good fit for the position and asked for me to send in my invoice so I can get paid for the days I worked. I was flabbergasted.

So, now I'm job-searching once again. Any other SRSers have any ridiculous stories of being fired for being a women? 

Edit: Apparently, a lot of you think it was wrong of me to even *mention* I was on my period.

I'm a trans woman from Vancouver, BC, which is right on the border of Washington where my girlfriend's parents live. I have spent my first summer carrying around the incredible shame that is a pair of breasts and let me tell you, it sucked. I missed going topless last summer!

Therefore, I resolved to go outside topless this year. Fuggit! It's hot and I'm a feminist and body freedom double standards patriarchy grawr! And since it started getting warm out I've been doing just that, popping my shirt off when I'm outside and the sun is out. It's been really liberating to realize I can still do this! Some people definitely stare and sometimes I get a comment, but for the most part people seem to be making a effort to pretend everything's normal. I put a shirt on when I go into a restaurant or similar and nothing really happens.

Today we went Stateside to visit my girlfriend's parents and do some shopping. We parked in downtown Bellingham for lunch and walked a few minutes to a nice little Mexican place. I had taken my shirt off during the drive and didn't care enough to put it on, although I did pull on the tank top I had with me when we came inside. No one seemed to care except for the busker who loudly remarked that, ""Damn! We need more of that around here!""

A few minutes into our meal two police officers walked in. At first I watched them carelessly, assuming they were there on their lunch break until they came and sat down across from us. The conversation went something like this:

""Uh.. Hi. Are you eating with us?""

*""Were you walking around outside with your shirt off earlier?""*

""..Yeah?""

*""Did the staff ask you to put it back on?""*

""No, I put it on because it's cold in here.""

*""Okay, you can't walk around like that outside.""*

""Why not?""

*""It's offensive. We got a complaint from someone who saw you on the street.""*

""Am I allowed to kiss my girlfriend in public? What if someone complains?""

*""No, that's different.""*

""Oh. I'm legally male.""

*""..What.""*

""I'm transgender. I'm legally male. Does that change anything?""

*""Uh.. No, you still have to wear a shirt.""*

""So are guys not allowed to take their shirts off too?""

*""No, that's fine.""*

""What if I was a fat guy with big boobs? Some of my guy friends are bigger than I am. Would you tell them to put a shirt on?""

*""No, probably not.""*

""So I can't take my top off because what, I wear makeup?""

*""Pretty much.""*

""Are you sure about all of this?""

*""..I think so. Do you have any more questions?""*

""Nope!""

*""Okay, have a good day.""*

""You, too, Brian!"" (Thanks Brian!)

After we finished lunch and left the restaurant I stripped off my shirt and walked back to the car. No one looked twice, not even the busker.

As you may have realized, I am mtf. One of the big reasons I moved out of my moms place was, after my Dad died, her religious over-bearings became so much that she would have my brothers violently take my phone and computer away so that ""I couldn't sin"" by talking with people, possibly sexually over the Internet.

After I moved out, I finally accepted I was trans. My mom took it hard, so did my brothers, especially my twin. They have said to me at least once that I wouldn't be invited to family functions if I ""dressed like a woman."" 

I do want to see my family, and extended family on Christmas Eve. However, I know that if I show up dressed how I feel I am, there will most likely be a big blowout, and probably a huge argument, etc.

But, I feel as if it were no different than bringing a black fiancé home to a family of racists. It's the ""right thing to do"" even if it causes strife.

The only difference is that of course, like in every family, there are kids. I was always able to hang out and play with them and hold and swing them around, etc. However I feel like if I even attempt to do these things in my clothing, people will think very poor thoughts and may get angry, thinking I'm going to be a pervert or something.

What should I do? Should I turn my back and never look back, or should I confront my very Christian family head-on and spend 2-5 hours in a very uncomfortable, but maybe slightly rewarding environment?

*EDIT* 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CAUTION: TRIGGER WARNING BELOW.

This is the conversation so far in text with my mother. I will keep it updated if it even continues.

&gt;Me: I would like to come down to SD to see you guys, as I would have a few days off, however I would only be willing to come as myself. This includes Christmas Eve [with the extended family].

&gt;&gt;Mom: What do you mean?

&gt;Me: Please don't pretend you don't know. I mean everything.

&gt;&gt;Mom: You mean you would come here naked? or in your bathrobe? Well that would be absolutely unacceptable. Thank goodness we don't have any cats! [Its an ongoing joke that nakedness would ""scare the cat."" I think its from a tv show or something]

&gt;Me: I am not talking about nudism, I am talking about being a woman. Just as every other woman at the event would be allowed to wear makeup and a dress and the like, I would be allowed the same rights.

&gt;&gt;Mom: Do you have a penis - or did u cut it off?

&gt;Me: That is none of your business and completely unrelated. If you do not want me to show up as I am, I will not come in any other clothing.

&gt;&gt;Mom: U used to get mad @ me 4 circumcising you as a baby.

&gt;Me: And I still am, as I concern it a part of my clitoral hood. Please stop changing the subject. Also, as a side note, you know that transition surgery has nothing to do with cutting the penis off, but reforming it.

&gt;&gt;Mom: That's a BIG hood! Never saw one like DAT! U are kidding urself over that statement...it will never be the same enjoyment as it was. U know, if u butcher urself enough, u just may end up with no sex drive at all! After they alter ur testicles, too. Man!

Sigh.... Not even sure if its still worth trying. You can see how she throttles the conversion to her will, and doesn't even answer me directly, no matter how many times I try.

*Edit again*

&gt;Me: I can see this will get us nowhere. Have a good day mom.

&gt;&gt;Mom: I love you honey, and u have such a beautiful body - it is perfect in every way. The dr. told me when u were born that u were perfect, and he was right. OX

I really don't know what I am expecting to gain from this post if anything I'm just really pissed still and want to vent in a space where I won't be told I was asking for it, etc. So I was at a club last night because I had told my friends who were hosting a party there that I would watch the door for a couple of hours and take money for the cover charge. Right before I go to start doing so, a tourist jerk reaches up my skirt from behind and grabs my ass. I have had people grope me before, but never in such a blatant and violating way. I was shocked and horrified for a few seconds, and then started screaming at the guy that I was going to kill him. My only consolation was the cowardly look of fear on his face as I chased him out of the bar and down the street with a glass raised above my head. Luckily some friends grabbed me before I could rack up some assault charges for myself. 

I hate how easily he did it. I hate that I can't help still seeing that smug look on his face as he blew me a kiss after he did it. I wish there was an easy way I could get over it or at least calm myself down. I am not sure if telling myself that it could have been worse would be effective or just internalized misogyny.

You're following a really obvious (and super shitty) pattern. I've dealt with creatures like you for years and years. So your reactions are fully expected. And super boring. Yawn. They literally do nothing but highlight how shitty you are as a person. 

Secondly, don't fucking lie about ""just joking"". That's an incredibly tired response that people like you give all the fucking time. No, you weren't ""just joking"" because if I had responded positively, it suddenly wouldn't be a joke. It would have ""worked"" and you would be happy that your dick-comment got a positive reaction. Surprise, surprise. You're just annoyed (and hopefully, if you have any shame left, you'll also be embarrassed) that I called you out for being a socially backwards, weird-ass shithead. 

Thirdly, by trying to make it seem like I'm being ""up tight"" (it's actually spelled uptight, just so you know for future attempted shamings), you're attempting to put the blame back on me for my understandable reaction of dislike, as if my reaction is somehow out of place and that I should just accept your commentary on your genitals as an awesome occurrence. As if I should be *happy* that you chose to be a weird-ass fuckhead and tell me things about your genitals I had no interest knowing about. There's a definition for that kind of shitty social behavior: gaslighting. 

It's not weird for a person to be put off by what you said. It does not make me ""up tight"", to use your words. But, gaslighting does tell me that you don't respect women and think it's a-okay to try to shame them for having perfectly reasonable reactions to shitty people like you who say shitty things.

Hilariously, if you took even four seconds to read anything in my profile, you'd know that I'm anything but ""up tight"". I do, however, expect to be treated like a human being and not a barely cognizant fuck hole. Which you also would have known that if you read anything on my profile since I state quite clearly that I'm a fucking feminist. You obviously aren't one, but with how you chose to contact me, I could have guessed that immediately. 

So, if you truly think talking about your dick to a woman the second you stumble upon her profile is somehow desirable, then you need to move on. Preferably, for the sake of the other women on this site, you should just leave OkCupid entirely. Your presence is most likely not welcome and if we have one less gaslighting shitlord in the world as a whole, that would be great, too. 

In summary: I'm not interested in utterly clueless fuckwads like you.

Afterwards, he weakly responded with one more gaslighting attempt and I told him how pathetic he was being and that I was reporting and blocking him and expressed my firm desire that he gets banned. 

It was all great fun

----

So, in closing, call them the fuck out on their shittiness and then block/report them. One thing, though, if you report the message and the mods respond and delete it, you will lose the message from your inbox. I keep these for a future potential book, so I generally don't actually report the messages themselves until after I've saved it in a document or something first.

I had to post this because I saw an anti-false rape accusation poster (written as a snarky parody of an anti-rape poster) on r/mensrights, and I cried. I wanted to share my story with you.

I was raped about two years ago by my best friend's boyfriend's friend. We were at my bff's bf's house, and the two of them had disappeared to his bedroom for a bit. After I was sexually assaulted, my rapist asked me to go watch a movie with him with my bff and her in the other room. I said no, and he left while I spent the next four hours crying. To add insult to injury, he later accused me of ""leading him on."" Sorry, but my exact words that night were ""NO"" and ""STOP.""

Anyway, I told my best friend and her boyfriend the next day. Her boyfriend laughed in my face and said, ""bullshit."" He said, ""You just regret doing it. I know how girls are."" Even though he was an abusive lowlife, it still hurt. And my best friend said things like, ""Well I'm sure he didn't mean to."" A few months later, when I broke down crying about it, she admitted that she hadn't really believed me. Because of these kinds of reactions, I didn't tell anyone else. I felt like nobody would believe me.

I know that false rape accusations may happen on rare occasion. I had a friend who was falsely accused of rape when he was caught in his girlfriend's house late at night, and she didn't want to get in trouble with her parents. He was almost discharged from the military and spent the night in jail, but the girl admitted she was just scared of getting in trouble.

**But viewing all people who claim they have been raped as liars, assuming it didn't happen, those things are harmful.** Of course, we have a system of ""innocent until proven guilty"" for all accused criminals, but we cannot assume that a person claiming they have been raped is ""guilty until proven innocent"" of making false accusations.

This happened quite a while ago, so things have gotten much better. I have learned to cope with what happened, and I hope my story can help illustrate how rape culture can harm victims. 

Thanks for reading.

",100,27,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/133fu3/tw_rape_abuse_i_am_so_fucking_sick_of/,"I am in my late 20's, and have been married. The divorce was final in September of 2011 (separated since January 2010). I have been with my amazing boyfriend since October 2011. I am happy. I should be, as everything is going well. But then my shithead of an ex decides to contact me.

A little background. My ex and I married right out of college. It was sort of what I thought you were supposed to do, so when he proposed I accepted and assumed all my doubts would just go away. He was a pothead, and I assumed that he would grow out of it. He didn’t. He went to grad school, and I put off law school to support him. The work became too much for him (when his natural intelligence wasn’t enough to let him sail through), and he dropped out. We moved so I could go to law school, and he never got a job to support me. He chose instead to smoke pot he’d bought using my loan money, while letting the apartment fall into disrepair. So I started working to support us while I went through school. At the same time, he started lashing out at me. He felt I was making him look bad by taking so much onto myself. He fell into a kind of funk (though not what I would call close to depression). 

Then… he raped me. He will never admit that was what happened. But I had gotten into the habit of hiding my emotions, since any time I told him about them, he would throw a tantrum and make me feel guilty. So when it came to sex, I just gave in. This one time, I didn’t. He asked and asked, and I kept saying no. And at some point I went quiet. I didn’t want to keep saying no, since it felt mean at this point. But I still didn’t want to. So I froze. And he did it anyway, as though I’d said yes. I cried silently while he did it, but I was face down and assumed he hadn’t seen. I just wanted him to be happy. I assumed it was a misunderstanding.

A month later, I was studying for my first round of law school finals. I have never been so stressed IN MY LIFE. And he approached me, and asked me if I could be more supportive. I blew up. He had my money, my emotional support, my verbal support, and he even had unwilling access to my body. What else could he POSSIBLY bleed out of me? I demanded a separation on the spot.

Over the course of the separation/divorce process, some things came out. It turns out the rape was deliberate. He was bitter that I was “keeping things” from him (I was unhappy. If I tried to tell him, he’d throw a tantrum. So I stopped trying, but I was always a terrible liar. He knew something was up), distancing myself from him. He knew it. So when he penetrated me, and he knew I was upset, and I didn’t say anything, he got angry. The anger caused him to choose to lash out and play chicken with me. How long could he keep going before I said something? And if I didn’t say something, then he was justified in doing it, because he was punishing me for refusing to talk to him. **Rape** was my punishment for being a bad wife. 

When he told me, I was stunned. I collapsed. I had labored under the delusion that the rape had been due to miscommunication. But no, he deliberately hurt me in the worst way a husband can. And he did it because he wanted petty revenge. I called it what it was, for the first time: **rape.** As soon as I said the word, he flipped out. He had what I can only call a psychotic break. He collapsed on the floor, rolled around, cried and screamed. He demanded to know why I would torture him like this. Why I would hurt him by saying that. At the end of it, *I* was comforting *him*. My rapist. 

Things degenerated from there. As unbelievable as it may sound, it was not necessarily because of the rape, but because of how he handled it. After his tantrum, he never recovered. When we talked about it, he was in denial. If ever I brought it up, he dismissed what I felt. Told me I was being overly sensitive and unreasonable (while at the same time saying I was being an emotionless robot for refusing to talk to him). I was grasping at straws for reasons to break up. He told all of our friends what he had done (in his own, non-predatory words), spreading my humiliation. My being used as little more than an ATM with a vagina. A sex doll. A mutual friend supported his view, because she had been violently and repeatedly raped by her father as a child. Of COURSE she wouldn’t see what had happened with me as rape. It wasn’t even in the same ballpark. And I was incensed on her behalf. He used her horrific abuse to justify his own manipulation and abuse of me. 

I cut him off. I filed for divorce, blocked his email and phone, and moved. I hoped it would be done. I dated a bit, had some fun silly experiences, and then started dating my boyfriend, and he is amazing. He respects me like my husband never did. I love him, he loves me, and he does those little things that people do when they genuinely care. He brings me flowers when he senses I’m stressed or blue, or just because. If he’s at the store and sees that they have my favorite wine, which they usually don’t, he’ll pick it up for me without a second thought. He took me out to dinner last night just because he realized he hadn’t done so for about a month (which I hadn’t even noticed). For the first time in my life, I feel like my partner really loves me, like a real partner should. I’ve been deliriously happy for the last year. I’d totally forgotten about my ex-husband, except as some learning experience I’d had in the past.

Then two days ago my ex emailed me. He is literally DYING inside (his words, not mine) because I refuse to talk with him. He had an amazing job, and he stopped going because he couldn’t stop thinking about how much I had destroyed him. They fired him, and he lost his apartment. His lack of adulthood is my fault. I went through a year of couple’s therapy with him, but evidently that was not enough. 

In a few minutes, I’m transformed. I’m that same girl, lying on her stomach on the bed, stifling her sobs because she knows they will upset him. Keeping quiet when she is upset because he said she was crazy when she expressed her feelings. The girl who, in the shower after, treated bleeding wounds on her lips and vagina while suppressing sobs in order to spare his feelings. That same girl who kept quiet because whenever she said anything, he would throw a tantrum and make it all about him. I was back to being that girl who has a panic attack anytime a man touched her.  I went from badass ball-busting SRSter right back to the insecure, man-pleasing shell of a human that he tried to turn me into permanently. 

That night, when my boyfriend started getting affectionate, I flinched. I saw him as just another predator, scheming to use my vagina for his own needs without regards to how I felt.  I went numb. I started to go to my happy place (corgis and kittens, mostly).

Luckily it took VERY little for him to realize something was wrong. A single unenthusiastic expression. One head-turn away from the customary evening greeting kiss. He’s a good person. As soon as he caught wind, he shut it down. He flipped a switch in his head, and it was remarkable (to me, at least). Immediately things went from sexual to intimate and comforting. He was physically affectionate without pressure. Just comfort. He made dinner, snuggled me, placed my kitten on my other side, put a glass of my favorite wine in my hand, and put on my favorite show. He never pushed to know what was happening, he was content to just wait. It was an eye-opener. 

You see, he’d had a bad day. He was stressed, and cranky. But regardless, he put it aside. Some small part of me had been thinking I was a bad wife. That I owed my ex some explanation, some compassion. That I was the villain, and I was hurting him by not giving him what he wanted. But my new boyfriend showed me, without even meaning to, that a good partner doesn’t make you feel that way. That a relationship is about compromise, not about giving and giving until you have nothing left to give. You’re with someone because you love them and want them to be happy, and that the other person has the same motives. Every day I am grateful for what I have, and the man I am head over heels for. For what my boyfriend has shown me. For what I learned from my ex, and how I have grown as a person because of it. I DO deserve to be happy. To be with someone who sees me as an equal, and not as a replacement mother with benefits (Ew. That was gross just to type). 

So why am I posting this? Mostly I just wanted to get this out to people who might understand. My boyfriend tries, and because of that, I think he gets it more than most men would. But there’s a part of this kind of experience that only a woman can understand and relate to. So this is cathartic for me, and also an effort to reach out. If anyone reading this finds themself in a similar situation, I hope you will know you are not alone (being with a man who is “emotionally unstable” and uses his weakness to make you look overly harsh when you come down on him). You may not be in as outwardly a dire a situation as others, but you deserve respect like anyone else, and there is support out there for you. There is always a way out, and things can get better. Life can go on. If you need someone to talk to, please do not hesitate to contact me or a counselor, or just to vent to this sub. You deserve to have your story heard. 

**TLDR: Ex-husband raped and gaslighted me. 2 years later, he is still trying to manipulate me. But FUCK HIM. I am happy and now know what real love is.**

I joined /r/short because I'm a short person myself. A short woman. I was interested in seeing funny stories from fellow short people, pictures of other short people, short people doing awesome stuff.

I also figured there'd be some good discussions about heightism, something you don't see discussed a lot. 

Instead, it's basically non-stop, what-about-the-menz, short-women-have-it-so-much-better, ""women won't date me!1"" crying. The few times I've tried to jump in with my perspective on heightism, I get told I can't possibly understand because I'm a woman. Basically, because I get hit on, heightism in my professional, academic, and social life otherwise don't real or some shit like that. Almost every comment I've made in /r/short I've deleted because I got so much shit for them.

This morning, there is a thread from someone talking about a leg lengthening procedure where one of the comments to him is literally calling him brave and the only dissenting comments are careful to spare his feelings. The first part of the guy's reasoning is that women don't treat him well, and then culminates with the assertion that if you put a 5'5"" man next to a 6'0"" man you wonder if they're the same species. 

Maybe I am being too sensitive but I want to throw my fucking laptop out the fucking window. 

If a woman admits anywhere on Reddit that when she wakes up in the morning she doesn't look like Zooey fucking Deschanel and she's considering having some cosmetic surgery done, she's flooded with shitty comments calling her superficial, stupid, and any other number of slurs and put downs. Hell, without any prompting, our bodies as woman are subjected to and inundated with blatant judgment and condemnation. Your boobs are too big; they aren't big enough. Your thighs are too large; Not large enough. Your tummy's too toned, it looks like a man's; It's not toned enough, you're fat! Your feet are too large, your arms aren't thin enough, your face isn't ""naturally pretty enough"" and using makeup is ""cheating"", your butt is too flat, or it's too big. 

I get that I'm overreacting and being hypocritical, but it infuriates me that a man can talk about having his legs sawed off and re-attached to gain 3"" of height and be called ""brave"" for it, but if a woman admitted to even a nose job, reddit would figuratively tie her to a stake and start a fire. Fuck everything about that. I guess I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed and this thread in particular really made me feel pissy about the gender inequality on this website and in the wider world. I know I should be happy and supportive for someone doing what they want to their body to feel better about it. It just bothers me that women are demonized for it and men are praised for it, that when women do it ""for men"" they're demonized doubly hard (and when they say it isn't for men, they're called liars and ignored)... but when a man does it ""for women"", women are still demonized as the bad guys who pushed him to such extremes, meanwhile men are never held as culpable for the effect they collectively and socially have on women and their body image.

So I'm the type who stays in her room, I'm generally unsocial. I'm in a university house, so my apartment is one of many, with a shared kitchen and social area. Despite this, every time I go downstairs people are demanding that I come be social with them, which I really don't want to do. I understand their thinking and guess I appreciate the thought, but I am the type of girl who appreciates being alone. So I go downstairs to cook some dinner, I'm heating up some pasta sauce at the stove, and I'm fucking hungry, because I didn't dare go downstairs until I knew all the housemates were out of the kitchen and in the living room area down the hall.

Suddenly, gay dude J sneaks up behind me, puts his hands over my boobs and squeezes, saying ""honk! Guess who!"". I instantly feel embarrassed as fuck, and jump, spilling out my saucepan of tomato sauce, so half of it is on the side, and a little went onto my hand and burnt me a little.

I turn around I he's smirking at me, and says ""Whoa! Jumpy much?"". I'm too stunned to speak, so I start trying to clean up my mess on the counter, and start crying a little bit because I feel awful about wasting food my mother bought for me. Now instead of having sympathy for something HE caused, or, fuck I dunno, actually helping, he just says ""don't forget the bit that fell on the floor, clumsy girl!"". I do what he says, while he just stands there, then continue cooking with the small amount of pasta sauce I have left.

He then starts telling me that I had no reason to be so nervous. He says ""After all, I'm not into you girls!"". As if that justifies it.

I'm feeling nervous that I'm alone with him, so I quietly say ""Please just don't sneak up on me like that"". He literally fucking rolls his eyes. Then he starts talking about how I should be more social, and says that the only reason I'm so 'jumpy' is because I don't hang out and talk to them more, and that he was only trying to get me to 'loosen up'.

As if to rub in how 'okay' it is for him to touch me, he quickly reaches out and grabs my boob again, smirks and says ""HONK!!"" and then walks away laughing. After his little lecture, he leaves, and I finish cooking, and I can hear him and the other housemates laughing about that lonely girl in room 3 who just needs to open up. I head upstairs, feeling like crap, and I also find that my sauce was burnt while talking to him, so after eating it in my room I start to feel sick.

So now I'm not only fucking pissed off that he was grabbing me, but I'm scared that if he decides to grab at my crotch, and finds out I don't have a vagina, I'm going to be forcibly outed to my whole school, and likely be the target of a shitload of transphobia again. And he would think it is completely okay to grab at me in this manner, because he isn't 'into' us women.

Ok, may just pass it off as a nervous joke. Then his son was playing in the kitchen and sweeping up ""Oh your mam does that doesn't she son. Thats the womans job"". My face must have been a picture, and my ex who was there too was horrified. We couldn't even believe his blatantly misogny. 

THEN, we overheard him talking to the other 2 teachers and 2 female parents ""well men couldn't work in a nursery. Only women can do that. Men would be rubbish at it. You women are suited to this"". I felt like crying literally. I dont ever want my son to hear this utter crap. I feel sorry for the little boy who is going to grow up feeling he can't do stuff he wants because his dad doesn't approve, and then this horrible man. urgh.

At first my feminism is fine. Maybe my SO don't know much about it. Its fodder for lively intellectual debate, and their engagement and humility is genuinely endearing to me at first. It feels safe. My experiences I divulge, the ideas I have, they feel accepted. ""They're not trying to attack me. We're just talking. They're genuinely interested in just exchanging ideas.""

That feeling gets undermined after a while. I love to debate, I love to argue. I just don't like getting put on trial, my ideas and explanations turned around on me for the sake of entertaining their hypotheticals, to get me to betray my principals or my values, to confess to my ""true hatered for men,"" or to admit that I'm only angry about something *because* I'm a feminist. 

Talking stops being fun. My sense of trust in them in rocked. ""How could this happen?"" I think. I chose my words so carefully, I made sure my ideas weren't ""too radical"" or ""too mean"" or ""too something"" to make the debate suddenly turn so polarized and mean-spirited. I take all the responsibility. Surely its something *I* did (instead of them being insecure if they are unable to change my mind).

They start pulling away. I feel like a disease. If only if it weren't for this *one* thing, this one issue that came up between us, things wouldn't have gotten so shitty. I wouldn't feel them slowly abandoning me. I wouldn't feel like walking on eggshells in order to avoid being ""the feminist killjoy"" that ruins another evening (or relationship).

Its happened enough that sometimes I want to give up the whole thing. Dating feels like a fucking minefield and I'm so tired of getting blown up that either I just stop dating or I stop identifying as a feminist.

He thought Transformers 2 was a good movie. He insisted I read this comic book called ""Girls"" which, literally, no exaggeration, starts out with the protagonist going on a Nice Guys rant. Whenever we get together, all we do is disagree on nerdy shit. Our conversations are so shallow and superficial.

Similarly, he seems to think that nerdy shit is MY BIGGEST PASSION IN LIFE OMG when it's NOT and whenever I try to tell him otherwise, he seems to tune me out. I was trying to tell him something about marine biology (the biggest passion in my life, hands DOWN) and as soon as I finished talking, he changed the subject and started going off about George Lucas selling Star Wars to Disney. It literally took all of my power to not scream, ""OH MY GOD WHO THE HELL CARES."" And when I try to talk to him about how women are portrayed in mainstream media? Hahahaha. Ha. Hahaha. Might as well fucking talk to a god damn fucking wall.

I seriously cannot fucking believe this guy. God fucking dammit. And you know what he's going to do when I knock him back? He's going to become an even bigger martyr for his kin, his fellow friendzoned nice guys and I will be yet ANOTHER horrible woman who just goes for the jerks and the assholes.

You know what I really want to do? I really want to ask him why he likes me. Because I know he'll be like, ""It's because you're a geek and I never meet any geeky women like you"" and then I can call him out on all his bullshit.

1342488901.0,71,self.SRSWomen,woduz,"I know we've had enough with Tosh threads, but I lost it on facebook today. ",89,18,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/woduz/i_know_weve_had_enough_with_tosh_threads_but_i/,"So I have this friend. He's all around a good guy, but he can be extremely shitlordy if the moment strikes. He's smart, and good at debate, so he isn't called out very often. Unless I'm around. And today has been very shitty for me. I've been triggered a bunch and i've been crying the last hour. I open up my facebook to see this: 

&gt;My fellow feminists: being angry at Daniel Tosh for being Daniel Tosh is as stupid as blaming the tiger for acting like a tiger when it mauled Roy. Pay inequity is a much bigger issue than offensive jokes. He's an offensive comedian, it's what he does. Side with free speech.

LOLWTF. Disgusting. Fuck all this. Not on my news feed. So I say this, in my rage:

&gt;I'm too tired and depressed to go into why you're full of shit about this, ***, but I will sometime soon. You're being a terrible feminist. Free speech my ass.

And then this: 

&gt;I changed my mind. Here you go. This isn't about tosh, per se. Or the singular incidence. It's about rape culture and how it's totally okay, in ANY setting under ANY circumstance to side with someone or be the person who would contribute to the degradation of women and girls on the most fundamental level. It's wrong every time he does it, any time anyone jokes about violence toward women. The fact that this is supposed to go un called out is the reason why women do not report rape or sexual abuse. Because it's not a REAL crime, it's a joke. It's the reason why it's not taken seriously. WE, as people in society, have the power to say ""NO, that is not funny. That is disgusting. What is wrong with you?"" But no. People who call themselves feminists fucking DECRY those complaints, and back the oppressor. It's about power. He has the power to make a ""free speech"" or ""comedy"" appeal, people say ""hey, that's fucked up. Maybe there are bigger implications then just one jackass doing a comedy bit here. We should look into this"". ONE OF THESE IS CONSISTENTLY CHAMPIONED. GUESS WHICH IT IS. The more these jokes fly around, and the more supposed ""feminists"" come to their rescue, the easier it is to brush off actual incidences of rape, or for women to not take themselves seriously when it happens to them.
I would say that it is a MORE important issue then equal pay. You just think equal pay is more important because it's something that can be litigated and measured easily with laws. I would rather have rape and the degredation of womens' bodies be the forefront of the feminist effort over fucking equal pay any day. Oh, and fuck you for assuming YOU have any fucking clue about what is the most important issue for women. That is not being an ally, it's being a fucking sexist. You think you know better then any woman about womens issues. Why is that? I'm your friend. This is why I point this out. You said a shitty thing and you should feel shitty about it.

&gt;There is a huge difference between saying ""we should JAIL tosh for what he says"" and bringing valid criticisms to the table about what he says. You are part of the oppressive system which promotes sexual violence when you say ""oh, it's okay. it's free speech. stop whining about it. there are more important things."" You are helping them win. Great job.

&gt;And whats going to happen now is you're going to get all mansplainy, and defensive, and pick apart everything I just said. Because ""WAAAAHHHHH"". Not in the mood today.


One of his friends went and liked all of my posts on the thread. No response yet. And frankly, I don't care. I don't know why I'm posting this here. It's definitely NOT the most eloquent or pointed writing I can do, or on the subject. In fact, it's just an emotional vomit upon his timeline. But I've done little else today besides feel bad, smoke cigarettes and have really upsetting phone conversations. So this is sort of like putting a paper on the fridge. My A for effort. 

EDIT: I was right. Some of the greatest and most egregious mansplaining possible. He even mansplained about mansplaining! It's so meta. 

Him:
&gt;You want to ignore inconvenient facts because they undermine your broader goal. Your refusal to consider the individual fact pattern, however, undermines even that much

Me:
&gt;what facts? Not that I actually give a fuck, because you're wrong, and dangerously so. I really can't abide by people siding with Tosh on this issue. For any reason. Your mansplaining is invalid.

Him:
&gt; Furthermore, the idea that I'm relegated to ""ally"" rather than being an actual feminist assumes that 1) I don't have a stake in gender equity and 2) that I can't opine on a particular subject because I'm a man, despite my education in American politics and jurisprudence, is sexist on its face. It reveals a demon that the next wave must confront - the idea that any one sex or gender or orientation OWNS feminism. 

Second, this isn't even about rape itself- it's about the right to joke about the taboo. Framing in in the context of rape rather than that creates an inherently loaded emotional element where none before was necessary. I reject it, unless you can't demonstrate to me that rape jokes have a causal relationship rape. 

&gt;‎""mansplaining"" is a horrible, sexist thing to say, especially to another feminist. Shit like that alienates and hurts feminism, and YOU should be ashamed for it.

Me:
&gt;""mansplaining"" is when a man tries to explain away misogyny to women. It's not sexist to call it out (Link to article ""Look, Kitten, I Am Too A Feminist! Fauxminism and Men"") 

Him:
&gt;Beating up on the wrong person undermines the cause. We have a limited amount of political capital, and I'd rather use it against a Limbaugh or a Santorum or a Romney or, you know, someone who actually fucking MATTERS. You use up all your ammunition on Tosh, and you'll have less for Romney. You could have actually ACCoMPlISHED something in dinging the GOP for opposing equal pay, or, ya know, any of the other things that they've done on their ACTUAL war on women's rights that would ACTUALLy effect an election. But no, a comedian said something offensive, do clearly I'm a bad feminist and who's opinion is invalid because of my silly y chromosome. So youre attacking sexism by... Being sexist? Good job, greennoodlesoup. 

Me: 
&gt;Did you read the article? and here, this is from the wiki on Rape Culture: ""According to the rape culture theory, acts of sexism are commonly employed to validate and rationalize normative misogynistic practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being. An example would be a female rape victim being blamed for her being raped because of how she dressed or acted. In rape culture, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as a continuum in a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.[23]""

&gt;LOL @ me being ""sexist""

EDIT #2. After leaving the computer to go have a nice dinner at a nice greek restaurant with my nice nonshitlord SO, I come back to this. (there were other comments back and forth before this, but I'll spare you. It's just repetitious and annoying):
Him: 
&gt;What you are doing is judging my arguments not by their own merit, but by the sex of the person who is making them, and that is textbook sexism. And for the record, youre not calling shit out, youre just being a jerk who can't properly formulate an argument without resorting to ad homonyms.

So I respond: 

Me: 
&gt;**You're right. If you were a woman I would have been much harsher. Lets be clear about this. I judged what you said because it was a horrible, insensitive, dismissive thing to say. The fact that you are a man, who also calls himself a feminist, took it to another level. You got feminism WRONG. You got gender politics WRONG. Rule #1 in working in advocacy for marginalized people in which you are not a member: Shut your damn mouth and listen. Marginalized people are marginalized enough without the dominant culture (which is varying depending on where you are. I would be the one shutting the fuck right up in a trans space, or even in people of color spaces *because I am mistaken for white most of the time and enjoy white privilege even though I am technically a POC*) coming on in with your intro to feminist studies know-how and tell them how to handle their own oppression. If you don't, when you get shown the door, DO NOT PRESUME to say that you are being oppressed by them, if you do, expect a boot in your ass. Why don't you go to your nearest third wave feminist discussion group and see how they handle it. Boots would be kind. Your argument on it's own merits is horrendous. Don't pretend like I'm JUST attacking you for being a man. Though it certainly doesn't help. And here. Read this. Studies linked within article. Because we all know, no oppression is legit unless some asshole at UCLA or Stanford or whereeverthefuck does a study on it. *EYEROLLFOREVER* http://oforganon.tumblr.com/post/11150747104/to-all-those-men-who-dont-think-the-rape-jokes-are-a**

Let's compose a group letter with our complaints, shall we? 
Then we will all band together to UPVOTE it enough to get it to the front page.

LIST OF COMPLAINTS:

* Internalized Misogyny
* Total tolerance policy for MRAs
* No moderation 
* Constant derailing of threads and abusive posts by other members
* General community that supports, promotes and upvotes principles that are harmful to feminism 
* Serious consideration of misandry as a thing

SUGGESTED HEADING FOR 2XC COMPLAINT:

* The internalized Misogyny here is astounding and I'm leaving. I suggest you all consider your behavior.

Why are so many trans women drawn toward the anti-feminist ""women oppress men"" bullshit?? Even before I transitioned, I could see so plainly that this isn't even close to true; while my male privilege certainly blinded me to the full extent of misogyny, I certainly never once thought that women were the ones coming out on top. While the patriarchy hates on me for being a woman with a trans history, my own queer community contains trans-exterminationist radical fauxmenists who call me a male oppressor trying to invade lesbian spaces, and then members of my own *trans* community buy into the MRM nonsense and try to argue about how women are so much better off and ""what about teh menz!!??"" etc., etc.

Why the fuck don't you actually take a step out of your little privilege hole and actually look at what the fuck is going on in society at large?? Look at how the gender class you identify with is treated in reality and quit throwing around inaccurate statistics you clearly don't even understand. Today I had one trans feMRA tell me that men's shorter lifespans were the result of how oppressed they are; when I mentioned that it was actually because testosterone has damaging health affects *she told me that was a myth*, blatantly ignoring objective, scientific facts. You're a fucking woman, why don't you try and show a little solidarity with the rest of us rather than living in special snowflake land???

I understand that feminism's spotty history when it comes to trans stuff alienates a lot of trans women from the movement; but sometimes when I encounter these disingenuous anti-feminists within my own community, part of me starts to think ""so this is why TERFs hate us so much; maybe they're right about us being polluted by male privilege""; it's not a part of me I like to listen to, but it's there.

She would always talk openly about any questions I had, when I got my period at 12, I knew exactly what was going on and it was the least dramatic thing ever. We would have long discussions on our differing body types, the differences in our period schedules, and the fact that we both have a slightly tilted uterus. When she got a prolapsed bladder a few years ago (my brother and I were both pushing 10lbs when we were born), she discussed the frequency and symptoms of it so I would know in the future (the majority of women have no idea what's going on because no one ever talks about it). Before I went to college she suggested I get on birth control and took me to see her OBGYN, explaining exactly what would happen on the drive over. Just last night I walked into her bedroom and announced ""Mom, my vagina's uncomfortably itchy, I think the antibiotics for my strep throat gave me a yeast infection."" And her response was ""That happens like every time I'm on antibiotics! I keep a Monostat kit around just in case, use that and if it doesn't clear up we'll make an appointment to check if you have BV or anything."" And then we talked about yeast infections and UTIs for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile my stepmom almost made my stepsister cry last week because my stepsister wants to start birth control and my stepmom was utterly unsupportive of it. I ended up pulling my stepsister out of the room and giving her the breakdown of possible side effects, that it doesn't make her a s***, everything related to it myself.

A few posts gave me the idea. But, this isn't a case of me ""figuring"" anything out, but finally being able to correctly articulate it.

If you look around Reddit you'll instantly be able to glean one thing from any conversation where a bunch of assholes are dogging on women and minorities and lgbtqia people. That theme is that holding [white] men accountable for anything is bigotry. I put the white in brackets because every other man of every other race can obviously be held accountable. LGBTQIA men/male-identified people are also always held accountable.

But straight white cis-men? Nope. And it's not just something they do and a nice display of comically absurd hubris, but I think shirking accountability as a white man might be the root of a shitload of America's social problems.

Sounds so obvious, right?

[Take the core of this thread for instance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/149er4/rant_why_do_some_men_have_to_whine_so_hard_about/) A lot of straight white dudes have a bad habit of blaming *everybody else* for their problems (while hypocritically claiming that's what everybody but straight white dudes do). They can't get a date because *feeeemalez*, or she's dating a black guy (ergo, all black people are awful) or some ""jerk"". Or *she's* the shallow one.

Or, race. Straight white guys on Reddit (a helluva lot of them) love dropping their pants and shitting on non-white people/women. They say the cause of all problems are people who aren't white/women. I even heard recently that crime and violence are a ""black"" phenomenon.
...Which is fucking hysterical. White people are more likely to have/sell/use drugs, are the lions' share of people reported as rapists and child molestors and more. Tell them this and they lose their minds.

Suddenly, it isn't *fair*. You're a *bigot*. You're a *racist* 

*Most people don't even know that the biggest terrorist threat to the first world right now comes from extreme right wing fringe groups and white supremacists.* Yet who is the fingered pointed at? Whoever they are...they're brown.

Someone got raped? Maybe he just...

A creep? Maybe he just...

""There's more to this story""

""He's just socially awkward""

""Maybe he has a brain tumor or a concussion""

""He can't help his urges to rape children.""

""Maybe he misunderstood the situation""

""Rape hysteria"" (Only because the rock solid rape statistics implicate men as 98% of all rapists, most of them shockingly reported as white. Accountability? Hell no! Just blame Feminists! A black man is accused of raping someone? ""Fucking N-----rs!!"")


....Let's all keep in mind how a MoC doesn't get any of these kneejerk excuses.

Let's not forget all the white men who have committed crimes only to have suspect sketch artists draw a black man *even if a white man has been plainly described to them.*



Am I wrong or are SAWSCMs fucking hella allergic to any form of accountability?

**This is a very white, straight and male phenomenon.**

Hello again, my gorgeous SRSters! So, I figured I would give you all an update about what I've been doing since the last time I posted. The newspaper published my letter, and the editor even wrote to me in the paper saying that she believed in what I was saying, and that the paper would try and support me in any way I can. A few days ago I went to my campus's gender equality/ sexual education/ center to talk to them about some of the ideas that I had, and they offered me a job right on the spot! So, as of right now, I'm coordinating a new advertising campaign to bring awareness of both rape on campus and the services the campus has available, and I'm working on bringing together both our center, the rape crisis center and the women's advocates club and the president of the university so we can all work on a unified message for the campus.

Lately, I have been getting lots of comments such as ""no way is that you!"", ""you're much prettier in your ID pic"" or ""look at you, all done up in your photo! I wouldn't have a clue that was you"". 

It is a decent picture of me (taken about 18 months ago), but it is actually what I look like when I have my makeup and hair done and shit, have slept more than 3 hours etc. I've been suffering from depression of late so have gained quite a lot of weight (although it mostly goes to my ass) and I guess I have ""let myself go"" in the eyes of the menz. 

I work from home so don't need to wear makeup for professional reasons, usually have my hair in a messy bun and wear cosy stuff like sweatpants. Fuck me, right? I guess I should I have to spend ages dolling myself up just so I won't get insulted by strange men? 

Previously, I'd always put a full face of makeup on before going anywhere but it just seems like a waste of time now, even if I had the energy for it. I joined the fempire late, but not too late. I am recovering from the depression, have a very supportive boyfriend who loves me for me but I guess I should conform to gender norms just to pick up a package, right? I'll dress up when *I* want to. 

They say it really chirpily too, like they genuinely don't know how offensive their comments are. In my culture, this is referred to as banter and it's kind of ingrained in you from am early age that people are just ""having a laugh"". 

And my reaction? I go along with the banter, and jokingly say something like ""sure, that's old age for ya!"" I'm 32 and look young for my age. I am so pissed off at myself that I am too much of a coward to tell them how offensive this shit is, so I just shirk back to my car and try not to cry. Next time, it's war.

Even that you finally got that tiny piece of apple peel free from between your teeth (because damn, that is satisfying).

Here's my good news (smallest to largest):  My house and classroom are moving in a much more minimalist direction and it's very liberating.  I've been eating well and working out.  I've been visiting a retirement home with my doggies and everyone (dags included) loves it.  I have fantastic classes this year.  I just found out that [a professor from my family's small town in Greece is preserving our nearly extinct language, which is a combo of Hebrew and Spanish called ""Ladino""](http://dailyuw.com/news/2012/aug/07/uw-professor-preserves-endangered-ladino-language/)  My grandfather is the only one who I've ever met who speaks it and he's very elderly.

**And the best news:  I just found out I passed the first two tests needed to become a science teacher!**  I'll still mostly be teaching English, and I just studied my butt off for the tests over a few weeks because I have no background in science, but I ended up loving it!  I'm sort of obsessed with all things science.  And now I can't get laid off due to budget cuts because science teachers are in higher demand than English.  So happy day all around!

For example, pornography that's depicted deliberately to make it look as if the woman isn't enjoying it. I'm a lesbian but I just can't get into one-way sexual gratification from women. Am I being old-fashioned because I see sexual gratification as something only possible from it going both ways? I understand the desire behind BDSM but with something like creepshots and plenty of other examples, it seems to be the norm rather than a fetishisation.

Edit: I mean this post with sincerity, it may be badly worded.

I see a marked difference in how at least I find the non-consensualism involved in this kind of thing a complete turn-off, but it doesn't affect the apparent vast majority of men.

First off, I am a furry. I make and wear fursuits. It's a cool thing to do and really fun. For me it is not a sexy thing and I do not like being approached sexually while in costume. 

Today I woke up to find that a man who sexually harassed me while in a fursuit costume (he made comments like ""I'm gonna lift your skirt and look at your pantsu!"" and grabbed my boob at a photo-op) AND cornered me / hit on me multiple times has found out my furry identity at large (the costume is not of my main furry character). Since I'm not a well-known fursuiter I didn't think it would happen, but it was a chance anyway (hey, am I not supposed to post pictures of my creations for fear of being recognized?). Now he knows who I am in real life and in furry life.

How should I respond? ""You're a creep"" or a *silent block* or ""don't ever try to lift my skirt again?""

This guy is also a really horrible person, a super shitlord who is totally misogynistic, transphobic, racist, the works. And the worst part is that he's a convention ""frequent flier"" and goes to every single one I attend. 

Uff. I feel in a bad spot and even more sick to my stomach.

EDIT:

I'm writing a letter to con ops of the convention I am going to go to in a few days about the incident. I have seen him there before and I believe he will be there again. 

EDIT 2:

Con ops can't do anything unless something happens at the con. I'll be extra vigilant (sux) especially since it turns out he grabbed a friend's ass. I can't get a restraining order right now. 

EDIT 3:

He will be at the convention. I told him on a website comment page that I did not appreciate his remarks about my skirt and that I would not like to have contact with him. He messaged me saying that I shouldn't call him out in public...I messaged him saying that I do not want any contact with him and that I am keeping records for precedent.

So, I've been having this intense pain in my lower abdomen and pelvic area for over a month now.  When it started, I thought it was just cramps; they were worse than any cramps I'd ever had in my life and they were mostly on one side, but I thought it was just a wacky side effect of my script lapsing and the resulting being off birth control for a while.  Only, it lasted way longer than cramps had any right to.  Finally, two weeks in or so, I went to the doctor.

Turns out, I have a rather large (10 cm) complex cyst on my ovary.  I didn't even know that was a thing.  Seriously, no one ever told me that was a thing.  In fact, I had spent the week between when the doctor found a mass in my side and when they could finally get me in for an ultrasound (transvaginal; if you've never had one, they're awkward and uncomfortable as hell) convincing myself I was dying of ovarian cancer like my grandmother had.  After I was diagnosed, though, I started hearing stories of acquaintances and family members who had one.  I was astounded that there was this thing that could happen that never, ever got mentioned to me in my life.  And I can't help but feel like that's a little fucked up.

Now, I'm waiting for to find out if I need surgery or not (most likely yes), and I'm having a hard time telling friends why I spend a lot of time in bed and why it hurts when I laugh or bend over or sit down or breathe.  I originally was honest and was like, ""Yeah, I have a cyst on my ovary that's giving me a lot of issues,"" but they were grossed out.  So, even though I know it's the last thing I should do, I'm leaving out the word ovary in my conversations about it.  It's just ""a cyst in my lower abdomen.""  And I'm perpetuating our sucky reactions to conditions of the ladybits.

I can't help but feel guilty, but at the same time, I can't help but feel pissed.  What the hell?  If I had known, maybe I could have caught this before surgery was necessary.  And now I can't talk about it because it's ""icky.""  Is there anything women can do about this?  Am I a terrible person for not standing up?  Proverbially, at least; my ovaries hurt to much to stand.

Even though I initiated it, it was really sucky and painful for me. I really cared about my ex, and hurting him was (and still is) difficult for me to deal with.

To help ease the pain, I saw a friend the other night. He and I have been friends for a while now. I moved to this city about two years ago, and he and I have been friends for about a year and a half. He's actually one of the first friends I've made since moving here.

And, well...turns out he's a Nice Guy.

When I was telling him about my break up with my ex, he basically cut me off and started telling me about how everyone always treats him like a therapist and he can't even count how many times he's had to comfort someone he had feelings for and why doesn't anyone ever see him as more than a friend? He's a nice guy. He's a *nice guy,* dammit. He's done so much nice stuff for me, and I repay him by dumping all my problems on him? After *all the nice things* he's done for me?

Then he started harping on some mutual friends of ours who are very popular in our social circle. ""Girls are falling all over themselves to be with them. What makes them so special? I try to be like them and no one even spares me a passing glance.""

Why are THEY so popular? Because they're LEGIT nice guys. Because I can go with them when I'm feeling exposed and vulnerable, and they'll sit with me and hug me and hold my hand and stay with me until I feel better. They're sweet, thoughtful, easy to talk to, and don't see the women in their life as potential fuck buddies. They see them as FRIENDS. They don't have ""girls falling over themselves to be with them."" They have a tight-knit group of friends that they care for and who care about them.

And he isn't actually like them. Our mutual friends like nerdy things and do martial arts, so my friend started doing martial arts and liking nerdy things, too. That's about all the changes he's done to his personality, as near as I can tell. He's still a jack ass on the inside.

It just made me feel so shitty. This guy never wanted to be my friend, he just wanted to get into my pants. He made it seem like I was a such terrible person for breaking his heart. As if I don't feel horrible enough for hurting my ex-boyfriend.

**UPDATE: Received a response from the university, see my comment**


Here is the email I finally sent to the Undergraduate dean of a university that I want to remain anonymous.

RAPE CULTURE IS REAL. 

""Hello,

I am almost 5 years late reporting this story. This is the story of when I came to visit **** University as a prospective student doing an overnight stay. What happened during the course of this stay caused me to decide to not apply to **** University ED like I had originally planned, and apply to **** instead. I do not personally identify what happened as rape but many people have labeled that themselves when I told them.

I do not want to get anyone in trouble for this so I am omitting names. But I don't want something like this to happen to another **** prospective student ever again.

I was 17 years old, a senior in high school, and very excited about **** University and to apply ED in Fall 2007. My parents arranged an overnight stay for me, I believe through Admissions. My hosting student didn't seem too interested in talking to me or the other (female) pre-frosh, and got her sorority sister to take us out instead (who I will call SS). I recall SS calling up some fraternity guys and I distinctly remember her saying that ""[they were] going to love [her]"" because she had two pre-frosh with her.

She took us to a fraternity. I had been tipsy before but never super drunk. We played beer pong with the frat boys. I kept thinking I should stop but they kept telling me to play again and again and again. I had never been that drunk before. I wanted the college students to think I was cool. So I kept drinking and drinking. I was so drunk that I could barely stand up. I had never been that drunk in my life and I only remember pieces of the night.

SS called me over and said that I was going to go up to FG's room (FG = fraternity guy, omitting names). FG was a junior, like SS. I didn't understand what was going on so I went upstairs. I didn't understand that she had told me to go up there so that FG and I would hook up. I hadn't spoken to FG the entire night and didn't know him at all. I don't remember what happened exactly but I remember giving FG oral sex.

I woke up the next morning, still drunk and very shaken, on the couch in his room. He drove me back to SS. I met the other pre-frosh again. She had the darkest hickies I had ever seen, all over her neck. She was upset because she didn't know how she was going to hide them from her boyfriend. I had drank so much that I was still drunk when I went to an engineering lecture, and didn't feel comfortable talking to the professor as a result.

I panicked later in the day when I realized I had a huge, black bruise, about the size of a softball, on my thigh. I was already freaked out because I didn't remember enough about my hook up with FG to know if we had had unprotected sex. I facebook messaged him asking if we had had sex and also did he know how I got this huge bruise.

He responded that we hadn't had sex, and that I had probably gotten the bruise because I had fallen out of the top bunk in his room. He said he was worried at first that I had a concussion but that I stumbled onto his couch and passed out so he figured it was okay. I don't remember any of this to this day so I guess I have to trust him on it.

I was so disturbed by this experience that I decided to apply to **** University instead. I didn't think that something like this would happen at **** at the time. I blamed myself the next day for drinking too much and for going up to FG's room. I refused to tell my parents why I changed schools I was applying to and the full story of how I got the bruise. But in my time at **** University (I graduated in May) I learned about rape culture and how the behavior of students on a campus can make rape more acceptable.

I still don't call what happened to me rape, but others have. I know that I was too drunk to walk straight, let alone to consent to sexual activity. I have no idea how intoxicated SS was when she whored me out to FG, or how drunk FG was when he had an underage girl performing oral sex on him. I do know that dozens of people were present as two high school girls were encouraged to drink more and more and more.

Thanks for reading, I thought someone should know my story. Many people blame me in these circumstances but one thing you should know is that high school students don't want to come off as uncool to the college students they are hanging out with on such visits. They will not always put their own best interests at heart. I shouldn't have drank so much but honestly I had never drank enough alcohol to understand what would happen. I wish someone had told me that it was okay to stop, to take a break, that I didn't have to go up to FG's room with him. I wish FG had realized I was too drunk to be able to consent to what happened, and that I remembered the night better to know how I really got that bruise.

Thanks,

I hear slurs left and right. I'm trampled with illogical arguments to the point where my OWN arguments become nonsensical and I end up making myself look ignorant.

I hate this. I hate not being able to defend myself. Imagine every single sexist thing in pop culture..That is public high school.



Thank you ladies so much for teaching me to not be a fat-shaming, slut-shaming, ableist, special snowflake, internalized misogynist, transphobic little shitbird. Seriously, thank you so much.

I'm simply astounded. 

A bit of backstory: my boyfriend is involved with tech theater at our college. He gets paid to do cool carpentry things, and he also just loves doing tech for plays. This girl is the stage manager for the most recent show he worked on. She asked him out about a month ago and he very politely (in my opinion anyway) declined. I met her briefly at the opening night party they had for the show last Saturday, and she seemed nice enough. I didn't really think much on it. Today, though, I decided to search my university's tag on tumblr (I just set up my tumblr last week to keep in touch with some non-facebook friends) and, lo and behold, she had posted something about the play! I clicked on her name, scrolled through some gifs, and then came to a text-post she'd made Saturday night: ""Had a good time tonight. But then he left with his whore. Ugh. Gross.""

I immediately just kind of had this sickening feeling that she was talking about me. And, of course, as I continued reading through her blog's history, she definitely was. Apparently since discovering that the guy she likes is in a relationship, she's posted on tumblr at least once a day about what a whore I am, or speculating about what STD's I'm giving him, implying that I'm not good enough for him, etc. Now, all that I might be able to deal with. It's the support she's getting from people who I can only assume are her friends who like these posts and comment in agreement with her. These are people I've never even met! I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

There's just all sorts of stuff that she's written there, speculating about how I must control him with sex and that if I weren't so easy I never would have hooked him, but at other times saying that I probably just lay there like a dead fish and things like that. She says that there's no way I'm his intellectual equal and that 'it takes a writer to truly love a writer, there's no way she understands that.' WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN MEAN. She talks about how high maintenance I might be, and how she can't wait for the day that he realizes he's so much better than me et fucking cetera.  

It's just like...is this the mystical Nice Girl? The boyf and I were both under the impression that she took the rejection pretty well - she's been friendly to him since. But on her tumblr (which I understand is a personal blog but...still! Anyone can see what she's writing!) it's just so much...hate for me and lamentation about how guys always choose beauty over brain and his girlfriend is a horrid bitch and all that bullshit, complete at several points with fucking Taylor Swift gifs from that song about how cheerleaders make bad girlfriends and the homecoming queen is always a bitch. 

Sorry this got really long, I'm just really upset about literally happening upon about a month's worth of internet hate directed at me, coming from someone who doesn't even *know* me, and supported and encouraged by other people who don't even know me! I kind of want to call her out on it. Even more, I kind of want to show it to my boyfriend and see if *he* calls her out on it. Because he will. Because I *know* homie don't play that. But is it even worth it? Should I just ignore it? *Can* I just ignore it? 

Ugh. I'm just so frazzled and freaked out by the whole thing. Talk to me SRSters, I have no idea what this situation even is. Halp. I need feel better :(

Rant, sorry.",73,12,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/z7wme/partner_of_7_years_just_doesnt_get_it_rant_sorry/,"Hello my favourite community, on a throwaway because people in real life know my main account :( 

I'm 21 and have been (on and off, but mostly on) with my boyfriend since I was 14. It's safe to say that we have grown up together and stuck by each other through some really horrible shit. We have a great relationship, he has always been caring, considerate and kind toward me and others around him. We have never what you'd call a ""proper"" fight, we usually sit and talk very openly about our feelings.

Until I started getting heavily into feminism and social justice (it's probably only been about 6 months). I've been noticing more and more that he derails or dismisses me every time I bring up a feminist topic. He knows I was raped and that I am so passionate about social justice and feminism and that it basically defines who I am these days, but he just can't get it through his head that his behaviour is problematic.

Case in point: He works as a security guard. I get that it is a really masculine, probably aggressive environment and because he has to work in close quarters with other men and keep the peace. He was telling me about a colleague ""that you probably wouldn't like"". I asked why, and he said, ""Oh he's a good bloke but he tells lots of sexist jokes"". To which I said, ""And you laugh at those?"".

It turned not into a fight but a heated discussion because his line of reasoning was, ""We don't actually believe the jokes"" (tired excuse I know). I explained to him about normalisation etc and he just said, ""Well, I can't do anything to change other people"". I was so fed up by that stage and in tears, I said, ""Don't worry about it.""

He says, stop being so sensitive when I called out sexist shit in TV shows, says, and I quote that I'm a ""mouse with a trumpet"" implying what I'm saying has no substance. He doesn't want to hear about what I learned in my gender studies subject. He refuses to acknowledge his male privilege because he grew up poor and has had to deal with a lot of shit in his life (which I absolutely don't want to take away from him).

The final straw was today - I sent him an SMS asking if he'd thought any more about the feminist stuff I was talking about the other day (implying the conversation we had about his work). He said, ""ear bash someone enough you're more than likely to turn them away from your cause"". 

I don't know what to do. I am considering breaking up with him. After all this time together and planning our lives and thinking he was the one good thing the world had offered me after all the shit I have had to endure in my life, I thought he could offer me some love and beauty. I'm so angry. :( Sorry for wall of text. I don't want to end it with him, I love him so much, but I feel like his attitudes are not something I want in my life...

Edit: He even had an experience on X-Box Live where someone had verbally abused him - and he was really quite hurt and shocked by that. He said, ""Imagine if that was a kid this person had abused, instead of me, why would someone say such hurtful things?"" So it's not like he's lacking empathy or compassion. I tried to draw an analogy to that, saying THIS IS HOW WOMEN FEEL ALL THE TIME! And thought maybe, maybe I would be able to get through to him. But no. Still doesn't get it.

I am a n00b to the Fempire. I migrated here from 2X and I'm LOVING IT!  That being said, I'm having trouble following some of the terminology that you lovely ladies use and I've noticed a few other people having problems with it too so I thought we could start a Fempire Definition Thread!

Here's some I've come across so far:

Trans*: [Are you familiar with the concept of wildcards in terms of searching on computers? And asterix is used as a catchall to signify ""substitute anything you like here"". Trans* is an inclusive, short term that encompasses all identities where your sex or gender is different from that assigned at birth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/vwvjx/whats_your_problem/c58f9pj) - thanks to [nyoro](/u/nyoro_n) :)

Cis: [Not transgender, a woman who was assigned a female gender at birth that she recognizes as being hers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/vxoyu/mightve_set_a_bad_example_for_my_lil_sis/c58jtuh) - thanks to [fuzzytoe](/u/fuzzytoe) :)

Another one that I've googled but couldn't find a definition for is SAWCASM as used [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/vx7hp/question_for_woc/c58h9aq).

**So, does anyone else have any nomenclature related questions?** Fem-veterans, are there names/slang/abbreviations that you can see being misunderstood or not understood at all - can you explain them? I think it's great that heaps of people (by the looks of it) have migrated from 2X and I'm sure many of us would love to be able to contribute more to the community in the established manner (sorry for the generalisation!), or maybe I'm just super jelly of all your wonderful witticisms... either way: give me/us a hand and define away! 

Oh, and thanks for being a super positive community. I've absolutely loved browsing and commenting here. It's seriously like a massive and GENUINE (unlike 2X on occasion) serious-silly sleepover! &lt;3

1349040298.0,62,self.SRSWomen,10q7ip,I gathered the courage to tell a guy that he's making me uncomfortable. Now things have gone from bad to worse.,70,8,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/10q7ip/i_gathered_the_courage_to_tell_a_guy_that_hes/,"Sorry for the tl;dr, I don't know where else I could say this, I just need to say it somewhere and this community is so wonderful and supportive.

Ok, so, the last time I posted here it was for advice in dealing with a co-worker who looked through my facebook page and commented on my pictures and was then asking for my number. I was already uncomfortable so I told him that I don't give out my number. But then I felt bad for hurting his feelings and did give him my number.

Since then we've been texting occasionally. He acts really familiar and keeps saying that I'm his ""inspiration"" and ""motivation"". He sends me compliments but they don't make me feel good (he kept doing it even after I told him to stop saying those things). The other day he asked for my home address because he thinks my family looks nice in my fb pictures and wants to meet them. And he says he wants me to go with him to his home country to meet his parents because he's told them all about me. He clarified that we could go to his country in 2 years because he thinks we'll be in a relationship by then. Then today I mentioned in passing a guy I used to date and he started questioning me ""who is this guy? Did you love him?"" and that crossed a line. 

I told him flat out, in plain English that he keeps making me uncomfortable and when he asked why I told him specifically that he was acting too familiar and asking inappropriate questions. Then he said ""don't leave me"" and just now he texted me saying that he's in *love* with me (!?!?). 

To make things worse, I've hung out with him in person ONCE, we've messaged briefly on fb and in text and now THIS. I still barely know him! I'm a naturally non-confrontational person who will avoid hurting someone's feelings and it’s hard for me to say no to anyone, so it took courage to tell him how he was making me feel (it doesn’t help that the last guy I said no to understood it to mean “keep trying” until I physically pushed him off me). He just seems so socially unaware and completely lacks a sense of what’s appropriate when talking to someone.

I'm sure he means well and he wouldn't hurt me, I don't feel like I'm in danger or anything (I don’t see him at work except briefly/occasionally) but I'm freaking out a bit.


**tl;dr**: Told a guy he was making me uncomfortable, he responds by saying that he’s in love with me. WHAT DO I DO?

**Edit**: Thank you for all the kind words and support! I messaged him one last time and took him off my friends list.

I'm tired and angry and need to vent.

I am not Muslim myself but I do come from a country where a large majority of the population is. So I do feel like yelling at people when Islamophobia is thrown around.

And it honestly fucking hurts when Western feminists do this. People have been talking about the whole Lady Gaga burqa thing and white people are all like ""oh, she's just trying to help empower those poor, oppressed Muslim women who have to cover themselves!"". And I keep hearing about ""feminists"" trying to RIP OFF A WOMAN'S HIJAB to ""liberate her"". And that shitty photo of a woman in a niqab bearing her breasts (which wasn't even in a protest, it was in some sort of carnivale thing). And Femen running around naked in a Muslim neighborhood, possibly to tell women that they shouldn't cover themselves up. I'm probably projecting on that last point, but still.

CAN YOU STOP. JFC.

Again, I'm not Muslim so I really have no right to speak like this but this really irks me that people would talk down to my sisters like that.

The Lady Gaga thing was obviously cultural appropriation, and the people who say that she was trying to be 'empowering' are probably the same people who say that all the brown ladies who wear the hijab, abaya or any other covering are oppressed. WOW GREAT. LET'S JUST IGNORE THE FACT THAT VEILING IS A WOMAN'S CHOICE. I admire women who wear the veil because it is one of the most powerful ways to enforce your bodily autonomy (and if men still give hijabis shit about it, I will help them lower their fucking gaze). Obviously, there are women who are forced to do it, but let's just focus on them, rather than the majority of women who choose to wear the hijab or abaya and see it as a form of empowerment. Ugh, this argument reminds me of an article by Uma Narayan that spoke about how Western feminists focused on the practice of sati (where a widow would burn herself up on her husband's funeral pyre) rather than the more prevalent case of child brides in India.

I just can't fucking deal with all this cultural appropriation and xenophobia any more. There is a difference between appreciating a culture or being invited to participate in someone else's culture and cultural appropriation. And in Gaga's case, blatantly destroying the context of an important symbol in the name of being 'shocking'. There is a difference between critically critiquing the sexism in religion and yelling about how sexist Islam is (and not, you know, other religions or society itself). SAWCASMs are the most vocal about this but when I hear Western feminists do this, a group who I thought that I could trust and look up to, it fucking hurts.

I'm not asking for a cookie or anything, it just fucking hurts. As much as I would love to imagine that there is a global sisterhood, this reminds me that I'm still the Other. It makes me scared that if I do speak my mind, people would dismiss me just because I come from a ""third world country"" (ick, hate that phrase). Shit like this makes me real fucking uncomfortable when I'm around Western feminists because I feel like I'm not included in any way. 

**EDIT:** Oh hey, people saying the exact same thing I was talking about. As I said, I am neither a hijabi or a Muslim so I can't say much, but it would help to ask someone who is to understand why veiling IS a choice. Like, fucking google it.

1346859472.0,61,self.SRSWomen,zeaxg,"I recently read Arlie Hochschild's ""The Second Shift"", which was awesome, so I wrote a summary of it for the benefit of heterosexually partnered SRSWomen.",82,21,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/zeaxg/i_recently_read_arlie_hochschilds_the_second/,"It is a truth universally *un*acknowledged that we are living in the midst of a stalled gender revolution. The women's movement has been very successful in helping women break into the formerly male-dominated market of paid labor. But there has been no corresponding movement of men into the female-dominated non-market of unpaid labor mostly performed within the home. Like a rubber-band stretched to its limit, women's ""liberation"" seems to be moving backwards now, with more and more women succumbing to pressures at home to cut down on their participation in paid work or else succumbing to pressures at work to the detriment of their personal health/lives and  that  of their marriages. 

""The Second Shift"" recounts Arlie Hochschild's studies on how housework and childcare is shared by couples all across America, details in-depth interviews of 11 dual-earner couples with children, and presents the author's own theories and conclusions based on her observations. 

According to her, 

**The Problem Is...**

...that for a variety of reasons, men do not perform nearly enough of necessary domestic labor and routine childcare within households. This leads to women who work outside the home to take on a whole second shift of domestic labor all by themselves, which causes unbearable stresses between the domains of home, family, marriage, and work. There are literally not enough hours in the day to do everything, even though many women sure do try. Hochschild's research found that women work a full extra month compared to men every year, on average, in such homes. Equally important is the leisure gap between men and women: in the hundreds of couples she interviewed she found that most men take time for themselves and their hobbies, but NONE of the women she interviewed - NONE - had any hobbies at all. The women, as a result, suffered from a decreased ability to participate in paid work (and paid the price for that loss of power within the home, and their identities as independent women), or else they made up for the time they spent on their work by cutting back on their commitmemnt to their marriage or kids (and paid the price for THAT in guilt, stress, loss of emotional support when they needed it most, loss of identity as mothers or women, etc). The men faced no such impossible choices, since the entire weight of traditional gender roles allows them to balance work, kids, home, and family without conflict. However, men still paid an unacknowledged but huge price in how bad their marriages were, how much resentment they faced from their wives, and how little they connected with their children. 

WHY and HOW this happens within the microcosm of the home is what the book is about. Hochschild analyzes this under the lens of four core concepts - 

**1. Gender Ideology**

Gender ideology is what a person believes about what is ""proper"" for a given gender to do, say, or act like. Hochschild classifies ideologies into three types: ""traditional"" (belief in traditional gender-roles, that women belong at home and with kids, that men are providers);""egalitarian"" (the belief that both men's and women's career ambitions are equally important, and deserve equal support by men sharing in unpaid domestic and childcare work equally); and ""transitional"" (a blend of the above two, typically manifested in women as the desire to have a great career while also being responsible for home and family, and in men as being ""all for"" their wives working, and willing to ""help out"" a little but she remains in charge of home and family).  

Take the example of Nancy and Evan Holt, one of the couples interviewed in-depth.  Nancy has a deep need to be a ""career woman"", and desperately wants a marriage in which her husband is a ""New Age Man"", a man who shares in domestic work and supports her career as a social worker equally to his. Nancy is egalitarian. Evan on the other hand ""thinks it's *fine* for Nancy to have a career, and he can see it's very important to her, but can't understand why *her* choice should change or affect *his* life."" His gender ideology is classic transitional. 

Another example: Frank and Carmen Delacorte, who both agree that a woman's place is in the home and a man's function is to provide. But Carmen still works - runs a thriving daycare center out of her home - due to economic necessity. Carmen enjoys her job but feels very strongly that if she didn't need the paycheck she would give it up in a heartbeat to become a ""milk and cookies"" mom like she has always wanted. Where Nancy Holt feels like she *must* work and *must* find her work important, Carmen Delacorte feels her ""real work"" is her home and children. What's surprising about the Delacortes, though, is that when it comes to household chores (though not childcare) they are almost egalitarian. Frank, even while maintaining that Carmen does everything, actually pitches in and does *way* more domestic work than Evan Holt. Frank and Carmen are traditional ""on top"" but nearly egalitarian ""on the bottom"". 

It's not at all uncommon for 'top' and 'bottom' gender ideologies of a person to be in direct conflict. For example, most of the men claimed to have a transitional gender ideology on 'top', but either through their actions or  during in-depth interviews or both, revealed that they were in fact traditional when it came right down to it. Many women who *claimed* to be egalitarian often suffered from guilt when they confronted their husbands about not doing enough around the house, and did a lot more around the house just as a gift to their husbands because they somehow didn't feel good about ""making"" him cook and clean, revealing that they were 'transitional' underneath.

What is your gender ideology? What is your partner's?

One surefire way of seeing what the ""bottom"" gender ideology of a person really is, is to examine their [**Gender Strategy**](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/zeaxg/i_recently_read_arlie_hochschilds_the_second/c63t9ye).",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_zeaxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/zeaxg/i_recently_read_arlie_hochschilds_the_second/,

Holy fucking crap, way to miss the entire fucking point. I don't even get it any more.

So FUCK OFF with your concern trolling. Fuck your entitled, thin-privledged bullshit. I DON'T OWE YOU THINNESS.

Could use some insight/feedback/support.,71,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/vxtod/stepped_down_from_major_kink_event_over/,"So, I live in the Bay Area, and for the past couple of months, I've been working with Folsom Street Fair as an organizer and coordinator for Venus' Playground, the women and genderqueer space. When I was interviewed for the position, I said, in no uncertain terms, that my objective would be to make it a more inclusive space for trans women, for though organizers of previous years and the Folsom board claim that OF COURSE trans women are welcome, **every year** the space is overrun by transmasculine-identified people and trans women complain they are made to feel unwelcome by organizers and other attendees. 

For two months my co-organizer and I promoted the trans -inclusiveness of our space. We rewrote the blurb for the site and sponsorship letters to say ""trans identified people not just welcome, but encouraged to visit our space"". We scheduled demos by trans kinksters and were set to have a fundraiser at a local bar that had a noted relationship with the local trans community. I was so super excited. Like, I'm not even interested in sex these days, but I was so happy and proud of myself to create a space explicitly welcoming of trans* identified people.

Last week, my co-organizer and I spoke with Folsom's ""graphic designer"" and requested that the word ""trans*"" be included on the banner, which for the last few years had read ""women and genderqueer"". We were told, from multiple people, that trans could not, would not be added to the banner because:

* it would imply that ""a man in a dress"" was welcome in the space 

* it would imply that trans men were welcome

* the wording and terms of who's welcome to the space are changed almost every year and people are tired of doing so

* the community that had originally created the space years ago didn't want the wording there, and we had to respect their decision


The second point is the most frustrating, as trans men are in this space every year, and the only reason I got the job as co-organizer in the first place was because a trans man turned down the offer. 

My co-organizer and I both resigned. We have since exchanged long, frustrated emails with the President about our concerns (about the transphobia and other issues, specifically racism and ableism within the festival and organization). We're at an impasse. I refuse to participate in a space where the language is left intentionally ambiguous (the justification we've gotten is ""well of course trans women are welcome, they're women aren't they?) to maintain a certain normativity. 

Flying the trans* inclusive kite was great when we were using it to acquire sponsorships and set up fundraisers, but once we wanted it, in writing, on the space itself, suddenly we were going against the whim of the community. It makes me ill to think of it.

Since stepping down my confidence has felt wholly demolished. I have received no small amount of criticism (in the form of passive aggressive facebook statuses and emails telling me that ""if I really cared, I would try to work through it"") from the community for my ""principled stance"". 

I gave the president of the organization my word that I wouldn't plaster this incident all over the interwebz and sour an already flimsy professional relationship, but I'm feeling hollowed out with doubt and apathy. I need some support, even if it's just image macros.

I don't know if I'll ever recover from this and return to organizing within the community again. Unless its to create a more inclusive, more radical alternative to Folsom. I've looked into the logistics of it, and if I campaigned hard enough, I could raise the money to rent out a private, accessible space for such a party/festival. I'm sure, with time and some positive interactions with the community, I could get back on my feet and make it happen. Revenge may not be the most friendly and communal way of resolving differences, but damn it feels good to be a trans* lady (for me, at least) and I'm not going to waste any time in a space where I can't proclaim that and encourage others to do so.

So, what do you think, SRSWomen? Did I overreact? Are my principles misguided? Does my portrayal of events read like shitthatneverhappened.txt? Am I credible?

Thank you for reading this. Even if you don't comment, even if you downvote it to hell, I'm just happy I was able to get this off my chest and make those first steps towards getting back up.

EDIT: I wanted to give a bit of explanation to give this more substance/make it more of a discussion about Special Snowflake Syndrome.

I think for me it was very similar to why many women like to victim blame with regard to clothing choice. I felt as though if I could separate myself from the ""bad"" women, who have to deal with sexism for reasons that are their ""fault"", then I could escape having sexism directed at me. I felt that I could be an exception with regard to the sexism in our society. (Well that illusion was destroyed pretty brutally.)

Additionally I think a lot of it was wanting to feel better than other people, in general as well as better than other women so I could feel more attractive to men. I really capitalized, at least to myself, on the fact that I am a woman successful in math and science. I felt that this made me rare and special and better than other women. Of course I don't feel any of these things now, I'm just explaining why I felt this way at the time. Now I see that while it takes a certain amount of courage to go into a male-dominated field as a woman, it certainly does not make anyone greater than or less than anyone else. I also see that I am certainly not unique for this characteristic - especially now that I'm working and surrounded by women that are vastly more talented and experienced than I am! 

I think a lot of it was dealing with my own insecurity about coming into my own (this was ages 16-20ish). I think everyone wants to feel special and this was my way of doing it. Maybe other people who are ex-SSs had a similar experience, maybe not. Either way it feels good to share.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,1343199428.0,,,True,t3_x4bdy,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x4bdy/i_used_to_be_a_special_snowflake/,

Were the bleats of SAWCSMs on TwoXChromosomes.

The penis' thoughts were not thoughtful or fair,

But the mods still allowed them to mansplain in there.

The wimmin were tired of what the menz said,

With whispers of ""misandry"" ringing in their heads.

With keyboard at ready, and I in my bra,

I steeled myself for MRAs saying ""A HA!""

When in the subreddit there arose such a clatter,

I rushed to the thread to see what was the matter.

Away to the ""top"" I flew like a flash,

And saw all the poop and feminisms clash.

The downvotes were flying, and dildz cannons ready

I lurked in a rage, my blue arrows steady

When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,

A subreddit where the menz disappear!

The wimmin, they flock, from all over the net

Communing in places neckbeards cannot get.

The Menz Rights brigade fires volleys and slings,

But we are immune to the poop that they bring.

The beardhurt is strong, and Reddit sure feels

That misandry, is in fact, all the way realz.

Our mods wield their bens with power and grace,

And a smile is wide on my feminist face.

O, not to worry! No mansplaining here!

This is a place where we share without fear.

I praise every day our Gaga's Dworkin

For founding a place in which menz are not welcome.

When she turned around and said ""I am going to have you escorted out now"" I thought it was the best thing she could do in that situation. It seems from the footage she quickly skipped to another part of the stage and kept working.  

Other women there said she was basically asking for it. That she was famous, singing and dancing on a stage and she let fans get too close. I quickly pointed out that just because someone stands near someone else it is NOT an invitation for physical contact. He swatter her on the ass! Not appropriate!  

What's worse is that this was in a prison, a place where there are several sex offenders. Really? You aren't worried about holding that guy accountable for violating her bodily integrity?

Because of this, I decided to take as many women's classes as I could for my final year (my minor is also cultural diversity, so they fit in nicely with it even if they're not polsci). So I'm currently taking Women and Public Policy, Women in Literature, and Intro to Women's Studies.  These classes are all pretty awesome, interesting, and fun.  My professors are all also very intelligent women, who are great at their jobs.  
  
HOWEVER, the other students in my Women's Studies and Women and Public Policy classes suck.  On one of the first days of Women's Studies, we were going over the transformation of the women's movement over time. So my professor begins talking about the different waves of feminism and what not, and says something about the first women's movement.  Guy behind me (90 person classroom, sit at the back, professor can definitely not hear him), ""A woman's first movement should be to the kitchen."" I mean...really...that's not even original. Yesterday, we were watching Iron Jawed Angels and at the part where the suffragists are arrested for a bogus traffic obstruction claim just because they don't want them picketing the President, when the women are convicted, same guy claps. And this guy is black.  I know shitlordness comes in all colors, but I would sincerely hope he would draw some parallels between the treatment of Civil Rights activists in the 60s and the suffragists of the early 1900s. Without those people, it's much less likely either of us would even be at this school.  
  
And then in my public policy class, there was just one incident that kind of bothered me. My professor is very calm; never raises her voice, and loves to talk both sides of an issue without really revealing her position. So one day before class, 2 female students were talking to each other about what a psycho feminazi our professor is. Likewut. We literally pretty much have just reviewed court cases and gone over different theories of feminism.  My professor never raises her voice, or seems particularly angry.  At worst, sometimes she'll make a face of ""I mean, really?"" when she's talking about something particularly dumb (like a former ruling that women can only work so many hours because they're too delicate and need to run the house, etc.). And then 2 guys chime in about how awful it is to be in the class and how uncomfortable they feel, and how sometimes it seems like she's going to just say ""All men are pigs!"" after a statement. I find it really depressing that a calm, rational discussion and explanation of court cases related to women's rights can be interpreted as the rantings of a deranged, man-hating feminist.  
  
It's just tiring and I know even if I say anything, no one else in the classes would really be on my side. In the 90 person Women's Studies class, when the professor asked how many of us consider ourselves feminists, 2 of us raised our hands (it's about 84 girls to 6 guys).  In the 18 people, 14 of which are female, Women and Public Policy class, I was the only one to raise my hand when the professor asked the same.

Unless one of us was glued at the crotch of one of our male friends they would act like it was totally okay to go in and  try and move us away. And they never approach you head on its always from the side or behind where you can't see so you have to have great spatial awareness. There was one shit head who spent at least 10 minutes hanging around the edge of our group waiting for an opprotunity to try and pull me into him. Why is this considered acceptable behavior. I can't have fun if Im trying to dance yet be aware of everyone around me without making eye contact.

Not bad for 1939, even if she did need sparkly high heels in order to get anywhere.

SPOILER ALERT to follow for those who haven't seen it.

I'm not sure if you know the premise of this new one, but basically Oz (James Franco), a selfish, egotistical, greedy nightmare (not to mention extreme womanizer, which ends up causing him to get to Oz in the first place when he is chased away by an angry boyfriend of one of the meaningless women he chases), is the hero of the story.  

He gets to Oz and seduces the first woman he sees - the witch of the west (played by Mila Kunis).  She informs him that he is what Oz has been waiting for - he is here to save all of Oz's people from the Wicked Witch.  He makes her fall in love with him, but doesn't care about her.  Then her sister, the witch of the east (Rachel Weisz), helps her realize this (by lying to her and making her jealous, since that's what we catty women do), thus turning her against him and his quest to be the savior of Oz.  The two of them collaborate to destroy him, while the Good Witch, Glenda (Michelle Williams) depends on him to defeat them and restore Oz to how it was when her father ran the place.  For some reason, she is unable to do this herself despite her magic wand.  I guess without a man Oz is just a shit show?

Lots of rights! Heaps. Loads.

For me, this means encouraging the men in my life to take care of themselves and their mental/physical health. Going to the doctor or getting counseling shouldn't be looked at as a ""less than manly"" thing. If I had a child, I would spend a lot of time looking into circumcision, because though I think the ""intactivist"" movement is pretty off-the-wall, bodily integrity is a powerful thing. I think that barring health concerns, circumcision would be a decision I would want to leave up to my hypothetical son. That's all I could really think of offhand.

Do any of you have thoughts on this subject?

I would always make excuses for him, describe it as a bad experience or something... I've always known about victim-blaming and always said how awful it is but it hasn't been until recently that i realised i've been victim-blaming myself my whole adult life. It took me about a decade to get to this stage. 

When someone tells a rape joke it makes me feel like it was my fault. When i hear a rape joke it doesn't matter if it is from a 'friend' or if i know the person would never want to see me hurt... When i hear a rape joke the message it sends to me and what i hear is that rape is really not that big a deal, and maybe i have just been overreacting. I am desperately trying to recover now, trying to see that it wasn't my fault that i was raped, trying to see how it has effected my life upto now and everytime i'm with friends and someone makes a rape joke it's like two steps back... Or sometimes it feels like falling down the stairs back. Rape jokes directly stop me feeling better, rape jokes directly make me leave the situation feeling that little bit worse and, invariably, going through the whole thing over and over again in my heard. Rape jokes say that rape happens, get over it. That you can find humour in anything. And every single time i hear one it makes it just that bit harder to cope with, that bit harder to deal with. 

I've spoken to some friends and people close to me to ask them not to, and for awhile they usually don't, but, in time, they forget and it is the same old tired rape jokes.

Ever since I started lurking around SRS, I became so much more self-aware of the shittiness that happens everyday, and the worst part was that a lot of it came from my own boyfriend. I always thought he was a great guy... funny, smart, respectful... but slowly I started realizing that a lot of his sense of humor was based on putting others down. I never thought he could be a typical shitlord because he was a minority, he had friends who were gay, native, black, etc... but at the end of the day he was still insensitive. 

When I tried pointing out that having a black friend did not entitle him to make racist jokes (anytime someone lost something he would blame it on his black friend and laugh like it was no big deal), he actually got mad at me! Slowly, I started pointing out more and more the things he did that were shitty in hopes of showing him how rampant it was, but he didn't care. It got to the point where he just told me to lighten up and to stop being ""a bitch"".

I've been in an abusive relationship before, and when he said that, I had so many flashbacks from my past that I was stunned and all I could do was walk out of the apartment (his) and drive home. That was this morning. A couple hours ago I sent him a single text letting him know it's over. I don't need his shit anymore.

I got lots of responses from women who’d posted there (this was back in the day when TwoX wasn’t so nasty) and they were all very open about their reasons. As you’d expect, it was things like - they enjoyed the attention, it turns them on, it’s their body they can do what they like with it, as well as those very heartfelt replies from women who admitted having really low self-esteem and finding gonewild to be an ego boost. So, I decided to get over my concerns about it and let it go because, I thought, it’s none of my business. Women should be allowed to express their sexuality how they wish and everyone gets self-esteem in different ways so I should just keep out of it.  Just because I wouldn't post there doesn't mean I should judge others and, after-all, posters are consenting adults (I hope!) not causing any harm. 

But… that was before I realised the extent of reddit’s misogyny and before I discovered SRS which has opened my eyes up in soooo many ways. So, it’s made me re-think about gonewild through the SRS lens and I ask myself is gonewild really not causing any harm?

Does gonewild contribute to this “show us your tits” mentality on reddit? Where redditors think it’s their right to demand pics whenever they see a woman poster? I’m certainly not blaming gonewild for reddit’s misogyny and sexism (after all, creepers gonna creep, and shitlords are gonna shitlord) but I'm sure it doesn't help.
 
Beyond that, and what’s more concerning, is posting to gonewild another example of internalised misogyny? Where women are basing their self-worth on being sex objects to a bunch of internet strangers, judging how sexy they are through upvotes and leery comments?

I’m feeling a bit confused by it all as I don’t want to judge anyone’s sexual expression (when it’s all consenting) but at the same time I just feel like gonewild is more about sexual oppression than expression.

**TL;DR – is gonewild an expression of sexual freedom or, because of the upvote/comment system, another example of internalised misogyny that some women use to determine their self-worth?**

His indifference was really starting to piss me off, and I was trying to tell him so, but then he cut me off with a question.

""Why do you care about any of this? It seems that every time you try to go after the patriarchy, all you see is women getting raped, objectified, mistreated, abused. How can you constantly expose yourself to so much negativity over and over again? What comfort do you find in that?""

I have to admit, I was caught off guard. He had a point. Every where I seemed to look, there was systemic oppression of women.

Why?

Because feminism taught me that I am not broken. I am not flawed. There is nothing wrong with me.

Feminism taught me that my body was my own.

Feminism taught me that it's OK to want to be single.

Feminism taught me that I am a woman, not a girl.

Feminism taught me that it's OK to have sex with as many people as I wanted.

Feminism taught me that humans are fluid across all spectra: race, gender, sexuality...

Feminism taught me that I am strong because I am a woman, not in spite of it.

Feminism taught me to accept myself, flaws and all.

I came to the startling conclusion that my SO on several occasions forced sex onto me, despite me stating I didn't want to participate in sexual activities with him. 

There have been many glaring examples in our relationship in which he expressed the desire to have sex, and then I would say something along the lines of, ""I'm not in the mood"", and he would continue to push the subject to the point where I would be too tired to fight back and I just give in. I've somehow have just lived in denial about this in the entire span of our relationship.

Last night, I confronted him about this and told him,""There have been times where you have pursued sex with me, despite the fact I told you countless times that I didn't want to have sex at that moment."" Once I said that, this look of shame and guilt came over his face. He didn't say anything, and still has not said anything. 

I know what he did was rape, and he probably realizes that himself, too. It was rape and in his ignorance he saw nothing wrong in what he was doing. Now he does, now he knows what he did was horrifying. He probably never thought he'd be a rapist, and here was, being a rapist. I honestly don't think he'd repeat that behavior, and if he did I'd leave him in a heartbeat. And he knows I would.

I just had to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening, this is the only place I can talk about this. I love all the SRSters here!

**UPDATE**: We discussed this further today, and he admitted to himself what he did was rape, and admitted to himself that he was indeed a rapist. He explained he was ignorant because the way he was raised, and was never exposed ideas that would have taught him otherwise. Being raised as a strict Jehovah's Witness gave him a skewed view of the role of women in relationships and he's trying to unlearn those views. He's only been out of the religion for a couple of years. I'm going to suggest to him to seek counseling to work through that further.

I'm going to continue being with him, and I know that sounds awful given the information posted here. He truly is an amazing person, and if I didn't think he had the potential to work past this I wouldn't have stuck around. What he did was fucked up, and I will never forget that and he knows that.

**UPDATE 2** My mom was called me a few times today, and I finally got back to her. She said she called so many times because she had a dream last night about me crying. I'm not the one to believe in supernatural things, but this made my hairs stand on end. I told her everything was fine, and then told my SO what she said. And his chin hit the floor. 

**UPDATE 3** To the people who feel the need to harass me for ""crying wolf"", I will make this final statement. I respect this environment too much to go into gruesome detail of how I was raped, which is why I excluded these details. On multiple occasions I said,""No"" and was ignored. On multiple occasions I said, ""No"" and was forcefully penetrated. Those details are not needed for the general public, but this constant harassment has begrudgingly forced me to say these details, for a slim chance to halt those who think its their right to harass me.

Last evening my husband took my awesome dag to a local dag park. It's off-leash and partly wooded. He ran full speed into some brush and began yelping like crazy. He ran back out and his left eye was bleeding, so we ran him to the local vet ER. They sent him to the big vet hospital near the city and we talked to a canine eye specialist.

A branch scraped and tore his cornea (the pictures are brutal), so they kept him there to watch him and decide whether he needs this very tricky eye surgery. As of now he's still in the hospital all doped up and in a tiny steel box and I miss him so much and feel like it's all my fault. He's so happy and visual and the thought of him losing that beautiful brown expressive eye makes me sob.

Hus and I are heading over there right now for a visit, but they're keeping him a little longer to watch the eye. No need for surgery yet, but there's no guarantee it won't get infected. He could lose the eye if it does.

So, SRSters, if any of you pray or send good thoughts or burn candles or do anything spiritual like that, we'd really appreciate some good thoughts/energy for Fritz. He's this awesome little german shepherd/hound dog mix and I love him with all my heart. ;.;

Short answer: most think that recruiting is biased towards men (women especially think this). I got some really hilarious freeform answers from people who disagreed.

""I wish there were fewer women [at hackathons], not because they're incompetent, but just because they don't know when to shut up and stop complaining. I'm sure some hackathons have some sort of application process, but most of the ones I've seen have been open to the public or to any interested students from certain schools. The ones I have seen don't have an application process so there is no gender balancing or anything of that nature. Yet you insist on turning this into a feminist issue. The last response is ""Wish there were fewer women""... seriously? Could you have made it sound more chauvinist and unappealing to survey responders? This survey is feminist propaganda and I'm sick and tired of it. There are plenty of really nice guys in the world, certainly in North America, who treat women nicely the way they deserve, but women who don't treat those men as if they're wife-beating murderous animals frothing at the mouth are few and far between. If you mention in your class that there are still people who wish there are fewer women and therefore America is still sexist, it'll be another victory for feminism and a loss for truth and equality""
-22 y/o male

""...when feminists complain that women need to make on average the same as men, have the same power in their job titles, have as much representation at recruitment events and in the workforce, etc., without ever considering the actual level of interest among females as a whole, it really offends me and worries me about the future of this country. It's such an overwhelming majority of women in America who act like this now too. Everything from breast cancer to technology or television to car insurance in today's America is centered around giving women way more than they deserve because there are probably still a lot of women out there who just don't care enough to earn what they want themselves. I understand that history may have put women down, but almost nobody does today. It just takes time for things to smooth out. Women won't be equally represented the day after they gain equality because laws and social attitudes may have changed, but people haven't, and it will take a few generations for women to start achieving the same levels of success as men. I don't see how that's unfair, it's just natural. By forcing it with these ridiculous surveys and political platforms, feminists are only antagonizing men and dragging all the progress of human history back to a standstill just to let some feminists catch up. Please reconsider this class, this survey, and everything else that is feminist and therefore inherently oppressive.""

So I've had my GORGEOUS baby daughter; she's 6 months old now and I'm finishing up my maternity leave soon. I had/caught/came down with post-natal depression when she was about 2 months old. It was SHIT; but thanks to some amazing support and also the fact that I was really, really, really public about it on my facebook and twitter, and from there into real life, I got fantastic help and totally recovered within a few months. There isn't a day that goes by now that I don't feel grateful for being able to be happy and anxiety-free. 

I'm still really active in pro-choice campaigning. I'm in Ireland where things couldn't be shitter for pregnant women. Since the horrific death of Savita Halappanavar here in November of last year, when I was 8 months pregnant, stuff has REALLY kicked off. I was heavily involved in organising the massive protest that was covered here on Reddit after her death; in fact I led it out. I think my face with my pregnant tummy crashed the servers of the college newspaper the images were hosted on that Reddit was drooling all over. (If you've any cash to spare and you're into abortion rights; [give us your monies here.](http://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/get-involved/donate/)

Anyway what I'm really back here is to say that back when I first came to Reddit, before I started posting, 4 or 5 years ago, I was a TOTAL shithead. Like, TOTAL. I was the definition of a special snowflake. I'd been a feminist from when I was very young; but a combination of a super shitty first boyfriend and an inability to properly analyse the control patriarchy and capitalism had on my self-expression and self-image turned me into a total spanner. 

Finding SRS and all the amazing people that make up this incredible place helped me to find myself again. SRS turned me into an outspoken and vocal feminist, in any and all spaces I find myself in; it made me aware of intersectionality and how power dynamics play into the silencing of people with differing levels of privilege and that how I conduct myself is a key part of that; and it is seriously, no messing, what made me the loud, proud and aggressively targeted abortion rights activist in an Ireland which prizes not speaking up and CERTAINLY not speaking up about your illegal abortion that's potentially punishable by life in prison, least of all while you're heavily pregnant with another wanted pregnancy, or more recently while a new mother to a baby daughter.


Anyway. Thanks, SRS; and especially thanks SRSWomen, for being a not-menz space where I felt truly safe.

I deleted my account after my facebook, reddit and email accounts got doxxed soon after the r/PreteenGirls fiasco.

A little more than a month ago I went out with a man I'd been talking to online for about a month or so. He seemed a bit pushy, but nothing too bad for online dating, and I was quite clear I wasn't going to do anything before I felt comfortable (This came after he requested that I kiss him as soon as he walked up, to which I laughed and said ""What? No. I barely know you""). We spent a few hours drinking beers and talking and wound up having sex at my apartment. We woke up the next day, he said he'd call me, left and went about his day.

Long story short he didn't call for 3 weeks, then randomly texted me asking if I'd see him, I said that I was hesitant after he didn't call for 3 weeks. Didn't hear back from him, but my best friend who I am madly in love with did ask to come over and stuff happened but I figured ""Fuck it, dude never called me back, and I like this guy way better"".

Next thing I know my ex from one year ago is calling me asking why this dude I went out with once is sending him messages on Facebook asking how he knows me, what his ""plan of attack"" was when we got together, and any tips he has for women like me since he's a ""novice"" and my ex seems ""experienced"". My ex sends me screenshots of the guy quoting PUA stuff and trying to get tips. Next thing I know the guy is sending me texts negging and slut-shaming me, asking if I want him to tell my ex he fucked me the first time we met in person, saying I'm ""surprisingly pretty tight for such a fucking whore"" and comments about my body.

I told him I knew what he was doing, and to just stop contacting me and good luck elsewhere, but then I started getting harassing messages on my OKCupid account (Which I've changed to ""seeing someone"") wanting to know how the new man in my life ""completes"" me and how I need to be dominated and controlled, even if I don't realize it. I blocked the account they were being sent from, but I'm a bit worried this guy is a loony toon and will try to harass me in some sort of other way. :/

The worst part, he sent me a text asking if I was seeing someone else as soon as my best friend and I got back to my apartment to watch movies and drink some beer. When I said yes he started making creepily accurate statements about my best friend ""Oh so I wasn't tall enough?"" (Best friend is 6'4.5) ""I suppose you like them all dark and weird like you?"" (Best friend was wearing a black shirt, red jeans, boots and has a red mohawk) leading both him and I to believe he was somewhere near my apartment and saw us together.

Thought I may as well share the love.,66,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/17opjm/effort_i_just_compiled_a_bunch_of_scientific/,"For those of you who have wondered about some scientific sources regarding why we should be skeptical of arguments that assert that men and women's differences can be traced to biology, here you go. Where possible I have included links to the full pdfs:

[A brief overview of the affect of environment on the brain, most particularly with references to studies on humans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_enrichment_(neural\)#Humans) (specifically to show that brain biology is not set in stone / can be affected by environment, and differences in biology therefore cannot reasonably be solely attributed to inherent differences between genders).

And then for some non-wiki articles:

**Regarding environmental expectations, behavior, and scientific reporting of outcomes:**

[Empirical evidence that teacher expectations influence actual student outcomes (people tend to meet the expectations)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1001620): teachers were told that some group of children was intellectually gifted relative to the others. In fact the children were chosen randomly. At the end of the experiment the students teachers expected to be intellectually gifted actually scored higher on IQ tests than should have been expected and than the other randomly selected group. This was especially true in the first and second grades, possibly because students are less likely to have reputations among teachers at those ages ([and more on Rosenthal's research of teacher expectations](http://homepages.gac.edu/~jwotton2/PSY225/rosenthal66.pdf)).

[Evidence of stereotype threat affecting women's math performance](http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/fr/GDP1/papers/spencer99.pdf): ""Characterizing the test as insensitive to gender differences was enough to totally eliminate women’s underperformance in this experiment. Yet when the same test was characterized as sensitive to gender differences, women signiﬁcantly underperformed in relation to equally qualiﬁed men.""

[More on stereotype threat](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/10/1/80): ""We found that Asian-American women performed better on a mathematics test when their ethnic identity was activated, but worse when their gender identity was activated, compared with a control group who had neither identity activated. Cross-cultural investigation indicated that it was the stereotype, and not the identity per se, that influenced performance.""

[Evidence that women aren't unique in being able to be affected by stereotype threat](http://www.imamu.edu.sa/Scientific_selections/abstracts/Math/When%20White%20Men%20Can%E2%80%99t%20Do%20Math,%20Necessary%20and%20Sufficient%20Factors%20in%20Stereotype%20Threat.pdf) (white men are affected when told that whites underperform relative to Asians), and also evidence that stereotype threat impacts higher achievers more than moderate achievers (and so you may extrapolate that in general, higher achieving women will be more affected by stereotype threat than low achieving women [if you don't like that extrapolation there is also empirical evidence that this holds true specifically for women as well] -- which of course means that the women most qualified for fields like computer science and engineering will be the most likely to underperform relative to ability due to stereotype threat).

[Evidence that experimenter expectation affects scientific reporting of behavior](http://cranepsych.edublogs.org/files/2009/06/Dull_rats_bright_rats.pdf) (and so should skew to favor men where experimenters expect men are more gifted, e.g., mathematics, engineering, etc): students were told that they had either been given rats bred for intelligence or rats that were dull. In fact, all rats were randomly assigned. Those believed to be bred for intelligence were reported to have more correct responses in maze experiments.

**Regarding evidence for discrimination in hiring and measures of competence:**

[Yale demonstrates that professors of chemistry, biology, and physics have a bias favoring male students](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109.abstract). All professors were distributed materials about an undergraduate student that were identical other than name (John or Jennifer). ""Our results revealed that both male and female faculty judged a female student to be less competent and less worthy of being hired than an identical male student, and also offered her a smaller starting salary and less career mentoring. Although the differences in ratings may be perceived as modest, the effect sizes were all moderate to large (d = 0.60–0.75). Thus, the current results suggest that subtle gender bias is important to address because it could translate into large real-world disadvantages in the judgment and treatment of female science students (39). Moreover, our mediation findings shed light on the processes responsible for this bias, suggesting that the female student was less likely to be hired than the male student because she was perceived as less competent.""

[Yale demonstrates that gender discrimination in hiring exists but that discriminatory hiring decisions are explained away with other criteria](http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/Uhlmann%20and%20Cohen%202005.pdf). More specifically, the hiring criteria for a particular job shifts to meet the candidate of the preferred gender. Parts of this are summed up by Cordelia Fine as follows: ""The students evaluated one of two applicants (Michael or Michelle) for the position of police chief. One applicant was streetwise, a tough risk-taker, popular with other officers, but poorly educated. By contrast, the educated applicant was well schooled, media savvy, and family oriented, but lacked street experience and was less popular with the other officers. The undergraduate participants judged the job applicant on various streetwise and education criteria, and then rated the importance of each criterion for success as a police chief. Participants who rated Michael inflated the importance of being an educated, media-savvy family man when these were qualities Michael possessed, but devalued these qualities when he happened to lack them. No such helpful shifting of criteria took place for Michelle. As a consequence, regardless of whether he was streetwise or educated, the demands of the social world were shaped to ensure that Michael had more of what it took to be a successful police chief. As the authors put it, participants may have ‘felt that they had chosen the right man for the job, when in fact they had chosen the right job criteria for the man.’ Ironically, the people who were most convinced of their own objectivity discriminated the most. Although self-reported endorsement of sexist attitudes didn’t predict hiring bias, self-reported objectivity in decision making did.""

[More evidence of discriminatory hiring practices](http://advance.cornell.edu/documents/ImpactofGender.pdf): Again a summary from elsewhere, ""in one recent study more than 100 university psychologists were asked to rate the CVs of Dr. Karen Miller or Dr. Brian Miller, fictitious applicants for an academic tenure-track job. The CVs were identical, apart from the name. Yet strangely, the male Dr. Miller was perceived (by both male and female reviewers) to have better research, teaching and service experience than the luckless female Dr. Miller. Overall, about three-quarters of the psychologists thought that Dr. Brian was hireable, while only just under half had the same confidence in Dr. Karen. The same researchers also sent out applications for the position of tenured professor, again identical but for the male and female name at the top. This time, the application was so strong that most of the raters thought that tenure was deserved, regardless of sex. However, the endorsement of Karen’s application was four times more likely to be accompanied by cautionary caveats scrawled in the margins of the questionnaire: such as, ‘I would need to see evidence that she had gotten these grants and publications on her own’ and ‘We would have to see her job talk.’""

**And just because I like this study...**

[Evidence that gender differences in empathetic accuracy can be explained by differences in motivation](http://pages.uoregon.edu/hodgeslab/files/Download/Klein%20Hodges_2001.pdf): ""Two studies of college students investigated the conditions under which women perform better than men on an empathic accuracy task (inferring the thoughts and feelings of a target person). The first study demonstrated that women’s advantage held only when women were given a task assessing their feelings of sympathy toward the target prior to performing the empathic accuracy task. The second study demonstrated that payments in exchange for accuracy improved the performance of both men and women and wiped out any difference between men’s and women’s performances. Together, the results suggest that gender differences in empathic accuracy performance are the result of motivational differences and are not due to simple differences of ability between men and women."" And of course there is no reason to suspect that differences in gender motivation are limited to the domain of empathy, so I feel this study is especially relevant.

This whole attitude towards her is just so vile an uninformed and for some reason Reddit is paying an increased amount of attention to her in the past few days. The more time it takes her, the more they feel they are justified in their pre-existing hatred towards her.

The thing is, she was a big influence in me getting more active and serious with feminism. Something that I didn't dare to do before in fear of judgement and an admitted lack of research. I stumbled upon her work a good while before the kickstarter was announced and I became very fascinated by the subject. When the kickstarter became a thing I was excited and couldn't wait. But apparently 'the collective internet' was not pleased and it's been one big drama ever since. I feel bad about it and I'm not even in her position. The way she's dealt with this so far has been admirable, but for some reason people are shouting scam and controversy at something that was delayed because of the overwhelming support and the need to do very thorough research (at least this was my conclusion from what I've read).

Reddit's immature response simply angers me. I know, it's the internet, I shouldn't care, but apparently I do. I've had so many discussions with people who didn't even care about my point of view and now there's people who aren't even subtle in their hypocricy when they praise a man who's doing a kickstarter that's similar, or feel sorry for one who failed and wasted a shitload of money. 

So I'm keeping to the fempire for now. It's not that I can't handle it, it's just a massive waste of my time to have to sift through so much unreasonable, irrational hatred to find the occasional entertainment.

Instead I will now sit back and watch awesome movies[.](http://imgur.com/WShmo)

My ex boyfriend's daughter was given to his ex as primary custodian because he lived in a party frat house and barely made $9-10,000 a year. And yet, that was somehow discrimination. He contacted a ""MR"" lawyer and he was told it was sooooooooo unfair, but he couldn't afford the lawyer's fees (wonder why) and just had to deal with it.

My mom is in NO way a sexual predator and is not an abuser. She did have an abusive childhood, though (verbal and physical). 


When I was 11 or 12, I was sort of starting to learn about sex and sexuality.  Well, (and I cringe even saying these things), my mom decided that a good way to teach me about my anatomy would be to show me on herself and myself... She showed me all the different organs (clitoris, urethra, etc). I remember her touching my clitoris nonsexually to show me where it was. She showed me where the different parts eere on herself too.. At the time, I don't remember being bothered. But now, I just feel..so uncomfortable. I also remember her giving me the ""Masturbation isn't bad blah blah it's better than having sex before marriage"" talk and then giving me lube. She isn't an abuser, but I have such mixed feelings about all this, even if the intent wasnt (which it really wasnt) sexual



Thinking back on all of this, I cringe so hard and feel so shameful. My mom is also the opposite of sex positive. She says girls are sl(urs) and w(slurs) for having sex before marriage. And that sex is ""holy"" and sacred (okay I'm atheist no thank you). Someone please PLEASE provide me with some comforting reassurance that it is okay for me to take sexual charge of my own body. In my mind, I am totally comfortable with the idea of casual or premarital sex, but I get that sinking ""misbehaving"" feeling thinking about it, like muscle memory from all my mother's scary lectures. My mom has put this poison in my head and I need it out.. It makes me feel like my body is dirty. And she constantly reminds me that ""hope no boys will be lookin at you heehee"" as if it's funny whenever I dress up, which makes me feel like a little ornament. I just need to feel like i can reclaim my body and sexuality as MY own. Instead of feeling like my virginity has a gatekeeper (my mother). Please, teach me about sex positivity.

I feel like I can't engage in my hobbies and profession anymore.,73,19,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1e45cf/i_need_help_dealing_with_sexism_in_real_life_i/,"Hi SRSWomen! I hope this is the right place to post this. I really need help with this because I'm starting to feel like the only way I can live is hiding in the basement and never talking to anyone again. :(

So, some background: I'm in my mid-20's, I'm a computer programmer (for a living), and I love table top RPGS and video games. I also have the misfortune to be the only woman in most of these activities.

This is extra unfortunate because it's not uncommon for me to run into shitlords in real life. The overt shitlord to not shitlord ratio is about 1:10, which isn't horrible, but the shitlords are vocal and I feel vulnerable being the only women in these cases.

An example is back when I was in college, I had mostly male friends, as there weren't many other women in the computer science department. It was fine, but I'd get comments from some dudes about how these guys were only wanting to be my friend to ""get in my pants."" Other times, I'd hear people claim one of the other women in the class got a bad grade because ""she's a girl."" (I was fortunate to always be near the top of the class, but comments like this still impacted me because I knew everyone was judging me based on my sex first.)

A moment that particularly stands out in my memory is one time when we were all sitting in class and the professor announced that there was a local conference for women in computing going on in a couple of weeks; everyone was invited to go. Champion Shitlord of the class vocally announces after this, in front of everyone, ""where is the conference for men?!?!!"" The prof told him that women are underrepresented and deserve a conference and then he shut up, but I regret everyday not yelling at him in the middle of class. (I was the only woman in this class and I kept quiet.)

Transitioning more to my hobbies, this stuff has also happened a lot to me when I try to play table top RPGs. (like D&amp;D, ect) I'll go into local stores to find out if there are any events going on so I can try to network and find a group to join. But then when I go to these events, I'm one of the few women and there are always sexists somewhere. 

I remember one game that I went to during one of these events. The DM was a man and he gave out bonus points anytime anyone made a joke about ""boobies."" This was awful because I was the only woman in the group, which put me in an extra uncomfortable position. Men at the table would play female characters, but the play them as horribly objectified sexthings. (Ie, ""I fight in this bikini and sleep with the innkeeper"") I normally always try to play a male character to avoid any of these guys being lewd towards me/the character I'm playing as. 

This doesn't happen every time, but to be honest, reading SRS and Reddit has made me feel worse. I can't stomach doing my interests or even my profession anymore because I know these shitlords have as shitty opinions there as they do on Reddit. The guy who wanted a ""computing conference for men"" probably has all sorts of other awful opinions about women. And even though it doesn't happen every single time, when it does happen, it gets harder and harder to deal with.

Furthermore, when faced with going into an unknown situation full of people who may or may not be shitty, I start envisioning the worst case scenario. I try to tell myself the worst case scenario is not going to happen, but it's all I can focus on. I feel like I can't leave my own home and engage in my hobbies and profession without swimming against the current of sexism.

I've kept quiet through all of these experiences and I'm considering calling people out on it next time I see it, but I'm not a confrontational person and I don't want to inadvertently make things worse for myself. :(

This is pretty standard procedure among my friends, including those who wouldn't identify as feminist.

With men. ,74,21,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/zw0n9/i_think_i_have_a_problem_with_men/,"Throwaway because my boyfriend has typed my username into google before and snooped on my Reddit account before without my permission.. /sigh

So my question (for those who want to get right down to it) is.. 

How do you date men when you KNOW that a huge chunk of them are shitlords? 

Here's the long story if you want to read it: 

Over the past few years I've had 2 horrible relationships, one involving tons of manipulation, emotional abuse, and a night where he coerced me into sex and it was basically rape but I don't like to call it ""rape"" because when you say that word people flip out. The others involving being called fat, and unattractive for my weight. 

My current ""relationship"" (the 3rd one) is also not going well. I say ""relationship"" because its barely a relationship. We're just roommates who never have sex despite my desire to. We both work, and I'm the one who does everything else (cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc) with no help from him. We also never go anywhere, or do anything together because he doesn't want to. I'm always putting the effort into everything, its always on my shoulders. Just like it has been in the other relationships.. I'm always the one doing MORE, a lot more. Whenever I try to talk about things and discuss my feelings it never goes anywhere, and things never get fixed. Anyway, I could go on and on about the state of things but basically I'm stuck. I dont make enough money to move out/get my own place, and I don't have much family or friends that I can count on. 

A very old friend, someone I dated years ago in middle school, told me I can move in with him if I want. We've been friends for years, and he's a good person. He told me a few months ago he wants to get back together, and I told him we'd have to think about it, and that I'm still working through my current relationship and I don't know. 

But then he slowly started subtly pressuring me. He sent me an email with a bunch of almost-naked pictures of himself. I told him to chill out, that I still have a boyfriend. He started calling me ""babe"" and ""baby"" recently, and other pet names. He's basically acting like I'm his already even though I'm a couple states away and still dating someone. He's changed a lot from the guy I used to know. I didn't think I was giving off any hardcore signals or anything, just talking like we normally do.

I don't appreciate what he's doing to me. How can he think its ok after the bad relationships I've been in? How can he think its ok while I'm still in a relationship? After all the dumb decisions I've made to date assholes because apparently I can't pick the ""good ones""? 

After all I've experienced with bad relationships, I realized sexism. I realized that it was everywhere. I realized that yes, it involves me, it happens to me and almost all other women. It started to affect my life and everything I did and saw and said. I felt enlightened but at the same time I constantly feel outrageous anger at the world because of all the horrible shit women have to deal with. 

I think.. I think I hate men SRSWomen. 

I can't trust them anymore, not even my old friend of mine who I thought was patient and understanding, but now is just waiting for me to jump into his arms and ""save me."" And I don't know what to do. It's taken me a long time to come to this conclusion, and I'm still unsure about it. I do get annoyed when I see sexism towards men, and all the stupid stereotypes aimed at men. But its not nearly as powerful.

When I'm walking around, I can't help but look around me and think ""most of these guys are probably assholes who would hurt me if I dated them."" I assume the worst about them. I know it's horrible, and I really try to stop it, but I can't. On my real account, I subscribed to TwoX, and then I found this place and I like it more because things feel more ""real"" here. I can really discuss how I HATE what happens to women without guys coming into threads and getting massively upvoted. This subreddit is a true women's opinion. 

My two closest friends are bi, and they started dating each other a few years ago. They say that they don't want to ever date men again. When I tell them about my relationships and all the shit, they jokingly say I should become a lesbian with them. It kind of annoys me though because I can't just BECOME a lesbian. Yes, I like cock, yes I want to fuck/get fucked by men. Hell, I even identify as a ""submissive"" so I want a guy who can get kinky with me. 

I just don't know how I can ever date a guy again without ruining it by assuming the worst. How can I develop trust? Whenever I think I don't see any red flags, they're suddenly all there and it's too late. 

I know I'm making a big generalization about men, and it's not true or fair, and I constantly remind myself that there are good people out there. I just feel like the chances of nerdy, fat, ol' me finding them are quite low. Yes, I have self-esteem and self-worth issues, and dating has made them worse instead of better. When I read things, or hear things, or see things from people everywhere that are sexist, it just makes me hate men even more because its everywhere. 

How can I be heterosexual, and continue dating and having sex with men, when I don't like them? Should I aim for casual sex? I think that would be difficult for me to do since I'm not what guys consider ""attractive and worthy."" 

Is it just about finding someone that I like for who they are, instead of focusing on gender so much? Should I try getting over my man-hatred? After all, I don't think my problem is with men, it's with sexist men. But I think that most men are internally sexist and they're unaware of it.

I know it's really messed up and that by hating men I'm doing what men do to me. I'm being sexist. Sometimes I wish I hadn't realized sexism towards women, so I wouldn't have become sexist towards men. 

Sorry this has become so long. I love this subreddit, so any opinions would be awesome. 

**TL;DR: I basically hate men.. how can I continue dating and having sex with them when I don't trust them and make too many generalizations about them? How can I stop focusing on gender and sexism so much? How can I not let it affect my dating/sex life for the future?**",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_zw0n9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/zw0n9/i_think_i_have_a_problem_with_men/,

I made a throwaway for this because my brothers know my other account, and I think I need to vent in order to see some sense.

I have no idea what to do with my life and how to cope.

The context of my life:

I have been brought up in a very oppressive religious culture, but I hadn't realised this until I started dating my current boyfriend, who isn't a member of my church.

The amount of abuse I got for being with someone outside of this little cultural bubble is something that I could never have imagined. I've heard about 50 different versions of ""you have to convert him or dump him"" from *every single person who has found out I have a boyfriend.* They probe and they guilt trip and say awful things and gaslight me. Surprise surprise, the worst offenders are my family.

I also have a shitty relationship with my mother. To put it short (it would take many effort posts to explain why she is inherently a terrible human being, I'm sure you all know at least one person like her) since I have been with this boyfriend  her reactions have shown just the depth of shittiness that's within her.

I've realised how sexist and harmful my culture is, and I want to escape it. The problem is that I can't. I am still in higher education and sadly dependent on my parents. I have been incredibly sheltered, and worse, coddled into not even beginning to know how to become independent because I've been brought up to be a housewife - passed on from my family into the possession of whichever man can take my shit. The only two outcomes of me doing the things that would make me happy (remaining with my boyfriend and distancing myself from the religion) would be my family forcing me to continue church attendance and keeping me under constant surveillance and questioning, or ostracizing me from them and my friends. I don't know what I could possibly do in that situation.

Furthermore, I know that leaving the religion would break everyone's hearts, especially my Dad's and siblings', which I could never do. It seems like my only option is to live a lie and hate myself for the rest of my life, or hurt literally everybody I know. There is also no way I'll ever be able to stay with my boyfriend in the long run, because I know he doesn't want to convert, and I don't *want* him to convert.

I'm not sure if I've said anything apart from rambling. There's so much I need to get off my chest. I feel terribly depressed and have zero self-esteem due to living with my mother over the summer (feeling depressed is selfish and depression don't real according to her, by the way) and I hate hiding the way I feel about my religion from my boyfriend, but feel like I have to because if he knew how marginalised and shitty it made me feel, he'd hate the church and never join, and I guess in the back of my head I almost want him to join to make life easy, but I'm also screaming for him not to on the inside.

So basically, yeah. I feel like shit. and then I feel worse because I get told that I have no right to feel bad because I've had a good life and feeling depressed means that i'm ""ungrateful.""

Also, in the far future after my higher education is over, when I move the hell away, I still wont be free to not go anymore, because, and this sounds weird, my parents have connections all over the country and they'd know within two weeks if I wasn't going.

I am so sorry for the ramble. If you have any questions I'll answer, I am really bad at giving out details.

**EDIT:** I told my boyfriend everything. He's being incredibly supportive and it's lifted a huge weight off my chest.

Thank you so much for your support. Long live the Fempire!

**EDIT 2:** Thank you again. You've really been able to help me clear my head and I feel better and determined.

Possibly. It's basically the story of my experience in the workforce so far  (4 years) as a woman. In the telling, I hope I can get a bit of the anger off my chest that is fresh from this morning. It's a tale of some good things, however the shit just seems to smear all of it and ruin everything. If you stick with me throughout this entire thing, thank you so much in advance. I'm sharing this largely because I just want to get it all out but also because I want other women to know that they are not alone in their experiences. A lot of this is extremely personal. But I want you to know. I want this to be raw and I want you to feel less alone. I want that so bad. So, let's begin.

After I graduated from college with a degree in history I landed a lovely little, but extremely low paying job, at a local nonprofit. I was living at home and didn't have many expenses so I didn't mind the low pay. It was truly enjoyable and I was working with what I loved. Then the fall of 2008 happened and the economy went down the crapper. My lovely little nonprofit lost all of its funding and had to let everyone except for the executive go the next winter.

After months of soul crushing searching and rejection I landed a job as a CSR at a local startup company. It didn't thrill me that I wasn't utilizing my degree but I went at with my best face forward determined to make the most of the situation. I worked really hard and proved my dedication and initiative. Within 6 months I was made supervisor. I only had 2 direct reports but that's pretty awesome for 23! Both of them were older than me. One, a man who I hired pretty much as my first act as supervisor. He had presented himself as so friendly and as a team worker in his interview. In reality, he gave me nothing but a hard time. He challenged me at every turn, usually for no reason. I made no big decisions without the approval of my boss (also a man and mostly awesome) but when I presented that to my team he would act like my ideas were clearly inferior to anything he could come up with. When I told some of my guy friends at work (most friends there were guys, there weren't many women) they told me I was just being paranoid and I felt guilty and bad about taking things ""too seriously"".

That is until, 3 months into his job, he asked *my* boss to grab lunch together. He spent the entirety of that lunch complaining about me and basically telling my boss that he thought he could do my job much better than me. I know this because as soon as they came back my boss called me into his office and told me. *My boss* said what this guy had to say was some of the most misogynistic shit he's ever heard in his life. That he basically doesn't like me because I am both a woman and younger than he is  Boss said I needed to get a handle on him. I wanted to fire him. Boss said it's not that bad plus he's good at his job and they paid him a low salary so it was worth it to keep him around. That situation never really got better. Eventually when we bumped up his salary a bit he quieted down somewhat but I never felt completely ok with him. Imagine having to work everyday with a direct report that you know for an absolute fact does not respect you based on nothing other than your age and gender. It was the worst.

Less than a year from my promotion to supervisor I was again promoted to manager of the department.  I was managing a department at the age of 24. Now I had more people, mostly men older than me. That shit is fucking hard. One of those men was my friend at work before the promotion. It's a tricky line to walk anytime a work friend gets promoted to the others boss. I tried really hard to walk that line but we didn't get very far into it before all hell broke loose. Keep in mind, this individual was married. At no point did I ever view him as anything more than a friend. I never acted in any manner other than that of a friend. Even if I had feelings for him, which I did not, I would never reveal any hint of it due to the inappropriateness that would be inherent in that situation. Oh god, I wish I was making this shit up so, so badly. Well, about 3 weeks into my promotion he sent me an email to my personal address. The email basically asked me if I had any feelings for him and it's okay both if I do and I do not. Either way, we'd be cool but he just wanted to know. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

I was completely, and I mean completely, shocked. I didn't know how to properly react. I didn't want to embarrass him so I tried to play it as lightly as possible, like assuming he didn't want to know because if I said ""Yes, I do"" he would then be like ""Ok, great, me too!"" rather, he was just genuinely curious for completely innocent reasons. So I IM'd him like ""Hey, sorry, I hadn't checked my personal email for awhile so I only saw that just now. Anyway, no. Please don't worry. There's no feelings here for you. I'm sorry if at any time I acted in a way that would indicate otherwise but yeah. No need for you to worry!"" I FUCKING ACTED LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT. FUCK. He didn't even respond. He just shut his computer off, packed up, and left. I was like ""Uh...I hope that is not about this"" because it was at the very end of the day after all.

Important update, with my new manager status I was now reporting to the CEO who I soon came to learn was a complete shitboss. That night, this employee of mine sends an email to the CEO, cc's me. It blatantly says that he is feeling extremely unwell and will not be in work tomorrow. Not only that but he had a vacation coming up at the end of the month and he thinks he will get an early start on it so he'll be out for the next two weeks. Um, come again? Then I knew for certain. He was throwing a huge hissy fit. He had developed feelings for me, asked me how I felt, I said no, now he's throwing a huge fit because I don't return those feelings so he's not coming into work for 2 weeks. Again, this guy is married!!! What the fucking fuck. And emailing *my boss* I know he did on purpose specifically to get at me. To try and make me look bad to him.

So, of course, shitboss calls me into this office first thing in the morning demanding to know why ""your people"" don't seem to understand that they can't just email the CEO that they're peaceing out for 2 weeks. I was completely lost. I didn't know what to do. So I basically told him what happened. At this point I just wanted employee guy gone. Shitboss says it's unfair to do that without hearing shitployee's side of the story. I say that it will be extremely uncomfortable for me to have this individual stay on my team from now on. Shitboss says he will take things over from here and let me know what's going on. This was on a Friday. I spent the whole weekend in dread. What if shitployee was in on Monday? I was so anxious. I had trouble sleeping that night. I just wanted him gone and away from me forever. He wasn't there on Monday. And of course it couldn't possibly behoove Shitboss to give me a heads up or keep me alerted on the situation.

Finally, on Tuesday he called me into his office and said he met up with Shitployee over the weekend, that he was very sorry and that it was all a ""misunderstanding"" and he'd be back to work tomorrow. Also that he had evaluated the company structure and there was nowhere to move shitployee to so he would stay with me. fuck my life. I had to sign some completely bs paper that said I would not ""retaliate"" in any way with unwarranted punishing actions against shitployee. Fuck, I didn't want to punish him, I just wanted him long, long gone and far away from me forever. I spent 4 more months in uncomfortable awkwardness having this employee around until there were cutbacks demanded and he went on his way. LinkedIn tells me that he still looks at my profile at least once a month. Can you block people on LinkedIn???!?

I made the mistake of responding back nervously ""thanks"" in a slightly quavering voice that barely concealed my shock and fear. His response; ""you should follow me"". I didn't say anything and just sped up my pace by quite a bit, and saw him slowly trailing behind until I broke into a run which made him stop and merely stare at me. I slammed on the front door of my house and my roommate let me in. I barely avoided bursting into tears and explained what happened as we made sure to lock all of the doors and draw the blinds. When my roommate looked out later, there was no sign of the guy, so hopefully he's left; but I'm going to need to leave in about an hour to go to an event at our local LGBT center, and I'm still shaking, and it's raining, and I don't really have a good way of defending myself.

I should note that I'm a trans woman who's been on hormones for over 8 months now, but I was dressed in near-boymode when this happened (I was wearing a jacket that could pass for a men's jacket, skinny jeans, unisex shoes, and women's T-shirt; although I was also wearing noticeable makeup and have painted nails). This is always something I've been afraid of, and I've already had some lesser run ins with creeps since I've transitioned, but this is by far the scariest. I feel like I'm no longer safe in my own neighborhood (although I am moving a few blocks away this week), and more helpless and vulnerable than I ever have before. I had always liked to hope that I either would've ignored the harasser in this situation, or swiftly retorted with a well-deserved ""fuck off"", but I didn't. And please, no ""welcome to being a woman"", I've heard it a million times before and it really isn't comforting to be reminded that I'm now treated as a lesser member of the human race because of my gender.

I cannot tell you how good I feel knowing that this man was *considerate* in approaching me. 

I was sitting at the not very well lit metro station in the ""dangerous"" part of the county (re: minority, high crime, poverty). 
A man walked toward me and stopped about fifteen feet from me. He asked if I had change for a dollar. 

I've been in situations before where opening I've been fairly certain that opening my wallet or admitting I have a phone will result in a mugging. His body language made me comfortable and I didn't even immediately pay attention to it. 

He was at about 3 O'clock - not behind me (I could see him), not directly in front of me (didn't feel cornered). His body was turned slightly to the side, away from me and he did not make any sharp direct eye contact. 

I told him that I might, took out my wallet, counted four quarters. I put my wallet away and only then did he move closer to me and he did so slowly. He was about five feet away, still only minor direct eye contact, and set the dollar on the bench I was sitting on. That's the part when I *knew* that he was aware that his approaching me where he did would have raised a small red flag and he took the effort to be not make me feel uncomfortable. I reached out and handed him the quarters and put away the dollar. He then said his thank yous and went about his way. Despite eventually taking the same bus he did not linger around me.

The poster (not sure who it was) basically said that she enjoyed dressing sexily at Halloween and as third-wave feminists we shouldn't be policing what people can and can't wear. The poster then deleted the topic. I think this is a really interesting and important discussion to have so I have revived it. Here is the comment that I typed out in reply to the poster before the link was deleted:


I feel like the sentiment is less ""let's bash women who wear sexy costumes"" and more ""let's look at the reason that sexy costumes are THE prevalent type of costume for women on halloween: patriarchal norms of beauty + pleasing the penis"". I am a third wave feminist and I support people's right to wear what ever the hell they please. I also am a VERY strong believer in critically analysing the REASON behind wearing certain things and feeling certain ways about certain types of clothing. For example, when women say that they like to wear makeup because it makes them feel confident etc, I feel it's VERY important to analyse whether their feeling confident in their make up is a symptom only of their being subconsciously swayed by patriarchal norms of beauty etc, OR whether they are aware of the influence of patriarchal norms of beauty and in awareness of/despite these norms they still feel confident in their make-up. 

Similarly, if women want to wear sexy costumes because they feel confident in those costumes I feel it's extremely important to question whether they feel confident in the costumes as a result of patriarchal norms of beauty or if they feel confident in them in awareness/despite these norms. 

I don't see anything incoherent in being a feminist and wanting to dress sexily. I DO see something incoherent in being a feminist and refusing to or not wanting to analyse why you want to dress sexily. If you are aware of the role that dressing sexily has typically played in the patriarchy (aka pleasing the penis, objectifying/over-sexualising women etc) and in this awareness still think FUCK I LOVE MY SEXY HERMIONE COSTUME - FUCK THE PATRIARCHY! That's completely awesome in my books. I'm just wary of people who say: ""I want to do x because it makes me feel confident"" but don't take the time to analyse why it might make them feel confident. 

I hope I'm getting my point across. I don't want to come off as sl*t-shamey - that's TOTALLY not my point - I just want to advocate for awareness of patriarchal norms whilst participating in events/etc that CAN be problematic.

I'm surprised he didn't use the word ""misandry"", especially given his posts/comments on MR.
Why do they think that 2X is misandrist? Why? Because we don't talk about men all the time? Because we point out that sometimes men can be assholes too? Or is it because every now and then there will be a feminist comment or post?

From the alleged suicide note posted on MR that lead to a huge anti-SRS circlejerk to the constant derailment from those involved in the MensRights movement (includes women too), 2X has become a target of accusations of misandry.

The other day, I had tightened the top on a can of PVC glue and when he double checked to make sure it was on correctly, he said. ""Wow, you're strong!"" And then, after a pause: ""for a girl...""

After he made that comment, I said, ""First off, don't call me a girl, call me a woman.""

He laughed and put his hands up and said, ""OK, you're right, you're a woman.""

Then I said, ""And that comment was...""

He looked at me, and I could tell he knew what I was going to say next, which made me super nervous. ""And that comment was...?"" he prompted.

""Well...it was sexist, Boss! It was a sexist comment.""

He raised his eyebrow at me. ""How was it sexist?""

""Yes it was! You were tightening a top and that takes strength and men are typically stronger than women --"" he began, but then I was feeling so nervous and self-conscious I just blurted out, ""Never mind, forget it, just forget it, what do I need to do next?""

I guess...maybe it's because he makes it sound like I succeeded at something in spite of my gender? Like...being female is what holds women back from being as strong or stronger than men.

Come by and meet your fellow SRSisters and have a fun place to chat.

Please understand that this is a public channel and nothing you say is guaranteed to remain private or in confidence. Many peoples' clients log automatically, or the channel may be logged explicitly. Note that revealing personal information about yourself including linking to your social networking profiles is prohibited for your safety. All the regular subreddit rules apply.

If you're an IRC pro, here is the important info:


**Server:** irc.synirc.net


**Channel:** #srsw


[**Click to join!**](http://irc.lc/synirc/srsw/IShouldChangeMyName@@@@) browser-based IRC- just enter a nickname where it says ""IShouldChangeMyName????""


For people new to IRC, here's a tutorial to hopefully help you get started:


http://irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html


------

**How to register your nickname and get a vhost:**


Registering your nickname is a good idea, because it makes it so other people can't steal it and pretend to be you. Plus it allows you to set up a vhost, which is the fun part. To get started simply type:


/msg nickserv help register


The process involves picking a password and confirming an email address to use in case you lose your password. Make sure to use an email account you actually have access to, you'll need to confirm it!


when you message nickserv for help registering, it will tell you to do something like this:


/msg nickserv register passwordhere youremail@here 


Once you do that, check your email for a message from SynIRC, and follow the instructions in that email.


Your nick is now registered! In the future, you can ""log in"" by typing /msg nickserv identify passwordgoeshere. Make sure not to do this in an open IRC channel, in case you accidentally forget the slash, which would allow folks to see your password.


**Now for the VHost!**

Vhosts (also called virtual hosts) are a lot of fun, and are a very good idea for your safety- making it so others can't see your IP address.

To request a vhost, just type /msg hostserv request my.vhost.goes.here

Of course, replace ""my.vhost.goes.here"" with something more expressive of your personality. Your vhost must look like a domain name (though it doesn't have to end in .com or .org or .info or any other registered top level domain) and not be any attempt to spoof an administrator. One of the IRC network operators will approve your vhost in anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or two (usually the former). You will get a notice when this happens. Afterwards, activate your vhost:


/msg hostserv on


Some examples of vhosts other SRSisters have gone with:

snuggles.and.snuggles.and.snuggles

all.aboard.the.benmobile

one.woman.pride.parade

angry.humorless.fembot

So you can make up your own vhost. Have fun with it!

And thats it, now you have a nick that belongs to you, and a fun vhost. Whenever you ""sign in"" in the future by typing /msg nickserv identify passwordgoeshere, your vhost will automatically activate. Its best to identify to nickserv before joining channels for this reason. If you run into trouble or have any other IRC related questions, feel free to ask the channel, someone who can help will probably be around.

We stopped and made small talk and would let our dogs play for a few minutes, then go on our separate ways. This happened for about a month. He met my boyfriend while he was out walking our dog, and he knows we live together, just like I know he has a wife and a son.

In hindsight, the rest of this is ridiculously creepy. After the first month or so of pleasantries, this dude starts appearing whenever I'm out walking my dog. The complex is small so I don't think anything of it. Then he starts hugging me when we cross paths, which I don't think much of because he's a married dude who just likes to stop and chat, and his hugs were never lingering or creepy. He also starts asking me how often do me and my boyfriend go out, and what am I cooking for dinner, and do I keep the house clean, whatever. At this point I think ""wow, what a sexist asshole"" because if I tell him we're eating leftovers or whatever he gets upset, as if I'm personally offending him by not cooking every night. Well, a couple of days ago he asked for my phone number so he could text me when he'll be outside, in case my dog wants to go play with his dog. So I give him my number, and now I get text messages *every day* from him. Asking if I'm working, what am I cooking for dinner (I swear to God he wants an invitation he's not getting), where am I, etc. I have not responded to a single one of his text messages, namely because I work 11 hour days and I have better things to do than give him an around-the-clock menu of what's available at my apartment.

Last night, I'm taking Leo outside when this guy and his dog walk up. They play for a while, and the dude starts asking the usual questions: where have I been, what's for dinner, are me and my boyfriend going out since it's Saturday, etc. I tell him no, we're not going out or doing anything, and I haven't decided what to fix for dinner. Then he gets all super creepy and tells me: ""Well, if you were single, I'd take you out all the time. You need to get rid of that boyfriend of yours already."" What the fuck, dude. I just want your dog to play with my dog, did you have to turn this into a thing so you can try and pick me up? I mean, ever since the text messaging started I'd been getting leery of him, but that just took the fucking cake. I don't need you hitting on me just because I like your dog and I stop to talk to you every once and a while.

Suffice to say I don't go outside when he's around anymore, but it really sucks that this dude had to spoil our pleasantries by being a complete fuckwad. I know he just tolerated being nice to me for the first month so he could ""feel me out"" as a match for him, and then decided to drop that shit. Has this ever happened to you, SRSSisters?

We've went through so much together, including a stalker that fucked me up enough emotionally that I tried to ditch our friendship and me begging her to leave a guy who turned out to be incredibly abusive. We've remained awesome friends through it all. And through it all, while discussing life and living as a woman, she's maintained.. ""I never want to have kids.""

I'm not really the opposite but in some ways I, for all intents and purposes, am. I'm a person who's loved kids and whined many a time about baby rabies (the overwhelming and unexpected desire to have kids NOW). I'm not ashamed to say that at the age of 16, I had baby rabies. I'm also not ashamed to say that when I got mistakenly pregnant at age 19, I had an abortion and though I look back on that decision with sadness, it's not a decision I'd take back. But... I'd love to be a mom. I look forward to it. I worry about it, but I want it for myself. 

My best friend found the person of her dreams. She's marrying him soon-- I'm a maid of honor -- and he has 2 kids from a previous marriage and she is, in my opinion, an amazing step parent. We've had many a talk about the consequences of being a step parent, and how fulfilling and frustrating it must be.. from my perspective of having a step parent and her perspective of being one. Imagine my shock then, when she sat me down and stated to me, ""After we get married, he's getting the vasectomy reversed, and we're going to try for a kid.""

We sat there looking at eachother... and then she started to cry, and I began to cry, and we cried to eachother while holding one another laughing and crying about why were crying.
My best friend's mother died 2 years ago. My mother died when I was a 3 year old. This, turns out, is the key part of our responses. For us... this is huge. For me, accepting and pursuing motherhood is working past the trauma I felt at growing up without my mother. And for her, this is her accepting and pursuing motherhood despite a present absence she will never fill. The bottom line... Motherhood is a loaded thing for many of us women. We connected deeply and frankly over this, and I look forward to both of us having our kids and having one another to lean on emotionally during that time, but this was not the topic that would ever be broached over coffee and cookie exchanges.
I can't speak to the experiences of other women-- transwomen, lesbians, etc. I just imagine there's something of the same there.. this inpenetrable veil of ""the way things are"" that makes you feel like an outsider because you are pursuing and becoming motherhood in a way that society doesn't acknowledge, accept, or otherwise make you feel is ""okay"".

I'd just love a space for people to talk about their worries about impending motherhood, future motherhood, current motherhood, or past motherhood where that kind of privilege isn't assumed. Not every mother becomes a mother due to her biologic ability, and not every mother becomes a mother because she no longer cares about her trial-filled past. So many women are cast off and marginalized even within their own subcultures, I just really would love to hear opinions and input from women dealing with these same issues.

I haven't exactly had the best life. I had a shit childhood, I was dirt poor, my education is *still* pretty rocky in terms of basic English grammar and whatnot, and I really feel just horrible about it.

People are always like, ""Well, at least you're not a starving child in Africa"" (which is such a gross thing to say, btw), but, like, I *was* a starving child in India. But if I bring that up, 1) people think I'm just scarred and irrational because of how I grew up, 2) I feel like I'm using that as ammunition instead of as an actual fact, and 3) It's so *humiliating* for people to know that the pictures they see on tv with celebrity endorsements is so damn similar to how I grew up.

AND why on earth should my argument be any less valid whether or not I was homeless? Most of my conversations have to do with women of color *in America* for god's sake! I'm a woman of color in America *who just so happens* to have also lived in India!

I'm not mad at myself. I actually used to be pretty proud of myself. I broke out of my poverty, I moved to America, I've got a wonderful job as a journalist, and I feel really empowered. But now I'm just frustrated that I didn't have the chance to live in America or wear shoes or get vaccinations. I really feel like the lack of western education I've had is severely impacting me and how people chose to respect me. 

I mean, it's not like I'm not proud of myself anymore. I'm still really impressed that I managed to get as far as I have, nominated for Pulitzers, writing fantastic pieces, and living in an apartment where I have a television AND a laptop AND an iPad AND a smartphone AND **A FAN IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM!** I think that's awesome! I've even taught myself english! I've made it so far and I'm so proud of myself for that!

But the confidence it gave me is really dwindling. People start using my lack of proper grammar against me. They say I should read more or look things up more or actually bother to learn. Which is so unfair because I had to go through so much crap just to get out of my childhood situation, and I *did* get educated and go to college and all that. 

It just wasn't fast enough because I had to catch up on so much and I had so few resources. And, whether or not I went through all of that, why should my arguments seem any less valid just because it's not in Oxford-worthy english?

It's incredibly humid here, which often means that even though your body is efficient at cooling itself down through sweating, your sweat doesn't evaporate as well so you can't naturally cool down easily.  

I have been struggling to find proper running shorts in my size. This contributed to my overheating. At first, I thought I couldn't wear anything shorter than knee length shorts. Mostly because of my own body image hang ups and yknow, fat people shouldn't show their fat because they should be ashamed, bullshit I've been sold for a long time. I had some from REI but one day I took them off after overheating and they felt *warmer than my body* to the touch. Not normal. I returned them (they have a 100% satisfaction return policy which is wonderful. They had no compression shorts that fit me, most of their running shorts were booty shorts.  

For a long time, as a Large/Extra Large sized lady, I've felt like I don't have permission to wear certain things. When I was younger and smaller, when I wore shorts I was harassed a lot so I stopped wearing them. Overheating like I have been meant I had to look into wearing shorter shorts.  

After having an online order screwed up by Champion I was pissed off about my clothing situation. I went to Dick's and found several pairs of Under Armor shorts, one pair of Nike Dri-Fit (not as great as there is a seam straight up the crotch). The best fitting pair of the Under Armor shorts was a size Large compression short, in white.  

I wore those shorts today and I really didn't care that you could see my ""nude"" (really tan-ish color) underwear. The world could stare at my fat ass in those white shorts, it was fantastic. I didn't overheat, I felt good and I could run. It was amazing. Showing what my body is capable of has always helped me love and accept it. I'm so glad I feel good running again.

I had walked to the corner store to get something for my mum because she wasn't feeling well and of course, i ran in to one of my childhood bullies and her horrible, catty friends (imagine Regina George's friends from Mean Girls but a bunch of pony-obsessed 10 and 11 year olds in netball uniforms). Some background: I suffer OCD and anxiety and struggled with an eating disorder through most of my teen years, to the point where I ended up in hospital with anorexia. I was rail-thin and this girl would grab my butt and thighs and call me a ""skinny s---"" and taunt me for being thin and tell me to commit suicide and constantly ask ""how much weight have you lost today you anorexic s---? lol kill yourself you ugly b---"". Of course, school overlooked it because her mother was seriously ill (her mum is a great woman, I love her and she's one of the people I look up to because she is amazing) and put it down to this girl acting out because her mum was sick and not that the girl herself was just being a horrible person. Her friends made my primary school years a living nightmare. 

So, I ran in to her at the store when I was lining up to pay for my item. She tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I remembered her. She said to me ""you used to be so skinny and pretty, now look at you, you're so fat and ugly hahaha what happened to you &lt;redacted&gt;? Now you're a fat d[homophobic slur]. Always thought you were a lesbian."" I would've punched her but I'm sick and I can't deal with an assault charge right now so I just told her to leave me alone. I wish someone had said something like ""shut the fuck up and leave her alone"", but they just pretended nothing was happening and it was really awkward. She walked off when I left the store laughing with her friends and they were laughing about my weight and my figure and making nasty comments about my family (my father is obese and my mother is too, but they have health issues making it difficult for them to lose weight and those girls know this.)

I was finally starting to feel like I was done with my past and my body issues, like I wasn't bothered about how I looked any more, I was happy, then she appeared out of nowhere to pick on me again. I never told my parents what happened because there'd be a huge shitstorm and I don't think my family or hers need that right now. I feel like the lovely people here might understand what I'm going through. I feel like I can't win. Everyone called me slurs when i was anorexic, they're still calling me slurs even though I look healthy. I was a ""s---""  for being anorexic and now I'm a ""fat b***"" for gaining weight and being healthy. I hope this is the right place to talk about this, I can delete it and post it elsewhere if suggested.

I hate going to the gym, I hate working out, I hate all of it. I have never been very coordinated or athletic and going to the gym makes me feel like I'm on display in a zoo. (""Ah, yes, here we have the pink_freudian_slip, the silliest of all animals. She is sweating more than any other animal in here and she's turning a frightening shade of red. Also, her gym outfit isn't cute and her running shoes are dorky. Feel free to gawk and take photos."") 

As much as I hate working out, I know that it's important to move my body! I want to be healthy and take good care of myself so I usually force myself to go and then I think about how much I hate running while I'm on the elliptical. But not today! No no no! Today I took a Fuego (knockoff Zumba) class at my university gym. 

Only women showed up to take the class, which made me feel like I was in a safe space from the start. The instructor was male but he isn't interested in women, so I didn't feel like I was on display for anyone at all. The very first thing the instructor said was, ""Ladies, for the next hour I want you to forget about working out, that's a dirty word. We are here to have fun and dance and feel fierce."" We started doing all of these awesome, fun dance moves to popular songs and I was feeling great. We did a lot of booty popping and body rolls and the instructor made a point to say, ""Work it! Let yourself be fierce and powerful! Look in the mirror, you are all some strong, fierce ladies!"" I enjoyed having a place where I could shake my booty and do some serious body rolling and not feel like I was being seen as a sexual object- I was popping my booty just because it's fun! 

The instructor encouraged us with really great, positive body image stuff during the entire class and he kept reminding us that we were strong and powerful which was really helpful because it made me want to dance even more! At the end of class the instructor said ""I want to end this class with something that I think is really important, I am so tired of hearing people putting other people down and telling us that we're not good enough or smart enough or pretty enough. That's not true! You are enough, just the way that you are. I want you all to look in the mirror and, on the count of three, tell yourself that you are enough!"" Hearing an entire class of women shouting, ""I am enough!"" almost made me cry from joy. After we told ourselves we were enough we got into a big circle and our instructor told us to think of negative things that bring us down and, on the count of three, yell as loud as we could and let the negative things that were holding us down go. As we were leaving the instructor told each of us that he was proud of us because we were healthy, strong, powerful, fierce and enough. 

I left class feeling like a million bucks. I got my body moving to some bumpin tunes and I really did feel powerful, strong, healthy, and fierce! I had such a great time, I cannot wait to go back on wednesday! This is how all gym classes should be!!

And saw this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/11y4vx/lets_talk_about_the_negative_stigma_associated/). I wanted to see just how the label creep affected the male counterparts to our societies but what I got was comments aimed at the fact women shouldn't be so judgmental towards men. That we have to unlearn the fact that men are capable of raping us and that not all men will. I was appalled. 

Woman from infancy to adulthood are told that men have the power to rape and harm us physically, that coupled with our size makes having any strange man approach us be uncomfortable for us. I could have lived if they had dropped it at this but for them to say that we need to grow out of it because it is a stupid lesson just horrified me. (I know Reddit is filled with twenty year old white boys with a skewed image of the world but bear with me.) Instead of the men telling themselves that they have the power to not only ruin but destroy a person's life with that is between their legs, they push it onto us not to be put into that situation then get offended when we act wary when they wish to hit on us. I am sorry, it just blew me away that their mindset was like that.

I am a woman and I know every single decision I make can potentially hurt those around me. I can make the decision to take advantage of a drunk male friend and molest him. I can get behind the wheel of a car drunk and kill someone but I cannot believe that these men are not willing to sit down and *think* that maybe they could ruin someone's life just because they are bigger and they wanted to get laid. It blew me away. I am still unbelieving about what I read.

For them to tell us it is a stupid lesson that needs to be unlearned. This isn't like peeing sitting down. This is an intense social conditioning woman have had since *birth*. It would be like telling us to stop listening to what our instincts are telling us. It would be like telling us to stop a function of our body. This wasn't taught to us, this was conditioned to severely and so heavily that it is part of who we are. 

I don't care that you hate it that you make me uncomfortable when you approach me in a bar. I don't care that you think it makes me an unreasonable bitch because my safety comes before your feelings. I don't care because until you man up and realize that you have the ability to rape someone with what is between your legs, I will remain wary of you, I will be uncomfortable when you approach me at a bar or any other social setting. I will because I have be so severely conditioned, it is part of my psyche.

But the thing that pissed me off the most about that entire conversation was despite them saying 1 in 10 men have raped someone, no one, *no one* mentioned that 1 in *3* women have been raped or molested by a male figure. I hate to say it but I have been molested and did it affect how I view men? Yes. Does it make me more wary? Double yes. Does it make me a bad person because I hurt your feelings by trying to avoid that situation again? *Hell no!*

I couldn't believe it. They were sprouting off that women shouldn't be so wary and they conveniently forgot the one statistic that proves them wrong. That 1 in 3. I'm not the only one, my two close friends have been. That 3 out of 3 but yet I shouldn't be wary when a strange guy comes over to me, calls me sexy and hands me a strange drink. Absolutely appalling. 

I think my little rant is done now. I'm sorry but I had to unload because I couldn't do it there. I would have but I have a rule that is the newest comments are over four hours old, I leave it be. I just needed to rant about it because of how absolutely idiotic their thought process was. I thank them for trying but I would also like to inform them that they failed miserably in trying to understand what women have to go through. A stupid lesson that we need to unlearn my ass.

1344481232.0,52,self.SRSWomen,xx3v1,Thank you all so much for your kind words and thoughts about my puppy Fritz! Here's a quick update on his status.,52,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/xx3v1/thank_you_all_so_much_for_your_kind_words_and/,"My husband surprised me this evening by bringing Fritz home! I was so thrilled to see him, because we visited him at the vet's last night and it was awful - he anxiety-whined the whole time and begged to leave the room. The vet called my husband at work and said it would be OK to take him home today, so he decided to surprise me.

So it turns out that the scratch on Fritz's cornea was twofold. He tore a flap off (sort of like a Lasik flap), so they put him under and sliced that off. The thing they were worried about was a deeper scratch on the bottom part of the cornea - they think it's about 50% deep. After watching him for 48 hours they determined that he didn't need intensive corneal graft surgery at this time, but we now have a long road ahead of us for the healing process.

Fritz has five different types of eyedrops that need to be administered four times daily. He also has two pills - one antibiotic, one for pain - that we give him in the morning and the evening. He does pretty well with taking the drugs, but he hates the drops. It takes both of us to administer them. My husband's going to have to drive home from work every day (hour-long round trip) so we can do this together. But it should only last for three weeks, so even though it will be a pain for all of us it'll hopefully go fast.

Fritz isn't allowed to play, go outside by himself, or go for walks that last longer than a few minutes. He has the lovely e-collar on (but at least it's transparent, so he still has his peripheral vision). He's exhausted, the same way I always am after a hospital visit (you never really seem to *rest* in hospitals). The not playing part is going to be rough, because he's such an active pup and he loves his playtime, but my husband ran out tonight and bought him a TON of chewy toys, bully sticks, and greenies that will hopefully keep him occupied.

The main thing I wanted to convey, though, is how much your kind thoughts and words meant to me and my husband over the past day or so. We don't have kids (childfree, woo!), so Fritz is our bebe. I got a really nasty PM from a shitlord making fun of me and Fritz, but that was entirely canceled out by the support and goodness you've given me here.

first of all I'd like to say that I'm glad there's at least one place on reddit where I can come as a woman and know I'm not going to get shit on for my gender or sexual orientation. that's fucking rare. 

On to the question: mostly im wondering how you all deal with men. this is probably a very childish question and i apologize in advance, but i need to know. I need to know how you do it. I just finished reading through parts of that askreddit rape apologists thread (i won't link because you've probably seen it and if you haven't please don't destroy your night by looking at it). And i just don't fucking get it. As a bisexual who has very few men friends I just don't even understand how anyone can do it. And i know its irrational but I cant even look most men in the eye because of these kinds of things. I'm scared of them and I'm scared of being close to them. I hate being bisexual but i can't change my attraction, I just don't act on them. 

men so are differently socialized and aggressive and frankly the attitudes many straight men have toward women disgust me. they make me feel like an object or like if I'm not physcially attractive i am good for nothing at all. most won't even look at me to acknowledge my existence, and i feel so much resentment toward many men. I was sexually abused by my father and belittled by many other men in my life to the point where i wish I was invisible to everyone of the male persuasion. And reading that fuckig thread has made me so much angrier. I was doing so well about being logical toward my feelings but now I just want to check out of the fucking world. i don't want to live in a society that is so goddamn misogynist. i don't want to live in a culture where I am comodified. I don't want to have the male gaze be the judge of my worth by society at large. I just feel like no matter what I do I will always been seen as inferior to men and tbh most of my experience with men have shown me that they think themselves to be superior on the basis of their gender anyway 

I don't know, this got way too long. honestly any words of advice would be welcome. I just dont feel like I can deal with this anymore. I'm just so fucking bitter and i know it's unfair to take it out on an entire gender. I just am so angry.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_x80e1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x80e1/how_do_you_deal_with_men_a_ramble_question/,

Things continued on there, much better for me now with shitployee gone. That is, up until about a year ago. A year ago, they did some restructuring and I no longer had to report to the CEO. I was now reporting to a new hire, a marketing guy (haha Im not marketing!) that everrrryybody loved. They looked to him as the savior of the company and he did sell himself that way after all. Everyone loved him. Except me. ""Why, MsKim?,"" you might ask yourself. Because he sexually harassed me. Here's the true and totally fun story of how I ended up leaving this company. One day NewShitBoss asked me to help interview some candidates for a role he was hiring. I did and happily. The next day, he asked me who had I had liked most. I told him. He says, in front of another employee and friend, ""Heh heh. Yeah? I thought you'd like him because he's hot."" Um, excuse me what? First of all, inappropriate. Second of all, no. I think my mouth dropped to the floor. He repeated this again in a meeting I was having with my entire team. ""Oh yeah, update. We're hiring a new marketing guy. His name is employee mcperson. Yeah, Kim even helped pick him. She liked him because he's hot.""  Again, whattttttttttttttt???? 

Later on, that same day while I was assisting a customer in a chat support he comes up ""Hey, Kim. Do you have a second?"" ""Hey NewShitBoss, not right this second because Im in the middle of a support request but soon"". ""Oh what? Is, like, the guy you're chatting with hot or something?"" Again, can I say What the fucking fuck? He took me out to lunch. When I stood up the back of my skirt was sticking up and hte lady at the table over called me over to pull it down. How nice! NewShitBoss notices and goes ""Did that lady just molest you? That must happen to you all the time"". Ok, final straw. 

Now, surprise surprise! This company didn't really have any sort of formal HR structure so I went to the top mgmt guy that kind of oversaw that and who was also my friend. I told him of these encounters. *He told me I was making a big deal out nothing and that things go in my ears one way and into my brain another*. Not satisfied, I went to the CEO. He asked me what I wanted done. I said I just wanted a firm no harrassment policy established for the entire company and someone to especially tell NewShitBoss to not do this shit but please, please, please never mention my name in connection to this stuff. This was on a Friday. I was then out for a week of vacation.

When I came back half of my team and responsibilities had been taken from me. I was back to doing just what I had done on the supervisor level. I had been demoted in all but name with no explanation offered. I had received a glowing performance review only a month ago. Hmmmm what could possibly be going on? Yet still, even though I was extremely disspirited I soldiered on trying to continue to do a good job but feeling an increasingly very hostile attitude from the superiors. I had a 2 day vacation again at the end of the month. When I came back from that *all* of my responsibilities were now being done by other people. No one said a word to me. On the day I returned both NewShitBoss and ShitCEO walked right by me several times and ignored me. NewShitBoss eventually came up to me and said 'Hey!"" all smiles and excitement and ""hahah"" as he usually presented himself. ""Do you mind writing up some detailed process documents on what you do every day on a day to day basis?"" Are you kidding me? I am not that oblivious. The signs were flashing at me in big red lights. I checked NewShitBoss' calendar and he didnt keep it private. I saw several meetings on ""Meet to discuss Kims dept."" and in the details it said how the meeting was basically about how they were divying up my responsibilities.

I had been at this company for 2 1/2 years. I had put blood, sweat and tears into it. I was the only night and weekend support they had for the entire time I worked there and I never asked a cent for it (though I should have). I was one of the only 3 people who ever received a special employee recognition award. I was a manager at 24! And I had put up with some really terrible shit b/c I really cared about the company, I took pride in my good work and I wanted to take the company far. Fuck.

The very next day ShitCEO called me into his office and officially placed me on a 30 day probation. The official reason? ""Lack of team spirit"". This talk was one of the most demeaning and sad experiences of my life. He proceeded to rip into me. Largely, with a lot of unfounded accusations about my performance and motivations. And I just didn't have the strength and resolve to defend myself. When I tried he just shouted down at me harder. He had been mean and demeaning to me all year but this was the worst now. His style of management is to criticize and blame unequivocally. He had sent me to report to NewShitBoss b/c he could see that I hated reporting to him in hopes of me gelling with that guy better but as you know from above it didn't work out. And he blamed that all on me. 

So guess what I did? I lawyered right the hell up. The day I went and met with the lawyer...was one of the happiest experiences of my life. ShitCEO had emailed me an ""official"" list of reasons why I was on probation after that meeting. The lawyer took one look at it and she literally laughed. She then dictated our letter to him into her recorder. Listening to her dictate that letter....wow, I just can't even tell you. It was the greatest feeling. Someone was sticking up for me. Someone was standing and saying ""No, this is ridiculous and it will not pass. Nice try, buddy. But no way, jose.""  He was getting told to the millionth. 

I'll tell you, being treated like a stranger in a place that was your home for long is terrible. Simply terrible. I was having trouble sleeping and eating. The blatant hostility...I just wanted it to be over. I didn't even have a strong feeling of ""vengeance"" or anything like that. I just wanted to stand up for myself and then get as far away from that place as possible. The day the letter arrived in the office I spent the day shaking...just waiting for ShitCEO to get it. And he did. I watched him open it, out on the floor in front of everyone and I watched him go to his office and slam the door. The whole time I was shaking still. I just wanted it to be over. A couple of days later the negotiations between the lawyers was resolved and I was able to walk out of there forever, victorious. But it was a shallow victory. I would have preferred the entire episode had never, ever happened.

Worst of all, at the time. The higher up dude who was kind of HR and my friend...never talked to me again. He de-friended me on Facebook, the whole deal. From the day the letter arrived til I left he stopped speaking to me. For a long time this really bothered and affected me. We were (or at least I had thought) good friends. A couple of months ago I eventually was able to be like ""Yeah, no. fuck you, guy."" I no longer care about him.


It took me almost 6 months grueling, depressing months to find another job. I've been at my current job for about 4 months now. It's a completely new field and I'm pretty much back at entry level. I don't mind. The job is challenging which I find rewarding and it's kind of like vacation not having to manage any other people :) But recently, things have gotten a bit shittastic. After going through all of that earlier stuff though I just dont have the heart to continue on this tale and it has gone on wayyyyy long enough already. Maybe later I'll fill in on what's going on now. Rest assured, it's misogynistic bullcrap. Basically, no one is taking me seriously or letting me contribute in a meaningful way even though I am jumping up and down saying ""Let me help!!!""

Wow. I wish I had made all of this up. I wish none of it had ever happened to me. But every single word here is true. 

I saw some shitlord MRA post in /r/askfeminism (haha, I know, right?) a couple of weeks ago ""Can anyone tell me what actual discrimination women in the West experience today?"" and then a whole list of all the things he wouldn't accept as actual discrimination. FUCK. YOU.  In TwoX, when I told an extremely abbreviated version of the NewShitBoss story, the shitlord's reply was ""Anecdotes aren't data and for very good reason. Your personal experience of something doesn't make it true."" Oh hey! Fuck you too!

I wish all of you the strength to stand up for yourselves and take this sort of shit from no one. I wish it for myself as well. I love every single one of you and I *especially* love you if you read this entire thing.

I don't know where else to go.

To start, I don't have any problem with women as exotic dancers, and think clubs where these women own their own labor (absolutely not the case at the club they went to) are pretty cool. 

My issue is more that these are a group of guys that I really like, consider friends, and they decided to celebrate a 21st birthday this way. Where they go to a place where the owners are horrible and abusive and the men that patronize the place treat these women like objects, throw money at them and say awful things. And treat it like it's some sort of rite of passage, to go and objectify women (at a really shady club). That's completely unacceptable to me. I tried explaining this to him, and he's always very open to my thoughts on these things and he seemed to feel bad but I still don't feel ok. I don't know if I feel comfortable hanging out with all of those guys. I know I have my own hang-ups that are probably making this a bigger deal in my head than it should be, but I just feel completely unsettled, my blood pressure is really high right now (my coworkers belittling someone's OCD is not helping). I don't know what to do or how to better vocalize this. 

That was so poorly worded. Ugh.

EDIT: We spoke about this for awhile this afternoon. My issue was not so much with him going (he got dragged along as part of the birthday celebration, I understand that). It was more with how uncomfortable I felt about his friends, who are also my friends, wanting to celebrate by going to a strip club that is known to be a bad environment for the people working there, and also for wanting to celebrate by using women as entertainment. He agreed with me and offered to talk to them about it, knowing that I would probably get written off. He reassured me that he felt the same way about the club, didn't like it or want to be there, and can understand, or at least empathize, why I feel unsettled by the whole thing. So I'm pretty satisfied with his response.

ok, I met up with the mutual friend who put me up to this date with this person as just friends. Anyway, we were talking and we got onto the subject of that guy, and she asked why I wasn't interested as he had only told her I had said no, I told her he creeped me out with the constant asking out and when we actually went on the date I didn't particulary like how handsy he was.

She got a bit quiet and said: ""I need to tell you something.""

He learned that she was coming to visit me and tried to get my friend to take him with her to see me. She said no, obviously. He has apparently been doing this a lot. And then, this is the really messed up bit that has me in such a state and so grossed out, she told me that he had recently broken up with a Ukrainian girl, and when they had sex, he couldn't finish, and they stopped seeing each other. Then, he saw my photo on facebook, pressured my friend into setting us up and basically wanted to use me as a fucking experiment to see if he could 'Finish' this time and prove he was a man. Put this together with this sort of obsessive thing where he keeps trying to get people to take him to me, has made me very freaked out indeed.

She was really angry too, especially when I told her my side and apologised for ever giving in to him and setting up the date.

I feel so disgusting. The date at the time, seemed ok, if a little hands on, but now with this new knowledge, yeah I am freaked out, really really freaked out. I feel disgusting, I feel scared and this does nothing to help my already huge distrust of strangers.

About a month ago, I was set up on a date with some guy because of one of my old friends from highschool thought we'd be 'great together'. Anyway, I went on a date with him (Let's call him Wally), he was ok, but I wasn't particularly interested. Afterwards I told him I had a great time but I didn't really want to go on another date with him.

About a week after this, I sort of came to terms with being an aromantic asexual :L after doing a lot of research and thinking. Anywho, I suddenly got a message from Wally asking for another date. I got confused, said no I wasn't interested again, and left it at that when he didn't respond. A few days later, I got another message asking for another date, this time, I was pissed and just ignored it. Then a week later, guess what another message from Wally asking for a date, and finally I said: ""don't ask me again, I have already said no twice. I not interested now, and never will be.""

Nice guy, right? Not takin' no for an answer, oh yes persistance, yes yes that's exactly what every woman wants!

I blocked him, I was so sick of the messages. I got really angry about this and posted something on my facebook basically saying: ""No means no, don't keep asking anyone who says no."" And, low and behold, NiceGuys^tm descended in a blaze of bitterness and went on and on about how I was such a b[slur] for blowing off that ""guy who obviously had strong feelings for you"" and how I had ""just embarrassed him in front of everyone"". Basically, there was an argument of some kind, though it was mostly just them replying: ""umad"" to most things or coming up with really skewed and terrible logic. Aha, they also decided to insult me and my friends and said: ""no wonder she hasn't got a boyfriend"" ahah. They were torn down and silenced eventually with the help of my online friends... but...

it revealed just how much of a NiceGuy^tm mentality there was with the people from my highschool (now becoming Uni students at the end of Feb). My IRL friends, including my female ones, thought I was over reacting for telling the original guy, Wally, no, and for telling these guys that they were sounding like a jerks. Coupled with this, is the fact that none of them accepted my aro/ace side as an acceptable reason for saying no or said I was making it up! Now I'm the dreaded feminazi or better yet, the W[slur] or B[slur] for basically standing up for myself against shitlord NiceGuys^tm among my IRL circle of friends and the people I used to go to school with.

:c

I just feel so frustrated and angry with both myself and them. Frustrated that I had to be so confusing with this whole coming to terms with my sexuality, and getting annoyed enough that I made stupid decisions, and I'm angry that this feeling of ""welp I asked u 4 times now u have to go out with me"", ""i'm such a nice guy"", ""i deserve a relationship because reasons"" thing is so prevalent among people my age! Now I have to go to University in Feb. and I am freaking out because, shit, if people who just left highschool all thought like this, and are going to uni, does that mean I'm going to be surrounded by these sorts of people as well?

**TL;DR encountered some NiceGuys^tm, called them out on their shit, and now my friends think I'm overreacting and I am freaking out that I will keep encountering these sorts of people once I start university**

So, last week I posted some submissions to /r/drunkencookery, because I made some excellent food while drinking copious amounts of beer.  I was downvoted off completely off the pages.  Someone finally posted and said, ""downvoting because you've posted in SRSWomen, worst place on the internet"".  It really upset me.  I mean, fuck me for trying to contribute.  I just deleted the posts and unsubscribed.  

Right after I submitted the posts, I had linked them to my brother, because I thought he may enjoy them.  Well, he finally got around to trying to look at them last night, only to find them deleted.  So he messages me with something to the effect of, ""lol, you deleted your posts, SRSWomen is the worst place on the internet, I checked it out.  It is way more sexist than Mensrights.""  This started an argument, naturally.  Because really?  REALLY?  Way to be supportive asshole.

I love my brother, but he tends to buy into fringe conspiracy theories on a regular basis.  I generally don't mind arguing with him and eventually getting him to see sense.  I've talked him out of all kinds of nonsensical things, it just takes some patience.  But...mensrights?  I just don't have the energy to try and convince my brother that I am a worthy human and that I don't have equality in the same way he does.  I tried a little last night to explain my perspective, and I was shut down with, ""well what about the men?"" arguments.  

The clincher, the one that put it completely over the top, is when he told me, ""Well I asked mom about it last week, and she told me what you are telling me."".  My mother is a terrible person.  I don't speak with her.  He invalidated my argument by telling me that it was something my mother would believe, and therefore, I shouldn't believe it unless I want to be like my mother.  It was an incredibly low blow.  I just told him ""Fuck you"" and logged off. 

It really really hurts coming from my brother.  I love my brother, we've been through a lot together.  But suddenly mensrights?  I've been working on helping him be a less shitty person for years, but this is a new low.  Why is it always me that has to talk him out of this stuff?  Can't he try to educate himself?  I just feel like I don't have the energy to argue with him about this.  I feel like I'm arguing for my worth as a person, with someone who is already supposed to know it.  

Thanks for reading my wall of text.  I'm just very frustrated and upset by this.  And Bryan, if you are still lurking here: Double fuck you asshole.

It was such an adrenaline rush but I DID IT!

So this guy has been lightly stalking/harassing me for about 7 years now. We dated for maybe a month back in high school, honestly it was a mistake but I broke it off when I realized that I didn't really like him.

About a week after this, he offered me a ride home from school and I accepted, being young and trusting. He instead drives me to some pizza place and sexually assaults me by groping me and kissing me. I hurl myself out of the door and run home, and avoid all contact with him after that. He still would try to talk to me and come up to me when he saw me, but I kept it brief. He also IMed me a bunch, but I either ignored him or tried to end the conversation as soon as possible.

Still, I never simply told him off. I guess I was afraid of being rude, which is silly, I know. I luckily went to college far away so I only saw him if I walked past the store he worked at when I came home to visit, where he would inevitably RUN OUT to come talk to me/try to hug me. He'd send me flirtatious messages, but I would remind him that I was in a relationship and he had better respect that. Still, I was never very firm with him, because he wasn't being threatening, I suppose.

Anyway, here is the IM exchange we had today. I am in the red.

[Conversation](http://i.imgur.com/1MIrC.png)

I know it doen't seem like much but I DID IT! I immediately blocked him from IM and facebook. I had unfriended him a while ago but I guess he still had my AIM username and he could still contact me on facebook. I'm so proud of myself, and I wouldn't have been able to do it without my SRSters and your confidence. Seeing you all talking about the importance of sticking up for yourself has helped me learn how to clearly say ""NO"" instead of accommodating people who are making me uncomfortable.

The most recent example is [this mansplainy bullshit](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/media/2012/10/sinister-campaign-against-page-3), the author of whom I engaged with in discussion on Twitter earlier. Basically his argument is that if you're not down with Page 3 of the Sun, you're a prude.

These kinds of arguments make me deeply, deeply uncomfortable. Yes, I recognise that some women enjoy participating in porn; yes, I recognise that some women feel empowered by sharing naked images of themselves (I've done the last one). *However*, what I think this kind of narrative can and frequently does fail to recognise is that there is a huge power imbalance in something like Page 3 of the Sun, and indeed the vast majority of mainstream porn. It is not women who profit from this marketing of women's bodies as a saleable asset; it is men. This seems to me patriarchy incarnate and I can't see it as reconcilable with *any* form of feminism that sits comfortably with me.


Yes, women can enjoy making pornography; yes, women can enjoy being naked in front of cameras for public consumption. But what I cannot accept and reconcile with is the commercial aspect of this; that in this narrative, and seemingly accepted by this narrative, women's bodies become a saleable asset for men (primarily) to profit from.

",69,22,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/19sbci/my_dads_dying_ladies/,"Most of this randomly poured out of me in a comment in /r/oneY not too long ago. I wanted to share it here, in the hopes that it will reach someone who has been through this and can offer words of advice, or help someone else in crisis. 

When I was little my Dad and I were two peas in a pod. We did everything together, and I even got my hair cut into a flat top to be more like him. He has tons of tattoos, and went with my to get my first piece, he introduced me to old records by Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Tom Waits and about a million other artists that I love to this day. He worked 60 hours weeks to keep our family afloat, and allowing my mom to stay home so my sister and I always had a parent here when we got home from school, and I simply can't remember EVER taking a family meal when he didn't thank my mom for cooking for us, and compliment the food. He beat alcoholism and heroin addiction so we could really be a family.

Fast forward to the early 00's. Stuffing feelings to be our rock caught up with him, and he had a break down. He was off work for over a month, crying and getting transported back to his fucked-up abusive childhood. (My grandfather was a grade-A shitlord, and he is not missed.) I took some time off school to come home and care for him, which was very hard at 19. He never really recovered from that. He got a head-shrinker that just loaded him up on meds, and allowed him to continue to stuff his issues, and allowed him to think that it was ok to deal with your feelings with drugs, because they were drugs from a doctor. Our relationship got complicated.

He would talk and talk, and I would get so frustrated with him for spending over an hour on the phone, telling me stories I'd heard about a million times, and never ask me how I was doing. If I got a word in edgewise, he would just respond in a way that made me feel that he had only been waiting for his turn to talk. He got diagnosed with some serious liver problems, and couldn't work any more, but wouldn't even help my mom with dusting, despite being fully able to go fishing with his friends and go to concerts. He'd tell me how proud he was of me, but it felt hollow, since he didn't even seem to know or care who I'd become. By this time I had begun feeling angry with men that I dated, because it seemed like they were all into this *idea* of me that had little to do with the reality, and it felt like my dad was just doing the same thing- the *idea* of the ambitious oldest daughter.

Fast forward to now. A month ago he got diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He's dying. God, I can barely even type that, but it's true. He's really, really dying as we speak. It almost makes it hard for me to breathe, just thinking about it.

I had since moved from our little farm to a major city, but as soon as I found out, I booked it back here. Fuck my job, fuck my social circle, fuck my busy and engaging urban life. I'm on FMLA, and I've been here, helping my mom care for him, listening to him, talking to him, making ginger candy to help his nausea, reading him the stories he read me when I was little, for a month now, and if he makes through the end of my FMLA, I fully intend to quit that job (that I love, that I'm going placing in) to make sure that I'm by his side, holding his hand, as he takes his last breath. I will be Woman of Steel, I will be magic like a grandmother, I WILL make sure that he goes to his grave KNOWING that his family and friends adore him, that he made the world a better place through the life that he lived, that I will take up where he left off helping people and making life better for as many people as I can. Because that's what he taught me to do.

And all the resentment that I carried round for the past ten years? Fucking GONE. Gone, water under the bridge, like I never felt it, like I was pint-size smart-ass with the blonde flat-top and stick-on tattoos all over again. He busted ass for us, and did the best that he could. So what if in the end he fell back on drugs; it never made him love me any less. I'm just trying not to beat myself up too badly for resenting him. I didn't want to let him be human, I guess.

So, SRSters. Let your dad be human. Listen to the same lame stories over and over again, because sooner or later, and I hope it's later for all over you, you will be staring into the reality that you'll never hear those lame-ass stories again, and it will crush you.

Yesterday I made plans to have a casual date with a guy I'd met through fetlife. He was moving the next day and I was looking for noncommittal makeouts. He and I discussed this beforehand. At first, it was cool. Then he started messaging me with stuff like 'kiss kiss' and 'I'm so horny.' We were discussing venue, and he rejected his dorm because (TW) he knew I was into consensual non-consent, and didn't want his roommate to feel awkward if he started 'play raping' me. (TW over) I immediately said that I wasn't wanting to do penetration or a scene. He continued to send me raunchy texts and would only agree to meet in private, and I started to feel really uncomfortable. At first I went 'Oh, but I already agreed to the date!'. A few minutes of agonizing passed, and it hit me. What the hell was I doing? I immediately texted him and canceled. I'll be honest, the reason I gave was that my family was staying on vacation a day longer. I didn't want to deal with his reaction, attempt at coercion, or the possibility that he would contact other guys on fetlife and try to find out where I live. His response to my setting limits put me on edge, and I didn't want to deal. Maybe not my proudest moment, but it has helped me feel safe.

So, what are your 'Fuck off, patriarchy!' moments?

I'm wondering if the judgement would have been the same had Brennan been a woman. As the article states, ""The law says that naked people are only breaking the law if they...got undressed 'with the intent of arousing the sexual desire' of another person."" Brennan was deemed not to have been intending to arouse and not guilty of the charge of indecent exposure. 

But as we all know, women's bodies are considered to be ""indecent"" in a way men's are not (hence the male privilege of shirtlessness and the fury over breastfeeding in public). And women are considered to be intent on ""arousing sexual desire"" simply by virtue of not hiding ourselves under burqas 24/7. Our bodies are viewed as inherently sexual; they're never non-sexualized. (Wish to hell I could find the Sociological Images article that articulated that idea better than I am now...)

So, what do you think? Might the results have been different were the offender's gender different? Perhaps some brave lady from Oregon will follow (birthday) suit and we'll have a chance to find out. ;)",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_wu1sv,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/wu1sv/about_the_portland_man_who_was_judged_to_have/,

I was at a party last night and met a guy there. We kind of hit it off and I invited him back to my place to just hang out and smoke a bowl. I smoked his weed and I guess it was laced with something because I started feeling extremely strange. I was very disoriented and unresponsive. I was conscious though, just barely. He managed to get me to lie down cause I was so disoriented and about to pass out. That's when I realized he was lying down next to me. He started kissing me and putting his hands under my clothes and I kept pushing him away as best I could. I'm just so disturbed because he was doing this as I was just lying there barely able to stay awake. Finally I just got up and stumbled down the hall to a friend's place because I was terrified of what might happen if I completely lost consciousness and control of my body (which I could definitely feel happening). It was terrifying.

I woke up this morning in utter disbelief. I don't really know how to feel right now or even what to do. I feel numb all over and I keep replaying what happened in my mind. My friend suggested I file a police report but I'm scared. I don't ever want to see or talk to him again and I feel like everyone will just judge me for getting myself in a dangerous situation.

EDIT: thanks for all the love ladies. I went to see a counselor and psychiatrist today because I have been having panic attacks.

I've been depressed. School tends to get me like this; I didn't want to go to college in the first place but was kind of forced into it by family. I love learning, but the whole... style, and culture, and setup of colleges just sort of bums me out, just like it did in high school. I've been here for five and a half years now trying to get my degree, and every single semester the same thing happens. A little less than halfway through, I start spiraling down into a pit of self-hatred, and then I skip a class or two, then I feel guilty, then I get anxiety because omg the teacher knows I skipped and probably knows that I skipped for a totally shitty reason, it's not like I even did anything besides lay around eating nutella toast and feeling useless and drinking tea snuggled in a blanket for no reason, then the anxiety builds and I skip another class or two and then feel even guiltier and WOAH before I know it I've almost failed at least one class, usually more, and have to bust ass to get a D.

[breath]

SO.

I noticed it happening too late last semester. I did fail a class. I started this semester with the goal that I would do better, and get help sooner if/when it started happening again. I was even proactive and informed my professors at the beginning of the semester that this was an issue I have been working on.

I was doing so, so well until fall break. And then after those two days off, everything just kind of fell apart. I started skipping classes, missed some assignments, got the guilt feeling again... and then, when I went to the school's RN one day for a sinus infection, said, ""Hey, can I get an appointment for counseling with [counselor I've had in the past]?"" Not even thinking about it. Was just there, realized it would be smart, and did it. No hassle, no agonizing. Well, I mean, there was agonizing later, but in the moment, it just *happened*.

And so I had a couple sessions. And duh, everything's not, like, fixed, or anything. But this morning I woke up late, saw that I only had one pair of pants not in the wash, and realized they weren't appropriate for the weather (they're super cute slashed-up criss-crossy jeans and I love them, but it's COLD) so I threw on some sparkly gold-and-black tights on under them. Then I realized, that's pretty fucking cute. So why not go the whole mile? I grabbed a plain purple scoop-neck and put a cute black button-up on over it, then threw on my super-awesome rocker chick ankle boots, and my purple faux-wool faux-peacoat, and my fuzzy so-warm winter hat, and on the bus I even braided my freaking hair. I haven't dressed up just 'cuz in ages, because, *depressed*, so *whyyyy*. But it made me feel so much better all day today. Every time I started getting down, I reminded myself, ""you're too fucking cute to be sad"", and took one look at my ridiculously sparkly tights, and I was okay. And then a lovely lady in one of my classes gave me the best note ever, and it made me even more okay.

Not great, but okay.

And that's a lot more than I've been able to say for weeks now.

So, ladies, I'm okay today. How are you? I hope you're okay too. You're cute and lovely people, and if you can't be anything else, just be... okay.

*bonus:* I didn't even deal with any shitlords today. I must have looked too intimidatingly awesome.

*edit*: do any of you know of a brand that makes cute, cheap, low-waisted tights? I'm a short-torso'd gal and hate things riding up to my belly button, but rolling tights' waistbands down always seems to be a recipe for disaster (descending crotch syndrome, anyone?)

I am new here, and am making my mind up about many things in regards to feminism. I want to share a story with you to see what your opinions/reactions are.

I am bisexual. I dated a woman for 8 months until she moved to NYC (i'm Australian). We spent 4 months talking every day on skype, and i had saved up all my money to go visit her for 3 months. We were both very excited and seemingly stayed in love the entire time.

When I got there, she became distant and started treating me with resent. Perhaps she was just afraid that our relationship couldn't work on a long-distance level and was reacting to that by being completely cold to me. I had no one else i knew in New York and was stuck with her. I started doubting everything i felt and said because she would often tell me i was emotionally overreacting. 

About a month into the trip we had started getting more happy with each other but the second we drank any alcohol, we'd fight- to the point where she punched me in the middle of a laundromat and we engaged in a physical fight.

Then this:

I had told her one night that occasionally i enjoy being submissive during sex, sometimes including pain, but only with my SO- someone i trust and love. The next night we got drunk in Manhattan, she was ignoring me all night, so we had a fight and i somehow made it back to Brooklyn by myself in the middle of the night on the subway. 

I then woke up that night to her entire hand in my vagina. I didn't know how to react at first, considering it was my girlfriend, and i thought that maybe she was just trying to mend things from the fight but about 20 seconds later started telling her to stop because it was obvious how angry she was, and because it hurt so much. She kept pushing me down and ended up fisting me. My vagina was bleeding and i was crying, she just told me to shut up, and that i liked it, i'd brought it on myself because i had told her i liked to have sex like that. 

She continued to take that approach and i eventually convinced myself that she was right, and that she hadn't raped me, but now that i am out of the relationship i look back on that experience with great pain. No man i have ever dated has ever violated me like that, and i often have great resentment toward women who treat rape as a male thing.

Would you classify this as rape?

I mention I liked the idea of the Depo Shot....well fuck me right, she goes off on a tangent about how I should have done research before I came because I have a history of depression and ~~hiss hiss hiss~~ Were she then proceeds to berate me for even having depression. I just shut the fuck down and go on nodding and mmm’ing . After that she started explain the other sorts of birth control, and she brought one up and looked at my chart, and asked “You’ve never had sex before?”  Nope.  Again, smirking and in the most sarcastic ton she could muster “Well good on you for being soooooo responsible.”

A bit later I remark on some of her tattoos (the deathly hallows and some elfish from Lord of the Rings), she mentioned how she’s a bit of a nerd, and all I said was you’re in like company then.  Queue another tangent about how people only say they’re nerds because it’s hip.

I was shaking by the time I got back out to the lobby. 

Edit; Rudest or most rude? :( Too early for thinks.

Also I should mention, the reason its such a big deal to me is I live in a fairly sheltered situation...I've never really had to deal with too much shaming and that sort of this, going to PPH around here isn't some huge secret to keep (Hell my grandfather offered to go with me in case I was scared).

1350844923.0,48,self.SRSWomen,11urei,[Rant] My mother and the mohawk,55,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/11urei/rant_my_mother_and_the_mohawk/,"Hello everyone. I'm not usually the type of person to rant on reddit about specific instances of drama with my family, but I'm just so angry that I needed a safe space to vent and calm down.

So I've had short hair for years. Varying cuts of bob, pixie, etc. I've been keeping it pretty short for the past year. I decided (for several reasons) to cut it into a mohawk and a good friend of mine helped me shave the sides on Friday night. I honestly love it.  [Here's an album of my hair from last November to now, just so you can see what I'm working with.] (http://imgur.com/a/Do4w6) More details you might need for this story: I'm almost 25, married, and my family is southern Baptist and has VERY strict ideas about gender roles.

Anyway, the main point of this post is one of my brothers sent my mom a picture from Facebook and she called my Friday night and yelled at me, telling me how awful it looks and what was I thinking blahblahblah. I figured it would blow over because it's just a fucking haircut,  but I was wrong. I just got off the phone with her after having one of the most (attempted) emotionally manipulative conversations I've ever had with her. She opens with ""I don't understand how you can expect me to be okay with this. I've been crying over this for two days."" Seriously? Over hair that is not yours? Ugh. So we argue back and forth for a bit, me saying how it should matter, it's just hair, I think it looks awesome, it'll grows back in a couple of months and I'll just have a short pixie cut, and her talking about how awful it looks, and how my dad is upset, and how she's going to have to ""prepare"" my grandpa so he doesn't have a heart attack, etc. She also complained that I have my ears stretched and nose pierced and now I have funny hair. 

Here's the ~~best~~ parts: [TWs for body shaming, slurs]
  
* Her: ""Everyone I show this picture to asks 'Is she gay?'"" Me: ""Do you know how much I care? There are much worse things for someone to think about you than thinking you're gay."" Her: ""Well, ARE you?"" Me: ""Seriously? I'm married."" Her: ""Well I just don't see how [my husband] could find you attractive after this stunt. Maybe you should date girls since everyone already seems to think you're a dyke.""
  
* Apparently she was going to have a family picture taken when one of my brothers came home on leave from the military at Christmas ""but now that's obviously out of the question because you don't even look like my daughter anymore.""
  
* At the end of the phone call, in the shittiest, most emotionally manipulative attempt to make me feel shame for cutting my hair, she brought up my grandma who I was extremely close to as a child and who died when I was 12. It's a fuckin' gem: ""It just keeps running through my mind, what do you think your grandma would think of how you look? Do you think she'd think you're pretty? Because I can tell you from experience, she would think you look like a freak.""

[End TW]

I'm just stunned that a haircut has caused this much drama. If I were younger, the emotional manipulation would have probably worked and made me feel like shit, but I'm wise to her tactics at this point and I still think I'm awesome. It's just a little ridiculous that my appearance is so scrutinized. The friend who helped my cut my hair is very heavily body modded with almost a full body suit of tattoos, stretched ears, split tongue, etc. and my mother is convinced that it's her influence that is ""causing"" me to make these changes and she actually told me I shouldn't be friends with her anymore. I just don't think she can accept that my idea of femininity is very different from hers. I've usually been able to overlook our differences to have a close relationship, but if all we're going to talk about every time she calls me is my appearance, I won't be able to handle it. She just doesn't seem to get that I don't consider my outer appearance the most important or defining feature about myself. I think I'm a pretty fantastic person most of the time, but if I'm ""ugly"" on the outside, in her eyes, I am not redeemable and nobody should accept me. Ugh. Sorry for the novel, but I am feeling better. Hope everyone else is having a better day.

 **TL;DR:** I cut my hair into a mohawk and my mom berated me for it.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,1350845348.0,,,True,t3_11urei,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/11urei/rant_my_mother_and_the_mohawk/,
1350159908.0,47,self.SRSWomen,11ffpc,"My SO is bi-gendered, and I'm struggling with it.",56,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/11ffpc/my_so_is_bigendered_and_im_struggling_with_it/,"throw away account.

A few years ago, when my husband and I were engaged, we discussed our sexual fetishes.  I found out that I'm mostly vanilla, and he had a lot of interests that I sort of struggled with, one of which was transvestitism.  I decided to be game and give them a shot, so he put on my make-up and lingerie and we tried it.  It did not go well.  We stopped half way through and had a long talk about it, but it didn't really come up again.  He could tell that I didn't like it and that made him feel terrible.

So a few months ago, this is a few years later, I've changed a lot.  I've learned a lot from being on SRS and other forums about people's identities, sexualities and the importance of being empathetic.  Those couple of years ago... I don't think I was a shitlord ever, but I was very ignorant.  I've always always been supportive of LGBT rights, but my eyes have been opened a lot.  I brought up the transvestitism fetish and told him that I was open to trying it again.  I didn't want him to feel like he couldn't express himself and that I felt differently about it now.  That might have been a little premature.  

He ended up opening up to me about how it wasn't just a fetish; that he's felt bi-gendered since he went through puberty.  I understood from a few years ago that he dressed in his mothers clothes sometimes, but to me I understood it as purely a sexual fetish.  Now I was learning that he has a deeply ingrained hatred of his own body and gender expectations as a very large man.  We talked about it pretty consistently for about 6 weeks, to the point where I was growing tired of talking about it all the time.  It's chilled out in the last couple of weeks.  He has told me that he doesn't want to physically change his body, because he loves his penis etc., and he wouldn't find a joy or completion in taking hormones and having an operation the way that a lot of trans people do, because he doesn't identify in the same way.  He's done a lot of research and I think he understands himself as trans, but he has a hard time finding exactly where in that spectrum he fits, which I think is causing him more anxiety.  He has continuously told me that he would find a therapist to talk to, but as is his way, he hasn't yet.  That frustrates me because I end up having to be his therapist too, when really I probably should be talking to someone about my own issues with it, as it has fundamentally changed my relationship with the man I am married to, and I can't talk to anyone about it.  

I'm struggling with it.  On one hand, I love my husband very much, and I know that him sharing this with me and feeling able to express it has made him much happier.  He tells me he is, and I can see it.  He is a brilliant man that constantly self-sabotages himself and hasn't been able to find a career that he enjoys making any kind of money.  He's always lacked motivation to do pretty much anything.  He says this makes him feel more whole, and he thinks that now that he's dealing with it, he can start his life.  I agree with that, and I am extremely happy for him.  In the end, all I want is for him to be a happy person.  His lack of motivation has always been a sore spot in our relationship, as I have already started my career and am definitely the breadwinner.  It's not that I want him to make more than I do, or any of that other 50's shit, I just want a partner.  One that doesn't get upset when I ask him to help me clean the house, and one that helps with supporting our household in general.  It's not that he doesn't, it just doesn't feel equal to me with any kind of regularity.

So on the other hand, seeing him put on make-up and a wig and women's clothing I can handle, but him ""acting"" like a woman - I say ""acting"" because that's just what it feels like, sorry if it is problematic... - is just really a turn-off to me.  I don't find it sexually attractive.  It's not good for either of us, because he knows on a level that I feel that way.  I've communicated it the best I can without hurting him, which is hard.  It sucks because he's basically having to compartmentalize it like he was before, where he does it on the day I work and he has off and at night after I go to bed.  When I get home from work on that day and I can see traces of eyeliner, it makes me moody.  I almost don't want to be around him.  I am struggling because I FEEL SO GUILTY FOR FEELING THIS WAY.  I AM BEING A SHITLORD.  It must feel so horrible for him to see me react that way.  I mean, to be perfectly honest I'm okay with it being an abstract thing that I don't really have to see in action.  We can talk about it, we can go clothes and makeup shopping, but I'd really rather not see him dressed, and I definitely would rather not have sex with him when he is dressed.  I know he isn't happy with that arrangement.  

I'm really really sorry if this is upsetting to any transperson reading.  I know that I am being an asshole and I don't know what to do about it.  I am not transphobic - am I ?!?! :( -  Is it okay for me to not find it attractive in my relationship?  I know this is long so I'll just leave it here and I can clarify anything in the discussion.

please help me ladies. :(  I don't know if this is the most appropriate sub for this, but after thinking about it a lot, it's the one I feel most comfortable talking about it in.

I was with my boyfriend, clearly drunk, very much enjoying myself, and I stumbled outside to get some air.

Somehow, I don't even remember how, this shitlord asked me if I was voting for Obama. When I said yes, he got extremely verbally aggressive, almost yelling at me, while his friend walked over and started doing the same thing. I tried to talk, but finally told him, ""Look, I'm too drunk to discuss this, can we talk about something else?"" he then demanded to know how much I had to drink, and when I told him, said, ""Well, *I* had that much and still know what I'm talking about!""

This guy clearly outweighed me by at least fifty pounds, not to mention being male.  During this entire thing, the guy repeatedly directed all his hostile, augmentative tones at me, then talked over me when I tried to respond. But he stopped to listen and respond reasonably to my boyfriend.

My boyfriend was really awesome and told him to cool it and not be like this at a party apropos of nothing. I finally told the shitlord I was freezing and had to go inside as a way to get away, and I was genuinely cold and obviously shivering. He kind of laughed and rolled his eyes. I'm sorry, you're wearing two shirts, one with long sleeves, and I'm wearing a tank top with my boobs showing. Yes, I'm cold.

Just, the whole thing, from the aggression, to the dismissing of my comfort and abilities, to ignoring me, the whole thing ruined my frankly awesome night of partying.

My boyfriend stayed to argue with the shitlord and found me later. He told me he yelled at the guy for being an ass and got him to back down a little bit. I'm glad he did--I hate the thought that someone made me retreat and I'm glad my boyfriend stuck up for me.

But, fucking shitlords. OF COURSE you pick the drunk small girl to scream at and talk over. And now I know he's bragging about how stupid Democrats are when he blindsided me at a party while I was clearly incapable of telling people my birthday, let alone my political thoughts.

SO LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY DAY.  Because you're a huge reason I said something, today.

So I work with this guy.  And he's super obnoxious, but when I first started working there he seemed nice, and we got along.  But then shit got weird.  He started following me out to my car and sorta lost-puppy whining for me to take him home.  I shut him down.  He'd ask about my sex life, I'd divert the conversation.  We never worked together often enough for me to get really bothered, but it's been escalating.

SO TODAY - I had to walk by him to get out the door.  He shoved his butt at me so that my hand would smack into it, and made some kind of like...'oh yeah' noise.  Well, I turned around and let him know that I wasn't pleased, and what he did wasn't cool.  He laughed, and was like ""Oh I didn't do that.""

So I ignored him for most of the rest of the day, till I had to pass him again - and he did it *again*.  AGAIN.  And I wheeled around and told him, again, that I didn't want any of that, and it was super inappropriate.  And he *fucking laughed*.

SO I DRUMMED UP ALL MY COURAGE and five hours later I talked to one of my managers about it.  And told her what happened, and all the creepy history leading up to it, and I was kinna expecting to be dismissed - but she listened to all of it, agreed, and said that she'd start the formal process they use to deal with sexual harassment.  First step is a verbal, second is written, third is GONE.  She believed me, didn't question anything, and was super supportive.

So I wanted to thank all you - because I think that without having read your stories, and seen how supportive you all are, I might have just swallowed it down and not said anything.

&gt;they don’t care and often don’t even know how much work it takes to live up to their standards. how much exercise, makeup, beauty products, push-up bras and shapewear, time, and more that it takes to get looks that just one man adores. and tons of men have different preferences, and if you don’t live up to them, then you’re not a “real woman” to many of them.
&gt;
&gt;men talk of women the same way I might talk about a piece of furniture. like, yeah, she’s okay, but I’ve seen better. 
&gt;
&gt;and often picking apart every individual detail of a woman as if she were a prized hog at the county fair. weight, breasts, ass, hips, thighs, waist-to-hip ratio, eyes, lips, eyebrows, clothing.
&gt;
&gt;not really considering the humanity of the woman involved. just reducing them to looks quite frankly, and if you fall outside their view of acceptable womanhood or beauty standards, you’re worth nothing to them. the fact that women who don’t shave are often considered “unhygienic”. that men  often say things like “that’s not even attractive” when women express themselves.
&gt;
&gt;when women don’t do what they want they think of them as defective women because they really have been socialized to think of women as walking masturbatory devices.


Hard hitting. I've articulated this myself a couple of times, but never so succintly. Nail has been hit on the head.

Couple this with the fact that study after study has come out proving that pop culture/Western society trains people almost from birth to see women as objects. That's for everybody, not just cismen.

To better capitalize on it, one thing I've noticed is that when people want to insult a woman, all they manage to go for is basically saying she doesn't measure up enough as an object. The worst possible insults people think are sufficient enough to toss at a woman most often concern her weight, body type, hair length and other aesthetic features.

That's one thing about internet anti-Feminists that cracks me up. The first word out of their mouths in ire is how unsightly we are. 

Anyhoots, just wanted to share this because it's amazing.

My brother and I are very close. I'm 25 and he's 21. We have really similar personalities and sense of humour, and he often stays in my apartment for days while we watch funny television and get stoned together.... I often end up talking to him about feminist issues, social justice etc, and he's always been fairly receptive, and understanding, but apathetic enough on the whole... he basically agreed with me and my positions, but by all appearances didn't give it much thought, and also didn't really understand why I spend so much of my time talking about it and caring about it, 'working myself up' so to speak, by getting 'too involved'. He was never mansplainy or dismissive though, and I knew he understood where I was coming from, so it was never really an issue.

Then something wonderful happened.

A few days ago, a friend of mine got into a horrid internet argument with some assholes on the Facebook wall of an vigil event she had created for Savita Halappanavar (one of many that the pro-choice movement we are part of have been organising country wide lately). She was getting really upset at the mansplaining douchebaggery, as she was under lots of college pressure anyway on top of all the horrific shittiness of women's rights here in Ireland that we're dealing with.

I was on IM to her, and she was asking me to jump into the comment thread too, when out of the blue I got an mail from my brother saying 'sorry, I couldn't resist', and saw that *he* had made a comment on the thread himself (he must have seen it come up on his little side feed thingy). And [this](http://imgur.com/fR8Kn) is what he posted. I read it and literally cried with happiness. I have *never* seen him arguing on the internet before, **ever**. This was totally unprecedented, and not only that, but I had *no* idea that he had given enough thought to the things we talked about to be able to put together a comment like that. I messaged him to thank him and he said he just couldn't resist after seeing those guys talk down to my friend as if *she* was in the wrong when they were clearly complete dopes.

my brother had mentioned to me in the past (2 or 3 weeks ago) about getting high with her (not uncommon for either of them) and then having sex with her. it sounded kinda iffy when he spoke about it, but I didn't really press the subject.

it came up in conversation with her, and her recounting of the event made it preeeeetty clear that it was definitely rape. though she definitely was blaming herself for it - textbook denial ""I didn't do enough to stop it"" ""it wasn't penetrative sex"" sorta stuff. But, yeah, it was rape, judging from her account of it, which included much saying she didn't want to, that it was a bad idea, physically pushing him away at times, him physically forcing her to do things, and being intoxicated.

Shit's fucked.

And after I told her that.. yeah, that's literally rape, she kinda snapped into realizing it was that and got understandably upset. So I drove over and comforted her, because she didn't trust her mother to not be an asshole about it.

..but now I just don't know what to do. I don't want to defend my brother for this, because he is definitely in the wrong. but I don't want to push her either way to try to press charges at the same time, for her sake - a rape trial that likely won't stick and the scorn she will likely receive for it aren't going to be fun - and concern for my brother, who generally fucks up and does terrible things a lot.

It was so white we called it vanilla valley. There were maybe five black students and a some hispanic students at my high school. I recently move to Washington DC which has a large black population. Now, I have always considered myself a feminist and I have read material on the struggles black women have in the feminist movement. Because of this I know that they get a tough break and am aware of how the media portrays white characteristics as the ideal beauty. 

I went to CVS (drugstore) to buy some makeup this weekend. I noticed that there was a separate section of makeup for black women. It was filled with dark foundations and richly colored eyeshadows and lipsticks. I walked to the checkout and noticed they had a separate section for black hair products and for the first time I was struck by the privilege I have as a white woman. By placing this products in sections separate from the other ones it was implied that black women are ""other"" or a special interest group. Instead of having the foundation go from lightest to darkest on the shelves it went from lightest to the darkest that could still be considered white and the dark ones were in their own section. I honestly don't understand why foundations and eyeshadows that work the best for darker skin pigments need to be segregated from the rest. I use the word segregated on purpose because that is how it felt. There is no reason for the black hair products and dark makeup to be in different aisles from the ""normal hair"" products and the lighter makeup. I feel like doing this just enforces the idea of white=ideal and black=lesser.

I'm grateful for this awakening and I'm grateful for the SRS community that has helped me become more actively aware of the social structures, both good and bad, that surround me. I am privileged and I need to remember that and work for change.

I have been long-distance with him since June, and we will be apart until December. 

Our relationship is very public. It's on Facebook, he comes up a lot in conversation- basically, if you are anywhere near my sphere of friends, you know that I am in a relationship. Recently, a friend of mine has been talking to me quite a lot, and keeps suggesting that we hang out. Not in a group. He'd like for me to come over and watch movies. I went to college, I've been around the block- I know that that means. I highly doubt there's no ulterior motive. And he's, well, he's got kind of a reputation. I know he's cheated on girlfriends in the past and generally does not have the best history with being a stand-up guy in that department. 

Then, last night, I went out with another male friend of mine to a party, and he would NOT STOP touching me. He'd find ways to put his hands on my waist, and was not taking the hint when I'd jerk away immediately. I really regret not saying anything, but I was uncomfortable and surprised. We also have a really great professional/creative relationship (we both work in the film industry), and I'm incredibly frustrated that it's being tainted with this other garbage. 

I don't even know if I'm looking for advice, or just a place to vent my frustrations, but seriously- WHAT GIVES?! It makes me feel like I'm not taken seriously. I had awful dreams all night last night, and I feel really, really bad for my boyfriend who's 2,000 miles away and surely feeling pretty helpless and angry over it.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_12kv0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/12kv0r/im_tired_of_having_my_relationship_with_my/,

One of the classes I'm required to take is all exchange students, a French culture course to get us acquainted with where we're living. 

So in this class each student had to give a presentation about some aspect of french culture compared and contrasted with that of their home country. Today the two presentations that were given were on the role of women in French society and feminism in France. Both of them mentioned a lot of important dates, milestones in women's rights, such as suffrage, abortion care, contraceptive care, the right to divorce your husband and also the right to prosecute your husband for rape. The woman giving the presentation on Feminism was Irish, and gave a very impassioned speech about how shocking it is in Ireland that rape within marriage was legal until 1995. Then Shitlord raises his hand. Now, this kid has a history of asking hands-down the dumbest fucking questions in existence, but this one took the cake- he said in broken French something along the lines of ""I don't understand why you're making such a big deal out of that law, that like, isn't a thing. Husbands don't rape their wives. That's not a thing."" And he continued to defend this point of view against the professor and the rest of the class for about ten full minutes and then finally conceded by saying ""Well I guess I just have a different definition of marriage.""

Her goal was to write slaves who were people, as opposed to filler characters, and to portray the humanity of slave owners.  Her grandmother, who helped raise her, was a slave forced to work in the cane fields.

Butler was a factory worker who got up at 2 am every morning to write.  She was the first science fiction author to win the MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant.  She won 2 Hugo Awards and 2 Nebula Awards.  As a black female, she felt she was uniquely capable of writing dystopian stories.

Here’s the plan:  

* We’re going to start next Monday 10.22.12.  


* We will be aiming to read 100 pages a week.  

* We will divide the week up into 50 page chunks.  I will make a thread on Mondays and Thursdays for the next 3 weeks until we finish the book.  I think having two posts a week will allow slower readers to participate without spoilers and will promote a more in depth analysis.

I will be reading on my Kindle app and I will do my best to include e-book percentages as well as page numbers.   [Here's](http://www.amazon.com/Kindred-Octavia-Butler/dp/0807083100/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350154562&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kindred) where you can get the book.

My mom only wore make-up for weddings and other occasions of importance and I never learned much about how to do it.  I've been pretty interested in it for some time, and I decided to give it a shot.

I like to use an eyelash curler and mascara, it makes me look more awake at work!

And tinted moisturizer with SPF15 in it makes my skin tone look even and keeps me safe from UV rays (but I really really have to remember to remove it at night or I break out).

And when I go out on weekends and have the time, I like colorful painty make-up, like one bright lipstick or one bright eye-shadow.

And liquid eye-liner!!  I look like I'm out of a movie about a girl biker gang from the 50s/60s!

I worry a little about the desire to be ""pretty"" and the internalization of normative beauty, but mainly I just enjoy having fun with it.  Although now that it's really hot out, I've been noticing that I also really do like my skin naturally glowy (read:sweaty) without the tinted moisturizer sometimes too.

&gt;Basically, you're reaffirming the double standard of 'women are whores and men are awesome' if you shun Taylor Swift for dating/sleeping around and don't think twice about every male celebrity who dates/sleeps around. 
&gt;
&gt;'It's okay for dudes to sleep around because they're dudes.  It's GOD AWFUL THAT ONE GIRL IS HAVING SEX WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON OOOH MY GOSH.'  Yes, this is what you are reaffirming.  Boys can have all the sexual freedom they want, but ladies CANNOT based on the very irrelevant circumstance that they are female. 
&gt;
&gt;This tells young girls that they have no sexual freedom and that they MUST remain monogamous, sentencing them to a life of guilt for being unhappy, and telling young boys they MUST engage in polyamory and never be faithful or face the very real gender alienation on men who choose actively not to engage in polyamory.
&gt;
&gt;Instead, it should be made known that it's okay to have multiple partners if you want, or one person if you want.  Sexual expectations in gender are dangerous and unhealthy.

The extra shitty part is that I will invariably be faced with dealing with friends who honestly have no idea why double standards are wrong, and while it will be kind of lame to have to rip them a new one as politely as I can, they probably still will not see where there is a problem, continue to perpetuate the problem, and then label me as a crazy feminist.  WHAT IF I AM, YOU'RE A SEXIST JERK

okay rant over.

Edit - okay so not quite shitlordy but someone did try this - 
**You cannot change the world... these things will happen. out of billions of people, you cannot... you cannot snag one girl in nova scotia** [I made note of the girl who recently was raped and humiliated for being raped], **shit, even 100, a thousand, a million... people are going to be bad, that does not mean as an entirety, they view of such, you are letting a couple events spoil your entire view of the world. for every one instance a girl is shamed for being raped, do you know how many are embraced? and coddled for such, as they should be. the world is not a completely horrible place, not everybody you see, wants to slit you from ear to ear for your lunchbox. not everybody is going to look at every woman and subjugate them. you need to stop seeing with eyes clouded by hate.**


I tried to explain - 
**Okay, you tell me how society views women on a whole, how society thrives in rape culture, shame culture,and then come back to me and tell me how I'm supposed to just let it all happen. If I keep quiet about this, then I am just letting the problem get worse. I might be one person, but another person and another person and 100 people build up and get louder and once we get loud enough, maybe changes will happen. It's not about hate. It's about something that is obviously such a problem that I am actually speaking out about it, as are thousands of other women and men because the act of shaming sex is just another way to keep the gender war alive. If you really think that just staying quiet because 'my two cents won't change anything' then you really, really, really either don't actually see the problem going on, or you do see it and don't desire change.**

You feel guilty you didn't try to defend yourself. That is what feminism told you to not do, but yet you helped them get off.

Like many of you, I belong to several 'fandoms' and enjoy spending time discussing and talking to other fans. Not surprisingly, there's a lot of issues in the treatment of each other when it comes to the internet and it can be especially vile when it comes to a specific subject people love.

A certain subset of fans often refer to others or themselves as either fanboys or fangirls, but I've noticed that people have a very aggressive attitude towards fangirls specifically. Opinions are waved away with a simple 'Oh, you're just one of those fangirls' and any problems the show/movie/game/etc/ may have are blamed on the fact that supposedly teenage girls dare to like what they like. They fear that these fangirls will be pandered to and so the world will end eventually.

You'd think fanboys would get a similar treatment, but it's the complete opposite. Fanboys are more considered the 'true' fans and this goes so far that people simply drop the 'boys' all together and just use 'fans' as a positive and 'fangirls' as something negative. The sexism I find amongst fellow fans is disgusting.

I'm supposed to be okay with the objectification, the hatred, the unneccessarily foul criticism and the general shitty attitude a fandom may have against a woman, but when a teenage girl dare express her celeb-crush on a male actor buildings explode and it's suddenly raining acid all over.

Neither of us have to be what we are being labeled as, but apparently you're either a 'true' fan, or you're a female fan of a certain age. And don't you dare call it out.

I'm completely done with this attitude and I've done so many things to work against it, but it only seems to be getting worse.

Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that I sometimes feel like my working out - specifically my weights routine - is somehow (seen as) less important or worthwhile or whatever because I'm this small woman who can only bench the bar and this kind of poop just makes me want to cry and leave the gym and never come back.

A long time ago I unsubscribed from all the default subs except r/vids and maybe one or two others. I added all my own subs and my experience has been greatly improved. I dunno if anyone has already seen this today, probably some of you. 

Anyway, so the vid is a ""Crying Competition"" and it shows four men trying to cry, and they spend half an hour trying unsuccessfully. It talks about what they were thinking about and their thought processes, and it shows their faces. It was supposed to be the ""first tear on the table wins."" But none of them could cry.

Then a girl comes on camera, and she manages to cry within 25 seconds.  

Then of course, the narrator (or the girl) or whatever says ""guys are disassociated from their emotions."" Which ended up starting a bunch of crap in the comments.

A shit ton of the comments are about how guys have it hard because they're supposed to be manly and guys cant cry when they're competing against each other and how when girls cry men are falling all over themselves to help them but when a man cries no one cares. This is all so ridiculous to me. It's just so many goddamn stereotypes and generalizations about men and women.

So those 4 guys couldn't cry? Thats only 4 guys on the planet. And that one girl could cry on command. I can't cry on command, and just because she can cry on command, that doesnt/shouldnt say anything about men and women's emotions. We can't just automatically conclude that ""this is how men and women are."" Most of the comments are guys saying shit like: 

**""makes you wonder what kind of deep dark shit is hidden in that girls mind.""**

**""I would actually posit that men are more aware of all their emotions. We don't let any single one just run amok. When I get emotional about things I can feel sad, happy, angry, dissapointed, content, sullen, etc all within a short time frame and about the same thing. A lot of girls I know simply pick one and go for broke. Ever try and get a girl to see the bright side in a situation when she's crying? Not fucking possible.""**

**""Goes to show how deceiving women truly are.""**

**""This shouldn't have been downvoted, many women and girls I've talked to have commented on how deceptive they are. It's no secret, it's just hard to tell when it's happening.""**

And THIS is at the very bottom somewhere, but it still made me rage:

**'Wow my gf would lose this competiton easily. She only crys when I hit her.""**

Ok, I know a lot of those are probably ""jokes"" but they are still so wrong! One girl cried on command and all women who cry are automatically deceptive?! Are you fucking serious? 

One of the top upvoted comments is **""Because men can only cry when it's real.""** This pissed me off SO MUCH. So every time a women cries its not real? She's not feeling any emotions at all?! I cry ALL the time due to depression/anxiety I've had my whole life. Once I start I can't stop, and I start very, very easily. I literally cry at least once a day and I feel every bit of it. Never once has it been ""fake."" My emotions are real, my sadness and tears are painful and I feel my chest ache from the pain.

Sorry, I know I'm hardcore ranting, but I wish everyone would stop putting everyone else into categories. Every man and woman is different, and they all cry differently, at different times, and at different lengths. If I could fart on command and the guy next to me couldn't, would we be making conclusions about each others bodily functions? No. We can't even cry without it being turned into a gender war. 

Ughhh. The sad thing is, I've had so many other instances of sexist, generalization crap that I've seen/heard of lately that I'd like to share but if I did I would go on forever. This is just one of them.

I browse and comment under my other primary account, but I didn't want this story attached to it.

I was reading [this post that jingledildz posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/znp7m/i_tried_to_take_off_her_panties_tried_to_convince/) and going through the comments and reading all those shitlords not understanding what the fuck rape is started to fester in my mind. Then I was just being at home doing my own thing and thoughts popped up in my head. Something I haven't thought of in a long time. 

Years ago I was in a relationship. It was a pretty shitty relationship but it was my first long term one, I was young and didn't know better. He would always be looking for money or cigarettes from me even though he made more than I did and wasted all his money on video games and pot. What a winner.

Anyways, we were young and hormones ran high so sometimes when I'd stay over at his place (or his parents, after he moved back in with them because he'd rather play video games and smoke pot then work, I know, I know...) he would wake me with sex and it was something we had discussed that was okay, given we were alone in a safe place and usually I'd tell him before going to sleep if I'd be okay with it. 

One time we went to a friend's party out in the middle of nowhere and there was a lot of drinking and there was no way to get back home that night (no cabs, like literally out in the most rural areas) so we stayed in a guest room. I was really drunk and just wanted to sleep and he stayed up for a while partying some more. Fine, I was just going to sleep and it was cool. Fast forward to when he is coming into bed, I wake up to him *inside* me. Fucking door wasn't even all the way closed. I flipped. Asked him what he thought he was doing, he said since we've done it before like that it was okay. I told him it was very much not okay. We were at someone else's place, I was passed the fuck out, I never said it was okay elsewhere and it was completely unacceptable. He had no fucking clue.

This happened 8 years ago. This is the first time I'd really thought about it since then. And all of those comments not understanding what consent is just triggered this memory. I've never had anything trigger me before. It is a truly awful feeling.

1.) I think a lot of this is going to be triggery, so I'm just going to put a **blanket TW on the entire post for sexual harassment, assault, fat shaming, body shaming, and other assorted fuckeries.**

1 1/2.) Slurs get you benned, which is just and good, but in this case, I think they're necessary - not because we need to use slurs against chucklefucks when ""chucklefuck"" is a perfectly good non-slur way to go about it, but because many of us will be quoting others when recalling experiences, and the unfortunate reality is that much of the language used against us in these situations is chock full o' the slurs. Avoiding them entirely means you won't be able to tell your story as it happened, but replacing letters with asterisks borks the hell out of the formatting if you need to do more than one, and I think it's important that those of us comfortable doing so display the full impact of just how horrible some of this shit can get. I asked the mods about this this, but they are busy ladies &amp; I didn't get an official answer either way, so I'm just going to say slurs are okay when you're quoting someone else IN THIS POST ONLY. If the mods are not okay with this, I completely understand - just let me know.

2.) Please post from your active SRSWomen account. If you want to use a throwaway, PM me from the active one with the throwaway so's I know you are supposed to be here. If you'd rather not do either, just PM me with your story. I will post it under my name saying it's from anon. 

Remember: I can't promise a safe space, so use your best judgment with details that could be personally identifying. And if you see fuckery, please report so the mods can smack it down.

3.) You can tell us as much or as little as you like. Your level of participation is entirely up to you. 

*****

I decided to start with street harassment because there's been some discussion about it lately &amp; this is one most of us can likely participate in. I'm using ""street harassment"" as a catchall term for the various things strangers say/do to us when we're out in public - slurs screamed out of cars, gropes on the bus, being followed, being propositioned, insulted, spit at, threatened, etc, etc, etc.

Like most women I know and many more I don't, I'm rarely able to leave the house without experiencing it in at least one form or another. Here are a few of my more memorable incidents: 

I am 11, walking home from school, when a middle aged man in a family-friendly sedan slows down to shout ""Hey, baby!"" as he passes. The words are innocuous enough, I suppose, but they're said in a tone that makes me uncomfortable for reasons I am not yet experienced enough to pinpoint. I put my head down, shoulders slightly hunched, cheeks burning, and keep walking, ignoring him. This is the first time this has happened to me directly, and I suddenly, *viscerally* understand why my mother's mouth compresses into a thin line and her eyes narrow when we're out walking and the cars slow down.

I am 16, and a man, apparently rather ticked off at me for ignoring his ""hey baby hey baby hey baby hey""s, drags me bodily out of the car I am sitting in, making a concerted effort to stuff me into his van. I escape by suddenly dropping my weight, falling on him like the proverbial ton of bricks as he hits the asphalt. Then I scramble up, kick him as hard as I can, and run into the store across the parking lot. I have never moved faster in my life, but all around me, people are going about their business in a leisurely fashion as if no one ever tries to stuff girls into vans and there's never a need to move faster than you ever have before. And though it happens in broad daylight, in the parking lot of a store on a busy intersection in a highly urban area, and I am screaming my damn head off, no one tries to help me. 

I am in my late teens, working a shitty retail job for shitty pay, serving shitty customers with shitty attitudes. To get to work on time, I must leave long before the sun rises to walk miles to the main bus station in the dark, because the bus line by my place doesn't start until after my shift starts. One morning, a car rolls up alongside me. A man inside asks if I want a ride. I decline, because yeah right, but he keeps asking. I'm not sure what to do, because the street is deserted like it always is at this time, and it's the dark ages before everyone had cell phones, so I just ignore him and walk faster. Nearly every morning for over a month afterward, he follows along behind me in his car while I walk to the bus station, not saying anything, just...there. I try varying my route, but he always seems to find me again after a day or two. Eventually, he gives up for reasons unknown.

And it is at this point in my life that, rather than feeling guilty and ashamed and frightened every time this shit happens, I start to get pissed off instead. Then epically pissed off. Then *black belt in surly* pissed off.

So:

I am in my early 20s, walking to the bus stop after a doctor's appointment. I come to a side street where a cop is parked, watching for people speeding on the main road. I start to cross the street when he calls, ""Hey, honey, bring that ass this way!"" I pause, weighing my options. If this were anyone but a cop, I'd possibly say, ""Get bent!"" or ""Fuck off!"" or flip him the bird or throw my arms out like how-ya-like-me-now, but due to some prior experiences, I'm extremely leery of cops. I know they are not to be trusted, but after some internal debate, I realize I can't ignore him, either, so I'm pretty much screwed here. 

I approach the car and ask if there's a problem. He says no, tells me how fine I look, and asks me out for a drink. I don't like his tone or that he's doing this while he's obviously on duty - it feels like he's abusing authority. What will he do if I say ""no""? It feels intimidating, threatening. It makes me nervous. It pisses me off, too, but I know I can't tell him exactly what I think of him, because that won't end well. I also want to *run,* but I know that is a bad idea, too, so I just back away slowly, ""I have to go, I'm sorry, I'll miss my bus."" ""Bitch,"" he says, rolling his window back up. The rest of the way home, I keep looking over my shoulder for cop cars.

I am in my mid-20s, walking similar miles in the small hours for yet another shitty job, and yet another guy rolls up to hey-baby-hey and offer me a ride. I decide I am too tired to engage at all, so I just ignore him and try to walk faster. He keeps following me, though, keeps asking, and then I am suddenly furious. 

*Furious.* 

So furious that I only need one hand to count the number of times I've felt that kind of incandescent fucking *rage* in my life even now, all these years later. 

I whirl on him, ""Listen, dude, I am categorically NOT going to get into your fucking rape-mobile, so just leave. Me. The. FUCK. *ALONE*."" He recoils from the window a bit, then calls me a cunt and stops the car. 

The street is so quiet, I can hear the click of his automatic door locks releasing. ""Okay,"" I think, ""He's gonna get out of the car now. Get ready, here we go, let's fuckin' do this."" I face him full-on, squaring my shoulders, but he just sits there for a moment, doing nothing, and somehow, that makes me even *more* furious - like, how DARE he? It's cold, it's ridiculous o'clock in the fucking morning, I have to walk miles, I get three hours of sleep a night (if I'm lucky) because I've got two babies to take care of in addition to working, and now I have to deal with this utter fucking *turnip* jackassing around like this on top of it? I do NOT think so. ""Well?"" I call, ""What're you gonna do, big man? Huh? Gonna get out, drag me in there with you? You just fucking TRY it. See what happens. TRY IT."" 

I don't know if he somehow intuited that I was pissed off enough at that point to make him wear his ass for an attractive and fashion-forward hat using naught but my superior bitch fu mind tricks or who knows what, but whatever it was, it apparently made him think better of getting out of the car, because he noped right on out of there instead. Smart man.

And then I am in my late 20s, walking my daughter home from school after chess club. A door to one of the houses opens, and a man pops out. ""HEY!"" he says, ""Lookin' good, bitch."" 

I can't help but picture him inside his house, crouched by the window, patiently waiting for a woman to walk by so he can burst through his front damn door like some kind of shit-flavored Kool-Aid Man, and I desperately want to turn around and tell him exactly how he can go fuck himself, but I can't. 

I have to ignore him, because my daughter is with me, and a guy that will haul his ass off the couch just to catcall me from his front door is clearly a guy that has some serious issues with appropriate behavior, so I can't risk it. I feel my mouth compressing into a thin line and my eyes narrowing, and I wonder how long it will be before it's my daughter's turn suddenly, *viscerally* understand why.

I dislike physical contact, in specific scenarios it is fine - if I know the contact is coming meaning someone asks permission to hug/touch/shake my hand. Or, if I can see someone is coming and they're approaching me from the front/never coming up behind me. 

My partner can touch me unless asked not to (which only happens when I'm really anxious).

My problem: The topic came up at work, I was explaining that I really don't like hugging or being touched unless it's on my terms. One of my male co-workers starts caressing my arm jokingly, and I tell him to knock it off. He does it again, I said, ""I'll knock your fucking teeth out."" And he tried to touch me again but I jerked away. I just get the vibe from him, something along the lines of ""You just need a man to show you/touch you right."" It grosses me out when he looks at me.

I'm being looked at as a bad guy at work for threatening him and supposedly overreacting. but this other guy has given me the heebie-jeebies from day one. He leers, and at an after work party hugged me and slid his had across my bra. I work nights and I'm often alone in a building with him.

Did I overreact? Or am I in the right for raising my voice and telling him no.

Another question in the same vein: Why do people assume because I dislike contact that I was molested/touched badly at one point? I just don't like being touched it makes me anxious and panicky.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_x8fao,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x8fao/i_dont_like_being_touchedquestions/,

As a female employee at a chain department store, I have ten thousand bones to pick with sexual harassment policies.",60,13,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1c69q5/advice_srswomen_as_a_female_employee_at_a_chain/,"I am a female employee at a relatively popular department store with hundreds of locations across the country. I have worked for others in the past as well, and **I have discovered what has become an extremely familiar problem of being sexually harassed by male customers.**

I have been approached by men who have asked for my phone number, have made comments about my appearance, my face, my smile, my body, etc. I have been asked when my birthday is, so that a male customer can return and buy me expensive things from my department. 

I have talked to other female employees at my job about whether this has happened to them, and my coworkers have just tons and tons of stories. One coworker had a male customer stalk the department until she was off of work, to the point where she had to call in another friend to walk her to her car to avoid being harassed or attacked. Another female employee who works in a confined space that does not allow her to leave, has been told that she has ""beautiful breasts,"" and in another instance, asked to ""spin around so that I can see your ass."" Another female employee has flat out been groped by a male customer.

I shouldn't have to explain the insanity of these stories, or the frequency with which I am sure they occur. I never want to be complimented on my appearance at work, no matter how benignly intended. We are not at my place of employment to talk about that, we are there to sell things and buy things. That's all. My sexuality and appearance have no bearing.

The issue that I find is that my store's sexual harassment policy is woefully negligent of this reality, and has no safeguards for me if I choose to name and reject sexual advances and comments. At our store, we have begun trying to address this with our Human Resources department, and it has been entirely unhelpful. Managers have suggested we wear baggier clothes, that we appreciate the compliments instead of rejecting them, or that we find other ways to avoid further advances without correcting the male customer's behavior. I ultimately feel that if I chose to react to a male customer's advances rather than smile and accept them, I may face some pretty serious consequences or safety risks. 

Edit: I should note too, that I worry that my job may be on the line as I make a bigger and bigger deal of this. Or that my hours will get cut. I realize the potential lawsuits that could result from that kind of retaliation by my employer, but it's nonetheless jarring.

**My question to pose to SRS Women, as my first post to you all, is: Has this ever happened to you?

He had a very strong manipulative control over me. I won't go into specifics otherwise.


He would manipulate me into performing sexual acts on him.


I finally worked up the courage to tell my mom about this. One of the things she said.. ""I never liked him. You should have listened to me."" I LOST IT at her. This was NOT OKAY. I presented the equally illogical argument that, ""Well, you should have put your foot down and not let him come over."" to show her how ridiculous hers was. She started to see my side a bit more..


She hated that someone had ""taken my innocence."" NO, the fact that someone assaulted me does NOT change who I am. It does not take away anything from me. It just really scars me emotionally.



She also said that her friend's daughter went to a part and got drunk, then woke up with just panties on.. And that she regretted going to the party and getting drunk and said she'd ""never put herself in that situation again."" 



My mom was sympathetic and almost cried, but something about her reaction made me feel like shit. It's like.. She was attentive, but also way too defensive of herself, when she SHOULD have been just trying to help me, and not have been trying to dig deeper and think of ""reasons"" why it happened.



The other thing I resented was that she later said how ""sex is holy, blah blah, I hope you never get drunk at parties, this could happen again.."" and just... I don't know, it seems like she didn't quite..get it..



Please, someone, anyone, help me. I just always feel like she tries to put the focus back on the fact that we disagree on some things and how important it is to ""wait until marriage."" I can't stand this anymore. I can't do this. I can't. I just don't get her views at all and trying to convince her otherwise is like screaming underwater.



I seriously felt horrid after her ""sex is holy"" bullshit, because that's her saying that my assault HAS changed who I am. But she also said that she doesn't see me differently and that she is concerned about my health. I don't even know. I'm just really fucking mad that she had the audacity to even barely TOUCH on the side of blaming me. SERIOUSLY.



Also.. I had told her before even saying anything that I did NOT want her to ask questions and that I just wanted to get tested for STIs asap. She did not respect that. She asked me more questions, saying it would help her know how likely it would be that I was infected possibly. This wasn't okay. She didn't respect my wishes..and forced me into elaborating on painful experiences.

1358677185.0,40,self.SRSWomen,16xapb,The most unbelievable thing happened at work this week. (Possible TW),55,15,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/16xapb/the_most_unbelievable_thing_happened_at_work_this/,"Alright, my work place is comprised of mainly women. Eight women to three men on the floor. This isn't counting the office staff because the rant I have doesn't pertain to all of them, just one of my bosses.

Now we got this new woman, let's call her B. I haven't know B for very long. I have been off work for a severe injury and when I do work its for a short period of time. Not long enough to get to know a person. So as a result I don't know really anything about B other than what gets passed to me by my other coworkers.  Anyway B's boyfriend has been looking for a job and our boss, a man I shall call C, offered him a job working in the plant with all of us.

 Everyone was okay with this until B tells us something. Her boyfriend has a criminal record, a bit of apprehension at this point but we were all okay. She then says it was for rape and not just any rape, this rape was apparently so brutal the victim was in the hospital for months afterwards. (I'm not even bringing up why she is with this man because I honestly don't know other than she says he's 'nice' despite the fact he treats her like shit. We've offered her a support system to get out of there but she refuses. Anyway, back to it.) So we learn this and all we can think of is, perhaps it is a bad idea to bring this man into a work place full of women.

 We send up one of my coworkers to bring up the issue to C. She told him that we were all concerned about the safety of the workplace if the man was hired. That we would be uncomfortable if he was. (He was going to be hired to work in very close proximity to us.) He asked her why we would be concerned and she asked him if he was aware that B's boyfriend was a convicted rapist.

This us what blows me away. He said he was fully aware and that it was none of our business. He brought her down to the work floor and laid into us about how this was the reason he wasn't going to tell us because we would overreact and get emotional. That we would cause trouble about it and we really needed to grow up and get over ourselves. 

I could not believe it. I still can't believe it. We told him that if he hired the man we would not be comfortable and could very well quit. Well that sent him off on a tangent again and we were forced to listen to this man practically defend this vile human being and slam us because we were worried and concerned about our safety if we were to be forced to work next to a violent rapist.

Its been two days since this incident and C has decided not to hired B's boyfriend because he can't replace us all but he's still pissy and we are all horrified about it. I just can't understand C's reasoning. This man was a violent rapist. He left his victim in a hospital for months and I don't care if he 'did his time'. This is not information you withhold from your work force and this is not an issue in which you defend the man rather than listening to your clearly scared and worried employees. I mean fuck. It wasn't an overreaction on our parts, we brought the issue up as politely as possible so there was no reason for him to fly off the handle like that. No reason for him to defend that man (if he can even be called that anymore).

I was so pissed off I was shaking. I have never encountered this before and I was horrified. Needless to say I will be looking for a new job at the earliest possible moment but all I can think about is that poor woman he did that to and the fact that this monster is now living in my town. Its terrifying to know but I am glad I do know.

Sorry about the ranting and this entire shitlord mess but I had to tell someone. Plus you guys are a lot more understanding than most places on reddit. Please forgive any spelling errors, I am posting this from my phone. I am going to sleep now because if I remain concious for much longer I might go insane thinking about this mess.

Anyway, I guess I should post a little bit about myself. I'm 21 years old living in the states and I have no idea what I want to do with my life haha... I like photography and drawing and sculpting and writing but I also love biology and astronomy and other sciences. I love everything having to do with nature, all my art is nature/animal-based. I collect shells too and I have a huge amount that I dunno what to do with. I used to hike and kayak a lot but don't much anymore since i have nobody else to do it with :(

I have two beautiful kitties whom I love very much, they're the only family I can stand being around more than 3 minutes. There's a bunch of strays that we feed too. 

I love video games but I'm really picky on what I play. I think Okami is my favorite, and the zelda games are second. I've played GW2 and love it, but haven't played in a while due to my shitty internet and no one to play it with. I used to play maplestory too for over 3 years and have a lvl 200 FP but I quit because it went down the shitter. I have minecraft and terraria too and could host a server to play once I get my new computer. 

For Tv, I watch MLP, and animes and yeah that's about it. I usually can't stand american television xD I think my favorites are Fairy Tail (I have a Happy backpack ;3) and Gurren Lagann. Steins;Gate and Noein are amazing too. 

I do volunteer work for the Conservancy (people who work to keep the wilderness around our town healthy and stable) and hope to get over my anxiety enough to apply there to work eventually, but now I'm kind of stuck working at my parent's shop since I'm doing a lot of things on the computer that nobody else has a clue how to do xp 

---

So yeah, I guess that's everything really important, I'll add more if I think of stuff later maybe. I use Facebook and Skype mostly, but I do have MSN, steam, GW2, and could maybe make a tumblr (one friend already is bugging me to make one). So yeah, if you want to add me on anything, just PM me or say you want to here and I'll PM you, just please don't post any of your info here, since people who have nothing better to do with their lives would jump on the opportunity to harass us SRSers offsite :( [](/ajugh)

I've helped him try to get lawyers in the past for previous offenses but he never would show up in court (which here in US leads to another arrest if you fail to appear).  I found out he was arrested again early this morning (collect call from the jail) for another drug related offense as well as ANOTHER failure to appear...and I told him he was on his own this time.

We ended up talking about all kinds of things, mostly creepshots and rape, and now I'm completely feeling down.

He used all the typical arguments. Creepshots aren't illegal. Girls make false accusations. Men have their lives ruined all the time by false accusations. If you're just drunk, it's not rape. 

Now, he's not completely up to MR levels of asinine bull, because he does admit that women get abused by the court system in rape trials as well, he just thinks it's equal between men and women. 

I'm just like, I get that enough online, I don't need to get it offline too, from someone I care about. I don't know what I should do, really. I feel like sending him feminist links explaining these issues will only make things worse. It's not like this is the first time, and he sees my anger and emails full of explanatory links as an attack.

Part of me just wants to never bring it up again, because I want to get along. I don't want to leave him, I don't want our relationship to suffer, but sometimes he can be so infuriating.

It's not as though everything is all bad -- he sticks with me through all my major health issues, does almost all the housework because of my disability, I make more money than he does and he doesn't care. There's a lot I like about him too, just I wish he wasn't quite so dismissive of women's issues.

Edit: After having another talk (this one got more heated) he admitted that he'd been picking up these opinions from Reddit posts. He usually doesn't have an opinion one way or another, he's a pretty easy-going guy, but Reddit managed to change his mind... leaning toward MR. So, he didn't have a feminist education or read up on those ideas before coming to Reddit, and now he's absorbed the hivemind.  Great.

I did just share with him a link to a study that shows that when men seek child custody, they get what they want about 50% of the time.

I had an early-pregnancy abortion when I was young and got pregnant while I had an IUD. I was with the guy I am now married to, and though it was an excruciating choice for us because we knew we wanted kids SOME day, we felt it was the fairest and best choice to make for everyone (including the baby-that-would-have-been and any future children). 

We've never regretted the choice, but I'd be bald-faced lying if I said we never felt any sort of grief or sense of sadness at what happened. Every year the due date rolls around, my husband and I usually do something small together as an act of remembrance. We did what we know was right but it doesn't mean we were happy to do it, if that makes sense.

We're at a place in our lives where we want to have children, so we're actively trying to conceive (or TTC for short). As I perused various support and community forums for pretty much everything from baby making to motherhood, people who've had abortions but are now parents or pursuing parenthood are pretty much the elephant in the room that's not okay to discuss.  There's miscarriage and ""pregnancy loss"" support sub-forums, but it's an unspoken but relatively hard line rule that the parents and parents to be in those areas experienced a loss that was spontaneous and not an abortion or deliberate medical choice. Going into vent threads or feelings-sharing threads can be land minds of rage towards people who've had abortions. Not really good when you're dealing with peculiar feelings on your own journey from pangs of sadness to pangs of relief to then pangs of guilt about your own past and going from pregnant to not pregnant without birth or a baby to show for it. 

I don't know WHY I didn't expect this to bubble up when I started purposefully trying to become a mother, but thinking back on my abortion has given me anxiety and anxiety that's pretty specific to abortion-- it's hard not to internalize all the threats of how scar tissue can cause infertility, or how what if you're infertile and you ""threw away"" your chance to have a baby or you're going to be cosmically punished? You know logically that this stuff is all mostly scare tactics or crap, but it's hard to keep the shield up from how inundated women who get abortions are with the certainty from so many people that what they did was objectively wrong no matter what (and from both sides.. pro-choice people who say ""I could never do that to my baby, myself"" are many times just as psychologically damaging as pro-lifers). These aren't regrets, but more intrusive thoughts that really are things only other people who've chosen to terminate a pregnancy and are now pursuing or are in parenthood will likely understand fully. 

The thing that also sucks is that because of the fact that there's pretty much no dedicated forums for it, if you call it out and express your desire for something like that, people don't accept that you don't regret your decision and you simply want a place where you can honestly discuss the aftermath, especially as it relates to becoming a parent later on down the road. Instead you either get people getting huffy or angry with you, or directing you to religious websites to ""purify"" yourself or tell you to take it up with a therapist, when all you really want is to talk to some other people who can be like ""Oh god yeah, I worried the same stuff, you're not alone!"" and maybe an assurance or two of ""But it all turned out okay for me!"" and maybe a place to commiserate with other people how the anti-abortion propaganda out there has psychologically affected you. 

Sometimes, you're just straight-up told, ""Having a dedicated sub that mentions abortion is too offensive and hurtful for other people so it's not going to happen.""

I know that this seems like whining but it's something that I'm seeing over and over and has me down. Though in the process of typing this, I'm considering saying ""fuck it"" and creating a community of my own. I can't be the first or last person who's had an abortion to feel this frustration in the current parenting communities available. Now to find a snazzy name for it I guess, ha.

These people were my good friends in first year, although I can't understand why I tolerated all their bullshit before - self-hating minority I guess. 

The first thing my asian guy friend said to me when he saw me was that I looked ""different"", and then he said ""girly"" in this tone that made it seem like it's worse and weird and icky. I was dressed nicer than before and had nail polish on... shocker! He's like ""what are you gonna get into next?"" in this way where you ask a stoner what drug they're gonna get into next. Then he starts going on about how my eyes are small! Holy shit I was so offended. He was literally making an ""asian people have small eyes"" joke, except HE'S asian as well, but he has giant bulbous eyes so he can feel superior to all other asians. So to be fair, he made these jokes all the time in first year so he was trying to be friendly, but just no. I'm sick and tired of that shit. He also made fun of my driving, saying I probably couldn't drive, and he was oh so superior. 

Then my other friend... she's Indian, but all she can do is make Chinese jokes, like 'oh are you gonna eat your cat?' or 'can you even see through those small eyes??'. Before university, I never faced sexism or racism, but somehow, all these shitlords are popping up now. I assume this is because I'm in engineering. The group of friends I used to hang out with would always make bad driver jokes or 'girls in engineering are so ugly boo hoo my poor penis' or 'lolol your eyes are slits roflcopters'. 

And all these recent conversations have been pretty brief too! The asian guy friend was able to fit all those stereotypes and jokes within a half hour! Fuckin' amazing, these shitlords. I just tried to brush it off by giving a pretty forced smile and then moving on to the next topic, avoiding the subject, but nope... keeps coming up again and again. Sigh...

&gt;Generally, when it comes to politics, I try to keep things to my own page and usually don't comment on other people's posts. However, after these past few months and especially this past week, I have had enough. I have never seen more racism, hatred, bigotry, ignorance, and intolerance than I have from conservatives and Republicans. Those wanting to progress with healthcare reform, humans rights and equality, stricter food regulations, better education, government-assisted infrastructure, better working conditions, and generally everything else that would catapult us into the 21st-century are being met with constant resistance by the opposition who are digging their heels into the ground based on nothing else what Fox News has told them to think. I have seen posts advocating revolution against the government because Obamacare was passed by SCOTUS. I have seen open mockery of the president and the continued lies being spread that he is a socialist, a Kenyan, and a Muslim. Through all of this, I have kept my political stances to my own page as much as possible, because I didn't want to start yet more dissent among the parties who are supposed to be working together. However, my patience has finally been emptied. If you want to see who is really destroying the country, look at yourself in the mirror. See how your conservative and Republican values have dragged us behind the rest of the world in everything except the biggest defense budget. I am tired of you making my country the laughingstock of the world simply because you don't want to change your Dark Ages views. If you are conservative or Republican and not prepared to defend whatever political stance you post on Facebook, unfriend yourself. I have defended my views plenty of times against you and now it's my turn. Game on.

The response I'm getting from it is overwhelmingly supportive, but there are two individuals who have first said that ""As soon as the liberal agenda does not condone abortion we may have something to discuss"" and then another ""Have you considered that much of what you're calling ""progress"" is opposed to human rights?"" I've been engaging both of them with facts and statistics and have yet to be fazed or defeated by either of them.

How do I get her to realise the harm she's causing?,79,33,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/wf12e/im_having_a_problem_with_a_woman_i_play_internet/,"I posed this question to /r/girlgamers and (su-fucking-prise) half of the comments were men telling me just to deal with the fact gamers are always going to be terrible human beings, or leave my group. Warning, crossposted wall o'text ahead with minor TW for misogyny:

I'm part of Reddit's Eve Online spaceship alliance. It's a very large alliance (over 2k people at a guess) and, because of the allure of internet speaceships, competitive PvP with consequences, and super-complicated economy the playerbase is somehow even more dominated by male MMO nerd types than most other MMOs. The playerbase seems to be a bit older because of the complexity of the game scaring away the 14 year olds, this doesn't seem to make it any more mature though.

I know of quite a few other women in the alliance who also keep quiet, but there's been one woman who I've been getting quite upset by. She's nice and everything, but when she gets on voice comms she turns into every virginal MMO-playing neckbeard's dream Gurl Gamer: she welcomes ""tits or gtfo"" comments, plays up to their lewd and suggestive behaviors to the point of fake-orgasming for their entertainment, and even when she isn't being actively hounded by her ""fans"" she seems to go out of her way to sexualize every conversation she's in. Obviously this makes her very popular, which isn't in itself a bad thing, but she also badmouths girl gamers for being oversensitive or not being able to ""take a joke"" when being told to get back into the kitchen for the 10,000th time. From a forum thread:

&gt;As a female, can I just say FUCK FEMINISM.

&gt;Feminists always get fucking butthurt that they are treated differently, how they should be equal, how it's soooooo unfair if your a ""girl gamer"" because you just want to be treated the same. Well guess what? Females are treated the same. They get the same level of abuse as everyone else, it's just that feminists always run and make posts about how mean everyone is to them. Whoopie-fucking-do, someone said get back to the kitchen. SO THE FUCK WHAT? If this offends you so much, maybe you should get back to the kitchen because the internet and life in general is not for you.

I've had private discussions with her about this and she believes that by being a loud female voice she makes it easier for other women to join in but doesn't see that portraying herself as a controller licking attention seeker who enjoys misogyny and rape jokes actually reinforces the attitudes in the alliance that keep so many women from participating. I think she's actively hurting the girl gaming ""cause"" but she thinks she's being liberating.

Am I being oversensitive by taking offense? If not, any ideas for how I can convince her that she's being one of those girls who guy games hold up as examples of how all gamer girls are attention-seeking cybersluts?

I'm currently at the laundramat, trying to get some work done while my clothes dry, and some dude decides to strike up a conversation with me. I politely smile, don't answer, and go right back to typing away on my laptop. He doesn't get the hint. I have to keep ignoring him for about 20 minutes before he finally leaves me alone.

It's not just today, either. This happens all the time. Just the other day I was at the pool with my book, and someone I didn't know walked up and asked me what I was reading.

That and the amount of utter bullshit in those books saying that sex usually hurts, the whole ""cherry popping"" terminology, all the shit about how it will hurt girls the first time, how it will bleed, and all other SOCIETAL BULLSHIT made up to dissuade girls from ever having sex. Oh, I am fuming.


Also, when I was 14/15, I was involved with a very emotionally abusive guy who was older (16/17) who would pressure me into sexual situations that I wasn't comfortable in (situations where I could be caught, etc). He would make me feel horrid about my body and would always laugh at me and say that I didn't turn him on. Once he had me lay down on my bed (my parents were home and thought we had just gone upstairs to get my iPod) and was about to penetrate me, but I said, ""Is this a good idea....?"" And he stopped. I don't want to go into that, though. That was the scariest time in my life.


Couple weeks ago me and a guy I've had interest in for a long time (That situation is complicated, though) decided to hang out and get high. We started fooling around (I was high, and he was, too. It was all good, all consensual. though I know that the line can be fuzzy when drugs/alcohol are a factor.) and after a while (I was extremely wet, so I know that wasn't the problem) he started to insert, but couldn't even get the head in. I cringed and grabbed at his arm, so he stopped and looked at me incredulously (concerned type of surprised, though, not mad or impatient. I don't want there to be any misunderstanding here) and asked if that was hurting me. I nodded and he said that if that hurt, then he couldn't do it. I told him to try with his fingers for a second, so he did, but it hurt when he tried to get more than two in. So I told him to try PIV penetration again. He did, but he had to stop again because he had barely gotten the head and a bit more in, when suddenly I felt my pelvic muscles twitch (It was already hurting) and felt this horrible shooting pain and a burning sensation. I audibly cringed and he stopped immediately, saying that he wasn't going to keep going if it hurt me this badly (He looked really concerned about me). I guess I'm just seriously lucky that the guy I was with was being sweet about it. I was probably more disappointed than he was, but we went on to do other stuff.
So I've been reading around about what could have caused this, and I stumbled upon ""vaginismus."" After reading the description, I just started crying, no BAWLING. This explains why it took me years after starting to masturbate to be able to insert even one of my skinny fingers (and my fingers are seriously slim) into myself. And why I couldn't even insert the tiniest of tiny tampons for the longest time. And why the jumbo sized ones hurt me so badly.


I feel so alone and scared. I absolutely positively can't tell my mom about this. I don't have any aunts or grandmothers I could talk to. My school counselors/nurses are utter shit. I literally have no one. I don't want to be this way. I want to be able to have sex. What do I do? I feel utterly helpless.. I've looked up some of the exercises for it, but even inserting two fingers is almost too much for me. It burns and stings.


Someone please guide me in the right direction :( I hope I'm not overreacting, but this seriously sucks and makes me feel so insecure and sad about my body. Why is my body this way? And why haven't I heard about vaginismus? And why, WHY, when I went to the doctor at 13 thinking I had a septated hymen, wondering why the fuck I couldn't get a tampon in, DID NO ONE TELL ME ABOUT VAGINISMUS?

So Anita's Tropes Vs Women in Video Gaming comes out tomorrow (yay!).

First I call the women, and they all have excuses. Good excuses, like ""Tomorrow I have biology class from 4-10"", or ""I'm going to my dad's funeral"". ...Fair enough. 

Maybe I could try watching a feminist documentary with a man..it might be fun. So, I call my first man-friend, tell him the first episode comes out tomorrow, and he says ""...I don't really like youtube."". That's a ...pathetic excuse. Plus, I've seen him go on youtube almost every time I visit him. So I try another friend ""A documentary about video games, from someone who's not a real gamer, sounds boring"". That excuse is also pathetic. Gruh! It got to the point where every single man rejected me with a pathetic excuse, until finally my boyfriend's sister's boyfriend got really excited and was like ""ooh can i please please come over and see that?"" (he's the only out and proud feminist man I know)

Anyways, it wasn't a one-time-thing. The exact same scenario played out when I wanted to see Bridesmaids, but didn't want to go alone. Every guy, terrible excuse.

But on the other hand, the idea of saying ""well, i'll just never mention feminism or women around those guys"" seems like a non-productive cop out.

Since it was my turn I decided to check out a new store that is really near our place. So it's close and it is one of those tiny places that is right nest to a vet's office, where the vet is sometimes in the store offering advice (should you need it). 

I get there, and they have quality litter at a very reasonable price - I'm super happy - that means I found a new place that is cheap and close by. Anyway, I'm having a really pleasant conversation with the saleswoman, when in comes the vet. Grayish guy, mid-50s. Before I get into the conversation I should point out that I'm in my 30s but look like I'm in my early-mid 20s. 

He sees what I'm buying and starts off with:

""If you haven't spayed or neutered your cat, you should really think about it"" - and goes for his card. I totally understand this, he's trying to get new clients for himself. I tell him my cat is already neutered, which should tell him several things - I've had this cat for a while, at least long enough to have him neutered, and I probably know what I'm doing as a cat owner since I had it done.  

""What food are you feeding him"" - he continues, and I'm still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, so I tell him the brand, I don't specify which type of food.

""You should really give him food for sterilized cats"" - and here I start to get pissed off. I tell him that I do, but I didn't specify it, and here I'm frantically looking for the money to pay the saleswoman and get the hell out of there. BTW saleswoman is completely silent since the vet came in.

He continues mansplaining cats to me - ""Do you feed him grass?"" - to which I answer that I do and that I've had cats all my life, so I know what I'm doing. 

The next question totally floors me - ""Are you married?"" - WTH??? Before I get the chance to tell him it's none of his business he starts telling me how I should have the cat checked out for toxoplasmosis, since I'm young and that can be dangerous for pregnant women. WTH??? At this point I've payed and I'm walking out the door, without saying anything. He walks after me and says

""I meant nothing wrong, I was just giving you advice. No hard feelings?"" - I just look at him without saying a word, I say goodbye to the saleswoman and go. Definitely not buying anything there any time soon. 

Why the hell would he feel that it's OK to talk to me, a stranger, about my family situation, and my desire, or not to have children? Maybe I don't want to have kids, maybe I can't and that's a painful subject, maybe I'm gay, maybe I'm asexual etc etc. Because I'm perceived as a young woman of course, and that must mean that I don't know anything about anything (cats included) and that I'm planning a family. This has never happened to my SO. No stranger has ever commented on him having or not having kids. Strangers telling me things, giving advice or whatever, about having kids is almost a daily occurrence. I hate it, and I hate it the most when it comes from middle aged men, whether they are strangers I come across every day or politicians looking to limit reproductive rights and to turn women into baby-making machines.

Also, fuck that guy for mansplaining cats to me.

[background](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/129u9e/i_know_twox_isnt_for_everyone_but_is_there/) if you don't.

I just... ugh. I wouldn't say that it triggered me, but it's left me in kind of a funk, and very frustrated. 

From the time I was 11 or 12, until I was 15, my grandfather used to behave very ""inappropriately"" towards me, but it was never physical. It started one time when my brother and I were visiting, but my brother and my grandma were outside, so my grandpa and I were alone in the living room, and he turned on a porno. He didn't say anything, or look at me. I was sitting on the couch reading a book, and I just froze. Partly, I didn't want to acknowledge what was happening, because then I might have to talk about it, and partly I was genuinely curious about sex in general, although this was definitely not the context in which I would have wanted to learn. I just kept reading my book, and neither of us said anything about it. After that, though, he started turning on porn every time we were alone in the living room together, to the point that I would just follow my grandma around when I would visit, to avoid being caught alone with him, and I would avoid using the bathroom at their house so that I wouldn't have to walk through the living room to get to it.

Then there were the phone calls. My family lives in the midwest, and for a time my grandparents had a house down in Florida where they would stay for the winter. Sometimes, especially on special occasions like Christmas, they would call to say hi and the phone would get passed around so that each grandkid would get the chance to say hi. Sometimes, he would maneuver it so that my grandma was out of the room when he would get me on the phone, and he would tell me that he'd ""found some videos for us to watch,"" or he would ask whether or not I had a boyfriend yet and try to talk to me about ""taking care"" of a man. This was on Christmas Day, when I was in the middle of the living room surrounded by my family, and I was all of 13 years old. I had to figure out how to let him know that I DID NOT WANT THIS without letting any of my family know about this whole horrible, mortifying deal. I'd laugh nervously and say things like, ""no thank you"" and try to pass the phone off to my brother or my cousin as quickly as possible.

Also, once when we went down there to spend Christmas with them, he tried to peek at me changing my clothes, but I (once again) froze, and after a couple minutes he walked away.

And I just... the OP of that thread thinks that I'm just supposed to shrug all this off? That it's no big deal because I was never physically harmed? That I should have calmly told him to stop being an asshole and then extricated myself from the situation? That would have meant explaining everything to my entire family, which I still haven't done a decade later; at 13 or 14 years old, it would have been entirely unthinkable. Hell, even just typing it out here is making me slightly sick to my stomach, and I'm doing it on a throwaway. Or she thinks that the fact that this affects me, that it's kind of a Big Thing in my life, rather than just something I can roll my eyes at, is me being whiny and ""acting like a victim""?

And don't get me wrong, I'm well aware that it could have been a lot worse. I've long considered myself LUCKY that it wasn't, that it never turned physical. But that shouldn't be the luck of the draw, that should be every woman's GODDAMN RIGHT. And it was that realization that led me to feminism, that led me to working to dismantle rape culture. The idea that I should just shrug off the harassment that reinforces that rape culture (the same rape culture that enables abusers like mine every day)? Or the idea that I'm at fault for my own abuse because I ""allowed"" it, or that shouting back even always works (it did, eventually, for me, but in many cases it only makes things worse)? It's just absurd and enraging.

When my ex was drunk, he'd often play what I call the shame game. He'd pick one part of my body and go on and on about what's wrong with it. I'd ask him to stop, and he'd say that he was just being honest and that I needed to hear him out. After an hour of this I'd usually start crying, and he'd tell me off for being so sensitive when it was just the truth and I must have thought about this before because it's such an obvious flaw.

I think he went over most of my body. My eyes are too small, my nose too wide, my face too long, my breasts too saggy, my hipbones not pointy enough, my butt too small in relation to my huge thighs, my vagina too loose, etcpp4ever.

I broke up with him two years ago and I'm still far from comfortable with myself. But with most of these traits, I can at least look at other women and, on good days, realise that I'm in fact not some gross monstrosity. I look pretty normal.

But... you can't really do that with a vagina.

Sure, I can tell myself that his penis was hardly bigger than his thumb (I don't mean that in a shaming way, it just was), that the guy after him needed several tries to fit in at all with lots of lubrication, that I've just gone through months of training to get my mooncup in and out without feeling too much like I'm gonna tear something, and that it doesn't really matter either way. But it just doesn't change anything.

I haven't had sex without tightening my muscles throughout the act to the point where it's not pleasurable for me since, and still get anxious that it won't feel good for them, that they'll say something. So I avoid having sex at all (for this and all the other reasons). Fitting the mooncup was a necessity and I wanted it, but this thought ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU'RE MAKING IT EVEN HUGER AND GROSSER"" was prominent the whole time and it's still there every time I use it even though I know it's bullshit.

Last week I got some toys in the hopes that actually doing something with that body part will help me like it more and subdue the huge-and-gross thoughts a little. The first try didn't go very well, but I hadn't really expected anything else. We'll see.

Okay, not quite sure where I was going with this. I think I just wanted to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading :*

I ended up at the doctor's office in tears and in the middle of the i don't even know how manieth panic attack. I went back to my lovely therapist and together with my doctor we decided that I should take at least two weeks off. I am not able to concentrate, I feel sick, I don't sleep... I needed rest and some time to get back on my feet.

My therapist and doctor have to tell me that every time I go in: you ARE sick, funghii, stop feeling guilty. Then this lady comes along and tells me... what the public thinks of me. What my neighbours and colleagues probably think: how is she sick? she doesn't do anything all day!

1343325330.0,42,self.SRSWomen,x78eh,Am I overreacting to my boyfriend's treatment of our cats?,57,15,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x78eh/am_i_overreacting_to_my_boyfriends_treatment_of/,"I don't know if this is the best place for this post, but I do know I'm in a really vulnerable state right now and wouldn't be able to take someone insulting me in response today.

I'm 28, with a live-in boyfriend the same age. We recently decided to foster 2 young cats for about a month while our friends, who normally foster them, are not at home. We were curious if we were cut out for being cat owners, as well, so this seemed like a good idea.

Both cats came to us well-socialized, if a bit standoffish. When they began to act out, like getting into cabinets, scratching furniture, etc, I took to the internet to find out why they did these things and how to avoid them/minimize the damage.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, has been lashing out at them. He hasn't hurt them, but he'll react impulsively when a cat ""acts out"" and put it in its crate rather rashly.

Last night, we working to clip the nails of one of them, the one who absolutely hates having its nails cut. The cat was getting uncomfortable and making whining sounds, so I thought it was time to let her go and we'd try again later. Right as I made this decision in my mind, the cat swatted at my face and I took a huge step back. I was fine and I yelled out, but my boyfriend pushed the cat aside and then, even though I told him I was fine, he started yelling at the cat and tossed it across the room.

I had a strong reaction to this and we ended up fighting. I told him that I'd pointed out his poor reaction to the cats in the past, and had repeatedly told him that a) it made me uncomfortable and b) it isn't even an effective way to discipline cats, that it'll just make things worse. He accused me of ""taking their side,"" and failed to understand when I tried to explain to him that mistreatment of animals is supposed to be a warning sign of abuse and it really made me scared that he would ignore repeat statements by me that I was uncomfortable.

He kept accusing me of being ridiculous or making overblown claims, and talking about the cats like they were ""out to get him."" I told him I wanted out. Texted my friends to tell them the cats needed a new home, emailed my mom to ask if I could move home, and ended up in tears. I've been in an abusive relationship before, so maybe I am just being oversensitive? Regardless, the argument hit a lot of triggers and I ended up calling the suicide hotline.

Thankfully, I was able to fall asleep, but is this too big a move on my part? I mean, the cats aren't actually hurt, but I was really uncomfortable with the situation and felt I wasn't being heard. I threatened moving out in the heat of the moment, but if I actually do it, I'll probably lose my job and will also no longer have a car (I live in L.A. and that's kinda necessary), in addition to breaking the lease and fucking up my rental history.

The two of us have a couples counseling session this afternoon and I'm afraid of what will happen. Should I stick to my guns on principle, or am I just overreacting and not thinking straight?

tl;dr I don't like how my boyfriend disciplines cats, is that reason enough to break up with him and up-end my life?

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, everybody. I am leaving to meet him at our therapy appointment now. I don't know what will happen, but I will try to check back in.

I commented playfully about how she should help a girl out but mentioned that it's not a life or death thing not to shave or whatev.

Well, of course, some menz came in saying, ""hairy pussy is smelly pussy"" and, ""EW HAIR IN MY MOUFFFFF!"" 

Being me, I told them, in other words, that they have no right to tell a woman what to do with her public hair - if she wants it, fine, if she doesn't, fine. Yeah, I went defensive because I've been dealing with a lot and I didn't need shitheads telling me about how my body should be.

It evolved into this whole thing where I got called a femini-nazi and was told to go do laundry. 

I thought my friend would defend me but instead she goes, ""you just like feminism because you're a woman and you want to feel empowered. Feminism is dead to me."" 

Then then another girl pops in saying that the guys were right, ""public hair holds germs and it's gross and icky. And women who don't shave are lazy.""



Suddenly the guy is demanding I add him, adding little hearts around his demand like that's supposed to make it better. I basically told him to fuck off and I don't owe him anything, especially not the privilege of being my friend on something even so trivial as facebook.




So yeah, help me out. I need to not only understand how feminism can be such a filthy word to some women but how do I handle my non-feminist friends. I feel like punching a wall. Or just deleting my facebook and being like fuck it, even though it's the only way I can keep in contact with some people. 

**Edit:** I forgot to add that the second girl mentioned that pubic hair gets clumpy with period blood and that's totes disgusting. My face was pure what.

We dated for ~9 months. We broke up because he had a horrible temper and was just generally emotionally volatile and way too intense.

 About 4 years ago, he finds me on Facebook. He messages me and says that he is really sorry for the way he acted when we were dating, he's grown a lot, etc. He was married, so I didn't think it was a come-on and friended him. A few months later, he says some racist mess about Hispanic immigrants (my BIL happens to be one) and I tell him off and unfriend him. 

He contacts me a year later, to tell me he's been ""thinking about"" me and that he's sorry. I tell him fine, I'm glad he's learned but I don't want him to contact me again. He sends me a long screed, harranguing me for stuff that happened when we were dating. I lol and send it to all my friends. Ignore him.

A year after that, he again contact me. ""I had a dream about you last night. I'm praying for you."" (He knows I'm an atheist.) I tell him to stop messaging me. He sends me another message about how much he ""respects me."" I ignore and block him.

Now, he's just sent me another message (somehow getting around me blocking him, possibly by starting a new FB account?) and again, ""I'm praying for you and your daughter"" followed by a long apology, again rehashing our relationship.

Its just...it feels so weird and creepy and violating. Like, its been 12 YEARS! Ugh, I've blocked him again and there's not a whole lot I can do other than that. He hasn't really escalated.

The article itself is fun, but it included [a link to a .pdf entitled ""A Feminist Reading of *The Great Gatsby*""](http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/aljarf/Documents/English%20Language%20Teaching%20Conference%20-%20Iran%202008/Soheila%20Pirhadi%20Tavandashti.pdf). It's a very basic introduction to the idea of feminist literary criticism through *Gatsby*, and it's also a nice refresher course on Feminism 101.

During the discussion, /u/shneerp and I decided to do a lightning read of *Gatsby* this week before the film comes out on the 10th. We'll discuss it in a thread next ~~weekend sometime~~ Sunday over in /r/SRSBooks, and anyone who wants to join us is totally welcome! The discussion will focus primarily on a feminist reading of the novel, and the .pdf I linked provides a nice context and primer for anyone unfamiliar with that style of criticism.

If anyone's able to see the film or get through the slim novel (only 180 pages!) this week, feel free to head over and share your thoughts! &lt;3

**edit**: shneerp has some great plans for this, so it should be a lot of fun!

I'm glad to join you all here.

So I've been living abroad in the UK for about a year and a half now doing my MA and now my PhD, but originally I am from the US. My group of friends back home - made up of girls and gay guys - is very open on any and all topics, including sex, birth control, and all the ""TMI"" details accompanying them. Safe to say I've become used to having crazy conversations without much repercussions. Of course, I know there are boundaries with new people, and I tread carefully.

In the UK I'm living in a large house with eight other people, all from the UK/mainland Europe, and so you would assume that - being European - they would be even MORE comfortable discussing sexuality than Americans. But that **hasn't** been the case, exactly; we've gone out a few times as a group and have gotten drunk together, etc, but every time I touch on the topic of sex - having it, birth control, vaginas, etc - the mood in the room immediately turns extremely awkward. This happens even in spite of the fact that one of my housemates (and good friends) discusses weird porn on a regular basis, and at most gets awkward laughter in response. Contrast this to me *obviously* joking about IUDs and visits to the OBGYN, where many of my housemates (but not all) looked SO CLEARLY uncomfortable with the topic and basically tried to get me to stop talking about it.

**TL;DR: I'm so tired of this double standard that men can discuss dicks and porn and sex at their leisure but the minute that *I* joke about having a small twat, they look as if I'm drowning a baby right there in front of them, *in slow motion*.**",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_1c9ngn,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1c9ngn/why_is_it_so_weird_when_women_bring_up_the_topic/,

I'm posting here because I really have no gauge for acceptable levels of shitlordery when it comes to anti-feminist, anti-welfare rhetoric and you all won't just dismiss me as ""emotionally invested"" and ""too sensitive"" for my concern like my co-worker already has.

Setup: I work in an educational environment where students come to get aid on coursework from various educators. Educators and students work one on one. I have a newish coworker whose approach and content has raised many alarms, especially regarding privilege spewing in an intended safe space.


1. He told a student that ""angry feminists"" have made ""she"" the default pronoun in academic writing instead of ""he."" [Which is is just completely false academic advice on top of being totally against our rules towards discussing sexism and politics outsides of assignments explicitly on the topics of sexism and/or politics.]

2. He waxes on and on about how lazy he believes children of immigrants are, trash talking them openly and loudly in an educational environment made largely of immigrants and children of immigrants.

3. He ignores students' names on the board while hanging out in the staff office (board is visible from there), leaving students without help for 15+ minutes while all other educators in the discipline are already busy with their own students.

4. He puts his bare feet on the chairs that both educators and students sit on despite the many campus-wide warnings about the dangers of staph. Not rhetoric related, but an example of an overall unprofessional approach.

4. He asked for geography lessons on where Bangladesh is in comparison to India from an educator from Bangladesh who was just trying to walk to the staff room, and then went on to call him Indian for the rest of the conversation despite the Bangladeshi educator correcting him multiple times.

5. He openly expresses contempt for all forms of welfare and dehumanizes those who receive welfare as lazy and/or addicts. On top of these comments just being unneeded, we have a strong ""no politics"" policy where we work and are at a campus in a high-poverty area. Most of our students receive some sort of financial aid and are the exact ""fraudster addicts"" that he regularly expresses disdain for.

He's relatively new, but these problems started the very first day and haven't gotten any better over time. It's made me feel extremely uncomfortable to the point of wanting to interrupt his student-educator sessions to correct the flat out falsehoods he says about feminism and grammar to students who just need help with writing essays with proper formality. I would never interrupt an educator-student session and undermine another educator like that, but I have no idea how to keep his misinformation from students without raising some sort of fuss.

He doesn't seem 100% malicious, mainly ignorant and naive as he talks about bootstraps and personal responsibility while living with his parents and bragging about lack of bills. It's the lying to students and complete disregard of the intention of having a safe space for all students, feminists and welfare recipients included, that really makes me wonder if I should speak to the managers. My attendance record at work isn't the squeakiest, so I fear that I would get terminated or laid-off for airing my concerns with this educator's methods. 

tl;dr Is this guy acceptable levels of shitlord for an educational environment, or should I speak up and possibly lose a job I've had a rather long time?",,False,,t5_2tdoc,False,,,True,t3_11u4rd,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/11u4rd/potentially_shitlord_coworker_misinforming/,

My one sister is Christian and though she doesn't talk about her politics, I'm pretty sure she's a moderate liberal. And I'm pretty much a bleeding heart liberal atheist, unknown to my poor dad. 

Back when I was a teenager growing up, I dated ""good Christian boys"" and went to a Christian high school. And I didn't really know any better- I had friends who were liberals, of course, but we all got along. 

Anyway, long story short, years pass, I'm now a huge liberal, live in a really liberal state with really liberal friends and have started dating really liberal guys. And the thing that really bothers me? I can't even say this out loud, because it seriously twists up the britches of almost every liberal guy who thinks he's above this (but I'm in a unique position most people don't ever understand, I think, of having a very varied and broad range of life experience with different politics/dudes) - but I need to get this off my chest.

LIBERAL DUDES ARE SOMETIMES WAY MORE MISOGYNISTIC AND AWFUL THAN CONSERVATIVE DUDES. WTFFFFF??????????

It's like they're more offended when you're hurt by them because ""LOL no way I'm totally the most enlightened guy ever."" and they lack this deeply ingrained chivalry and respect for women that a lot of southern christian boys have- and I know, I know, that patronizing stuff is bad but dammit, srswomen, sometimes I actually miss it! Sometimes I actually think the ""always respect a lady, never hit a lady, never pressure a lady for sex, never ask a lady about her sex life, be a gentleman"" stuff is actually, well...*preferable.* I actually miss it and that whole culture. Seriously. And contrary to what some liberals believe, most conservative ladies are ""tough southern belles"" and DO have careers and jobs and are allowed to be sassy and whatever else. The difference? Men find it charming and have a hands off attitude of respect for women.

And liberal dudes often have this brainwashed attitude that sexism against men is a thing or we live in a ""post-everything"" society, so they get to play the victim card, too- whereas, most conservative men I've known would seriously LAUGH IN THE FACE of ever claiming that. They wouldn't even dream of it. 

Not to mention, a lot of liberal guys have this hugely open attitude about sex such that if you're not pleasing him you're a prude, and you should be okay with open relationships and whatever else, whereas, do I even need to say it? Most more conservative guys wouldn't dare to bring that shit up, or at least would realize that it's not ""lol totally ridiculous for women to ever have reservations about sex and lol we live in a post-slur world lol.""

Why is this so fucked up? Am I alone in this? I will say, like 1 out of 10 liberal guys actually is a very wonderful person, like so wonderful it actually puts me to shame and I learn from him, but he's a freaking needle in a haystack. If the thought of living with a guy who insists we go to church every Sunday and doesn't believe in taxes and might be a secret racist wasn't so terrible, I think I'd go straight back to the South tomorrow.

He is referencing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zihjp/you_just_need_to_faggot_less_360/c65239a) post I made about a fight my bf and I had. Yes, I lost my cool, but my grievances were no less valid. I honestly was reacting to the fact that I have always been told (by shit lords) to just ""get over"" racist/sexist slurs and ""jokes."" And the thought that my boyfriend could possibly be in the category of these shit lords was confusing and infuriating.

Anyway, I just wanted to ask, has anyone else been targeted by AntiSRS? I mean, I haven't looked for the thread about me, for obvious reasons (I mean, honestly, they want to circlejerk about a situation they really don't know about? alright).

Why is it that when women are sick and tired of something, and lose their cool, they are horrible horrible people. I never hit him, I never called him names. I cried out of frustration that I was being silenced *once again* and I hit a wall because... what am I supposed to do with *that much* frustration? Frustration that has been building up for **years**.

These jerks want to make my boyfriend out to be some poor abused boyfriend, when in reality it was not that way *at all*. My boyfriend saw his posts to me and said ""fucking shit lords."" He was angry that some bigoted ass holes wanted to make my bf out to be a poster boy for *horrible, horrible* abuse from teh wimminz! My bf took the time to sit down and think about my point, seeing how upset it made me, and ended up understanding why those words are actually hurtful and not funny. He was able to do this because he meets the minimum requirements for a decent human being, and **beyond**.

Ugh.

EDIT: Found the thread about me. Some shitlord decided to let me know about it. How nice of him :)

The summary to the above is basically after years of by anxiety and depression being mocked and ignored by my parents, it got to the point that I did terribly in school and I was absolutely **terrified** of telling my parents, knowing I wouldn't be heard.


The aftermath of this is that I was on academic suspension for this spring semester, which meant I could not take classes.  My parents also decided it wasn't ""worth it"" for them to continue paying for my education (which is fine, I never wanted them to pay and be in debt because of me). I took a retail job nearby and started saving, in the hopes that I would move out or at least dorm, just get away from my parents. I have put my deposit in for my dorm, and I'm making plans to get my stuff out.

I should mention that I plan to do this without telling the parents, when they're not home, because they have literally told me that they expect me to live with them until I get married off.


I have two weeks to sort out loans and other related things and I'm just feeling stressed. I don't know if I'll be able to get a loan, and find a job closer to campus (I don't drive). I know that potentially moving without a source of income is poor planning, and this very well may not work out, but I'm just so angry. Angry that:

* My dad throws everything I say back in my face mocks me when I get upset by flailing his arms in the air and repeating what I say in a childish voice. It's disgusting and insulting
* My dad will try to publicly shame me about my performance at school by telling family member who do nothing but gossip (His defense is that they're family and ""deserve to know"") and tell others how my job is for ""people who drop out of college"" in front of me
* My mom always laughs at me when I'm angry
* My mom told everyone I was ""dieting"" when in reality I was struggling to maintain my weight due to anorexia. This is something I had to work on on my own
* After all this time I still go to therapy in secret
* If my parents ever found out about the above they would label me as a crazy pill-popping zombie
* My parents consider people who take antidepressants as crazy pill-popping zombies
* Telling me that I'm acting like this on purpose and that I should stop hurting them
* My social life is limited. I can't stay out past 10 and I can't drive....parents decided they wanted to teach me themselves and this never happened. My friends have been teaching me when they can.
* My internet access is restricted at home because I ""waste too much time"" and if I want unrestricted access I may while dad is looking over my shoulder

Even though I've improved a lot by surrounding myself with great friends and using every resource available to me for handling anxiety and depression, I can't bear the thought of being stuck here where I'm invalidated and every aspect of my life is controlled.

She blocked me from her Facebook shortly after that. Today, I got my hands on the conversation between her and my brother (who is NOT FB friends with me so he has no idea what is going on), and this is the entire fucking conversation:

&gt;E (the gossiper): Dude, what happened to ninja_guinea pig? She's going crazy?

&gt;J (my brother): Crazy? explain lol

&gt;E: She used to be a strong Christian, sweet, intelligent, friendly. Now she's against everything Godly, is belligerent, jumps to conclusions, and I think she might be a lesbian.

&gt;J: Yeah... she's well... ""out there"". I blame college professors and their ""open mindedness""

&gt;E: Probably, but I feel that something might have happened to her. Some circumstance maybe. I don't know. Someone she met or something.

&gt;J: Yeah... I'm sorry for anything she said to you or anything like that. She's kinda out there on her own right now.

&gt;E: Yeah, I blocked her eventually.

&gt;J: Probably for the best, as much as it pains me to say it.
My mother, father, and I are still devoit Christians so don't lose hope haha!!
devoted*

&gt;E: lol. Oh good.
YEah, it made me sad. I rarely block people unless they become consistently belligerent


&gt;J: its a mystery to me. Oh and congratulations on your wedding!

&gt;E: thanks!  
Is she actually a lesbian?

&gt;J: I actually am not in communication with her, so I wouldnt be able to answer, truthfully.

&gt;E: lol. Ok. I think she might be.
Even during our private conversations she has been very angry. The last time I had a homosexuality debate with someone who was that angry about it they were gay. lol
You have no reason to be so angry about something unless the thing targets you or a loved one.


&gt;J: Well, right now for me, I don't investigate into stuff like that or look to understand the ""other side"" of gays and lesbians. It's hard enough for a 20 year old man to keep his nose clean in today's world without looking for trouble haha!

&gt;E: I agree!
I suppose leave it to the women to debate about this stuff! For the most part. lol
Regardless of any religious beliefs, why would anyone honestly want to marry another person who has the same strengths and weaknesses as they do? And statistics say children fare better in heterosexual households with both parents persent.
*present


&gt;J: I just know that I enjoy women way too much to swing the other way haHA!

&gt;E: oh gosh
lol
and I'm too annoyed by them to swing the other way
I like my strong and logical husband. lol
anyway, going to chik fil a now. lol.
Have a great day!


My brother basically threw me under the bus, and even though I have been through a LOT of abuse from my family, at least I defend them in public. This fucking sucks. My mom has been questioning why I'm being rude on Facebook and that people are going to think that I'm gay if I post stuff about gay rights. She bought into it hook, line, and sinker, and won't even believe me when I tell her repeatedly that E is known to be a gossiper for as long as I've known her (probably 7 years now).

And my brother and I do fucking talk. We play video games together via Internet several times a week. He's just as bad as E is in my mind.

I'm not overreacting, right?

EDIT: I'm watching Rachel Maddow. If I *was* lesbian, I know who I would pick for ideal partner. She's so freaking awesome.

SECOND EDIT: I did post an update on Facebook about this.

&gt;So it would appear that my support for gay rights has led to a case of cyber-bullying. ""E"" private-messaged me to continue the discussion of the companies which Chick-Fil-A supports and, after some conversation, asked me if I was a lesbian, since I was so passionate about this subject. I told her that was none of her business, she proceeded to take that as a ""yes, I'm a lesbian,"" blocked me from her Facebook (hence my posting this publicly since I can't tell it to her directly), and then proceeded to tell my brother that she thinks I'm a belligerent lesbian. Said gossip then made its way to my mom, subsequently driving a wedge between my family and me based on nothing more than a rumor. It is a sad state one's life is in when she resorts to spreading gossip about someone she barely knows to one's own family, who knows me better than anyone else.",,False,,t5_2tdoc,1344004049.0,,,True,t3_xlr8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/xlr8i/fuck_people_who_have_nothing_better_to_do_than/,

1.) If you are lighting off fireworks/sparkler/roman candles, make sure you're a safe distance from others.  Also it's a good idea to NOT be intoxicated while lighting them.

2.) If you're having a barbecue or any other type of cookout, be aware of how close your grill or other cooking device is to the other guests.

3.)  If you're lighting anything off, please be sure to have a fire extinguisher on hand.  (Also if you have long-ish hair, you may want to consider pinning it up.  I accidentally lit my hair on fire last year)

4.)  Have fun!  Enjoy the day with friends/loved ones.  Or if you prefer to be by yourself then enjoy the day with yourself! :)

So now that the tips are out of the way, what are your plans for the day?  I plan on reviewing for an exam and then heading to a local park with some classmates to watch the evening fireworks.  Then come home and light my wal-mart bought ones off with my neighbors.  

Will add more tips on in EDITS

EDIT #1:

5.) from garlicstuffedolives:  dags are scared of loud noises. Make sure yours are safely inside when the fireworks are going off.  (Same applies to any other pet you may have)

EDIT #2:

6.) from Notnowwonton: drive or bike safely and soberly! If on foot, walk defensively.  OP ADDING ONTO THIS:  Flashlights are your friend! Army surplus stores sell very strong flashlights in a nice small portable size (step-dad is overprotective of daughters...the day we turned 18 that was one thing in our 'goody bag' ) and not that expensive.

EDIT #3:
7 &amp; 8 .) from thepinkmask: 

7) please be conscious that fireworks can be especially triggering for people (human and non-human) with PTSD.

8) please remember vegans and vegetarians exist and salad is not a meal. We need protein, just like everyone else :)",,False,,t5_2tdoc,1341405202.0,,,True,t3_w05gy,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/w05gy/just_a_friendly_reminder_for_those_of_you_who/,

I've never been triggered so hard in my life. Oh, I didn't have a panic attack (thank goodness), but I stopped breathing and started crying. I'd never seen anything so closely resembling what happened to me. Nor did I ever expect to- no movie, no series I'd heard of depicts that sort of assault. I almost wished there'd been a trigger warning- not that I would have paid it any heed, given that my PTSD is basically under control now.

I'm so deeply shocked right now. What was that, what happened? Did he rape her? Did he assault her? She may not have said 'no', but she clearly didn't want him to go on. I know how she felt. God, I know all too well. The expression on her face... Fucking hell.

That scene appears to have rocked the interwebs- well, at least a little bit. People are wondering whether it was rape. In any case, it seems to have shaken people up a bit, to see a girl being used like that, when every muscle in her body is clearly screaming ""stopstopstop"". Good.

I posted this because it was a great example of why I'm so damn thankful that SRSWomen is a thing.*

First of all, *dat title*. I can just feel the judgement oozing out of those words.

Basically, what went down in this post is that our dear author decided that us poor ladies need a reminder to not be nagging hags towards the men we have somehow lured into our clutches.

[](/feministfun)

&gt;I've noticed that a lot of women talk to their boyfriends with total and utter disrespect in public. If a man was talking to his girlfriend in such a manner, I'm sure people would bad mouth him either behind his back or perhaps to his face, and say he was being verbally abusive.

AWESOME, let's play the HYPOTHETICAL game! Where every hypothesis is a valid contrasting device.

&gt;As an example, I had one woman, she was probably in her early 20s, with her boyfriend, buying some books. She was so mean, condescending, and controlling I was embarrassed for this guy! The conversation went something like this:

[](/goodnews)

&gt;""Hi, you found some books?"" This is me talking.

&gt;""Yes, John. JOHN, put those books on the counter."" This is the woman speaking, she sounded very annoyed and as if she was talking to her 6-year-old son who has issues with listening skills.

&gt;John placed the books on the counter for me to ring through.

&gt;""That will be $23.55"" Me again.

&gt;""John, give her the money. NOW"" This was pronounced more like ""NOWWWWE"" with an extra syllable at the end.

OH NO WATCH OUT HERE COMES ANOTHER SYLLABLE (literally Hitler)

&gt;John hands me $25. She took the change and put it in her pocket.

&gt;""Put those books in your backpack."" Her again, sounding even more annoyed with him.

&gt;He didn't say a word. Not one word. His eyes were downcast. I felt so horrible for him! Now this isn't an isolated case. I hear women talking to their partners like this quite often. They are mostly women in their early 20s. I often think to myself ""if you hate him that much, why are you with him?"" because that's what it sounds like. Pure hatred for another person you are supposed to love.

Note how the above paragraph is all about how horrible early 20's wimminz can be to the poor menz, but the following paragraph is now suddenly all about the **him/her**.

&gt;So I guess what I'm saying is, if you are with someone, treat him (or her) with respect. Don't speak to him/her as if you are an annoyed 16 year old. No one likes to be spoken to that way, and to be honest, no one likes to hear you speak that way to someone else. If he annoys you so badly that you can't control yourself, then maybe it's time to find someone else.

I've acted like a serious special snowflake in the past and tried my best to be seen as one of the 'bros'. (y r teh wimminz so sily?/ tehe etc.)

I've been lurking the various SRS subreddits for a week or so now and holy crap, has it been a revelation.

I'm recovering from thirteen or so years of diagnosed social anxiety with a delicious topping of depression icing but I'm still not out of the woods yet. I've only recently been calm (and medicated) enough to leave the house by myself and go places alone. 

I'm a 23 year old woman and holy fuck the amount of misogyny, ableism, racism and straight up shittiness I've internalized and thought was 'ok' is disgusting, really. This doesn't bother me however, because I can work on myself and get rid of all my shitty thoughts. Stop using slurs and offensive phrases and better myself.

What's really bothering me is the amount of misogyny I'm coming across and seeing for the first time. It's not only that but I can't tell if I'm just overreacting and becoming too sensitive to anything I might vaguely construe as sexist or if my instincts are right when they scream ""THAT WAS OFFENSIVE!"" at me.

For example today I was out to find some ducting for the extractor fan over the cooker. I want the rigid kind not the accordion-y kind. I tied my dogs up outside the place and went in. After waiting for a little bit the man behind the counter asked me if I needed anything. Now, when I get any anxiety at all I tend to start forgetting words and substituting in 'thingy', 'yoke', 'whatchamacallit' etc.

I say I need some of the subduct for the thing over the cooker, (clear as mud, right?). He looks at me like I've grown an extra head and we stare at eachother for around 30 seconds. He then asks in a joking tone if it's Jif I'm after, (Jif is a brand of cleaning spray in Ireland). I get pissed, make up some excuse and leave. 

Cause the only reason a woman would DARE leave the kitchen is to buy cleaning products, amirite?! What was I thinking going into a MAN'S shop to buy something a MAN would have to fit anyway? Sure the only thing I would be doing is flitting around dusting and making tea and sandwiches while my cookerhood is having venting fitted. Hell, what's the point in me even trying to get a bit of piping and an elbow joint, I'd only buy the wrong thing anyway and a man would have to swoop down and fix my silly mistake!

Am I seeing something that isn't there and overreacting to a silly joke a man said in a hardware shop? Or a man claiming women have it 'so easy' while I'm in the pub? What about when I'm also in the pub and a man knows I'm good at computers and technical stuff but insists on relaying what his daughter's boyfriend knows about some problem he's having while asking me my opinions?

It's starting to really depress me if it's only after lurking in SRS for the past week or so that I'm starting to see these things. And if I'm not just overreacting why did I put myself through hell and back in therapy to walk out, feeling like I'm finally getting better, only to be slapped down and told UR MENTAL ILLNESS GOIN AWAY? OKEI BUT UR STIL ONLY A WOMMIN LOL TITS OR GTF0, GET 2 THRE KITCHIN ND MAEK ME SAMMICH, THE ADULTZ R TALKIN RITE NOW BITCH! LOLOLOL.

This Halloween I’m going as a sad zombie clown, a decidedly unsexy costume. I’m sick of the tyranny of sexy. ‘But, but, but you must! You can’t be serious. Sexy is sex and sex is back in style.

But tell me, look around and what do you see? What is sexy? Going by what’s been drilled into my head through decades of countless repetition, sexy is...Sexy is shirtless twenty-something men with washboard stomachs and rock hard pecs, guys blessed with smooth skin and lightning fast metabolisms, men who spend half their lives in the gym. Sexy is just barely of age skinny little women bearing curves, women who look nothing like me. Sexy is an exclusive club and chances are you’re not a member, and if you are you won’t be for long.

Sexy has stolen the joy of going out on the town and turned it into a battle of my body and mind and society, a struggle to overcome what I see and feel, to tell myself stories, sing little sub-cultural songs of inner-beauty and bodies being like flavors, ‘there’s something there for everyone,’ to counter the collective story of never good enough spoken over the endless pulsing beat of inequality, of winners and losers. Which side are you on? I can’t be the only one for whom sexy makes looking in the mirror like staring down the barrel of a gun.

Sexy almost ruined Halloween; turned the one day of freedom to break out of our cells, to escape the residue of consequence we call ourselves, into its own silk sheeted cage of aping cliché masquerading as sex-positive liminal infinity.

This Halloween I’m going as a sad zombie clown, a decidedly unsexy costume. Sexy can go fuck itself.

Unexpected, eh?

In SRSHome I made a big long post about how this community helped me with my sexuality issues -- something that had been bugging me for a long time. It was great to realize my pansexuality, but for some reason that still wasn't hitting it for me. Something was still missing and while I was a bit happier, I still kind of had this hollowness in myself and was down in the dumps a lot. 

Well at the beginning of June, I was screwing about at my completely unstimulating job (like I always do) and I was thinking. Asking myself questions, I suppose. What do I want from life? Am I really pansexual? Should I stay in college? What do I want in a partner? Blah Blah Blah. Well then, out of the blue, for the very first time ever, I asked myself, ""Am I a woman?""

I stopped in my tracks. Like, seriously. That was the very first time I'd ever questioned my gender. I don't exaggerate -- it turned my world upside down. Completely. I then spent the rest of the day thinking about all of the major events of my life. School, work, dating, sex, etc., and all of the instances where I truly felt secure in my identity as a man. 

I couldn't think of one. That's when I decided that this was a serious thing that should be given a lot of thought. 

So I've been thinking about it a lot. That's good! Ever since I have been, my self-image has been REALLY IMPROVING. I shave daily, keep my hair trimmed, wear clean, ironed clothes every day, match my colors, etc. I used to have crappy self-confidence, but now I am so self-assured that I annoy myself. Seriously! 

I guess it seems silly that I'm improving myself externally as a male when in reality, I feel indeed very female. But nonetheless, I feel good. I've informed my friends of it and so far, none of them have had anything but good things to say. The only hurdle I have to overcome now is informing the family. That's going to be hard -- they do not have a history of being accepting. But that'll come later. Other parts of my life are also improving. Even the romantic part of it -- despite letting potential partners know about it! Things are going great.

That's not to say it doesn't get hard sometimes. I still run into many people who don't consider me a woman upon me telling them, I of course have my family who doesn't accept me, and hardest of all is imagining the long-term romantic situation. That's the only thing that really does intimidate me when I think about it. When I participated in relationships and imagined long-term relationships as one identity, then realized it didn't fit, that meant I had to re-imagine *everything*. Partners, parenting, sex, etc. That's **hard**. I'm still re-imagining things every day. That's stressful.

But the fulfillment I've gotten from this journey so far has been worth the stress. I plan to continue it! I don't know if I'm fully ready to identify as a ""woman"" yet. I feel very, very female and I'm most definitely not a man, but this journey has only been 3 months long. This is huge. I need to be 100% sure before I go that far. 

So anyhow, I don't really know how to end this. For the first time I'm actually pretty nervous to post something someplace in this community. I guess that means I must be doing something right?

Last night I was out at a crowded bar with some friends (the awesome queer/feminist/progressive type of friends :) ), and I was decently drunk. Not pass-out-on-the-bathroom-floor drunk, and not I-don't-know-my-own-name drunk, but just regularly drunk for a saturday night.

Anyway, ended up on the dance floor, which was very crowded, just dancing a little bit, and this big fedora dude comes up behind me and grabs my body. He just put his arms around me and literally grabbed my chest, my stomach, and my genitals. I couldn't even move with his hold around me and all the people blocking my way.

But the scary part is that according to my friends, who were doing their best to scowl at him menacingly from a few feet away, he kept doing this for about 10 minutes and I barely remember any of it. I vaguely remember what he looked like and I vaguely remember feeling really violated, but I'm missing most of those minutes from my memory.

I don't think it was the alcohol, because I remember pretty much everything else from the night. And I'm fairly sure I had already blocked it out by the time I snapped out of it, because I didn't talk about it when I got back to my friends.

Right now I feel unbelievably angry that this literally fedora-clad shitlord felt it his right to hold onto my body and not let me go for a prolonged period of time without my permission. Without even fucking _saying_ anything to him.

It scares me because I'm usually quite confident with people, and I can deal with turning down strange men in bars, but for some reason 
I just froze with this.

I just want to know why I froze and why I don't remember it. Why did I shut down and stand still while it was happening? I couldn't even say ""no"" or ""stop"", which I'm sure made it worse because he probably thought I wanted it then.

I need some perspective...help?,54,15,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/yv485/i_just_found_out_minutes_ago_that_my_dad_is/,"Obviously throwaway since this is very VERY personal. If you need proof I'm an srser, I'll PM you my real account. And I'm sorry if this is disjointed but I just found out literally a few minutes ago. My dad is cheating on my mom, and I have proof. I love srswomen, you guys are so supportive and always give such leavelheaded advice without all the shitlordery.

I don't even know where or how to begin. I've always thought I'm in a good family. That I'm very lucky. Both my mom and dad earn a good living, we live a comfortable life, and we rarely ever fight. My parents have been married for 25 years. My mom is a career lady and my dad is a total workaholic. My parents gave me opportunities most other parents couldn't and made me feel taken cared of. I never had a 'rebellion' phase that most teenagers went through. I am a lot closer to my mom than my dad. My dad is out of town a lot, and has been a workaholic ever since I can remember. I have lived with him all this time but have never gotten to know him. My dad doesn't know 2% of what my mom knows about my life, even though we have lived together since I was born. 


Right now my mom is out of town for 3 days to visit my grandmother. It was 2AM, my dad thought no one else was awake. But I was. I was about to go to the kitchen to get some food when I noticed my dad talking softly from the corner of our living room. He was talking to someone in this really soft voice that I've never heard from him before. My dad has a naturally loud voice, and me and my mom have constantly reminded him to speak in a quieter voice when we're eating out, otherwise people from 2 tables across could literally hear him. So even in his soft voice I could hear him clearly from across the room. He was talking to a woman. Who has a boyfriend. She is a maid, and she borrowed money from my dad. They were whispering sweet nothings to each other. He was very sweet with her, which was very shocking. You see, me and my family, we're not sweet to each other at all. We have a very good relationship, but we never tell each other ""i love you"", or ""i miss you"", or even things like ""you're a wonderful dad"". Even my extended family. So it was so surprising to hear my dad saying things like, ""no, no, your boyfriend won't leave you, you're beautiful. Heck, I've seen you up close and personal. Don't you trust me~?"" (It sounds even sweeter in my language. It wasn't in english, I don't live in the US) He was obviously talking down to her, I almost thought he was talking to a little kid if it wasn't for the sexual overtones. 


For a few minutes I just stood there, out of sight, stunned at what I was hearing. I suddenly had the idea to grab my iPod and record the conversation from where I was standing. I was able to record the last three minutes of the conversation with my dad trying to put down the phone while apparently the girl not wanting to yet. I was able to catch him, on record, saying, among other things: ""I love you. I love you forever and ever. Believe that.""

I know this is very naiive of me, but I never thought to believe that my dad's trips out of town had anything to do with his infidelity. If my dad goes out of town it is to give a speech or to chair an event or to lead a conference---all that is well documented and is usually in local news. I wouldn't have thought he would even have the time to have an affair. Everyone has business with him, he barely has time for each of them. 
My family prides istelf on the values of honesty and integrity. That's what I have always admired about my family. Now I'm hearing my dad sweet talk a maid with a boyfriend who borrowed money from him.
So yeah, I know cheating is fairly common, but I never thought it would happen in MY family (yeah...naiive, naiive, naiive). 
 

Then there was also the fact that my dad revealed misogynistic tendencies I've never known before. In the conversation he's said stuff like, ""no, you wash my clothes. Of course you will. It's a woman's job."" and ""don't take it out on your boyfriend. women should always be sweet to men, like how you're with me."" Why did he ever marry my mom if that's what he believed? My mom has been a modern, take-no-guff lady since the beginning! 

I think my brain is still too fried to think. I don't think I can ever tell my mom. Hell, maybe she knows, she's not exactly stupid. What would that do?? Should I tell someone, anyone from my family? Or not? I don't even know what I WANT to happen. I don't even think I can tell my dad. I'm feeling so weak and I'm sorry If I'm sounding very dramatic. It's just that...I come from a stable and very happy family and...we've never had a single major problem in our family...and now this. I don't even know what I want from you guys. vent, give advice, offer perspective, tell me how stupid I was, whatever. Just tell me something. I don't usually post submissions on reddit, even THIS is making me anxious right now! I Just really need to hear from other people right now...no matter how harsh.

However, she finally made a doctor's appointment today because I'd like to get an evaluation for ADHD, and she...snapped. She's been drinking. I know she has. And she doesn't do this often, she's usually really great. Long story short; she invited me along with my sisters to go to dinner and I politely declined. She got a bit hurt by the gesture, and left me alone. When she came back she was completely pissed and we had a one sided argument where she blamed me for everything that's been going on, and she started crying, after that she started blaming herself. She then started getting even more emotional and she turned all my problems around and made everything all about her. When she left I couldn't help it, I started crying.

He's been spoiled his entire life and has been an egoistic nice guyTM his entire life.

Mom is mom. Told my brother that if he can stay here if he won't smoke weed.

Yesterday:

Had a talk with my mom about my brother. I told her that I find him a massive douchebag because he told me directly to my face that women are dumber than men, then we talked for like 3 hours and she told me that my brother keeps smoking weed all day, he doesn't help her with money because all his money he spends on drugs. Basically all he does is sleep and do drugs. He doesn't even shower or brush his teeth.

I told my mom that she's not helping him by letting him stay here and doing drugs, but my mom keeps being like ""I can't let him go he's my son"" and ""if he doesnt stay here he'll live on the streets and he'll die"" 

The thing is, my mom doesn't even have money to keep a freeloader. He doesn't help with housework, he doesn't help with money [he just got his last paycheck, didn't give my mom a penny], he doesn't do anything at all. The worst thing is that he used to smoke in his car, away from my mom, but now he smokes in the balcony of the apartment. Thing is I live in Romania. Anyone can call the cops and if he's found out he'll get at least 4 years of prison here.

I've known since I was 14 that I never want to change my name.  My long term boyfriend is supportive of that, and in fact if/when (it's a touchy subject) we get married, he wants to change his name to mine because he's estranged from his father's family. Pretty cool.

But I am shocked to see that almost every woman I was friends with in college and got married changed her name to match her husband's, even one of my queer friends.  Now of course it's each person's own choice to do what they want with their name, but I can't help but feel a little bit angry that they all changed their names.

Disclaimer so I don't get menned/a little bit about me:
I'm male-bodied, genderqueer, and pansexual. God, that feels so good to say. Back when this happened, like 4 or 5-ish years ago, I still more or less happily identified as male and had just come out as bisexual and was a sophomore in high school. That's ... actually still what I identify as to my friends and family. I should probably change that. Go me. I'm awesome.

ANYWAY, there was this awesome (or so I thought) gay boy, same age as me. I talked to him for like 4 hours before finding out he was my roommate. Things were going okay-ish. I was being friendly mostly because I was grateful to have a friend. I was shy and awkward as fuck back then and debate-folk understand me. By the way, this is at a debate camp. Important detail? Maybe. Moving right along, he asks me to have sex with him. I decline. This is at about midnight. He spends the next three hours trying to convince me to fuck him. We end up making out and he gives me a back massage. I felt a little icky, but it wasn't that bad. I thought that was the end of it. No, no, not even close. He spends the next three days or so trying to convince me to go further. I tell him to fuck off. He is having none of it. Eventually I feel kinda guilty for leading him on and getting his hopes up, since sometimes I would be friendly and flirt kind of. So I masturbated with him if he agreed never to bother me again. That jackass actually kept his word. He didn't talk to me. Sometimes he'd do little stupid things like throw pennies at me in my sleep, but he left me alone.

I didn't report this asshole because I didn't want him to get in trouble. I didn't stand up to him because I was afraid and I just admitted to the world that I like men and felt like I was lying if I didn't prove it. I felt like I led him on and that I fucking owed him. No! FUCK YOU, [name withheld because personal information]. I keep repeating this behavior. I'll go out with people I don't even like because I think it's expected of me if they show signs of interest. I'll sex with them to. I hate this about me. I let this ""a man should always be ready for sex"" bullshit push me around and I'm not even a man.

Right so... I'm not sure what I want with this. Maybe just a listening ear? It's all so weird. I guess I'll explain from the beginning. This is going to be long.

I met the guy in 2006 when I had just started my first study along with his group of friends. They were all nice and we hit it off - it was great. We were a close pack of friends that went everywhere and suffered through exams and enjoyed good parties. Sadly I failed the study as it turned out I wasn't very good in the subjects. After 2 years (2008) I stopped and decided to follow a new one. It was in the second year (2010) of my second study that he did express interest in me via email. I remember very clearly that it was autumn and he suggested that maybe I could give him a sexy massage for his birthday a couple of weeks later. I thought he was cute so I thought sure, I wouldn't mind giving him a chance.

A week later my mother suddenly landed in a coma at 1 AM. I found out because the ambulance stopped at our house. I was completely distraught and it didn't help that the doctors told me that she could die. I forgot everything at that point, school, friends, etc. All that mattered was my family. A couple of weeks later she woke up but it was clear she had a hemorrage (my English is secondary so I hope I translated that well) in her brain and she had lost some body functions. Doctors said she could recover but it could take forever and maybe even never happen at all. All in all, that time of my life was pure hell. I was always crying at night, I was always angry when I wasn't busy, I constantly forgot things, etc. I was depressed but too proud to show it.

My friends were nice, sending me messages if I was okay, if I needed help etc. He did as well. They never visited me but that was because of my pride, I was too worried that I'd use them. As such I ended up not seeing any of them for a long long time. My second study just completely went to shit during this time. My school didn't seem it necessary to give me extra time to prepare for my exams and of course I couldn't focus on it.

Fast forward another 3 years (2013). I had decided to work for a full year (odd jobs and such) just so I could refocus my life and earn the money I needed to pay for my third study (because I really did want to finish it, especially because the best jobs required a diploma). In the next year I did a one-year sped-up course which was hard but I finished with excellent grades and I was very pleased. I had picked up my life again, reconnected with my friends, got a good job, I'm able to pay off my loan monthly and my mom is still recovering but she had made amazing progress and I'm doing so much better.

During the 3 years I got a boyfriend. He was a volunteer at the hospital. My SO helped me constantly through my rough moments even though he could've just as easily left and I don't think I could love him more. When I felt utterly broken he told me that I still had everything. I don't think I've cried more than with him but I always felt so comfortable and warm.

It was at a party where all my friends and their SOs were invited that said guy told me that he remembered a promise I made for him a long time ago. I thought it was a joke so I laughed it off, but he was totally serious. When I told him that I now had a relationship, he got all annoyed because I was breaking my promise. I told him that I had forgotten about it because my mom was dying and afterwards we hadn't seen each other in 3 years, so any sparks we had were dead for me. And I honestly thought that because he never brought up the topic of 'us' again during our emails and telephone calls, he felt the same. Turns out I was wrong.

He just completely dropped me. He proceeded to ignore me in every way possible. My friends contacted me because they were wondering why the hell said guy was suddenly calling me a 'horrible slur who lied to him'. My SO think this guy is a shit, most of my friends agree that he's being unfair but find it hard to break off their friendship with him (logically, they've known him longer than me). I've told them that it's up to them whether they want to stay mine or his friends or not, but they don't need to get involved in this mess if they don't want to. And that's where we are right now. Is this a Nice Guy? It sure sounds like it. But I always thought they gave up after a few months.

I'm not really worried about losing my friends. Most of them are intelligent and sensible and from what I heard they're on my side. I think I'm just going to throw my hands up in the air and flail about in the sun because this all sure don't make sense and I'm not planning to let this mess up my life. I've had enough of that. I just think it's so so weird.

Apologies if anywhere in this rant stuff doesn't make sense.

Posters, please do your part and read **carefully** through any posts containing anything listed below and put a TW in the title - explain the nature and extent of the trigger not just a TW.

* suicide/suicidal ideation
* self-harm
* abuse (any kind, sexual, verbal, emotional, etc)
* war
* oppression
* addiction
* death
* explicitly sexual content

This title is OK:

[TW: sexual abuse] Someone gets jailed.

This title is not OK:

[TW] Someone gets jailed

except for if the title is obvious and contains the above listed things. (You can still be specific if you wish.)

Thanks folks.

You can find the article [here](http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2944842/geef-pedo-virtuele-kinderporno.html), but sadly it's in Dutch. The gist of it is that the researchers are convinced that giving pedofiles virtual kid porn will not increase abuse but decrease it. It will also help decrease child porn where real kids are involved.

In the latest paragraph there's a part that says that should the government agree to this, it will be strictly monitored and even branded like you would with food products. Also the people who wish to get this will have to go to a 'sexologist' and while he will be treated as a patient, he will also be monitored. Currently any form of child porn is forbidden here.

As often with these articles, the comments are full with people angrily debating left and right whether they agree or not. One side says that it's a mental disease and that these people can't help themselves and thus need this to prevent kids getting hurt. The other side says that they're fully aware of what they're doing and should not be fed or treated as a patient. The word ""chemical castration"" is dropped quite a lot.

I'm torn, so I want to ask the intelligent and rational SRSWomen how you all feel about this. Yes/No/Maybe? I'm all for methods that reduce pedofiles getting their hands on kids, but I'm not sure if this is a method that works. Still, the strict monitoring stuff sounds good.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies all! I won't have much time to comment on all right now but I will after work!

[This photo](http://i.imgur.com/xgFcN.jpg) showed up (remember it being a joke on the front page yesterday?) and I mentioned that it's a shitty joke and that it's mildly sexist. Boyfriend responds with a groan and ""Dude, it's a fucking joke.""

So then my hackles are raised. I start talking about heteronormativity and how it affects our views and perceptions of each other and how this particular joke would be just as effective with the use of ""Big spoon/Little Spoon"" instead of ""Guy/Girl"" and he goes on about how I'm digging too far in to everything all the time and that I'm acting like it was made maliciously etc etc. So we fight all morning and now I'm seething and hurt and angry. I feel like we can never have a conversation about actual feminist issues even though he claims to agree with the cause. It's like he's ok with me having the label ""Feminist"" but not the actual activities. 

Could I have kept my thoughts to myself and waited until we weren't fresh from dreamland? Yes. Should I censor myself around the person I am most intimate with? I hope not. 

How do you approach these things so that it doesn't get combative? He asked at one point ""Why do you have to get on your soapbox so early in the morning?"" and I just responded ""Because I never stop caring about this."" 

He's not a shitlord. We have non-traditional gender roles at our house and I have never once heard him make or laugh at a woman/rape/gay joke. It's just a case of someone not thinking that all the little things add up to big things. That photo and joke are symptoms of a larger problem. Not to mention it makes it seem like men hate cuddling and women just demand it over their partners comfort. As the predominating big spoon in my partnership I can tell you that it ain't hard to do it right and it's wicked comfy for both people. And what the fuck awkward boner? Right, because men literally can never be near a female body without getting aroused. 

This text got away from me. I understand that it was early and he's a laid back guy who just wants a joke to be a joke. But I also don't want to have to hold back from commenting on shit that isn't ok because he's got a chill vibe going on. It's ok if he disagrees and calls me out when I am going too far (it happens) but the way we go about arguing it is mean and hostile. 

**TL:DR** Boyfriend tends to think I get soapboxy too often and shuts down arguments, I need help being less combative and finding ways to be more constructive.

It goes like this, more or less: the issue of stigmatizing &amp; silencing language will come up in conversation, usually in a relatively casual way, and usually with someone who seems to be fairly down with the idea of social justice/feminism/etc. I'll say something like ""when Mutual Male Friend makes these jokes, I feel disrespected/uncomfortable,"" or ""sometimes I think Completely Different Male Person really crosses the line with the way they talk about Third Friend Who Is A Lesbian."" It can even be more generic &amp; less personally charged than that, such as ""American conservatives are tacitly endorsing racist language by not calling it out and this is ruining political discourse."" 

At which point this someone aaaaaaalways feels the need to say ""Well, Kasdayeh, you're not perfect either. You made a gay joke that one time in high school, or you called something 'lame' the other day, and your knitting group calls itself 'stitching bitches' and that's very sexist, and you're uncomfortable around the homeless man who hangs out at your bus stop, etc, etc. You're discriminating against people all the time, so how can you judge someone else?"" 

Sometimes it doesn't even get that far; sometimes it just devolves into a long list of 'times when Kasdayeh has behaved shittily' and doesn't even get into the 'and that's why Kasdayeh can't ever judge shitlords' part.

I *know* I have privilege. I *know* that I will fuck up, and I will say shitty things, and I am incredibly grateful for the fact that a) I have a number of tools at my disposal to keep educating myself, and b) I am also lucky enough to have kind, smart progressive friends who will point out my fuckups in a way that encourages me not to do that shit again. Those dear people are not the same as the person who likes to list my sins. 

I don't want a gold medal for trying, I don't want a 'decent human being' cookie, I don't want a big ol' flag to fly that says ""100% LEGIT ALLY."" That would completely miss the point of what social justice *is* (and also be really obnoxious. *It's not about **me**.)* I have long since grown out of being a shitty teenager, and I want to continue to learn and grow (and that *is* going to involve fucking up, although hopefully much less of it.) 

So, do I have a right to feel as though I'm being derailed when someone brings these things up? As though this person I'm talking to cares *juuuuuust* enough about social justice and inclusivity to use my mistakes to invalidate my point, and not enough to actually engage with me on these issues? Or am I just being a special snowflake shitlord who's mad that her shit also stinks?

I hope it's ok to post here. 

But first, story time!

Several years ago, way back during my freshman year of college, I was the victim of a crime: some assholes decided to jack my car from my dorm parking lot. I was dragged out of my bed at 3am to go deal with it, and I ended up being recorded for a television show.

In my pajamas. 
At three in the morning.
While I was trying to not have a breakdown because 3 dudes just STOLE MY FUCKING CAR which I would be driving home in two weeks later. It was not a good moment, I wasn't fully thinking, and I ended up signing the release that allowed the crew to use my footage in the tv show. And as it turns out, that episode is one of the most popular ones they've ever aired. 

And my cousin, my aunt's husband, and a family friend (all men) all find it HI-FUCKING-LARIOUS. 

Every time I see them, they bring it up. They quote parts of it at me. My cousin even went as far as spreading the rumor that he was going to have shirts emblazoned with I said during the episode so that he and his son could wear them to my college graduation party. 

I have asked them all to stop, but that just seems to push them to escalate their teasing. I end up crying and blowing up at them, and they always, *always* respond with ""Geez, don't be so sensitive, I was only joking.""

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!

Tonight, my aunt's husband felt the need to tell me via my facebook timeline that ""Your tv debut is on!"" and of course, my cousin and the family friend felt the need to add their comments as well. I just deleted the whole thread because I didn't feel like dealing with their shit. 

This behavior isn't limited to this particular instance, and has been going on for most of my life (puberty was especially hellish). And it only comes from the men in my life (uncles, cousins, step-dad, father). These are also the same people that feel the need to comment on how ""happy"" I look. 

So, any stories? Helpful advice? Or is the ""ZIPHI-HULK **SMASH**"" response still my best bet for dealing with these behaviors?
