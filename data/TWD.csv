It baffles my mind how unlikable her character is. Honestly, I hated Lori, but Andrea really is taking it to a whole new level, and this episode cemented my opinion. I mean COME ON. She shows up acting like everything is fine, despite being told multiple times that there's just been an attack on the prison survivors, and when Rick initally asks her if she's alone, she doesn't even reply, and acts like she has some kind of sense of entitlement to the group. Just when you think you couldn't possibly like her any less, she actually lacks the common sense to just notice that Shane and Lori aren't with them anymore, so WHAT ELSE COULD HAVE HAPPENED!? REALLY?
You have to ask Rick of all people what happened to them?

What really made me pissed is that she simply doesn't listen to rational information. When Carol is telling her about what happened to Shane, the first thing Carol mentions is ""Rick killed Shane,"" which Andrea clearly has a sound reaction to, seeing as she was banging Shane in season 2. What really boggled my mind here was what Carol then said immediately after, that Shane was going to kill Rick, had lied about Randall, and that he had loved Lori the whole time. Andrea, instead of factoring in that 1) Shane was going to murder their leader, and arguably best asset to the group, and 2) SHANE WAS TRYING TO BANG LORI THE WHOLE TIME, YOU WERE THE THING ON THE SIDE. (sorry for the caps, normally I wouldn't ever type in them, but Andrea is one of those characters..) The worst part is, despite all this eye-opening information, the only real thing she heard and has a response to is ""Rick killed Shane.""

Throw in her incapability to think for people other than herself, and she is just the most unlikable character in the show. I really hope she dies soon.",,False,,t5_2szqa,1361813262.0,,,True,t3_1976s7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/1976s7/really_andrea_really/,

1354557758.0,126,self.TWD,147l5b,[Spoilers] One of the greatest themes about this show over the course of these three seasons...,147,21,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/147l5b/spoilers_one_of_the_greatest_themes_about_this/,"The thing I like most about this show is the theme of characters is that every time the characters try to find some semblance of security in that world, they begin to get lulled into complacency and start losing sight of how truly bad the existence they're running from is.  And the show too tends to give the viewer that sense of complacency.

One of the greatest scenes so far, I think, was the opening sequence of Season 3.  I don't even recall there being any dialogue in that scene, and yet it was clear just how bad things are out there outside the fences of a farm.  A kid once told repeatedly to ""stay in the house"", is now a long-haired kid expected 8 months later to help clear them with military precision.

Arguments over who's job it is to cook a nightly dinner with all the fixins' have taken a back seat to whether or not we've come to the point where one questions whether a can of cat food is acceptable food or not yet.

Then they find the prison, and while they have dangers and problems, they've found some sense of security for the time being, and I as a viewer, again begin forgetting how gnarly things are in the open again.

Then we see Tyreese and his group, and through nothing but dialogue, you are reminded of how infinitely more desperate things constantly are when there's no fences or walls.  How the threat of mortality outside isn't a matter of months or weeks; it's a matter of days or hours.

**TL;DR:**  I like how the show periodically reminds the viewer how much worse things are outside the safe haven.  For how bad things are inside a secure fence are, the problems and day-to-day priorities those inside a fence have to deal with are quite different that the problems and day-to-day priorities of those on the run.  Something I often forget while watching the show.",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,,True,t3_147l5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/147l5b/spoilers_one_of_the_greatest_themes_about_this/,

I know I know...the characters and story both need to evolve in a post-zombie apocalypse world. And I know a lot of people think it's awesome that everyones being so badass now, so for walkers to go back to being the main threat would seem like a step backwards. But here's what I feel:

Begin rant/

I MISS THE SHEER TERROR AND HORROR THAT CAME FROM THE WALKERS. For example, one of my absolutely favorite scenes of the season was S2E01, when the group stopped at that ""car graveyard"" and were overcome by that random hoard of walkers and they all had to hide under the cars. IMO that was THE MOST intense scene of television I have ever had to sit through. My heart was literally pounding. And at least based on season 3, I don't think any living, human villain can incite that amount of fear and intensity in the audience. I don't read the comics, so I didn't have any expectations for the governor, but honestly, I really don't see the craziness/madness in him that everyone else seems to see. Sure, he snapped in the finale, but the rest of the season, he just seemed a tiny bit more out-of-it than Rick or Shane would've been in his position.

It's for this reason that I've started losing hope in this show. Almost every episode of season 3 seemed to drag on to me. I know people say this show is supposed to be character-driven and not focused on walker-killing all the time (and I agree), but last season, there was barely any urgency to the storyline for the main group. There was no feeling of having to survive and move forward. Season 3 felt very stagnant to me.

What do you guys think?

The writing in the show has done a fairly good job at making a fair amount of the audience hate/dislike the main female characters - Lori, Andrea and even Michonne - and adore the male leads. So, instead of having a man save the day, shouldn't Maggie be capable of taking down The Governor?

Say they focus on one walker.  We could follow him or her, seeing  how the walker reacts to stimuli, reacts to other walkers, and finds or fights for food.  It could help answer some running questions about the nature of the walkers and probably create a few more.

It could be a specific walker we've seen before, or even a recent character that has turned.  I know they did this with the bicycle walker in S1 via an online webisode, but I'd like to see something like this in an actual television spot.

1361010113.0,73,self.TWD,18msf7,[SPOILERS S3E9] Getting tired of all the new problems,99,26,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/18msf7/spoilers_s3e9_getting_tired_of_all_the_new/,"After watching the Suicide King, I have to say I'm a little disappointed in how the show just won't give us a break when it comes to the weakness of the group. The premise of the entire series provides a great dynamic setting for the show writers to explore how people act and interact in crisis situations. I have to say, it's absolutely fascinating to observe human nature in its most extreme forms, and that's why stories like this hold their appeal. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's about the people, more than the environment, and that's good. 

That being said, it might be nice if we got a break or two. It seems like in every episode, whenever a problem within the group is solved, another rapidly appears in its place. There's always somebody dying, leaving, getting injured, being sick (mental and/or physical), not cooperating, or causing more problems with an accident or strongly held moral conviction. The third season's beginning was certainly emotionally exhausting, even compared to seasons 1 and 2. I totally loved the first episode where the whole group works together to take out all the walkers in the prison; it was finally a situation where there wasn't someone dragging everyone else down and everybody could really get something done effectively and safely. This didn't last long of course, what with the walkers *inside* the prison, the rick/lorrie/carl debacle, etc etc, but it was finally a time when I could root for the group, not feel sorry for them.

The show seems to have comprehensively shot down any hope of a final resolution to the zombie situation; a cure is out of the question, all the 'safe cities' are pipe dreams, and the first real attempt to re-make a solid human society is taking a turn for the worst too. On top of that, now Daryll has left, Rick's losing his shit, Glenn is pissed at Rick, and the Governor is about to wage war. What might be considered a small victory (getting Glenn and Maggie out of the town) has been completely quashed by all the new problems. Also, it's clear that the white guy in Tyreese's group and his son are going to be a future issue. Maybe it's just annoying how many times everyone is so close to making things working out better, but one more thing jumps in the way (for example, Rick going crazy and driving at least two potentially very helpful people away from the group). It's depressing that we can't get any unification of the people against their common enemy (the zombies) and some real progress towards getting out of the situation.

I realize this is only the third season and there has to be a constant influx of new conflict to keep the story interesting, but what started out as a pretty depressing story is really beginning to outdo itself. Maybe one or two successful efforts that aren't immediately stifled by some new obstacle would help restore some faith in the show; just a little actual conflict resolution. This is my personal opinion, but I'd like to hear others.

**EDIT:** Ok, fine. It seems like a lot of people who read this think I'm expecting some fairy-tale ending that is neither exciting or interesting. Instead of griping about the finer points of my argument, I'll extrapolate on one of the contributing factors to why I'm not too happy with where the show is going. The Walking Dead is admittedly a cliched premise, but succeeded by telling a zombie survival story that was unlike any before it; it was new and fascinating. Now it seems like the show is running our of steam and coming up with more and more predictable, less original material. For the past few episodes it's been fairly easy to make some pretty good guesses about where new conflicts would spring up and what would happen to old ones. I don't think anyone thought the Governor would turn out to be a good guy or that Merle would reintegrate peacefully with the group or Michonne would actually kill the Governor or no one would die during the rescue mission. It seems quite obvious now that the Governor will attack the prison, Andrea will eventually have to dramatically choose between the Governor or her old group, Tyreese's white friends will be a problem, Tyreese and his wife will help if not join the group, Rick will eventually get over being insane, and it's not too big a stretch of the imagination that Daryll will rejoin everyone after an episode or two of angsting about his brother.

For some reason, hearing Beth sing brought this to mind.  I thought of history being passed, long ago, from generation to generation by old narrative songs.

It's not a major concern to any plot points in the show, but it seems to me that someone would recognize that, for future generations, documented history would be important and necessary.  Maybe most of the group members don't think this is important b/c they see no future.  They're all a step or two away from Morgan, thinking that it's already over and the inevitable end of all of man is a forgone conclusion.  

What I didn't expect was how much of a focus history would be in this episode.  Even in his madness, and whether he knew it or not while he was doing it, Morgan has created what amounts to cave paintings and hieroglyphics, making a historical record for those who will come upon his ""home"" decades and decades later, assuming the booby traps don't get them.

I think this is where Carl proves that he can be a member of the future society that evolves the human race from a mass of nomadic waring tribes back into a society that more resembles the world prior to the outbreak.

On Talking Dead, they mentioned how much Carl is still like a child b/c he endangered himself just to get a picture of his mom, but that wasn't an immature act.  That was a thoughtful and intelligent decision that even I hadn't considered.  The baby will need know what her mother looked like.  If they survive, there will be no connection, tangible anyway, to the people that came before b/c what will be left of the before will be gone.  If you lose your sense of your own history, you lose the part of yourself that makes you human.  Something as simple as a picture works to prevent that.

Carl took a step towards preserving history for future generations, and in doing so, he kept alive a small fire that all civilizations need to move forward and flourish.  This shows that Carl is truly his father's son in that I have always seen Rick's purpose as being the constant reminder that society could not afford to lose its humanity, even in the face of so much misery.  Rick has tried to show that keeping that little bit of our civilized selves was most important - maybe more important than simply surviving.  Carl's actions speak to that same premise and risking his life for the sake of preserving his history speaks volumes about him as a character.",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,,True,t3_19n15s,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/19n15s/spoilers_the_absence_of_a_historian/,

Rick is a brave and stoic leader. He doesn't (outwardly appear to) let his emotions dictate his decision making. I feel like his breakdown was the first time we saw Rick experience that raw emotion since [Shane's death](/spoiler). 

I think he is going to blame himself for every single thing that happened this episode. 

1) He convinced Lori to keep the baby, even after she had abortion pills (morning after pills) at her disposal. 

2) He never stayed to make sure [Andrew](/spoiler) was dead. 

3) He wasn't in the gates when the problem started. 

There are ifs and should haves running through his mind. I should have resolved my shit with Lori. I should have protected her. I should have killed [Andrew](/spoiler) myself. I shouldn't have let my guard down. Because I let my guard down, the last of my son's ""goodness"" died. My son is permanently traumatized from [killing his mother](/spoiler) because I fucked up. 

I think he is going to be so furious with himself that he projects onto everyone around him. Obviously, as we saw in the previews, he is touchy and raging. I think he will resent [the baby for ""killing"" Lori.](/spoiler) He will resent the group for driving him to resent his wife and duty.

Last night made me realize that I am hating Andrea more than I have ever hated Lori, which for all of us, is saying *something.*

Remember in the early part of the show, that even though Lori was having an affair with Shane, there was a point where she saw the person he was becoming, and did well to reject him a bunch of times, as well as call him out in front of the group for acting like an asshole?
Lori may have been a bitch, but at least she did shit like that and was somewhat strong in her own right. If I hated her, it was because I hated her for betraying Rick and letting things with him and Shane go so crazy. That being said, the way that situation came about is totally believable and I can relate to her point of view. 

Let's cut to Andrea the last episode. Message to Andrea from me: Andrea. What the fuck. You have just been told from multiple sources that the dude you're in love with practically molested a woman you know, has all these crazy problems going on with him, he STILL isn't letting you in on anything, yet you STILL end up driving away with him.

This season has been stellar so far, and as we continue on into the last episodes of season 3, our subreddit continues to grow. With the new influx of subscribers and moderators, a few more conflicts have come about. The mods have discussed some concerns that were brought to our attention, and we have decided that the best course of action would be to ask you all for your opinions (after all, this is YOUR subreddit, we just look after it). 

If you have an opinion on either of these proposals, PLEASE post it in the comments. If we don't get any feedback, we'll just adjust the rules as we see fit. In addition, **I as well as the other moderators will weigh in our opinions on both proposed rule changes**. This way, you can see the ideas bouncing around in the mod room.

**RE: IMAGE POSTS**

It seems like images are love it or hate it. Many users complained that some images being posted here are inside jokes, circlejerk posts, and macro images (shitty memes). Specifically, ""they don't mind if the image promotes discussion, but if it is just there for teh lulz, it is pointless and is a block to in-depth discussion."" We've asked about this before, and didn't get much feedback. 

**RE: COMIC SPOILERS**

This is actually a mod debate, but we figure your opinion has more weight than our own. What do you think constitutes a comic spoiler? While I tend to be fairly lax about this definition, other mods want to remove all mention of the comic. I understand that we should have a more specific rule, so I leave this to you. As I mentioned above, the mods will each post their opinion of what they want to enforce.

IF it was man-made it would stand to reason there would be some people beyond the reach of society that would NOT be infected unless it was airborne and could literally infect the entire earth (HIGHLY improbable if they want to adhere to any semblance of reality which to date they have). 


If it was supernatural the series would certainly veer off in to a different direction than it has been heading as there has been very little mention of anything religious aside from a few people relying on their faith. 


At some point this will need to be addressed otherwise the plot will get repetitive and it will just be killing off old characters and introducing new ones.

Is There a Morgan/Gov Connection?] (/spoiler),78,23,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/1as2lc/spoilers_wild_theory_alert_is_there_a_morgangov/,"Okay, here it goes - spoilers abound down below, so if you're three or four episodes behind, do not proceed.



Is there some sort of connection, a hidden past, between Morgan and The Gov.?

In ""Clear"", Rick, Carl, and Michonne happen upon Morgan.  Some crazy ensues, but all is ""well"" for just about everybody but the backpacker come show's end.
  
Clue #1
(During the episode, we learn some things about Morgan, but not enough to really nail the specifics down.  We know he's pretty fucking resourceful and has built some ingenious ways of keeping bandits and zombies at bay.  The most simple but effective is the trap that lures zombies in to wooden pikes via caged rats and small animals.  The zombies end up getting themselves hung up and impaled so severely that Morgan just has to kill them, unpin them, and throw them on the pyre.

Clue #2
Morgan eventually takes note of Rick wanting all these weapons, rightfully concluding that Rick's about to go to war.  He tells Rick he's not going with them to the prison and says the bit about the weak inheriting the earth.  With all the names on the walls, it's obvious Morgan wasn't always alone and he had more people around than just his son.  Some names are listed with how the people died.  Others are hard to read or understand.  Regardless, what happened to all those people?  All zombie kills?  Maybe, but Morgan's seems to know how to deal with walkers without much confrontation.  I could see a few people getting killed, but Morgan's traps could keep an entire town safe from zombies - maybe not a large group of humans, though.  Also, Morgan's reaction isn't one where it just dawned on him that there's going to be a fight.  It's as if he's seen that kind of thing go down before.  Maybe experienced it himself?  I mean, it's kind of ironic that he calls out Rick for stockpiling weapons for a fight while he has an entire police weapons cache up in his apartment.  Why all the guns, Morgan?  

Clue #3
In the next episode, Rick and The Gov finally meet to discuss terms of an agreement.  During the dialogue, The Gov reveals that he knows Rick took all those weapons and is gearing up for a fight.  Now, this implies The Gov had Rick n' Co. trailed.  At the very least, this tells me The Gov knows about Morgan.  Does that mean Morgan was killed and the rest of his weapons taken?  Well, if The Gov. never knew of Morgan until that moment Rick got the guns, I'd say yes, but what if The Gov knows Morgan?  What if they have a history or an agreement of sorts?  Did Woodbury wipe out Morgan's crew?  Was Morgan himself or his people once part of Woodbury?

Clue #4

Somebody else has a zombie trap, but this one keeps the zombies relatively unscathed.  It uses a pretty ingenious lure - a wind powered noisemaker that draws the zombies near a pit where they eventually fall in can't get back out.

Could Morgan have designed that trap?  Was Morgan at one time one of Woodbury's people?  Did he have a conflict with The Gov.?  Maybe he and some others were able to escape before shit got crazy.  Later on, there may have been a war of sorts, or maybe The Gov agreed to leave crazy Morgan alone.  Maybe it was too risky trying to get at trapmaster Morgan for some guns, so he just left the crazy fucker alone.

Kinda Sort Clue #5?

What was the deal with the police bag in Phil's room?  They showed shots of it in the season's earlier episodes.  Did we ever figure out whose it was?  Some said it was or wasn't from Rick or his police station, I think, but I can't remember if there was a definitive answer.

So, if we're not sure, what if that was something Morgan took into Woodbury or that was confiscated when he happened upon Woodbury? 


I know it's a long shot, and I'm just flinging things to see what sticks, but even if I'm wrong about the particulars, I still think there is a connection between Phil and Morgan that might play a role in the last two episodes.

**Edit:  Okay, so I wanted to update with some more ideas.  njmj brought up the other interesting point that Morgan may have set the zombie pit on fire.  This could be and we discuss why and how, below.**

**I went back and watched ""Clear"" again for some confirmation of my assumptions.  First of all, the world ""firefight"" is scrawled in blue near some names and, as someone pointed out, Morgan tells Rick that they will be ripped apart by teeth and bullets and that he doesn't want to see that again.  This all but confirms there was a battle of some sort that Morgan either took part in or witnessed.**

**Another interesting point is what Morgan says when he first sees Rick after waking up.  Rick asks Morgan if he knows who Rick is and Morgan says something about Rick being a man who wears dead men's faces.  Now, Morgan still doesn't know it's Rick, but he seems to recognize him from somewhere.  There's all that struggle back and forth before the stabbing, and Morgan is saying things about Rick not clearing and that he turned.  He says Rick died.** 

**Okay, here comes a crazy theory even crazier than my original: what if Morgan took part in the attack on the prison?  I never thought about it until I was replying to nmmj's comment.  We never did find out who drove the bread truck/zombie bomb.  In the making of S3E10 on youtube, David Morissey says that The Gov had one of his ""men"" drive the truck in.  Now, if you look at the driver, it appears to be a woman from the body type.  You can't tell b'c of the body armor and mask.**

**When we first see Morgan again, he's wearing some tactical gear, a helmet, shin guards and a mask.  I know it's not the same outfit as the zombie bomb driver, but I did notice that if not for Morgan's voice, you might not be able to discern it was a man under those clothes.  When he comes down to get Rick and is shot by Carl, he does have a kind of feminine body shape.**  

**The zombie bomb truck was filled with zombies caught in (if my theory is correct) Morgan's pit trap.  Was Morgan once tasked with gathering zombies, making the zombie bomb and using it in other battles on behalf of Woodbury?  Remember, Morgan tells Rick that he will be torn apart by ""teeth and bullets"" which damn near happened and may happen still.  Morgan doesn't want to see that again.  Is this b/c he's been on the receiving or even the giving end of such an attack?**

**Morgan's comments about Rick wearing a dead man's face, having turned, and dying seem to go along with what almost happened at the prison attack.  Rick was fucking dead to rights, covered in walkers and unable to fend them off.  The Gov and his crew pull out just before the Dixon's show up to save the day, so if Morgan were there, he may have thought Rick had been killed.**

**None of this is probably true, but I'm home with my sick kid on a Friday, so what's a guy to do?**

Back in season 2, after some prompting from Daryl,  Randall confesses that he's part of a group that has twenty or so heavily armed men. At first, I thought this was a cute reference to Woodbury. Once we were introduced to the town of Woodbury I realized that they didn't match the description of Randalls group at all. They were an encampment of men women and children (with a few badasses thrown in fir good measure.)

1364494158.0,54,self.TWD,1b6ve5,3x15 - What was Hershel about to say to Rick after reading the Bible (Psalm 91) with Maggie and Beth?,68,14,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/1b6ve5/3x15_what_was_hershel_about_to_say_to_rick_after/,"I think Hershel was going to flip on Michonne, and tell Rick to turn her over to the Governor, and here's why.  

[This 2-min. clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjZyS4vXsGY) leads up to the line I'm talking about, but doesn't include it.

The scene: Hershel reading Psalm 91 to Maggie and Beth. This is interspersed with Rick finding an Ethernet cable to restrain Michonne with, seeing Lori's ghost, and changing his mind about turning over Michonne.  

Hershel concludes: ""What I wouldn't do to keep you two safe.""  

Rick enters. Hershel gets up and goes to him.

Hershel says: ""Rick,"" he says. ""What you're about to do—""

Rick cuts Hershel off, and tells him he's not going to turn over Michonne.

Notice we don't get to hear what Hershel was about to say. It's easy to assume he was going to try to talk Rick out of it again, especially since *Rick* seemed to think that was going to be the case.

However, think of the previous scene. I am not good with bible so I don't have an interpretation of that directly. I just know he was in serious religious contemplation about something. Finishing, he seems to have come to a decision, and tells his children *he'd do anything to keep them safe.*

Why would he feel the need to say that? I think he's saying it to comfort himself and reassure himself that his decision is correct. 

Now, the obvious moral decision would be not to turn over Michonne, and I think that's been Hershel's position up to now — correct me if I'm wrong. At minimum, he's been on the fence.

But now he's made a decision. He goes up to Rick to tell him. And I'm certain the end of that sentence was going to be:

""—do it.""

Hershel made a decision between Michonne and what he considers the safety of his children. He took what he likely also thinks of as the cowardly and immoral way out of his dilemma, given his normal position as wise old man of the group.

Hershel, in a way, made a deal with the devil (the Governor). It's only thanks to Rick that his assention to turning over Michonne isn't spoken nor becomes reality. This was subtle, and may even speak to future developments in Hershel's character.

Case in point:

1. When Michonne mentioned to Rick that there was an entire town secured from walkers, his eyes totally lit up like, ""That's what I've been hoping for!""

2. On the other side, we've got the Governor. Who, when he hears that the group has cleared/taken the prison, he turns to Merle all pissed and says something to the effect of ""You told me months ago it was impossible."" Which seemed to imply to me that, if he had it his way, he would move the whole community there.

Now, it would seem that both groups are simultaneously going to attack/try to take the other's 'camp.' Or at least the Gov. wants to take the prison, Rick et al does seem to just want to rescue Glenn and Maggie. 

So anyway, if they both are so envious of the other's situation, why not just trade, amirite?",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,,True,t3_1403bb,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/1403bb/possible_spoilers_the_grass_is_greener/,

There was a request a few days ago to consider previews as spoilers since some people watch on Amazon or after the fact and don't see the previews to enhance the surprise. I discussed this idea with the other mods and the response was generally good. **Because there is only 7 days between a preview and the next episode, we should spoiler tag anything shown in the preview UNLESS it is tagged in a speculation post.**

Secondly, we gained over 2000 subscribers in the span of 2 weeks. A lot of these new subs haven't read the subreddit policy and that's okay. The rules are to the right (or click [here](http://redd.it/qc8gs)) and I encourage everyone to read them. The super main ultimate point though, is **ABSOLUTELY NO COMIC DISCUSSION SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN THIS SUBREDDIT.** This subreddit was created for fans of the show to discuss the separate beast that AMC has created without influence from the comic, particularly since the comic is so far ahead of the show, and since many show fans do not read the comics. I have removed countless numbers of comments lately that reveal comic information, so I figured an announcement needed to be made. 

If, in the future, changes need to be made, we can implement those changes then. For now, happy posting!

* Axel lived during the shootout?

I think that Carol would've actually found herself in a love triangle, considering that she seemed to like Axel as well as Daryl, who arrived shortly after the shooting. Something would wind up happening between Axel and Daryl. Also, Axel would bring some more humor into the show. The only thing that worries me is what he might've done to Beth had Carol not been there.

* Rick was too late and Hershel died because of his bite?

The group would definitely lose themselves without Hershel, as he seems to be the last piece of thread that ties the group's sanity together. Also, Maggie and *especially* Beth would go into depression, possibly resulting in Beth's suicide. This would bring Maggie into a depression that even Glenn couldn't bring her out of.

* Andrea was bitten instead of Amy?

I don't care how much you might hate Andrea, I think in the end, she was a great character, and *Amy* was the ""bitchy"" one. I can't really see Amy's character development getting too far. Also, if she were to make it all the way to meeting Michonne (which she wouldn't), then the whole Woodbury issue would've been a lot different.

* Daryl and Merle switched places, so Daryl was handcuffed to the roof and Merle was still with the group?

This is an interesting one. I think that Merle would've caused great conflict within the group, and he probably would've even killed T-Dog. As for Daryl, if he were to make it to Woodbury, that would've been interesting to see. Also, the group might not have survived considering the fact that Daryl seemed to be their main source of food through hunting. It's possible that Shane or even Rick would've killed Merle at some point. And imagine Merle's reaction to losing Sophia. Yup. Nothing.

* Ed was alive, but Carol was dead?

This might have affected Sophia greatly. It's really hard to see what would happen. There would be no possible Daryl/Carol situation, and Ed, much like Merle, would've caused many problems in the group, and would probably end up killed by Shane.

* Andrea still stayed in the CDC with Jacqui and Jenner *knowing* that Dale would die with her?

The group didn't have Hershel as a replacement moral compass yet, so they wouldn't have made it far without going insane. Also, Dale was the only reason the RV was still going, so they wouldn't have made it far before dying. Also if, let's say, Shane or someone else in the group knew how to keep the RV going, Dale was the one who noticed the herd first, and Rick was the second, but mostly because he noticed Dale thought something was wrong. Also, if the group were to still make it all the way to the prison, Carl's speech to his father at the end of the season might have gone somewhat differently, as he wouldn't be responsible for Dale's death because of the swamp walker.

* Morgan's wife, Jenny, was alive from the beginning, but Duane was dead?

This is a very tough one to imagine. This would've greatly affected how Morgan would take care of Rick, and imagine how Jenny would react to having a stranger in the house during an apocalypse. Also, Morgan's second meeting with Rick might have gone differently, regardless of whether or not Jenny were to die between their two encounters.

* Milton worked at the CDC and Jenner was the scientist at Woodbury?

I think this one would make a greater difference than all of the ones above. Think about it: Milton was definitely afraid of death, especially 8 months before we ever saw him onscreen. This would mean that he and Jacqui would have survived, and imagine what a massive impact that would be on the group. They probably would've stayed with Milton at the CDC, using it as a fortress against zombies. Now, let's say Milton were to still lose TS-19, but instead of blowing up the CDC, he left it along with the rest of the group and made it to Hershel's farm. I'd like to see a much earlier Hershel making friends with a much earlier Milton. As for Jacqui, I'm not sure how she'd affect the group the whole way in. Anyway, if they were to make it to the prison, think of what it would be like with Milton on the prison's side, and Jenner on Woodbury's side. He seemed to handle a gun pretty well, making yet another soldier *and* a scientist for Woodbury. He'd be pretty close to the Governor being that useful. But his reaction to the Governor snapping would be interesting to watch too.

But, it's unclear about Tyreese and Sasha. In Ep 9 they are thrown out of the prison by Rick (sort of) and from their time there I imagine their impression of the group is that it consists of nice people but has a leader who is literally crazy. And especially from Ep 14 ([Governor's chase after Andrea] (/spoiler)) I think their impression of Woodbury is about the same.

So, it's pretty obvious that they both want to leave Woodbury and the Governor, but why would they go to Rick's group after that? (Which seems to be what the show is building up to and what most fans want/expect.)

Being caught in this war between, as far as they know, two madmen and their respective groups, wouldn't it be better for them to just try to leave Woodbury and then go on on their own, and not try to join Rick's group? (It's obviously possible that this is what happens, but that they then bump in to Rick's group and decide to join them then.)

Obviously there is an advantage in being part of a larger group, but with it being about a year (I think?) since this apocalypse started, most people seem to have little problem dealing with walkers (I think I read there have only been 3 instances of death-by-walker up until the latest episode, and in that [those who died from walkers only did so because they were shot, allowing the walkers to overrun them] (/spoiler)) and as such Tyreese and Sasha would probably have a better chance surviving on their own than participating further in the Rick v. Governor war.

So, /r/TWD, what are your thoughts on the future of Tyreese and Sasha?",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,,True,t3_1b1vu2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/1b1vu2/what_do_tyreese_and_sasha_do_now/,

And [we'll] get a little more into some of our characters. The challenge with a show like this, when you have a big ensemble, is you don’t want any of the characters to get lost; it’s important that we know what Carol’s story is and that we know what Beth’s story is. And when you’re trying to service a lot of characters, it becomes challenging. Watching the first season of Walking Dead and seeing how grounded it was, that’s really important to all of us. Andy Lincoln and I spent a lot of time going through the scripts and making sure we feel that they’re grounded. Because that’s what keeps our audience coming back. The walkers and the gore and the action and stuff, that’s fun, that’s the popcorn part of it. But if you don’t have characters that people are invested in, you lose your audience.” - Greg Nicotero, Executive Producer.

This is really interesting. I would love to know more about Carol and even the Dixon's, being since we now know that Daryl got abused as a child and had a rough time growing up. Also I am curious about Glenn, all we know from the show is that he delivered pizzas before the outbreak and hardly anything about what his family was like. What is your take on this?

I hope you are all pumped for tonight's episode. It's been a long while.

That said, over the hiatus, we gained a metric butt-tonne of new subscribers, and that is awesome! It is so amazing to think that we've come from just 100 or so subscribers in just a year. So, claps for all! This is awesome!

However, based on my comment skimming this morning, not all of us are familiar with the rules of /r/TWD, and that is perfectly understandable. Since a new episode airs tonight, I figured now would be the best time to remind everyone of our policies. 

**1) ABSOLUTELY NO DISCUSSION OF THE COMIC BOOK, WHATSOEVER, SHOULD BE HAPPENING ON THIS SUBREDDIT.**

Yes, we understand, every good TWD fan should read the books, but we'd just ""get it"" if we read the books, this is done to pay homage to the books, yadda yadda. Many of our subscribers have in fact read the comics, but many others have not. This subreddit was created to discuss the separate animal that AMC has created and while an understanding of the comic may feed into the show, many of us want to appreciate the show without comic spoilers. Taking a blind approach to what is happening in the show can also really vamp up excitement for a lot of viewers!

**2) Self-policing is best-policing.**

Over the break, we brought in a ton of new moderators. That being said, we brought in a ton of new subscribers, too. We scour the comments and new posts daily (and depending on the circumstances, sometimes hourly) to check for violations of our spoiler policy, and we don't always catch everything. It makes us so happy to see users commenting, ""Hey, can you edit your post? It violates such and such a rule,"" but it helps us if you also clickity clack that ""report"" button so we can remove the comment if necessary. That said, don't just clickity clack because you disagree. That's poor reddiquette, right there.

Some things bothered me during that scene with her and the Gov alone, aside from the context of the scene itself, but more things that Penny did in response. 

First she *runs* out at Gov. not like a quick shamble, but a steady, quickening pace, to the point where it isn't zombie-like, at least from the ones we've seen in this show. Maybe they were pulling a Witch from Left 4 Dead, but I just didn't like how she came out at him.

Also, I really hope I'm wrong and I really hope she was just focusing on the bucket of meat, but I didn't like how she seemed pacified once the music started. If she got pacified, then that means there's *something* there, an idea I hate.

1331771888.0,49,self.TWD,qx11l,I think I figured out why Rick didn't reveal what Jenner said in his last transmission to Morgan. [Speculation. Spoilers.],57,8,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/qx11l/i_think_i_figured_out_why_rick_didnt_reveal_what/,"So, it has been exhaustively speculated that what Jenner told Rick was that everyone becomes a walker regardless of cause of death. So exhaustively in fact, that I think if (or when) that is the big reveal I will be fairly underwhelmed. Now that it has been all but confirmed anyway by Shane and Randall's deaths it will even seem redundant. However, I personally find the writing of this show to be pretty stellar, and to put a reveal off for so very long - especially after teasing us with it in the second season's opening monologue - and then for it to turn out to be something the fans predicted long ago, doesn't seem in keeping with that quality. I mean, most of the big plot points lately have been pretty damn satisfying and it seems like hyping one as weak as this would ruin that whole momentum. Having said all this, it still sure does look like this is what Jenner's comment will turn out to be.

Now, being of unshakable faith in the subtly terrific writing of this series, I have resolved this in my mind by figuring that even if this is the proper speculation, there must be some twist in store. I mean, if all Jenner said is that everyone is infected then why would Rick refuse to broadcast that on his walkie? I figured it was because Rick thought that people would lose hope when they found that out, or that he didn't want to accept it himself, or that he didn't want to tell that to whoever was listening before he knew it was true. But reasonably, it seems like keeping that information to oneself puts a lot of people in serious danger, and that doesn't seem like Rick's style. So what is the dramatic and shocking revelation that Rick could be keeping to himself that we have so far failed to guess? 

Here is my speculation. Unfortunately, it is very close to the easily assumed notion that Rick simply didn't want to destroy people's hope for a better world. I mean, that is pretty much the central point of the whole first half of this season, right? That Rick had hope even when in truth hope was dead? So, it would make sense that that initial monologue was in retrospect just the introduction of Rick's naivety and denial. But in fact, the implications are much larger. If everyone becomes a walker after death, that does not simply mean, “oh shit, all these people I'm with will turn into walkers, oh shit, I'm going to turn into a walker whether I like it or not,” it means something much bigger: that this zombie epidemic is *never, ever, ever going away.* Death itself, death as we know it, is forever changed. Your kids, your grandkids, your descendants a hundred generations from now, everyone that will ever exist from here on out will become walkers when they die. Walkers will *by definition* outlive humans. 

One of the most exciting parts about post-apocalyptic fiction is the concept of starting over, of rebuilding in the ruin, notions that essentially give the apocalypse a kind of “temporary” quality. But Jenner's information changes all of this from a one time event to an ongoing, forever renewing fact. The world is not over because of this one apocalypse, the world is in a state of horrific apocalypse forever more. The hope that humans can band together and possibly reclaim an existence free of the walking dead is ruined because the more that humans overcome and thrive, well that is simply the more assurance that zombies will persist in overwhelming numbers.  While this doesn't exactly validate Rick's decision to keep this information to himself, it does increase the gravity of the situation significantly in a way I had not considered until now. It's the kind of thing that could destroy hope irreparably, which might have the existentially chilling effect that Jenner's info sort of lacks on its own.

Now, a lot of you have probably thought of this before, and of course there is always the hope for a “cure.” But whatever, I thought it was a cool enough realization that I'd post it.

We recently posted [here](http://redd.it/199fn8) about potentially changing some of the rules around here, in particular, those concerning comic spoilers and image posts. 

For starters, *we are never going to change the no-comics rule*. We only asked to get a better idea of what you all thought constituted a comic spoiler: simply mentioning the comic, or including information from it in any way. The mods have decided to **unanimously remove all comments and posts that mention the comics.** This way, nobody gets spoiled, even though yes, some of us have read the comics and think certain comments aren't spoiling anything, but others feel that simply mentioning the comics in regards to a particular topic spoils the comic for future readers.

Secondly, (and we know this may be controversial and we are willing to let this be trial and error should this become unpopular) **we are making /r/TWD an image-post-free zone.** Users have complained that lots of the images posted are memes and meaningless images used for karma-farming. **NOTE: This does not mean all images are banned. If you want to discuss an image, feel free to put it in a self-post. As long as it doesn't break any other rule, we are allowing images within self-posts for discussion purposes.** 

If these rules become too obtrusive, the mods are willing to compromise or change (maybe have an image-post day or something). But for now, these are the rules that the vast majority of the users of this subreddit have agreed upon, and we are going to give them a try. Remember, the upvote and downvote buttons DO still work, so as a user pointed out, you can still vote on quality and what makes it to the front page. 

**Just as a reminder, all episode preview information must be spoiler tagged in posts not related to the future episode, and all spoilertv/spoilthedead future spoilers must ONLY be posted in a new thread.**

I really want to engage in some discussion about the first episode beyond the usual lori-bitch, carl-house, hershel-ammo foolishness. So, since I posted this in a similar thread in the other sub I thought I'd throw it out here and see what comes back. Feel free to post any thoughts. How wonderful it is to be back!

After all the complaints about pacing, balance, and believability last season, I think this episode was pretty much perfect.

I'm excited about what they are doing with Rick and Lori's relationship, with Rick obviously suffering over the Shane incident and Lori voicing very legitimate concerns over her pregnancy. It is dramatic but also believable, and doesn't let anyone off the hook. I was afraid they would leave the Shane thing completely behind, as many lesser shows would have done because viewers of ""action"" shows tend to have little patience or appreciation for ""dramatic"" conflict.

I like that despite the ""not a democracy anymore"" line, the group actually seems to be functioning in a healthy, democratic way - just with Rick making all the final calls. Again, I was afraid the end of last season set the group up for conflict too conveniently, with Rick finally going off his rocker much like Shane did. Instead we are more invested in these characters because we can actually appreciate their decisions, not just sit around thinking ""stop being so stupid!"" which I think is the typical state of horror media.

On that note, I like that the way they are dealing with walkers is efficient, strategic, and adaptive. Though still not perfect, of course - it remains a TV show with limited ability to depict 100% believable plans - the number of arbitrary problems/mistakes/coincidences for dramatic effect is very low, this makes the drama and suspense in tense situations much more real.

I especially like that we are starting with a group of people who seem to finally understand the world they live in and don't just bitch about silly things for the sake of narrative conflict. In my opinion this is the zombie show/film we have been waiting for since the beginning of the genre.",,False,,t5_2szqa,1350327252.0,,,True,t3_11ivzx,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/11ivzx/discussion_of_anything_you_thought_about_the/,

",43,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/121fpp/in_regards_to_recent_issues_a_reminder_of_this/,"**Graphic novel discussion** - First and foremost, absolutely no discussion of the graphic novel should be taking place in this subreddit. The main purpose of this subreddit is to keep fans up to date on the show, and in the dark from the comic. Mentioning you have read the graphic novel is fine, but giving any information found within it is against the rules here. 


**Spoilers** - Do not post spoilers in the title! If you are going to include spoilers in your post, be sure to use the following format:
[SPOILERS (Episode#)]. 

An example of a title would be: ""[SPOILERS (1x1)] I have a theory about Rick."" **If a post clearly indicates [SPOILERS] or The Episode Name/Number in the title, IT SHOULD NOT BE REPORTED FOR HAVING SPOILERS.**

Within the context of the post, you should mark your spoilers using the following format:

A good rule of thumb for spoilers: When does information STOP being a spoiler? (Shameless steal from CollegeHumor)


*Standard episode - 2-3 weeks

*Season finale - 1-2 months

*Series finale - 2-4 months

Still tag the title, but any comments in regards to previous episode shouldn't be reported. 

**Trolling** - Please do not throw around hate speech here. We are all adults and should be able to get along. Friendly debates about the characters or plot are fine, but don't let things turn personal. And no trolling, it serves no purpose and contributes nothing. Hateful or abusive comments will be removed immediately and consistent abusers will be banned from this subreddit. 

**PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF KIRKMAN USE YOUR REPORT BUTTON.**

The other mods and I try to go through every thread every day to check for new comments and comic spoilers. This takes a while. We generally pick up illegal comments and have them removed, but we miss some on occasion. If you report the comment when you see it, we get it in our mod queue and we can take appropriate action much faster. 

**Pre-release Spoilers** - Last year, a user on 4chan had insider information and spoiled most episodes before they aired. It is okay if you want to post these spoilers, **but** you *must* post a separate thread away from the weekly discussion post and appropriately tag the post as ""[SPOILERS (Ep #)] Pre-release Spoilers""



Please read the rules in the sidebar before posting. If we can all follow these simple rules, we can make this subreddit a better place to browse and discuss AMC's The Walking Dead. 

If you have any suggestions, please comment below or message the mods. Thanks!

It's just some survivor on whom Rick has superimposed Morgan's face.

Evidence:

- The guy didn't recognise Rick from the rooftop or when first waking up.
- Michonne and Carl have never met Morgan, so they believe Rick.
- Rick is inadvertently priming the guy with a lot of facts:  ""My name is Rick Grimes.  You know me.  You saved me.  I gave you this.  I said I'd turn it on every day at dawn"".
- When the guy ""recognises"" Rick, he repeats back things Rick has already told him.  ""I know who you are.  You said you'd turn yours on at dawn.  That's what you said."" thus reinforcing Rick's psychosis.
- As the vision takes hold, most of the middle conversation (about wives and sons) could be in Rick's head.
- At the end of the conversation, by the window, the guy exclaims ""I don't think that you heard a damn word that I said!""
- Rick: ""You're not seeing things right"".  He repeats this twice. Is it his own subconscious trying to break through to him and dismantle the vision?  ""You can come back from this. I know you can.""
- At this point the guy gives Rick a very puzzled look.  He just wants to get this crazy man out of his house.
- Michonne's comment before they leave, ""I know you see people"" - she might suspect it was not really Morgan but doesn't know how to broach the subject directly.
- Occam's Razor.  It's more plausible that this is just more of Rick's crazy than it is that both Rick and Morgan are crazy.

[SPOILERS (3x08)]",59,29,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/14hzww/you_scream_i_scream_who_screams_to_alert_zombies/,"So in the season finale we hear two screams, one at the beginning of the episode when Tyreese first appears on screen and one inside the prison which alerts Carl to others in the prison. These screams appear to have come from Tyreese's group, but this doesn't seem to make sense for many reasons.

This is a hardened group that appears to have spent a large amount of time on the road (as Tyreese states they haven’t been anywhere this safe in weeks), so would know the stupidity of screaming and drawing attention to themselves.

Who screamed? To me it sounded like a woman’s scream, there are only two women in the group (sorry I can’t remember their names, or if we've been told). The woman who got bit didn't scream that loud when she got bit, so I can’t imagine her screaming louder for no reason. The other woman seems like the most wary of the group, as she sees the danger of bringing the bitten women with them, so why would she scream an act potentially more dangerous.

I can only see two possible explanations to this;
1) It was the kid in the group as he seemed pretty hysterical. Though he looks about 16 and it would be a bit weird if he screamed like that, you would think his voice would have dropped by now.
2) It is someone outside of the group we see, though this would make little sense as the scream is heard outside in the woods and in the prison, and it leads Carl to the group not anyone else.

So here's what you can do: Design a header image OR design a reddit alien to be featured on our main page and post it on r/TWD with the tag [CONTEST SUBMISSION]! The most up voted image will be our new header/alien and the user will receive one month of reddit gold.

RULES:

No comic images.

No images that may openly spoil something that happens *in* season 3, (No post-death or post-amputation images)

Must be related to The Walking Dead. If the most up voted header is a unicorn with a dick-horn, it is not going to be the header. Sorry guys. (Yes, even a zombie unicorn with a dick-horn will not be accepted). 

Be creative! The link to this Contest will always be in the sidebar.

Header: At least 60 px high. If it is a repeated image then it should be 600px or more wide. It can be a larger image that is taller or wider, such as the image on r/thetalkingdead, but I would not exceed 1200x200.

Contest ends on December 31st, 11:59 PM EST, and the new banner will be displayed the following morning of the new year.

When posting your submission, please include the tag [CONTEST SUBMISSION] in the title!


EDIT: Since everyone is in the midst of Christmas shopping and finals. I have extended the deadline to sometime mid-January. Hope to see *some* submissions. :)

Are the people who need protection but provide a civilized environment worth the risk?,39,6,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/13p0gc/possible_spoilers_a_debate_i_have_over_and_over/,"My friend says he would want everyone in his group to be fighters. He would not care about clean clothes, decent food, or other comforts. He says it's a zombie apocalypse and there is no room for a homemaker role. Protecting people and children who cannot fight compromises everyone's safety and survival. 

Fair argument, I suppose, if you want to live like a filthy inhumane savage. 

I would want both like the show has. They have a variety of talents at their disposal. Dale was good at fixing cars, Andrea can fish, Hershel's a doctor, Lori was a leader and strong advocate for that side of the group, Glen is smart and quick, Maggi is like a nurse, and Carl can turn invisible and wander off at a moment's notice. 

The main thing, though, is the environment they provide. Lori, Carol, and others provided a civilized environment. Imagine if the world ended. Everything was gone. Everything. Your loved ones, your friends, your hobbies, your interests, you homes, your safety, your plans for life. Gone. What keeps you going? What can possibly help you remember that you're still human at the end of the day? Good food, good company, clean clothes, small comforts from home like silverware and plates or items like soaps and shampoos that are restocked and kept track of by certain people. 

Not everyone is like Daryl, who can probably  kill walkers all day and then go live in a burrow. I don't think Rick, T-Dog, and Glen would be able to keep up with those responsibilities themselves without getting worn out.

Ho. Lee. Shit. We have come SO far from last year!

In honor of getting our 2000th subscriber, we are going to create a new contest! Last year, we hosted a banner contest, and /u/bmanfoley's banner (the current one) won with the most up votes and he won a month of reddit gold. 

What kind of contest would you like to have? What kind of prize should we send out?

We had an issue this week with a user submitting spoilers for the premiere before it aired, and it was properly spoiler tagged in the episode discussion. /u/Antroh and I agreed that the comment wouldn't be removed unless it was reported, which it was, multiple times. However, there were also complaints after the removal of the comment. It has since been reapproved. What do you guys want to happen? Do you want all pre-release spoilers to be banned or placed into separate threads? Or are you just fine with them being placed into the main episode discussion? What would you like the policy to be?

Finally, do you have any suggestions or concerns that you would like the mods to consider? We are always looking to make our subreddit more user friendly and a place for YOU ALL! Please let us know!

(S1-S2, and LOST spoilers)",31,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/10tno5/why_i_think_carol_is_actually_a_pretty_decent/,"Having been a longtime LOST fan (though the series finale can go fuck itself), I have enjoyed shows with weak characters that somehow never seem to die when they should.
Spoiling most of LOST here:
In LOST you had Sun, Jin's wife, who started out in the series completely submissive, weak, character that really didn't do much except look scared and fall down. I wanted her to get eaten by the smoke monster for her lack of character. But then Season 4 happens, and I see her putting a gun up to everyone's face, and not dying from childbirth on the island. Plus you got to see her before she became timid, and you realize what kind of shit she went through to put her in that submissive state. It was once she broke out of her shell, she started to become a very strong character.
TWD Spoiler time:
Now in TWD, we have Carol, who when we meet her, is weak, timid, has a wierd shaved head (I personally think her hair has been shaved out of her fear of what her husband would think), and is completely controlled by her husband physically.

Her husband getting eaten in the camp attack gives her oppurtunity of freedom, but at a rather terrible cost. Even though she was beaten by him, Sophia would then not grow up to have a father, ecspecially one like Rick.

With only Sophia left, just a little girl surrounded by death, Carol is put in a desperate fear for the health and life of her child. Honestly, for anyone to still not blow their brains out at this point, is some serious fucking willpower. 

We go to the Season 2 opener, under the cars. Goddamn, STUPID Sofia just HAD to move and not wait 3 hours like any normal human being would have moved, and got chased into the woods (this is all her own damn fault, I don't blame Rick at all for her death). This all happened right in front of Carol. She watched her daughter in a helpless state of fear, and disappear. Fuck. 

We don't need to discuss the Sophia crap, it goes on way too long... she dies, Carol flips her shit (amazing acting performance btw. Without her completely breaking down, Sophia's reveal wouldn't have had the weight of impact that it did) now Carol has nothing left, except for the hope that Daryl still cares for her (I personally think she loves him subconciously. Daryl is totally the man she always wanted, imo)


When weak characters lose everything they love, they also lose what fear of death that they have. Why should carol care she dies at this point? She almost has nothing left to live for, which is exactly why we're gunna see her at her most primal state.

And seriously:
She's shooting an AK at something in the trailer! 

Either she gets raped and killed, or she becomes a fierce, soulless zombie killer.

If she does die this season, it will close one hell of a character arc.

First, when Merle accidentally shot ~~Ben~~, when he was aiming at the Governor. Second, it was Ben's body that Merle was chowing down on.  
  
I could be reading too much into this. but I have a theory on this. As seen in the season finale sneak peek, Woodbury is about to launch an all out war upon the prison (i'm so excited!). I would argue, to bolster the causes for war, the Governor will use the death of the innocent child (~~Ben~~) as a rallying cry to war. The Governor could thus claim that, if the evil prison gang is willing to kill a innocent child, then they would be willing to kill everyone in Woodbury. Thus, ~~Ben~~ is the martyr that the Governor needed to launch the war.

Here's my take:

I know a lot of people want the Governor to die.  But there are a lot of people in Woodbury who look up to him and depend on him as a figurehead and leader.

And Merle.  Ooooooh baby something is going to happen with Merle for sure.  The moment the Governor lays eyes on Michonne he is gonna be *pissed* at Merle.  And the moment Daryl and Rick find out what Merle has been doing to Glen (and what he might do to Maggie) they're going to be pissed as well.

So how will this come together?  Maggie (or someone else) puts a knife in the Governor's head and Merle takes over Woodbury as the main villain for the second half of the season?  Merle abandons the governor and dies a hero's death saving Daryl from him?

But if they both die, what will the second half of the season be about?  Will Rick take over woodbury?

I want to say ""There's no way Andrea will side with Rick and Daryl"" but I might be underestimating Michonne's influence.  Those two have been through a lot together even if it was mostly implied.

This subreddit has absolutely died over the in-between lull and I can't wait to see some activity again! I love our little community (though it is always growing) and I am glad that, even though there wasn't much activity, we weren't flooded with the usual TWD spam. So thanks!

I would just like to remind everyone that this subreddit is show-specific, and any comic spoilers should be reported. We chose to create this branch of the main subreddit because show fans were often bullied or belittled for their opinions because they were not comic-canon, and because some just simply didn't want to be spoiled by comic information. 

Additionally, with the start of a new season comes the start of a new contest. On October 5, I will try to create a new contest, where the winner will earn reddit gold (and maybe another prize, who knows?)

Finally, rumor has it that on October 11 Season 2 will appear on Netflix, so get yourselves caught up if you haven't already if at all possible. EDIT: It's actually on Netflix now. Go enjoy!

**Just a reminder about the spoiler tags:**

In an **episode discussion**, there is no spoiler tag required. If you are creating a discussion post or image, please use the format ""[Spoilers (Episode #)] Blah blah discussion topic."" 

Please be generous with your spoiler tags in non-episode discussion threads. They aren't *required* if the title is properly tagged, and I'd like to think we shouldn't need them, but if it is a big spoiler, i.e. ""OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE RICK KILLED CARL."" then please spoiler tag it.

Last season the popular vote asked that this subreddit remain meme-free, and while I can tolerate a meme or two, let's police ourselves and not let this place turn into a total macro-image hell. 

If you have any other ideas, thoughts, comments, or suggestions, leave them below! Your mods are always open to change. :)

For me, flashbacks can really add a lot to character depth and really make you attached to them through thick and thin.

I feel if there were more flashbacks to show why a character made a decision or why something really hit home for them, the show would greatly benefit.

I'm not talking about crazy amounts of flash backs like LOST (which I'm current watching and am only on season 2, so please flag your spoilers if you make them about that show.) but something like one every episode or every other would really add a lot to show for me.

Now, before you quit reading this, hear me out. I have good plausible reasons.**

**1.** Almost every other character that we believed to be dead came back alive. Take for example the prisoner, Andrew, that opened the gates and set off the alarm. Merle was believed to be dead in season 1. He is also alive. There also doesn't seem to be a problem of not showing deaths because of gore, either. So, I think it is safe to draw the conclusion that any death not specifically shown can't be assumed.

**2.** After the episode, T-Dog had a major part on The Talking Dead. This was strange for such a minor character overall, even though he was widely liked. Lori was not on at all. Not even for a few words(to keep it short for Lori haters but still have her on). None. So, either she is not dead or the writers are still trying to hide something about her character (possibly turned, maybe still on cast for flashbacks, etc).

**3.** The are rumors that her character was cast in later episodes this season. This could mean she is alive, she turned into a zombie, or there could possibly be flashbacks of events that were not previously shown.


I definitely don't want her to turn into a zombie. That would be cruel after what happened in the last episode. If she is done, she should be done and Carl shot her. But, I do hope that she is alive. I think she could be a good character and necessary for the baby. It seems like everyone is dying. Think back to season 1 and how many more people they had. Some of this is necessary but I think they have taken the death of main characters too far. Some of you will say that Lori should die and you didn't like her character, but I think she was just being a pregnant b***h.

I know I may be stirring up a hornets nest by making a thread devoted to Lori, but I've seen people using this parallel around here and the other sub and found it very intriguing. And after her very significant conversation with Shane last episode, I'd love to see some discussion about it or just general thoughts about her. When calling her a Lady Macbeth it seems people are mostly referring to the conversation she had with Rick in which she told him Shane is dangerous and that he believes the baby is his, and that people mean to say she was encouraging Rick to kill Shane. This may or may not be the case, but the way I see it Lady Macbeth's intentions in encouraging her husband to kill his competition was for the sake of ambition and personal gain. Lori was more doing it as a legitimate warning to Rick, who she probably thought a little naive and unable to see past his friendship with Shane, and if it was to instigate murder it was more to stabilize the group and prevent further harm to anyone who got in Shane's way. As for the most recent conversation, I personally think she did the right thing being so candid with Shane about her thoughts. It seemed to me an attempt to mend things, to express to Shane the well deserved gratitude he was in a way robbed of, but ultimately it looked more like a final goodbye to a man on death row. At the same time it seems like that conversation is what drove him off the deep end and some people seem to think that was her intention, which also sounds tones of Lady Macbeth.

Now, don't get me wrong, I more than anyone would love to endorse this analogy, but I am admittedly unfamiliar with the particular complexities of that play, and I've always had a hard time putting my finger on what exactly Lori represents and means in the scheme of things.

If you've seen the previews for the next episode, you know that Glenn and Maggie are going for a run for supplies. It also looks like they run into Merle (in the preview it looks like Maggie is pointing the gun at Merle). Maybe a couple of the Governor's guys were out looking for Michonne (because we see Michonne hiding) but couldn't find her. Glenn or Maggie fess up about the prison to Merle and the Governor's guys forcibly take them and bring them to Woodbury. The Governor then tries to get information out of them in numerous ways...

Dale is still a chicken shit and doesn't really have balls like Shane said.

Rick is learning to be a leader, and still choosing to make morally ""right"" choices.

Andrea should be shot.

Glenn needs to man up.

Lori needs to turn into zombie mom.

Carl needs more lines.

Also, T-DOGG. WHY? Why do we not see more of this gent? I mean, aside from being a little slow.. if he would have just paid a little more attention and not slit his entire arm... things might be different. Also, he should man up as well and do more than just utter 1 liners.

I think, overall I like Hershel, and I like Darryl, but it's definitely time for the group to move.

I haven't seen anyone say ""best finale ever!"" or ""that was perfect!"" 

So while some say it was awful and some say it was meh, all agree that it could've been better. What direction do you hope season 4 takes, and what direction do you think it will take?

I hope the prison gets one final attack by the mid-season finale, where the Governor, Martinez, Shumpert (the black guy), and maybe two or three other guys he managed to pick up along the way lead an assault on the prison. (Remember, Rick and Maggie in the mid-season premiere were enough to send Woodbury scattering--I'm sure that four or five heavily armed guys can lead a decent assault. The first half of the season shouldn't show them much and focus on the group: maybe Morgan returns, Carl's relationship with Rick, Judith growing up, Carl starting to reveal his hinted-at crush on Beth, etc. By the midseason finale, a huge shocker should come as the Governor and his crew return and lead an attack. Rick and co. quickly gather up and prepare, sending the old people and children from Woodbury somewhere to hide. In the ensuing chaos, Beth is killed while holding the baby, dying, and Hershel can't take it. As the Governor closes in, he begs to be killed with her. Martinez and/or Shumpert are killed, as is the Governor (later on). Either Glenn or Daryl should die, just to make it a real slaughter. Rick manages to save Carl, and the two are separated as they flee the prison while the rest of the group gives up. The Governor's forces manage to get walkers into the prison as Rick's original group leaves, and the walkers infiltrate the room with the old people and children, killing them all. The Governor should be the last one to die, torn apart by walkers. 

Rick's group regroups outside, although Rick and Carl are separated, and remain so for a few episodes. Once the group is reunited, they are on the road for a good portion of the season. I'm still not sure how the finales would play out, though. 

What do you think? What are your hopes for this season? While it probably won't play out that way, that is what I would love to see. What about you

This subreddit was created for fans of that show that either have not caught up with the graphic novel, or have not read it at all. If you would like to discuss both the show *and* the graphic novel, we invite you to check out our main subreddit /r/thewalkingdead. We have lots of interesting ideas for the future and are excited to get things up and running!

With that said, it is important that we lay out a few basic ground rules.

**Graphic novel discussion** - First and foremost, absolutely no discussion of the graphic novel should be taking place in this subreddit. The main purpose of this subreddit is to keep fans up to date on the show, and in the dark from the comic. Mentioning you have read the graphic novel is fine, but giving any information found within it is against the rules here. 


**Spoilers** - Do not post spoilers in the title! If you are going to include spoilers in your post, be sure to use the following format:
[SPOILERS (Episode#)]. 

An example of a title would be: ""[SPOILERS (1x1)] I have a theory about Rick."" **If a post clearly indicates [SPOILERS] or The Episode Name/Number in the title, IT SHOULD NOT BE REPORTED FOR HAVING SPOILERS.**

Within the context of the post, you should mark your spoilers using the following format:

    [This is a spoiler sentence!](/spoiler)

It will show up like this: [This is a spoiler sentence!](/spoiler)


A big complaint within the main subreddit was the constant untagged spoilers. With this format, you will be able to tell what episode the post may spoil, and if you so choose, you can avoid posts regarding that episode. With that said, as we are making this community available for show-only discussion, there should be no excuse for down voting any comic information in the original subreddit, /r/thewalkingdead.

**Any and all preview information must be spoiler tagged until the episode airs.** 

**PRE RELEASE SPOILERS MUST BE PLACED IN A SEPARATE POST. Absolutely NO pre-release spoilers in episode discussions or otherwise.**

A good rule of thumb for spoilers: When does information STOP being a spoiler? (Shameless steal from CollegeHumor)


*Standard episode - 2-3 weeks

*Season finale - 1-2 months

*Series finale - 2-4 months



**Trolling** - Please do not throw around hate speech here. We are all adults and should be able to get along. Friendly debates about the characters or plot are fine, but don't let things turn personal. And no trolling, it serves no purpose and contributes nothing. Hateful or abusive comments will be removed immediately and consistent abusers will be banned from this subreddit. 



With all that said, I hope this community will grow and turn out wonderfully! **Get posting, people!** Of course, if you have any suggestions about what else you would like to see or other rules that should be implemented, feel free to message the moderators or comment below! If this gets off the ground, we are also considering doing some fun activities for everyone that could leave you with a month of shiny internet gold, just to liven things up a bit.

As you can tell, our header looks pretty bland. We would love if it looked just as awesome as it deserves. 



So here's what you can do: Design a header image OR design a reddit alien to be featured on our main page and post it on r/TWD with the tag [CONTEST SUBMISSION]! The most up voted image will be our new header/alien and the user will receive one month of reddit gold.



RULES:

No comic images.

Must be related to The Walking Dead. If the most up voted header is a unicorn with a dick-horn, it is not going to be the header. Sorry guys. (Yes, even a *zombie* unicorn with a dick-horn will not be accepted). 


Be creative! The link to this Contest will always be in the sidebar, and we may post another design contest in a few months! (We'll see if this subreddit grows at all :D)


Header: At least 60 px high. If it is a repeated image (such as [this one](http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2rygv_13.png) that is used for r/thewalkingdead) then it should be 600px or more wide. It can be a larger image that is taller or wider, such as the image on r/thetalkingdead, but I would not exceed 1200x200.

I understand why the Governor and his soldiers would be. They're the more powerful, with better weapons and more people.

But why does it seem like everyone in the prison (sans maybe Hershel) wants this to escalate to war? They act as if they'll kill the Governor and it'll be over. But the other side has dozens of people, well-armed. Rick could very likely lose his son. Hershel could lose his daughters, Glen could lose his girlfriend.

The only real way I see the brewing war ending would be with multiple deaths on Rick's side if things go on this way.

I see Tyreese's group going back to Rick, especially if the theories about [the Governor raping Tyrese's sister](/spoiler) is true. I could even see Andrea going back to the group once things get really heated in Woodbury. If in the next few episodes, Morgan comes back like he's supposed to, that could be another person on the group's side, but even then, they're pretty screwed.

Why don't they just leave and try and find somewhere else. They've pretty much stayed pretty close to where they were in Season 1 and 2 (as evidenced by Daryl and Merle being familiar with the area and [Next Episode Spoilers][Rick, Michonne, and Carl going back to Rick's home town](/spoiler).

Really? I don't get it to say the least. What do people expect? Just because it's an apocalypse everyone needs to be OK with running around with shottys blowing peoples heads off?

Since the beginning of season 1 Lori has made it clear that she didn't want Carl getting caught up in all of this hoopla. It's nothing new. They really begin to emphasize it in season 2. 

* Firstly her ""little boy"" gets shot: This would put ANY mother on edge. 
* She has conflict with Rick during his healing time thinking that it MAY be best for him to not grow up in what seems to be a world not  worth living in. 
* She HATES the idea of Carl getting involved with the guns: What mom wants there 10 year old (or whatever age) toting around a gun blowing heads off of what what used to be people?

She has this dilemma from the get go though and the show has done a great job at slowly evolving her character and her struggle with this idea. The last scene with her and Rick, I do not believe she was mad at Rick. When Rick told her he killed Shane, yes, she backed off a bit. That was more of a ""I can't believe we let things get to this point"" in my eyes. What really threw her over the edge was the fact that Carl, her son, was the one who put Shane down in the end. A man who Lori had just given thanks to for saving their lives and a man who was essentially a second father to Carl. For as much trouble Shane caused I think the last thing Lori wanted was for her husband/son to be involved in the death of him. Lori is a conflicted character. One minute she is telling her husband he is dangerous and something needs to be done (she doesn't say go Kill him mind you) and the next minute she is thanking Shane for all he has done. This is clearly a woman torn between two men one way or another. She felt guilty in my opinion. 

All in all Lori isn't just the ""bitch"" of the show. I think she is a strong character that we are seeing evolve every episode. I think she is finally coming to terms with the fact, albeit not happy and obviously disturbed, that her son is going to have to kill in order to live in the world they are in now. What mom wouldn't be a mental mess with those thoughts?

Those are my thoughts though. There are 1000 threads in the other sub meme related or just bashing her and I don't really understand why. I had to rant. ",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,,True,t3_r3ihk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/r3ihk/my_thoughts_on_lori_and_why_i_like_her_character/,

[SPOLERS],4,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/12wd1d/my_theory_on_the_events_of_episode_3x4_spolers/,"**I think that Lori may actually live and continue to be on the show. Now, before you quit reading this, hear me out. I have good plausible reasons.**

**1.** Almost every other character that we believed to be dead came back alive. Take for example the prisoner, Andrew, that opened the gates and set off the alarm. Merle was believed to be dead in season 1. He is also alive. There also doesn't seem to be a problem of not showing deaths because of gore, either. So, I think it is safe to draw the conclusion that any death not specifically shown can't be assumed.

**2.** After the episode, T-Dog had a major part on The Talking Dead. This was strange for such a minor character overall, even though he was widely liked. Lori was not on at all. Not even for a few words(to keep it short for Lori haters but still have her on). None. So, either she is not dead or the writers are still trying to hide something about her character (possibly turned, maybe still on cast for flashbacks, etc).

**3.** The are rumors that her character was cast in later episodes this season. This could mean she is alive, she turned into a zombie, or there could possibly be flashbacks of events that were not previously shown.


I definitely don't want her to turn into a zombie. That would be cruel after what happened in the last episode. If she is done, she should be done and Carl shot her. But, I do hope that she is alive. I think she could be a good character and necessary for the baby. It seems like everyone is dying. Think back to season 1 and how many more people they had. Some of this is necessary but I think they have taken the death of main characters too far. Some of you will say that Lori should die and you didn't like her character, but I think she was just being a pregnant b***h.

2)Why do we have T-Dog if he serves no purpose to the story other than 'the black guy'? Other than the episode that they dropped the N-Bomb 20+ times he has had 3 lines at most. Let's hope he gets a part eventually... maybe I'll keep watching if he does.

3) Darrel was a great character at the start of the show. He was loyal to his brother and somewhat unpredicatble in the first season and started to bloom in the second season. He nearly died looking for Sophia, and of course we all know what happened when she was finally found. Afterwards he was pissed off, and thats all fine and dandy.

The Era of Tyreese?,12,13,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/1b59i3/spoilers_s4_goodbye_rick_the_era_of_tyreese/,"I've been bothered by the inclusion of Tyreese for sometime.  I've not read the comics, but I know that when Tyreese popped up as a character, the TWD fanbase was excited.  Then, after his introduction, he kind of fell off, and I never got a sense that he and his group had been properly established.

Those scenes where we have had Tyresse interact with Carl, Rick, Andrea and The Gov have painted him, however, as more than just a part of the ensemble cast.  I don't know what it is, exactly, but the way he's played and his presence on screen puts him on the level of both Rick and Phil - and it's not just b/c he is a leader of a group.  He seems to have been set up to a much bigger influence than as another blind mouse for Phil or even as a welcomed addition to the prison kids.

I know the number of deaths has been set at 27 according to Lincoln, so some blood is going to flow, and while one would assume Herschel and Beth are certain to die, others think maybe it'll Glen, Maggie, or both.  It could be Judith, Carol, or even Carl.  Very few have said Rick will die, and like a lot of others, I thought that theory crazy - but now, I'm not so sure.

When you look at Rick's story arc, his character is kind of finished.  He has come back from the dead, learned the harsh realities of the new world order don't easily mix with his old world morality, found himself slipping dangerously close to being a dictator and a mad man as a result, and found redemption, giving his power to decide how to live and how to die back to the group.  Rick seems to have come full circle as a character, and while in comic books we see characters come, go, comeback, get reinvented, go, comeback, and get reinvented again, in tv and film, characters that take a path like Rick's are usually done.  They either end the movie, replace the character with another, or end the series.  I'm starting to think Rick is as good as dead.

Then I thought about how that could happen.  Would Daryl become the leader?  Could that even work?  I don't think so.  Neither would it work with Glen, IMO, but what if Tyreese became the focus?  Maybe we take a break from the prison group (who may no longer be the prison group after the finale) and the show follows Tyreese, Sasha, and any others who survive Woodbury for the beginning of S4.  When the second half of the season hits, a year from now, I could then see what was left of Rick's group returning.  Maybe Daryl and Michonne are paired up and running together.  Maybe Carl has taken his father's place, and while not running a group on his own, is a part of the inner circle. 

I can't imagine the specifics b/c, as much as some want to say the show has become predictable, I can't see how that's really true.  Anything could happen, but I have to believe Tyreese becomes a much bigger player come Season 4.

1331166074.0,0,self.TWD,qmj8i,[Spoilers] S2E11 Worst ending yet,7,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/qmj8i/spoilers_s2e11_worst_ending_yet/,"The show has lost it. The producers seem to have contempt for the core of the show and the viewers. Here's why: 

The cool part about the show was solving puzzles and trying to figure out the big mysteries - looking for little clues and wondering what they mean. Unfortunately, this seems to have been slipping to the wayside as the interesting puzzles (eg. two dead guards without visible injuries) are never mentioned again.

But now episode 11 ends with many contradictory facts. But rather than being fascinating clues to zombie nature, I suspect they're shortcuts in logic made to save money and to avoid creativity:

* Why was the cow on the edge of the forest at night and not in the barn?

* Why was the zombie not still on top of the cow eating it? If it was insatiable, it would have been. If it was not insatiable and thus ""full"" then why would it so ravenously attack Dale?

* How did the zombie silently tiptoe right up behind dale, in a field and underbrush -- so close Dale couldn't use his rifle? (Honestly, this is just a made-for-tv literary device that screams ""cheap!"") 

* How did the zombie possess super-human strength to (1) Rip open Dale's stomach cavity while (2) physically resisting Dale?

What fascinating things we learned about zombie behavior. :-P",,False,,t5_2szqa,False,,,True,t3_qmj8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/TWD/comments/qmj8i/spoilers_s2e11_worst_ending_yet/,
