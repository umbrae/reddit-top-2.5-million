We are truly pleased that you find this site interesting or useful. It is a pleasure to keep this site going because you readers are informed, polite people. 

We often comment to each other how fortunate it has been that this little subreddit does not descend into stupid name-calling in the comments and that the subscribers understand the purpose of this site and only post articles and videos that are germane to the topic. 

I hope that you use the information that is shared on these pages to educate friends and family to what the US government is doing around the world. It is one thing to know what is going on, it’s another to do something about it. The most important thing to do is to disseminate what you learn here.

Despite what you might think of my comments here, I do think our military policy is in the wrong place and has cost both American military and foreign civilian lives.

This was the documentary that really sparked the idea for me, Eugene Jarecki's **Why We Fight**.  This was what 9/11 Farenheit should have been - an even handed look at the entire military-industrial complex from the viewpoint of an average American citizen.

**The access Jarecki gains with contractors and politicians is very impressive and the segments about 9/11 or the death of Baghdad civilians can be heartbreaking.**

Probably the best moment was when John McCain, the well-known ""maverick"" senator from Arizona, was talking to the documentarians about how it wasn't really corruption in Washington.  It was this sense of ""closeness"" and improper communication that creates an atmosphere where things slowly backslide into corruption.

**At the exact moment as if to prove his point, he gets a call from then-Vice President Dick Cheney.**

If you've never seen it, I HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest you purchase this documentary as most of it is not out of date.

Much of our attention lately has been focused on the use of drone strikes against US citizens on US soil. The Administration recently affirmed that it does not have the right to kill Americans on US soil by drone…unless it deems them “combatants” first. This should not make us feel any better – that was the same technique used to send so many to Guantanamo even though it was known they had not committed a crime against the US. Call someone “combatant” and they lose all right to life and liberty without trial. It seems like a bad dream.

Unfortunately, less attention has been paid to another very disturbing and dangerous aspect of the US use of drones to kill. As the UK Guardian newspaper reported yesterday, the United States has been using its military to attack the sovereign territory of Pakistan without the consent of the government of Pakistan. Over continued objections of the government of Pakistan, including regularly delivered strong notes of protest, the US government continues to use its drones to attack Pakistani citizens on Pakistani soil. 

Much of those attacks are what is called “signature strikes,” which means the US targets individuals exhibiting certain kinds of behaviors or wearing certain types of clothing rather than any evidence of actual wrongdoing or violent acts in progress. Former US ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter had this to say last year about these strikes, when asked to define who can be targeted: “The definition is a male between the ages of 20 and 40.” 

According to the Guardian article, the UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights Ben Emmerson returned from a three day trip to Pakistan and concluded:

“The position of the government of Pakistan is quite clear. It does not consent to the use of drones by the United States on its territory and it considers this to be a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

""As a matter of international law the US drone campaign in Pakistan is therefore being conducted without the consent of the elected representatives of the people, or the legitimate government of the state. It involves the use of force on the territory of another state without its consent and is therefore a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty.""

To date, Pakistan estimates that 2,200 deaths had been caused by drone strikes and a further 600 people had suffered serious injuries. Hundreds of the dead are non-combatants, including scores of women and children.

The US claims its attacks on Pakistan are authorized by the initial Authorization for the Use of Force granted to the president to retaliate against those who attacked or assisted in the attack on the US on 9/11. The targets in Pakistan are neither of those. The operation is therefore an attack on a sovereign nation in total absence of any legal Congressional authority. In other words, the US is illegally at war with Pakistan. Is this reckless droning of sovereign nations making us all more vulnerable to retaliation? After all, wars are often two-way streets. 

The US government touts the rule of law as it lectures the rest of the world on how it should be governed. When it comes to actually observing the rule of law, it seems the US view is “do what we say, not what we do.” How much longer can we have any credibility with the rest of the world with this kind of arrogant imperialism?",,False,,t5_2s4wg,False,,,True,t3_1ag4io,http://www.reddit.com/r/EndlessWar/comments/1ag4io/ron_paul_are_we_at_war_with_pakistan/,

Two years ago, the drone murders were not yet institutionalized, although Obama was killing random people all over Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. It seemed like things would have to get better because of budgetary constraints in Washington and because at some point the American voter must see through the fog of lies and demand a stop to the murderous craziness. I can't say that I was hopeful two years ago, but I didn't really expect things to get worse. I was unreasonably optimistic. Things have gotten much worse and we are at the doorstep of a vault up to a new level of state violence, both at home and especially in the Mideast/Central Asia/North Africa.

I find it hard to believe that the majority of American voters are so incredibly misinformed, and led to false conclusions through racist propaganda that dehumanizes Muslims while deifying the brutal Israeli state. Things are not getting better. The herd has not awakened. Polls show that only a fraction of Americans think that Israel provoked the current war of abuse on Gaza, although it is perfectly crystal clear that Hamas was actively trying to negotiate an end to hostilities. What can stop the Empire if it can succesfully apply mind-control to the voters?


And we are now going to embark on more and much bigger wars. Given Israel/US aggressive actions against an unarmed people held in a concentration camp, its hard to see that reasons of decency and justice will keep the Empire from killing hundreds of thousands of Iranian civilians in order to assure Israeli/Saudi hegemony over the Mideast. That war will spark revolt and wars throughout the Muslims world

Increasingly intrusive measures are being used to spy on Americans, in order to cull out anyone who might threaten the permanent war state. Julian Assange, Bradley Manning and John Kiriakou are examples for the dissidents who oppose the actions of the Empire. The herd applauds their illegal mistreatment. 

I don't know what to do but to ask all of you to inform yourselves as well as you can and talk to Americans. Convince them that they must wrestle control of their government from the neocon warmongers.
