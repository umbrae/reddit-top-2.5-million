1343584614.0,370,self.autism,xckwv,Autistic girl video inspired me to ask you about something I've struggled with my whole life: massive over abundance of sensory input,420,50,372,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/xckwv/autistic_girl_video_inspired_me_to_ask_you_about/,"Hi /r/autism. I'm a guy in my 30s and I've been struggling with a problem my whole life. I hope I don't offend anyone with this post, but this path I'm following is the biggest source of hope I've had in a while to figure this out about myself. 

I never would have thought about autism until I watched the video about the severely autistic girl who was communicating through the computer, and she said something about how she is constantly overwhelmed by all of her senses and how she has a hard time looking at people's faces because it's like taking ten thousand pictures. 

All of my life I've struggled with this characteristic. I've always referred to it as trying to drink from a raging river, because a firehouse is too tame a comparison. My senses don't seem to have a filter the way other people's do, I don't seem to have a ""background"" everything is always ""on""; I am always aware of the feel of everything I'm touching like clothing etc, I know my own heartbeat and can hear it constantly thumping, every conversation and sound around me is competing for my attention, I have a very complex sense of taste (which is awesome at least) and my sense of smell is ridiculous (like I found out one day that it is not normal to know who is pooping in the restroom with you at the office by the smell and women don't like it that you know when you know without being told that they're menstruating). I have very vivid sight and often see things that others don't, or long before they do (like a car coming to do something stupid, or some shady guys acting shady).  I got teary the first time I watched Limitless because it seemed like someone understood what I go through (I even get those horrible bouts of blackouts with missing time if I don't eat and keep up with sleep) even though it was portrayed positively in that movie. Sadly, I have such a monster rush of information I can't do most of the tricks with it that he can. 

Secondly, when I am conversing with people I get this massive amount of micro expressions in every second. I got really interested in Paul Ekman's work some years back (the guy Lie To Me is based on) because I was what he referred to as ""a natural."" Reading faces and body language is often overwhelming, and my biggest problem in relationships is making judgements about which of the hundreds of different emotions every second are the most important (I have learned that the ""last one"" before neutral is usually the more ""real"" one, but I still struggle a lot). I am incredibly empathic, often to a debilitating degree. 

It often takes an immense amount of concentration for me just to filter out the useless information I am flooded with, whereas it seems for most people that they struggle to pick up on the most obvious (to me) of details of their surroundings. It's utterly exhausting. And on top of that, at least once or twice a day when I let my guard down, I'll look at someone or someones and it's like my brain downloads this massive dump of perfectly captured information about the situation. Like ten thousand times more detailed and vivid than usually just glancing around. But it's not all sensory (like although I can picture it perfectly, I couldn't describe people's clothing) it's more like a complete snapshot of the universe, this massive sensory and empathic input, like I could sit and describe exactly how this person is. Sometimes it feels so intense I feel like I *am* that person for a few seconds after, like the only thing separating me from them is this thin veneer of our brains. The memory and effects lasts for hours and is super distracting. 

I also have a crazy gift for remembering the faces and body language of everyone I meet, and am frustrated often that I recognize someone but can't place where (and it's not imaginary, there's been a bunch of times we figured out something random like we were both at the same music festival or something) but this one is more of a useful superpower but I thought it was worth mentioning. 

I've read about autism and I don't seem to have any other characteristics, but I don't know anymore. I am successful and happy, I am very gifted socially, I can relate to people (too much sometimes), I don't have trouble picking out focal clues, etc. That's why I'm coming to you because like I said this is the first time I've had hope in years.

Because I'll be honest, when I heard that girl talking about those problems, I got teary-eyed. I've always wished there was some way I could tone it down when I wanted to, like a pill or a technique, because I've been completely on my own about this my whole life. Alcohol is the only thing that helps, but it gives me terrible tunnel ""vision"" and I generally find it unpleasant to be drunk. (The ironic possibility that this tunnel vision is more like ""normal"" people has not been lost on me.)

Sorry that this is long and rambley, I just don't know what to talk about. I want to ask questions, but I don't even know where to start. I guess, does this sound like something like autism, and does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do? Like more reading, resources, or drugs to help, or something. Anything. I've mentioned this to doctors during my life and they always just give me ADD drugs which do nothing for me. I don't want to say I'm desperate because I've taught myself to deal with this over my life, but I think if I found something that would help give me relief from this constant assault, I probably wouldn't be able to stop sobbing for days.

This works better than outside, because out there he just wants to keep going out to a busy road, not to mention the hills. 


It's his little sister's princess bike, complete with the picnic basket, purple streamers, but zero fucks given. It annoys the wife that it's indoors, but you have to take what you can get sometimes.


He's five, starting summer kindergarden in a few weeks at the local public school. He's been in early childhood programs since being diagnosed at two.  


He's mostly nonverbal, but can utter a few single words when prompted. Has a few behavioral and meltdown problems, but that seems to come with the territory. It makes me very sad when he's next to NT kids at the playground or whatever, and I see the milestones others have reached. I believe he comprehends a fair amount of things going on around him. He is in speech and occupational therapy, and swim class once a week.

Mainly I fear he will never be able to express himself verbally, and depend on me until I die. As he's growing, I worry a lot about what will happen when he gets bigger and I can't pick him up anymore and leave when it's necessary. It's overwhelming to think how difficult it will be for him to learn to read.

Later that night while I was watching TV, he brought me down a piece of paper and he wanted me to read it. He usually just writes nonsense, so without thinking I just started reading it. It said, ""I happy there like."" I couldn't believe it. He actually liked it, and wanted to tell me. I was the happiest I had ever been in my life. I was appreciated.

Kinda unsure of whether I should ask this but it's something that has been bugging me for a long time. I frequent anti-vaccine pages, to debate for vaccines, and am struck by how often the now debunked link between autism and vaccines is still brought up as proof that vaccines are bad for us. What is bugging me is that, even though this 'fact' is still brought up, it is rarely done so by someone who is actually affected by autism (from what I can see).

From posts I see here I think it's fair to assume very few here think there is a link. Is there some responsibility to tell vaccine deniers to stop using autism to further their agenda?

I watched that entire C-span thing with the panel talking about autism and it just pained me every time the scientists would say there wasn't  a link and 5 minutes later one of the panel members asked about vaccines.

My son has a book from his previous school that he made with his teacher that contains a picture and recipe of something they cooked each week. My son likes to look at this book every once in a while but is by no means attached to it.

I picked him up after work from my mum's house last week and he had been writing in his recipe book. He had written a date on most pages. I noticed that the date on the spiderweb cake page was near Halloween and the date on the easter cake was near Easter. Then I checked and found that the dates were all on a school day one week apart. He remembers the date on which he cooked each item. This book is from 5 years ago. 5 frickin' years. 

I asked him about it and in his one word responses he seemed to think it was no big deal. He just remembers. He has some other impressive talents and I've always thought he was amazing regardless but this one has finally popped my brain balloon! And the thing that gets me the most is what else does he know that I don't realise he knows?

Anyway, thank you for reading. It's oddly relieving to get this off my chest in a place where people might have similar experiences.

This month, I came across various blogs discussing autism. I gained enormous appreciation for the people who navigate its challenges, especially the families who sacrifice so much to help those on the spectrum. 

A few days a go, I submitted two links to this subreddit. I did so with a genuine aim to raise awareness in the general reddit community, but my methods lacked a delicacy that should come with any discussion of autism, especially from an outsider. Mods later informed me that others have been trolling r/autism this month with derogatory and otherwise insulting material, and this context likely made my posts even more hurtful.

Thankfully, mods have given me a chance to apologize to this courageous and fierce community. I'm sorry for any feelings I hurt, and I especially want to extend my very best wishes to you all on a campaign to raise awareness and acceptance for autism. I do not know anyone on the spectrum, and yet your efforts were able to impact me nonetheless.

Respectfully,

I was with Sarah and her dog, Jordan, in Chicago, when we decided to go into an independently-owned coffee shop named Cafe Descartes at 327 N. Michigan Avenue in Chicago. As soon as we entered the shop, the only employee there began shouting at us, asking us to leave and saying ""No pets! No pets!"" We attempted to explain our ADA protections and to show him the paperwork &amp; I.D. badge that we carry in Jordan's zippered vest, but the employee would not touch or look at the materials, nor would he listen to our explanations.

The employee placed a call to the store owner, who was in Rockford, Illinois at the time. After he got off the phone with the store owner, he told us that we could ""stay one-half hour only."" Again, I explained to him that we had the same rights as any other customer, and could stay as long as we chose to stay. I called the police non-emergency phone number and requested that they send out an officer for mediation.

After speaking to the employee, the officer showed us a bottle of ""Espresso Machine Cleaner,"" and explained that the employee told her that the chemicals were unsafe for pets. He said that the espresso machine was leaking. However, the floor was bone-dry when we entered the store and there wasn't a chemical smell that we could detect. Additionally, there were children present in the store. None of the children had been yelled at or asked to leave. I took a picture of the espresso machine cleaner bottle with my cell phone.

This morning, I realized that a police report had not been generated. I called to speak to the officer, Officer Rodriguez in the 1st District, to request a written report. She refused to write a report, saying that she ""did not know the brand name of the cleaner."" I am working with the Chicago Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities in order to get a written report.

By the way, the brand name of the espresso cleaner that purportedly excluded us from the cafe was ""Cora Clean.""

I worry about peak oil and the economy. Growing up, I played pokemon, and learned to read from an
early age. I enjoy long walks on the beach. I once wrote an article for my mother about men’s pocky. I
pick water types as my starters. I play with items off. I think pink is a manly color. I am a bronie. I am a
democrat. I am aware of all internet traditions. I make Chuck Norris jokes.
 
I am an autistic, and I am just like you.
 
I was diagnosed with Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome to be specific, when I was in the third grade. I don’t
remember exactly how I reacted to learning I was an autistic. I do know that I never made a big deal of
it, and found it all very silly. A vest for my fidgeting? Spending time with a lady with speech cards? I was
however glad to get out of the classrooms, and into special classes, until I learned what a living hell they
were later on.
 
But I’m getting ahead of myself, perhaps from a lack of a real point to start from. How does one define
living with autism? I can’t honestly say how different I would be if I wasn’t an autistic. All I know is that
one day I was defined as having Asperger’s Syndrome. A high functioning autistic, but still, it was yet
another brand. Not that I minded, I preferred being an outsider.
 
In fact, that has been the single hardest problem with me. As much as I try to be friendly with everyone
I meet, it is so hard to accept their viewpoints. “I am right, how can they believe such nonsense?” As
a result, I always tended to prefer adults, they knew what was up, and they didn’t bully. It was just so
frustrating being in such slow classes, dealing with such…well, at the time I considered most of my peers
to be utter morons. Obviously today I know that’s not true, but I was a kid.
 
I think I may have seen my diagnosis as a blessing under that logic. Finally, they would see I wasn’t part
of the herd of children and that I deserved respect! I have always wanted respect from adults more
than respect from children my age – which as a result made me grow up as a loner. I preferred going on
forums, playing an online game, or talking to my mom rather than suffer the idiocy of what my peers
enjoyed.
 
As an autistic, the single hardest thing to do is to understand. Understanding why your peers like what
they like, understanding that you are sometimes wrong, and understanding that school is important. A
wise man once said “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.” If you are an autistic,
you will probably find it absurdly difficult to understand why you have to do things. And if you are the
parent of an autistic, I’m sure you have torn your hair out over their dismissal attitudes and refusal to
do things they do not understand are important. As hard as it sounds to believe, I really didn’t believe
chores, school work, etc were important, simply because I did not understand why they were important.
 
Imagine it this way. A man comes up to you, and tells you to punch him in the face. When you ask him
why, he gives an explanation in a language you do not understand. That is what it is like to be autistic
and being told to do something you do not find important. Even I don’t really know how to handle this
 
problem, but the important thing is keep working at it. Eventually, you or your children will understand.
Perhaps you/they won’t understand why, but they will eventually understand that it is important, and
that will go a long way towards them complying.
 
Onto the next subject – bullying. Autistics are bullied. Especially in the lower grades. Most children
simply do not understand autistic children and will act accordingly. People are afraid of the unknown.
If you are an autistic child, it sucks, but you can’t avoid it. But please, do not let it keep you from trying
to make friends. I made that mistake, and there is a very noticeable void in my life caused by my lack of
relationships. Thankfully, it eventually ends, and you will get out of school one day. But just know, no
matter what you do, you will be bullied.
 
You cannot avoid this, and I beg of you, parents, not to put your children in a “special” program to try
and protect your autistic child if they are high functioning. They do not work. Autistics need to learn via
trial by fire how to deal with their peers, not how to deal with other autistics, which is actually harder in
many cases due to the even larger language gap. Plus, there is one large reason why I beg, not ask, but
beg you keep your children out of special programs – they are hell. The politicians, the councilors, they
will all try to convince you otherwise, but they are either misguided or lying to you.
 
Perhaps there are genuinely good programs for the autistic at your local school. It is possible, but highly
unlikely. I have been in quite a few such programs, including the BRIDGE program, which was supposed
to be among the best in the entire nation. By the middle of my first year there I was literally begging my
father to please make them put me back in the regular classes. “Special” programs are understaffed,
overstuffed, underbudgeted, and assigned teachers who are given insufficient training except on how
to restrain children. That was literally the only thing I ever saw them get right. Don’t take this the
wrong way – most teachers who are a part of such programs do care, but the reality is they are just
undertrained and understaffed.
 
Even if your child is a low functioning autistic, keep them out of public school programs. Unless it is
absolutely your last option, pull as many strings as you have to in order to get them into a private,
specialized school that has the resources required to properly taking care of your child. They will thank
you later. I hate to be so passionate about this, and I normally would say “do the research,” but I assure
you that placing your child in a special care program is among the worst possible options you have. If
it is an aid program designed to supplement normal classes, those actually work and are worth looking
into, but if they involve your child being placed into special classes and given a special routine, just stay
away.
 
Instead, try to get your child tools and accommodations to aid them. Typing accommodations, reading
accommodations, calculator accommodations, whatever it takes. Just, unless it is literally and absolutely
your last resort, do not put them into a special program. They are hell. I say this from experience.
 
Onto the next subject, autistics, don’t feel ashamed. Don’t feel alone. You are you, you are no less
important than anyone else, and never let anyone tell you otherwise. It will be hard. You will not
understand many things, and you will hear rumors and whispers behind your back from peers who
cannot understand. You may even be alone, and your parents might even give up on you. I was
 
fortunate enough to receive a lot of mental support, but it is a very real possibility to be alone in this.
 
It will probably get dark in your life. You will be confused. You may even think you are worthless. You
will feel lost, and that is ok. It is ok to feel lost and confused. But you aren’t worthless. No matter how
hard it can be to think otherwise, don’t give up. Find things you enjoy, and keep working at them. You
will eventually get good at them. It might take a short period of time. It might take years. But never give
up.
 
Finally, the last thing you need to know, growing up with or raising a kid with autism, is that it does
not make you different. Yes, it changes how you think, but you are still human. This is the single most
important thing to remember about autism – it does not make you more or less of a person.
 
In closing, no matter how bad things may get, never give up hope, never stop trying. Please, never
give up. There are people who care. There are people who are worth living for. For parents, never stop
trusting in your child. They are beautiful in their own right; you just have to learn to love them. And if
you’re reading this, trying to understand the portrait of an autistic, please don’t consider us freaks, or
outcasts. Don’t be afraid to meet us. Don’t be afraid to step to our aid. We are just like you. We live like
you, love like you, and laugh like you.
 
We are human too.

1336965269.0,26,self.autism,tlwod,So we had a meltdown tonight...,31,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/tlwod/so_we_had_a_meltdown_tonight/,"My 7yo had a meltdown tonight when we tried to go to a restaurant for Mother's Day dinner.  
We were with my wife's family and the place was so crowded that they had set up tents outside to hold the people waiting for tables. I was carrying her around outside and I could feel her getting tense with so many people around; but we played around some and she was laughing - she seemed fairly well adjusted...  
...until we tried to walk inside.  
It wasn't loud, but it was a little dark and pretty crowded - I got about 2 steps inside the foyer when she let out an ear-piercing scream (3 inches from my ear) and I had to stop and turn around and walk out.  
We went out to the sidewalk to calm down, but that wasn't happening.  
After 3 or 4 more screams and some pinching and kicking (again, while I'm holding her - she wouldn't let me put her down to talk) we decided it would be best to just skip the restaurant and head home.

I should mention here that my wife (and her whole family) is NT but I am not.  
Sometimes we differ in our reactions to these episodes - like tonight.  
If a meltdown isn't too bad, we'll often ""power through"" and get to a point where she will relax into, and usually enjoy, a new/scary/different experience. When it's bad we'll usually change the plan and find something else to do.  
Where we differ is typically in the assessment of how ""bad"" it is and ""why"".  

My wife tends to take a view that the daughter just ""doesn't want to"" and we shouldn't ""let her have her way"". That it's almost always better to ""power through"" and force her to confront her fears and deal with new experiences.  
I (and she) mean that in a much better way than it sounds.

That's what happened tonight. She said we shouldn't let her ""have her way"" but I vehemently disagreed - that this wasn't something that she was going to adjust to (crowded restaurant, new place, large-ish party with us), and it wasn't a good idea to try.  
She didn't seem like she was going to calm down very fast and I dislike making her *that* uncomfortable without a really good reason.  
I don't really care what other people think about her meltdowns and screaming but I thought it would be pretty rude to force that on a restaurant full of people trying to enjoy Mother's Day dinner - she can scream really, really loud.

My wife gave in but there was a heavy cost. She was really disappointed having to leave and cried (quietly) almost all the way home.  
The daughter thought she ruined Mother's Day for everybody and I think my wife is blaming both of us.  

My daughter even had the idea of having a ""restaurant"" at home and wanted to make menu's and everything. I told my wife I'd make her anything she wanted for dinner and we'd have a great time.  
She just cried and told us she wasn't hungry - then suggested I take the girl out for dinner someplace alone.

I'm heartbroken now. I feel like I failed my family on Mother's Day.

My wife won't talk to me; she's doing that stupid act where she pretends everything is fine.  
Sorry for the downer post, not really looking for advice; just wanted to rant.

**TL;DR: I think we screwed up Mother's Day and I'm sad. Sometimes this shit sucks (self-post; no karma)**

*EDIT/UPDATE: Well, wife really was pissed and thinks I handled it wrong.  
This morning she said she wasn't mad anymore and that just made it worse for me.  
I understand that she was disappointed but I don't think she has any cause to be ""mad"" about it.  
Now I'm more upset because I feel bad that the night was ruined and she was disappointed but I really think she's wrong and I have to advocate for my daughter - if it was just me, then I'd just let it go.  
So now she's stomped all over my triggers and I'm essentially non-functional today.  
Thanks for the input and support*

1376325502.0,29,self.autism,1k7rb6,"Meet my brother Jonathan. He is 24 years old and is profoundly autistic. He loves movies, musicals, G.I. Joe toys and Youtube. He is a marathon runner, and will run his 11th marathon this November in New York City. Check out his story!",34,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1k7rb6/meet_my_brother_jonathan_he_is_24_years_old_and/,"Meet my brother Jonathan.

Jonathan Brunot was born on March 14, 1989, a healthy child with an expressive personality. He was the youngest of three sons and as a baby he was very socially interactive with lots of eye contact, and his vocabulary built steadily as he began to learn to speak. However, when he was about 2½ years of age, he began to regress dramatically. His eye contact became non-existent and the few words and even phrases he had mastered in the previous months slipped away into completely non-verbal interaction. Jonathan was diagnosed as severely autistic, and the lives of the Brunot family changed dramatically from that moment.

Olga, Jonathan's mother, galvanized that family around the diagnosis. She approached Jonathan's autism in a powerful yet unique way that would become a consistent theme throughout Jonathan's development.

Jonathan wasn’t merely an “autistic” individual; collectively, they were an “autistic” family. 

Throughout Jonathan's development, this mantra was behind much of the decision making regarding finding the appropriate schooling and activities for Jonathan. Olga sought out as many special needs programs as possible.  As Jonathan went through his teenage years he was enrolled and engaged in a plethora of activities, such as horseback riding, swimming, and basketball, among others. The goal was to maximize Jonathan's opportunities in life and find his niche. Because of Jonathan's inability to proactively pursue new activities and endeavors, Olga took it upon herself to effectively “throw him in the deep end” and immerse him in EVERYTHING.

It was precisely this determination and persistence that prompted Olga to have Jonathan join a special needs running program called Rolling Thunder in 2007. The volunteer coaches at Rolling Thunder specialized in assisted running with the mentally disabled and they welcomed Jonathan with open arms.

When Jonathan first joined the running club he struggled tremendously. For the first couple of weeks, he could not run more than 10-15 yards without stopping, getting distracted, or wanting to lie down. In fact, Olga began running side by side with Jonathan, at times gripping his waistband to literally pull him along the trails. Despite 2 months of weekly practices, Jonathan was still not really grasping the concept of running. Olga, exhausted from pulling his weight and exasperated by his lack of progress, was ready to quit and move her son on to another activity.

Thankfully, the head coach of Rolling Thunder, Steve Cuomo, refused to allow Olga to give up on the process. He informed Olga that the point of the program was to keep pushing, even when the outcome looked bleak. It was that conversation and Olga's ultimate decision to continue with the program which led to the fateful day when Olga was introduced to a volunteer running coach named Vincent Del-cid.

Coach Vincent needed only one week to get Jonathan to finish a 3 mile trail without stopping. He saw potential in Jonathan and made it clear to Olga that he was prepared to commit to Jonathan's progress long term.

Over the next year, under Coach Vincent's weekly training, Jonathan underwent an amazing transformation. Physically, Jonathan lost around 25 pounds, as he became comfortable running longer distances and trained 3 times a week. He went from 15 minutes per mile (for a 5k race) all the way down to under 8 minutes! Socially, Jonathan was developing a clear love and passion for the sport of running. On “running” days, Jonathan would come from school happy and eager to put on his shorts and sneakers to go run with Coach Vincent.

Jonathan had found his niche; he was a runner and he loved to run.

After a year and a half of consistent training, Jonathan was running 5k and 10k races almost every weekend and the Brunot family was proud and excited to rally behind his accomplishments. However, Coach Vincent decided to REALLY up the ante.

Coach Vincent informed the family that he intended to train Jonathan to run and finish the ING NYC Marathon. He challenged that family to put their trust in him to help Jonathan successfully navigate 26.2 long, difficult miles across all the boroughs of Manhattan! Coach Vincent had already accomplished so much with Jonathan that this new goal simply became the next challenge.

On November 2, 2008 (at the age of 19) Jonathan completed his FIRST marathon in 4 grueling hours and 49 minutes and 8 seconds. He battled through cramps and frequent bathroom breaks to finally reach the finish line in Central Park with his family happily and loudly cheering for his accomplishments from the finish line bleachers.

Today, Jonathan Brunot is a charming, 24 year old, autistic marathon runner. He has 10 marathons and 1 ultra-marathon under his belt and is showing ZERO signs of slowing down.

Despite his incredible success as a runner, Jonathan's autism can still present tremendous difficulties. Jonathan can't regulate his bodily needs, so his coaches are always nearby to keep him well hydrated and help him replenish his electrolytes, as well as to deal with any of the potentially dangerous situations that can arise when running amongst tens of thousands of runners. In many ways, Jonathan's coaches take on the role of coach, parent, medic, nutritionist and special needs instructor each and every time they sacrifice their bodies to help him reach the finish line.

Yes, autism is a lifelong neurological disorder, but with lots of love, positive attitude and training, an autistic individual is only limited by the constraints that we put upon them. The joy and happiness that we experience as a family each time we see Jonathan run towards the finish line cannot be encapsulated in words.

Jonathan's running has given us a beautiful gift – an experience that galvanizes us around our champion and his triumphs. In essence, we are rewarded every time we see him put on his running shoes; beset by a gleaming smile and an eagerness to get out some of that boundless energy by running for miles and miles. 

Jonathan is my youngest brother. He could not speak or write this on his own so I had to speak for him. Jonathan inspires me each and every day... and he doesn't even know it! We don't care about his time or his pace; watching Jonathan run is one of the most fulfilling experiences of our lives, and we are simply overjoyed that he can keep this gift for as long as his legs can carry him.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_1k7rb6,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1k7rb6/meet_my_brother_jonathan_he_is_24_years_old_and/,

When she was 18 months she stopped talking to me. She never wanted to be held or touched, she screamed when her senses got overloaded - which was constantly. She got older, and things were ""better"" but hard. She received therapy every single day from 18 months to the age of 5. She was in a day program from age 2-5 where she got 8 hours a day of constant therapy. She went from a child who had to carry around a ""puke bag"" wherever she went because she would get so hysterical she would vomit, to a child who loves to hug her friends when they are sad. She went from a child who we were told would never go to ""regular"" class, to a child who is happily entering 2nd grade at the local elementary school ahead of her peers academically, and while she is called ""excessively shy"".. she manages to interact with her peers and participate in class. 

It makes me happy to hear other people say ""you would never know she has autism"". It makes me angry to hear people say ""Are you sure she is autistic? Because my [insert cousin, neighbor, friend's kid] has autism and they are so much worse than she is"". Then they list all the ways that child is autistic like it is a contest to see who is ""more autistic"". They ask ""Oh, she must have Aspberger's then"" .. no, she does not. She is autistic. And, while Aspberger's is on the spectrum, it isn't what she is. 

My kiddo has come a million light years from where she was, and I thank early intervention for that. But she still struggles every day. The world is black and white, and she doesn't understand that not everything is literal.  She is easily overwhelmed, especially with people. She gets obsessed over things and it is hard to redirect her. 

Why do people feel this need to make me feel like I have to explain my child to them? I try to brush it off and say that early intervention worked really well and we are happy with where she is at, but they still want to argue about it with me.

There is nothing good about autism. I can't make friends. I am drained doing the easiest things. I can't understand certain things. I stick out like a sore thumb everywhere I go.

I know, I know, it's kinda weird to ask people who have trouble connecting with others if they've had any trouble connecting with others. But a lot of us are tuned in to others in ways that may not make interaction easy, but leave us with a lot of insight.

She works with children on all levels of the spectrum, ages birth to twenty-one. She specializes in working with children who are non-verbal and utilize AAC devices, but has experience working with all ability levels as well.

She is currently working on a project (a presentation about visual supports which will be used to train other professionals), and as part of that project would like ideas for example visual supports. Rather than making up supports that will never be used, we thought it would be a neat idea to see if there is anyone on /r/autism who is in need of a visual support or two for their child. She's open to doing just about anything (social stories, visual schedules, basic communication boards, etc.). 

If you'd be interested, you can just PM me (or respond publicly) and let me know a little about your child (can be completely anonymous, of course, if you prefer) and what they need a visual support for (e.g. you're having a difficult time with dinner, or grocery runs, or getting them to request a snack they like, etc.)

Obviously there is a disclaimer attached to this that she is not providing professional services in any way, and if you need more than a basic example support you should of course seek help from a professional in your area.

In addition, the examples she creates will be used as part of a public presentation, although obviously she will not be discussing where they are inspired from or any other personal details that you may choose to share with her.

Don't get me wrong - I have more asshole stories than I'd care to count and it still gets to me in a big way when it happens but for those of you who haven't experienced the other side of the coin, I thought it might help to at least be aware of its existence. For the record, I have Asperger's and my boy is at the 'low-functioning' end of the autism spectrum.

I take my son to our local main st shopping area a lot and when he was younger and not very skilled yet with communication, he'd get very frustrated and have meltdowns and the assholes would inevitably glare, mutter and scold. It's the kind of area where you tend to see the same people all the time. 

One evening when he was about three-and-a-half I took him to a favourite restaurant of mine on the main st. As I was having my coffee at the end of the meal, a man from the table opposite came over. He said to me, ""I've seen you around here quite a lot. It's great that you can bring your son to a restaurant. Our son is 9 and we still can't really do that. Anyway, I just really wanted to say to you that I know you struggle but you're doing a *great* job. You're a *good mum*.""  That one brought tears to my eyes. Who'd have known - some of the people looking at you in public are looking on with compassion, not contempt.

I've also had two instances of people coming over and offering help mid-meltdown, rather than offering unsolicited parenting advice. I'm really hoping some of you out there have some similar experiences to share.

Last year he started school after the winter break, and he was in a small class, out of our district, with a couple other young children with various disabilities.  He did really well, loved school, and it seemed to help him a lot.  His language expanded and he improved his motor skills a bit.  For this year he was transferred to another district and placed in a normal Head Start program with a class of 17-18 neurotypical kids.  I was getting close to calling up the school and having a meeting to see what could be done, because I've noticed he is much more upset and agitated this year compared to last.  I felt it was just far too much for him.  But then his speech therapist called me up yesterday and said that while the state requires a ""try and see how it works"" approach to see if kids can handle a regular setting, it's not working at all for my son and the poor little guy cannot learn anything because he's so overwhelmed by the other children and the fact that his class moves at a pace much faster than he can handle.  Starting November 5th he will be moved to a special education class in our own district, and he will get daily speech therapy instead of once a week.  The other children will be more like him and the class will move at a pace he can handle.  I am just so happy right now, and relieved that the schools and staff (therapists from both districts met) have worked together and come to the conclusion that this is best for him, without me having to make all kinds of demands.  With a lot of frustrations day to day, I just had to share my happiness with some folks who might understand!  My little guy does enjoy school, it just has to be in the proper setting for him instead of everything just blowing past him and leaving him behind.

We went to a local ice cream and burger joint and everything went fine during our dinner. When we got our ice cream he got a little excited and started running around. I would get up from our table and ask him to come back. He always listens if I try and have fun with him. I try to never force him to do anything because a sudden change like that causes him to throw pretty massive fits. 

I got up a few times and was thinking of getting a high chair (he's three) when an old man starts scolding me. He asked, ""What's wrong with you?!"" I stopped and said, ""My son is autistic"" In his old crotchety age he asks me to repeat myself so I shout ""MY SON IS AUTISTIC."" Now that everyone is looking he says, ""Oh, well, you shouldn't take him out."" ""What do you expect me to do, lock him in the house?"" To which he replies, ""You shouldn't take him here."" 

Now, let me remind you that this little burger place is not exactly a four star restaurant. At this point he tells me to go away to which I reply, ""You stopped me, you better be prepared for what I have to say."" I storm off and get my things from the table. My face is flushed red with color and I felt like I'd never be that embarrassed again. I can't stop my tears, my shoulders were shaking as I wept. The manager stops me and asks me if I'm okay. I pointed at the old man and said, ""ASK HIM!"" (Pretty dramatic I know, but I was very emotional.)

I went outside, loaded my son into his car seat and wept for a sold ten minutes. I thought to myself, ""Does my son need a mom who weeps when someone tries to make us feel bad for his diagnosis or does he need a mom who stands up for him to even the most ignorant of people?"" After a few minutes old man river comes out with his wife and gets into his car. As he backs out I step out of my car and wait for him to see me. When he does he sees that I've been crying my eyes out and starts to roll down his window to apologize. I pointed my arm towards the exit and said, ""Go, just go. GO!"" and I stared him down until he and his wife couldn't crane their necks any longer. I figured I made him feel bad enough. I mean, I'm not going to cuss out an old ignorant man and his wife. I'd be just as bad as they are.

I don't know how many people have to go through this kind of thing. I hope no one does. As I got back into my car a woman came outside with red eyes and tears down her face. She said she saw the whole thing and asked if she could help. I still hadn't completely calmed down but I smiled and said you can't really do anything. I didn't even know what to do. I told her I was happy that at least some people have compassion. She was so nice and told me that a friend of hers has an autistic grandson. She made sure I knew about our local events and awareness groups for families of autistic people. We hugged and I climbed into my car. 

As I drove down the street trying not to cry I realized she never told me her name. I don't know why but this sticks out in my head the most. I wish I'd gotten her email or something. People like that are too nice to just walk away from. Especially if they are active enough go on autism awareness walks with her friends.

David is 10 and is one of the lights of my life.  When he was in second grade he was evaluated for speech therapy and slipping grades.  Over the last few years we've seen autism curb his growth more and more...

Public school hasn't provided what he needs so my wife has stopped working and is a stay at home - home school teacher for him now.  She works so hard.  The time and attention has really allowed David to soar and he's working at grade level despite his disadvantages.

He is so sweet, so loving, a pure innocent wonderful boy.  He works so hard.  He gets so frustrated.  It's so hard to watch him struggle but I'm so proud of how much he has managed to accomplish.

He's akward, he's difficult to understand.  He's tall for his age and while very functional he is obviously different when observed with a group.

Last night I picked him up from soccer practice.  As he came walking across the field I could see his eyes were red and he was crying.

""What's wrong buddy?""

""They were making fun of me, even the girls.""

""Oh sweetie, I'm sorry...""

""I was telling them to stop teasing me, I was telling them I have autism but they couldn't understand me because I was crying...""

""Come here buddy."" &lt;hugs&gt; ""I'm sorry they were being mean to you.""

""Coach made them stop.  He told them what autism is.  He told themI have it.""

""Yeah, because you were crying and you couldn't?""

""Yeah.""

""Well, maybe they won't be so quick to tease you next time.  You know there's nothing ""wrong"" with you David.  Autism just means you're not wired the same way as everyone else, you're just different, not worse, not better.""

""I know, but they still make fun of me...""

""Sweetie, they are kids and they don't understand.  When kids don't understand something, or it's different they make fun of it, I wish it wasn't that way.""

""Yeah...they say I'm dumb and they call me stupid.""

""You know that's not true, all they are doing is showing you how stupid *they* are by saying that kind of thing.  You're very smart.  All kinds of people have autism.  Doctors, laywers, software developers, fire fighters - being different doesn't mean your dumb.  They're wrong.""

""Will I have autism when I grow up?""

(my heart collapses into a cold ball as hard and dense as a singularity in the center of a black hole.  I manage to keep the quaver from my voice and the tears from my eyes)

""Yes sweetie.  It's not something that goes away.  But!  As you grow up we're going to teach you to cope with it.  We're going to help you understand it.  So long as you keep working hard you'll be just fine, autism or no autism.  Most people don't have to do all this extra work, they have it easy, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.  Mom and I will be here to help though, I promise.""

""Yeah...""



It's hard being an autism parent.  As I talk to and comfort my son this way I'm watching the other kids running across the field, getting picked up by their parents.

This is the part you're going to hate me for.

There's this one little girl - Sarah on David's soccer team.  I've seen her tease him.  I've heard her say cruel things.  I've seen David blow her off and go on about the game having fun.

I've seen the way she skips across the field, fluid and confident.  She has grace and mind that runs like a finely tuned machine and no conscience or humility at all.

Compared to my lumbering, shuffeling, mumbling boy with such a sweet pure heart and some bad wiring/programming that traps him like a prisoner in his own body.

And I wish and I hope and I pray that Sarah's children have autism.

I want her to spend the first 20-30 years of her care free life in cheerleading, playing soccer, getting good grades and being popular.  She'll go to a good school and get a good education.  She'll start a good career and meet a nice husband.  She'll have a beautiful baby, she'll have everything in the world...until she gets a note from the teacher in second grade.

I want her broke because she can't work and has to care for her children.  I want her tired from working two jobs so her husband can stay home and takre care of them.  I want her to have to spoon feed her child EVERY SINGLE FUCKING BITE OF THEIR FOOD FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIES!  I WANT TO HEAR THE CRACK AS THE STONE OF HER HEART SHATTERS WHEN SOME LITTLE BITCH CALLS HER CHILD A FREAK.  I WANT HER TO FEEL THE BLACK HOLE IN HER HEART WHEN HER CHILD ASKS HER IF THEY WILL HAVE AUTISM WHEN THEY GROW UP.

I'm sorry.

Autism Spectrum Disorder, through my eyes.
Dear Shopper,

Yes, I know. I’m well aware that my child is screaming. Not just a regular scream, but an ear-piercing, sanity-shattering screech. Even if I wasn’t seeing and hearing it, I would know by the expression on your face.

Clearly, you have raised your children better than me.

That is what you were wanting to say, right? There certainly can’t be any other purpose to you stopping in your tracks to stare or elbow your companion or better yet — give knowing looks to other shoppers passing by.

I have no doubt that you have wonderful, well-behaved children. Grown, tax-paying, law-abiding citizens who would never have dreamed of screaming like this in public when they were children. Judging by your expression and utter exasperation, you’ve never hesitated to let them know who was boss.

And I know that you did your best with your children, that you loved them, and want all children to have a solid upbringing in which to start their lives. You are, in all probability, a good person. You probably don’t mean any harm.

This is what complicates what I want to say to you. Because, despite my anger towards you, I happen to have been raised well too. I don’t want to be ugly, even though right now I feel like it.

Because I know some of that anger is misdirected. It is misdirected because I, too, have stood in judgment of someone like me. I, along with almost everyone, have stood in public and watched a scene like this one play out and thought to myself, “Clearly she has no control over her children. When I have children, mine will never behave like that.” I, like most people, wasn’t quite as obvious about it as you. I didn’t stare or make comments that could be heard. But I was every bit as decided. So, some of my anger is really directed toward Human Nature, who refuses to be put in its place.

The nice thing about human nature, however, is that it can be overridden. And all it takes is but a single experience, a single human interaction, to the contrary of your own strongly held convictions. Then presto whammo — you are a new and hopefully improved person.

Let me introduce you to my child. Like you, I marveled at the miracle of life upon becoming his mother. Like you, I rocked, burped, and inhaled his sweet baby scent and thanked God over and over for the gift of him. Like you, I had certain dreams for my child. There your path and my path diverged somewhat.

My precious child is autistic. Yes, I’ve seen Rain Man, and, no, my son is not likely going to be a great card counter. The truth about autism is that it encompasses a wide spectrum of abilities. And, like you and me, every autistic child who has it is different from the next. Yet they do often share some similar traits – sensory overload and meltdowns are one of them.

Every person on the planet has what I think of as an internal alarm system. Most of us have ours in good working order. But some people with autism have what I like to call a hair-trigger alarm system. Theirs can go off with what seems to average folks like little to no provocation. There IS always provocation. Non-autistic people simply aren’t as sensitive to seeing and hearing the triggers, and that’s when the alarm goes off. And when it does, it’s loud. Everyone in the vicinity wants nothing more than to have it turned off, including the people who love them. When you see me “placating” my child and “giving in” to his tantrum, I’m really just desperately looking around for the alarm key or trying to remember the right code to turn off that blaring alarm. It isn’t his fault. And, no matter how upsetting it is for you, let me assure you it is that much more upsetting for him.

I’m sorry that you haven’t had quite as pleasant of a shopping trip as you had anticipated. It hasn’t been so pleasant for me either. Problem is — I have to feed my family, deposit my paycheck, pick up prescriptions, etc. just like you do. And, unfortunately, no one arrived at my house today to watch my child so that his autistic behavior wouldn’t upset anyone in public. I have to leave the house and so does my child. Because I have to teach him about the world. I have to let him practice controlling his alarm system. So that he, too, can possibly be a productive citizen making come true all those dreams I had for him when he was so small.

With so many advances in early detection and therapy, many of us will be able to see most of those dreams come true for our unique children. And for some of us, our dreams will have to change for our children. We may need to re-define happiness and success. For life is like that. We constantly have to reevaluate our expectations of ourselves, others –and, sometimes, even the grocery store.

I’m hoping that your single human interaction with me has given you an opportunity to be a better person. For, with 1 in 91 children being diagnosed with autism now, you are going to have a lot more opportunities to make a positive impact in the life of someone like me. All it would take would be a smile, a pat on the back, or a “Bless your heart, honey, hang in there” to refill a stressed out parent’s reserve of patience and calm. You could be the bright spot in our day. And, then, if you want, you are welcome to ask all the questions you want. Your curiosity doesn’t offend me in the least. Most of us aren’t the least bit upset to talk about our kids – any more than you are. If anything, it is an opportunity to educate and dispel myths.

And, maybe, just maybe, you will be standing there when the alarm gets turned off. Maybe you will get to see what every mother wants the world to see – the wonderful personality of her child, in our case hidden behind a mask of fear, anger and frustration.

Who knows? Maybe I’ll get to see the one hidden behind yours.

Please read.,21,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fnmtw/i_need_help_please_read/,"Recently I've entered a relationship with a wonderful woman who has a 4 1/2 year old song with autism, and a neuro-typical 2 1/2 year old daughter. They are living with me and I have become a de-facto father-figure. I love them and their mommy very much.

My problem is that I have some severe anger issues when dealing with the autistic boy. I'm much older than my girlfriend, and I have a son from a previous marriage who is grown and married himself. My parenting days with him are long in the past, and I've forgotten how hard small children are to manage. But the boy's autism is something I'm apparently not able to deal with positively. He's constantly demanding, whining, manipulative, combative, impulse-driven, and obsessive. He will have periods of being the boy that both I and his mother want him to be: sweet, loving, able to listen and follow our instructions. But they seem to be few and far between, bookmarked by repeated, obsessive demands for whatever his whim is at the moment and combative meltdowns when not immediately given to him.

Given the fact that I'm upset at my failure to positively deal with this today and the anger of my girlfriend at me for it, the above description of the problem may be more dire than it actually is. The bottom line is, I have to gain some tools to deal with my anger and resentment issues towards him and some positive parenting skills for a special needs child like him. I just have no idea where to go or what to do, because me drawing on my earlier parenting experience is woefully inadequate.

I really didn't knew where to post this, and this is difficult for me, but here we go.

I always was different. Since i was a month old, my parents knew there was something wrong. I was crying non-stop. They didn't knew what to do with me, I didn't wanted to be hugged, held or talked to. I only cried a lot and contact with my parents made it even worse.

I behaved very odd during my childhood, always making myself an outcast. I was always on my own.
I had done some really odd things, and I could never be reasond with.
I started to talk in my self, making up a world out of the books I read, or the few movies I saw.
I really read a lot of books back then.

When I was 7, my mother brought me to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with ADHD and Borderline.
I didn't even made eyecontact with te man, too cought up with the pictures hanging in the room.
Sinds then I always have been having medication and therapy.
At later age, the same man said I was having schizophrenia, and was mentally undeveloped for 3-5 years, depents on the aspect. (this I do believe in)

At school I was bullied at. Since I can remember, I always was an outcast, never had friends and always been bullied at at school.
Long time (although I don't remember much of that time)
When I was 18 I moved to another school, and for the first time, I was not bullied at.
I did not knew how to act. It was a whole new world to me, people acting nice at school.

School and work (I have worked at age 16-18) where war-zone's for me. It felt that way.
There was noise, people laughing, kouching, talking, yelling, looking, moving. There where always threats I saw, and there where huge fears.

I was trapped inside my mind. My mind always becomes a thick white fog, where everything goes slower, on schools and workplaces. It also happens on crouded area's and occasualy at home.

I can not talk in that state. Nor can I process anything or really do something.
It is still very annoying, and I get frustrated when and after it happens.

Anyone who reconizes this?

I have been having these destructive moods lately, and now I have medication what really helps. When I'm having such a mood, I am so sad, angry and frustrated that I yell at some one, or I start hurting myself.
Afterwards I am cleaning up the mess I made, am very ashaimed. I am not the girl who is showing her self in those moods.

There are moods where I only am able to think that I must die, or be gone or be hurt. And it does not always ends well then.

2 years back, I was admitted to a mental hospital, because I was very suicidal. It also had an good side, there I was diagnosed with autism, and a year later, I was admitted to a facility, designed to help people with autism, to give them support for work and a home.

A lot of us go to an more independed home, some of us go to a long term living form, where you have your own apparement with help.

I might sign up for that.

Now I have activety's on the terrain, and therapy's.
There are nurses here at this unit, and I have been having more contact than ever.
I am happy here, and that never happened, I can find peace and quitness here, and structure.
Things are finally good, the fog keeps appairing lesser, the Darkness also does. (my moods and depression, I like to call it Darkness) 


Another thing, I wrote back earlier, that at some point, I started talking in myself a lot. 
Since I was 15, I started doing this in English, a foreign language, and I still do it a lot, sometimes even in public.

Anyone who reconizes this?

This was most of my story, I wanted to share this with you, because I could not simply ask the question before you knew my story.

I was posting on different subreddit's, until I thought it might be easier if I just told everything on one subreddit, instead to post bits and pieces on a lot of subreddit's.

I'll hope you forgive my bad English, and if you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

Update 1: 
Hi, I e-mailed the tekst to my 1st nurse here.
We talked for what seemed like a whole morning and we are going to look on until january, and then we look further.
I emailed a really messed up letter, I was a bit confused and sad.
Thanks for all the help!

Update 2:
Hi, a small update. I get an intake at a supportive housing home. It is quite scary, and good at the same time. The nurses say that they finally see what I am capable of, and they say that all these years I have been overasked, always too much pessure. I thought about it and I understand it. Until my 18th nobody knew what autism was, so everyone asked a lot of me. And this year in this facitity, I finally saw that nobody wants to put pressure on me anymore, they actually want me to be happy!
I never saw that.
I am going to focus on beeing happy now. Now, I have a lot of therapy and no responsibility's anymore.

They mean well but even his kindergarten teacher last year called attention to it.  She decided it would be ok tell the class that ""we even have an autistic student in here"" as part of her presentation.  She didn't say it was my boy but it didn't take a genius for the parents present to do the math.  We had 2 different parents come up to us at different times to tell us how great my boy is 'doing'.  Since it is awareness month or worse, Autism Week, people feel it is ok to bring it up.

I hate doctors, I hte hospitals, I hate the public transport I have to take there. I can't speak well enough to hold a conversation.

A trip to the hospital usually goes like this: 'name' *goes in little room, hands over little statement clarifying situation attached to insurance info, waits* 'Please rate your pain' 'I can't' *friend/family explains I really can't, nurse gets agitated, I melt down, friend talks nurse out of sending me to psychiatric, nurse makes up a number* Scenarios like this continue the whole time. People keep trying to talk to me, ask questions I quite literally can't answer, and everytime it has been an absolute miracle for me to actually make it through to getting care and beyond a miracle they let me leave at the end.

I don't know what to do. I don't even know where to begin, it'd take me a week or more to prepare for even the bus ride, and I've only got a few days.

They're hidden, just below the surface. Unless you knew me really well, you probably wouldn't know I was autistic. Most people just think I'm quirky because I'm brilliant. I'm not so sure I'm brilliant, but that's what people have always said.

Yet, I have a lot of problems every day. I have terrible anxiety when I'm around other people (except a handful), and I have a bit of a panic attack or meltdown when it comes to having certain responsibilities (needing to be somewhere at a certain time, things like that). 

Currently, I'm nearly finished with my BS in computer programming from an online college, but I feel like the knowledge of my field is subpar. Though I try to improve, I'm completely devoid of guidance and this limits me greatly. I have not been able to find the help I need, and I'm scared I won't be able to work the job anyway.

I know that I am unable to work other jobs. I have tried a great deal of them and nearly all of them have ended on the first day, usually with a panic attack. 

I've been lucky enough to be approved for SSID, but it's not nearly enough money. I have the cheapest apartment I could possibly find, but I need to get out of here. There's noise all the time and there are people all around, just on the other side of these thin, un-insulated walls. Rent, electricity, and internet, a few miscellaneous bills total about the same amount as my income. 

I just want to live a normal life. I want my own home, one that I'm comfortable in, and I want to pay my own bills and I want enough money left over to pursue my interests. How on earth can I make it happen?

I can't be the only one with these problems. On this subreddit, I often see thread after thread about parents asking for advice for their autistic children. Where are the autistic adults?

The following is an excerpt from [the musician's response](http://tylergregorymusic.com/fr_journal.cfm):

&gt; It was an ordinary day, walking to my regular spot to busk when I don't have a gig that night, and play music on the corner for a rotating crowd. When Jacob came over I felt excited about having another kid listen to the music. (Makes my day when kids dance to the music on the street... I already had a couple come over that day so it was already nice). However, unlike most kids that come up to me with curiosity, I felt so much energy coming off of him and I was completely overwhelmed. His hand on my leg was very powerful and about brought me to tears while playing. Not because he is blind or autistic.. but because of a connection I have never felt and one that is impossible to explain. Honestly, a feeling that came from my toes all the way up my body and surrounded me. I can't begin to explain it. I want to try to put it into words, but there is no way to tell how powerful his energy felt.

Background: I am a high school senior at a school for students with autism. I am in the gifted/college-bound track (gifted programs within special-ed are rare, at least in the US, so I'm pretty lucky in that regard). My friends and I were complaining about some speech someone gave where they kept talking about how people 'suffer' from autism. While I do know that there are a lot of people who **do** suffer on a daily basis, the general consensus among my friends was that we, in many ways, do not suffer in not only does it give us a unique perspective on things, but thanks to early intervention we have had many opportunities (small school, therapy, integrated social skills curriculum) that the vast majority of K-12 students in the US don't get. 

So, we want to have shirts made. We're selling them right now with on-demand printing, but to lower the price and increase the quality we're having them bulk printed soon once we get enough investors.

I realize that the way we've worded the slogan will offend some people because it seems like such a blanket statement. It has been suggested to me that we change it to ""I don't suffer from **my** autism..."" but this doesn't have the same ring to it in my opinion.

Does anybody have any suggestions for a better way to phrase this sentiment before we bulk print them?

Also: We want to donate proceeds to an autism-related charity. However, I do not want it to be a cure-oriented one such as Autism Speaks. Does anybody have a suggestion of a charity/research organization that could use the funds?

Thank you for your help, Reddit.

I guess what I'm saying is that I don't know any other way than having a sibling with autism (he still lives at home, and we grew up together), and to me, he is person who just can't talk, has poor impulse control, and gets anxious in public sometimes. Of course, it's more than that.

What are your experiences with siblings with autism? Do they speak? Are they older or younger than yourself? Do you feel like people underestimate their ability to comprehend the world around them? Did you ever get into any fights sticking up for them as a kid? What things could you not do because of their autism, and what things did you make sure you could do?

I remember once we took my brother to the movie theater to see Cats &amp; Dogs because he loves animals (those are some of the words he can say, as well).

Obviously this is frowned upon by reddits basic suggestions on how to act on this site and in this /r/. I have seen completely legitimate responses, suggestions and general feedback on some very important and valuable comments buried to oblivion leaving it up to the user to search and travel to get to the meat and bones of the comment.  
My ultimate goal here as a moderator is to provide users with a valid and valuable place to come and seek information, idea's and more importantly, support. It is obvious to me, as I have been using this site for well over 5 years, that people do not follow guidelines and use the voting system properly. On a smaller scale, we as a group and I as a moderator can alter or better our little slice of the reddit pie. I have reached out to the /r/ before in asking for feedback on what you think. That is the purpose of this post. I would like plus and negatives to make it so that you can NOT downvote comments. All reporting of spam and vulgar postings would still apply and removal of trolling for emotional comments from others will not be tolerated. I would rely on users to help me with this, as they currently do. Tell me what you think, or if I am just trying to reinvent the wheel.  

On a different note, I have noticed a great increase in the trolling accounts and the ban list for this subreddit is growing much larger in the last few months. There have been large groups and whole /r/'s that dedicate themselves to trolling other /r/'s and the users to instigate arguments and emotional responses. I personally go through MANY posts and comments just to keep an eye out for these ""people"" so I can protect others from the horrid things they say. Most of the time I catch them, but some slip through. I'm sorry if you or your post was bitten. Again, help me or the other mod's by reporting them. Use your judgement and I will do my best to keep it under control. If you can message the mod's, that would be helpful as well. If its painfully obvious as to the violation, no need to tell us.  
Thanks gang.

I typed up a long post explaining everything in detail, but lost it with a chrome crash. I'll go through the basics and hope it makes sense.

In April this year I bought my first house, and it's just ideal. I'm not on a lot of money and I needed a two car garage for my main car and a Camaro I've been restoring for ten years. The people are great, the neighbours are great, the location is fine and I could afford it with help from my parents.

In the middle of September I came home from work and found an old ford fairlane parked in my garage. Neighbours told me it belonged to the guy two houses up (where there's no garage, just a driveway into the back yard). It turns out the owner is autistic, in his 40s, and had been in hospital since before I moved in. He'd only just come home again where he lives with his parents. He owns the fairlane but doesn't drive it on the road (it's unregistered) and it used to belong to the previous owner of my house (I'll call him Mr C) who let him have it after he got too old to drive it. The previous owner had also let him park it in the garage for more than fifteen years.

Short story is I couldn't get the guy to move his car, he kept falling back on having permission from Mr C and it needs to be garaged or it'll rust, so I had a couple of mates help me move it to his parents front lawn and I locked my garage. The autistic guy had a major meltdown over that and for two days we had wailing and yelling and I'd find the fairlane parked in my driveway or in front of my house. Autistic guy was hanging around my garage trying to get in to put his car away. His parents are kind and good people, so after talking it through with them and another couple of neighbours, I relented and let him park the fairlane in my garage again for a while. They said it'd give them time to fix things and settle their son down. Several times a day for more than a month he's been checking in my garage windows to see his car is still there, but he isn't a problem other than that.

Now it's Sunday the 28th October, and on Tuesday my Camaro is being delivered to my new place after all its bodywork has been done, and I need the fairlane out of there. The fairlane's owner or his parents haven't found a solution about the car, and I'm offside with two other neighbours who think I'm being selfish wanting to get it out because I'm single with two cars, and there's a lot of tension in the neighbourhood. My direct neighbours on both sides think the fairlane should be towed and scrapped or at least locked back in the owner's back yard under a car port where it'd been while he was in hospital. Before all this happened I'd been ignorant of autistic people, so I've been googling myself mad trying to figure out a solution. From what I can tell this guy depends on routine and one of the strong parts of his revolves around owning that car and keeping it garaged in my garage. Without that, he's a problem his elderly parents can't cope with. With it, he seems to get on well with most of the neighbourhood and they can all live together peacefully.

I have to get his car out and this problem solved by Tuesday lunchtime. Help, reddit, I'm at a loss. Legally I know I fully have the right to have the car towed, and it may be scrapped as it's a wreck and its registered owner (the guy who used to own my place) is dead. If I do that it's going to give the autistic guy's parents all kinds of problems they haven't had for fifteen something years, and make two sets of neighbours hate me. If I leave it there I'm defeating the purpose of the house I bought. I don't have the knowledge or skills to work around this guy, and from what I can glean online that's the essence of his parents' problem too.

What's the ethical and right thing to do here? What can I do to change autistic guy's habits?",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_1278lc,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1278lc/looking_for_sensitive_solution_to_issues_with_an/,

I am verbal but my sensory problems put me well into the autistic category. While I can, under certain circumstances appear ""normal"" I have a hard time maintaining that act when my sensory system is being challenged. 

I have a service dog. After learning all the weird things he needs to do for me on a daily basis, he is now being trained to accompany me out in public. Kind of backwards compared to most service dogs, but an Autism service dog is not like most service dogs. Yesterday, we were working on training him to get me out of a crowded building on a cue so that I will feel more confident in public. When my system gets overtaxed I will sometimes have sensory meltdowns or sensory storms where my brain stops being able to process incoming information. When that happens I stop being able to understand the world around me, I can no longer read, talk or understand how to navigate the isles in the grocery store.

Yesterday when I was out training my dog I happened to walk past a bell ringer outside a store, actually several times as we were working on having him get us outside on a cue. The guy was pretty outgoing and was giving out loud Merry Christamses to everyone that walked near him. On about the 5th or 6th pass I once again said ""Merry Christmas"" back to the guy and he basically gave me a ""there you go"" since I guess I finally said it loud enough that he could hear me. At first I was just a little irritated. First at myself for acting in a strange manner and then at him for treating me like a kid and giving me an ""atta boy"". I am, very obviously an adult, with wrinkles to prove it. 

I guess his response, which wasn't all that out of the ordinary, hit a bit of a nerve for me. In public situations, I've been accused multiple times of being aloof or downright rude since I make very little eye contact passing people (even friends and acquaintance) and have a hard time responding to simple hellos. I've pissed so many people off who seem to think it is their right to get outraged by what they assume is my rudeness. I've even had people come up to me and chew me out publicly. I thought the confrontations might ease up as I got older since people wouldn't see me as a kid anymore and think it was their right to ""teach me manners"". I guess the take home for me on this is that it will keep happening and that I'm going to keep offending people who don't know better. 

If you have read this far, the information I would like to offer to you is that there are people, some may have autism and some may have other issues, that find it hard when they're already overstimulated from a sensory perspective (from being out in public in a crowd with weird lighting or lots of noise etc) to simply navigate and put one foot in front of the other in stores, office hallways, etc. If they seem off or aren't friendly to you, don't take it personally. They might not even be in a bad mood or be having a bad day, they may just have a disability that makes it difficult to behave in the way you think is appropriate.

If you would like, you can share my story. I am one of the few in the autism community that is not qualified as being Aspergers who is verbally articulate. I know I am not the only one on the spectrum who has run into these types of situations.

My younger brothers, all of them, knew that nobody was allowed to touch her because she was too small. But when she was about 3 months old, my brother, diagnosed as PDD-NOS, got upset. He decided to take Calie, put her in a pillowcase (he was afraid of getting scratched), climb to the top of his closet, and drop her. He put her back into the bathroom where we'd been keeping her since she was still small, and we found her hurt about ten minutes later. We rushed her to the emergency vet where they pronounced her dead, with bruised lungs and a punctured heart. We didn't find out what he did until hours later when he finally told us.

My mother and I have had a hard time dealing with this. She's been worse off than me. She's taken up fostering kittens to cope, and she's doing an amazing job. We recently took in 4 kittens, all less than 3 weeks old.

My brother keeps trying to touch them and play with them and screams and acts out when we won't let him. He doesn't understand that he can't touch any of the cats because of what he did to Calie. He has also kicked my full grown cat (about a year old) when he's upset. I'm not sure how to deal with him and it's really frustrating.

And I am a 17 year old guy who just found this today, and I want to share my mind, my life, and my stories with you. I guess this could also be an AMA since i'm sure you will have questions.

To start off I will begin with how I was brought into this world, April 16th 1995, my mother is in the hospital. The doctors gave her too much anesthetic while she was in labor. She went unconscious, the doctors rushed an emergency C-section and I was without oxygen for over a minute. My parents are both small, with my dad being 5 foot 6 and my mom being 5 foot 2, but I was still small even for that. As time went on I developed extremely fast though my early childhood, beginning to speak extremely early, with full sentences, I read many many books, and was constantly asking my parents while we were out driving pointing to signs asking ""whasat say?"" I am an extremely picky eater. And for YEARS we were told I was quirky, I would grow out of it. etc.  I frequently would simply cry, scream, and not want to do things. with my parents having virtually zero clue as to why.

Fast forward to around age 6, i went to a daycare center and would frequently play with legos, building blocks, Lincoln logs etc. I played games on the computer and handheld games like Bop It! I was fascinated with the plastic shapes they had. I forget the name of them. But they are a famous series of shapes that can be connected to form countless patterns. I would arrange these in patterns for hours on end to myself, and get extremely upset if someone wanted to join in themselves and would do it wrong.  My dad had started to become fessed up with my eating behaviors and started to force it (parents, please don't do this ever. it makes the experience terrible) I was told almost daily I couldn't go to school, I would get things taken away unless i cleaned my plate, or bowl of cereal etc. This continued from about age 6 to around age 10. We finally got to see some sort of doctor who simply told him to not ever force me to eat something. But he has maintained this ""Ill do it myself cus I know how to fix him"" mindset, and it's miserable. 

Oddly even during my early elementary school years I either brought my own food from home (a peanut butter sandwich, every single day) or VERY RARELY ate the 1-2 things i liked on the school's menu. And on the days where I wasn't very hungry we had a lunch monitor who made me finish my sandwich every day before going outside. I really wish I had done something about this, as it was INCREDIBLY frustrating being told you had to eat when you didn't want to. I know why they did it though, it is because I am underwight, very slim and they see that as unhealthy, so they attempt to force me into their proper body image.

Age 13, me and my mom see a doctor at the local hospital(my mom by the way has been a wonderful parent, she actually cares and attempts to understand me) after hearing my story and asking questions. he comes to the conclusion that I have Sensory Integration Disorder, which is a sensory processing disorder, VERY closely related to autism. I get overwhelmed to what you all find ""normal"" sensory inputs. The best way i can describe it is if you have a pet peeve that you don't like people making the ""slurping"" noise through the straw at the end of their drink. Except instead of it just slightly irking you, it triggers a fight or flight response and it's either I move far away, or I stop whatever is making the noise. and it is this way for countless sounds, smells, textures, tastes etc. And now it becomes clear. No wonder I dislike so many foods, I respond to them at such a heightened level I can't deal with them. I like to eat my food alone( since my family usually doesn't also want to eat the same few foods often as the ones I do) so I don't have to look, smell, hear them eat. It explains my previous ""quirkiness"" except something never sat right about it to me. It seemed too easy. The doctor said he had only ever seen it without a connection to autism in 2 other cases. He believed I didn't have autism because i didn't exhibit any social or communication issues. And to an extent that's both true, and completely false. I can speak english perfectly fine, and when I talk to someone I have very little issues making eye contact etc. But I have a hard time making friends, I never felt like I could truly be myself, I often got teased and made fun of. and so for years i tried to be one of these ""cool"" kids. I thought if they were cool and I wasn't, all I had to do was be like them and they wouldn't tease me. I didn't really have a hard time making or keeping friends, I just never felt like people were friends with the real me. My big problems come from groups. If there's a group larger then about 15-20 people. I start to get overwhelmed by the small noises and chit-chat, by everything. I am truly an introvert. I hate working in groups because I feel i can work 10 times faster and do it my way correctly. 

So how did school go? Well to be honest. This is my biggest regret. In 2nd grade I was noticed for flying through math books etc. I was placed into a select group of gifted students who not only worked with brain teasers and puzzles(think tetris but instead of making lines you have to make a Square, or another pattern, keep in mind this is the 2nd grade still) but we also worked with algebra. yeah, algebra in 2nd grade. The algebra didn't challenge me, and I wanted to work with the brainteasers and patterns more. And for some reason i stopped going to the gifted program. I don't know why the school had me leave. But I was back to regular school where nothing challenged me still. And nothing really ever has. I am writing this at 17. I do every single math problem in my head, often faster then you can do it by writing it down. for new lessons, I would often skip ahead of the teacher and ask infront of the whole class why we weren't exploring other facets of a particular thing. I never took notes unless required for a grade, and even then only took them about half the time. It was wasted effort to me, why spend so much time writing it down when I had memorized it all just by seeing it, and understanding it. I never studied for anything. not even finals, or standarized tests. I had to find ways to game the system to create challegnes for myself, see what grade I got by rushing through the test and being the first one done (I usually finished as one of the first 5 people anyways) Or if a test was open note/open book, how I would do without them. A Health issue took me out of school for months, I was too far behind to catch up. I understood all the lessons, but the sheer amount of ""busywork"" that had piled up was too much for my easily-overwhelmed-often-highly-stressed-self to do. So i dropped out, I had already scored advanced and above for all my states standardized tests, i had already taken ACT/SAT and scored well above average. I attempted online classes that were done at 4 times the speed of normal courses at a public school, but those were too slow for me too, I couldn't motivate myself because I had no interest in doing more useless work when I already understood and wanted to move along. So i dropped that and am now simply getting a GED. I will end up finishing highschool early. In my aptitude-test for the GED to test my knowledge across various subjects to make sure I do not need to brush up on any material before I take the full on GED test. I scored as if I had already completed a year of college level courses. and my national average across the subjects ranged from 97-99th percentile. Oh and I did the 2 mathematics portions of that test all in my head as well. 

So here I am now, 17. finishing my schooling early and I have become fascinated with learning myself in the meantime(I plan to apply and attend the #2 ranked school in the US for my major starting in 2013, but I'll get to that later) I have come across temple grandin, I've read and seen movie's of hers years ago. I read another book, written by someone who has autism and synthesisia. I have taken IQ tests from Psychologists and scored a 150 IQ. All my life I have been misunderstood, and there has only ever been one person who truly understands me. my mom.

So what do I want to do with my life? Well I am big into video games. Not like playing them, sure they're great and I have fun too. But I study and analyze them. It's similar to phsycology to me. I can analyze what makes a player do what, why, for how long etc. All based on an interactive experience. I have always been drawn to a computer. I have been gaming my whole life. In december of 2011 a new blog section went up on a popular gaming community site. I joined a public chatroom to talk with the creator of the blog, and because he was going to be busy soon he needed some guest posters, I volunteered and started posting there. I was doing what I have done all along, I started getting paid for it. And now I can move on in my life, hopefully college will challenge me(I expect it to) I can attend a university and get a degree in game design. and I have found what I believe is MY purpose. 

Thanks for reading, I know it's long but I really wanted to share. Many of you might have a child who can't express how they experience the world, and while every person is different, maybe you can see how we perceive the world. I am one of the most observant people, so if you have any question, no matter how specific I will try to help you from both what my mom did to help me, and what I feel was the problem or what I did myself.

1335334371.0,14,self.autism,srdqz,"I'm constantly filled with regret and guilt over how 
I treated my autistic brother in childhood and 
don't know how to get past it. ",16,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/srdqz/im_constantly_filled_with_regret_and_guilt_over/,"I am 23, my brother is 21. He is ""high functioning"" in that he can work a low-skill job and answer questions, but he cannot coordinate his own transportation, pay bills, initiate conversations (except rarely with immediately family). 

A couple days ago there was a conversation at my house, where my mom brought up an anecdote from my brother's childhood -- where he ripped all the tags off a collection of beanie babies for no apparent reason, when he was 6 years old. He piped up and said that he did it because he thought the plastic loop holding the tags on was hurting the animals - and he didn't know they weren't real at the time. 

He'd never shared this before. The fact that he had such a clear memory from so long ago triggered something in me. Beyond the... infinite compassion that that particular idea embodied. 

Since then I have been CONSTANTLY thinking of what an incredibly awful brother I had been for the majority of my life. I would never let him play with me and my friends, because I thought he was ""weird."" I would always try my hardest to crush him at video games, because I didn't want to ""compromise the integrity of the game"" -- even though losing over and over made him very mad and upset, and just one or two wins in there could have made him extremely happy. He would routinely eat more than his ""fair share"" whenever we ordered pizza, and I would make a HUGE deal out of how he got more pieces than me -- even though I didn't really need more than what I ate. I just thought it was ""unfair."" Even though food is one of the FEW things that he gets to fully enjoy. I still tried to take that away from him. 

My parents tried on several occasions to get me to go to sibling workshops, to spend time figuring it out and learning how to cope. But I always refused. I just flat out refused any interaction.

For several years in adolescence I barely acknowledged him on a daily basis, despite living in the same house.

I vividly remember one episode when I was around 8. A friend was over, and for some reason, I thought it would be a great idea to take a deck of cards, throw it up in the air, and tell my mom that my brother did it. It was all my idea, and I had no reason to be so cruel. He was admonished for it, and I can't stop thinking, I just CAN'T stop thinking -- he must remember this. I was a stupid kid, I was an awful brother, but his amazing memory must still be encoded with the way I treated him forever. 

I like to think that now I'm a good brother. I go out of my way to make conversation with him every time I'm over there, I send him messages on facebook and start conversations there, I never yell at him or admonish him or treat him as inferior in any way, ever. I bring him random gifts that are perfect for the few interests he has.

But that's only the last couple years, and I feel like I could never overcome how I treated him for almost his whole life. I'm an awful brother, and I've practically cried myself to sleep the last few nights knowing that I did this. What would his development have been like if I was a good brother? What would his life be like now with our family? What would it be like to actually have a RELATIONSHIP with my only sibling? 

I hate myself. How can I possibly cope with this? ",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_srdqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/srdqz/im_constantly_filled_with_regret_and_guilt_over/,

I would love to explore the path, but so many people give me negative feedback on the position.  I am just curious and honestly wouldn't mind going back and getting my masters in psychology if I get the job and like it.

My name is Rory and I am one of the programmers working on a project (Named Project Autismus: Facebook Link - http://www.facebook.com/groups/ProjectAutismus/) that will help teach autistic children to develop social skills and looks to improve their quality of life through gaming. 

We are a completely not-for-profit organisation, where all funding will go directly into the development of games and specifically the software licenses we need in order to continue making games. (All people working on this project are donating their time).

The project leader for this project is Druhin Mukherjee, a BAFTA award winning game developer and full-time games tutor.

The first game in the series is called Nurf Land and it helps kids to distinguish between various human emotions.

Through his guidance and with the help of Psychological experts we are currently nearing completion on Nurf Land and are currently around $464NZ~($384 US~) off reaching our target to get the licenses required to finish the game.

The game will be released for free on iOS and Android devices and will have no in game micro-transactions or any monetisation of any kind.

For more information or to donate you may find information here:

https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/713

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me and I will answer them as best I can.

Many Thanks,

My amazing 2-year-old son is showing signs of autism and we are going to get it checked out, but I'm scared like I've never been scared before and I don't know how to deal with it.

It all started because we did some google searches and found that a lot of things fit. (2 years and 4 months and can't really speak, is not interested in other kids). On the other hand he's super happy, every single person who babysits him says that he's incredibly easy - it's primarily his mom and me he tests. First of all I know this is dumb as hell, we should listen to what we find on google, but it's done, and I can't seem to shake it.

I'm scared that he's going to have a hard life, he'll never be able to tell us, that he loves us, that he'll need constant care, am I a good enough parent and so on.

I love my kid more than life itself and I'm just shaken - perhaps some of the parents on here know the feeling and have a few tips to deal with it?

He doesn't nap every day now, which is fine; however, he's still wildly unpredictable in terms of whether or not his ""signs of readiness"" for a nap will result in 3 hours of fighting a nap to no avail, conking out almost immediately, or something in between where he puts up a good fight for a few hours and then passes out.  

Of course, when he does nap, it's glorious and I get the precious hour or so to myself that every fiber of my being seems to be screaming out for, and I do my damndest to enjoy it.

Bedtimes and naptimes are, obviously, completely correlated, and it's always a tradeoff.  If we do get him to nap, I can recharge in the afternoon, but he'll stay up so late that any hope of doing anything productive or of quality in the evening is pretty much gone.  

But, the unpredictability of it all, combined with the stress and monotony of the rest of the daily details has pushed me--a self-described calm, composed, and difficult to rattle person--to the point where I don't think I even recognize myself anymore.


When my son started showing signs of autism a bit after age 2, it was terrifying.  When his pediatrician casually told us ""yep, he's probably on the autism spectrum"" a few months later, my heart shattered into a thousand little pieces.  I still have not recovered in the year since his declaration, despite doing all the ""right things"", like getting involved in Early Intervention services, getting a formal diagnosis, starting various therapies, etc..

And even though right now, I'm making the best of being an unemployed post-graduate (i.e. a Stay-At-Home-Mom, but not really by choice), I struggle with how very little of my own life is not dictated by the whims and needs of this mysterious, challenging, and yet desperately loveable little boy.  


I find myself still bitterly clinging to the me that got left behind without me even knowing it.  The me that could (and did) relax easily; the me that felt in control of her life; the me that believed she could be a good parent.

I don't think I'm a bad mom to my son; I'm overall proud of the attention and energy I give him.  But it comes at a price, and I resent it.

It wouldn't be so damned hard if even the smallest little pleasures in life weren't also robbed from me.

I can tolerate not going to fancy restaurants, or going 10-12 hours without a ""break.  I can tolerate my nice things getting ruined, getting pinched and bruised and screamed at.  I can tolerate a lot of the things that come with this.  

But I miss being able to read the paper for 20 minutes while relaxing at a coffee shop.  When I try to emulate something similar, it almost always ends with a screaming preschooler and me processing a whole host of emotions of self-loathing (""why did I even think this might be a good idea?""), embarrassment (""those other patrons probably think I'm a horrible mother""), pity for my son (""he doesn't understand what's going on...it's not his fault he's having a hard time""), regret (""I never should have come here""), resentment (""if my kid was normal things wouldn't be so damn hard""), and fear (""will I EVER get to go back to anything resembling the way things were?"").


I mourn for the person I am no longer.  I miss the me that never yelled, never raised her voice, never lost her temper, let alone basic composure.  I miss the me that felt confident in my ability to handle lifes challenges; to figure out the solutions, and keep plodding along in a forward trajectory.

I know I can't expect my friends or family to understand how I feel...I know my husband doesn't even really get it.  Not that he doesn't feel stressed in his own right, but I do get envious in a total non-rational way about how he gets to leave the house every day and escape the restrictions of caring for our son.  

I feel very mixed feelings about the fact that I'm looking forward to working full time so I can justify paying half my salary to hire someone else to watch my son.  Right or wrong, I think working would be easier than this.  


I'm not looking for anything other than to put out my own thoughts in a space I can hope is without judgment.  I spent the vast majority of my time censoring my inner monologue to my loved ones because I don't want to be ungrateful of the overall blessing that is my son.  I do love him.  And I do love EVERY part of him.  And my life could be so much worse; I could be in a bad marriage (my husband is amazing) or in a bad spot financially (we make ends meet, which is good enough for me!), or in bad health, etc.

I am an adult dealing with a crisis but I also have a life time of trauma. I was raped at 16 and then again at 18 by two different men. I've endured social ridicule my whole life and have been teased and taunted as a child. I recently found out 3 years ago that I am autistic which explains my social awkwardness and why people treated me bad. My father died when I finished my BA in pre-med (I am autistic but have a very high IQ) and I had to take on the role of care taker for my sick mother and little sister. I never had the chance to go to medical school. 

I skipped from job to job (before my autism diagnosis) because my managers stated that the other women in the office ""didn't like me"". I then lost my career and had to start waiting tables in order to pay bills. I worked 3 jobs at a time but always had issues with customers and so I had to leave that career behind too. I eventually had to leave my mother and sister to care for themselves because my life had started to fall apart. They blamed me for a long time for leaving them.

Right when I moved out on my own I was in an accident and injured both knees and ankles and my right hip. I used all of my savings 3 years ago for surgery but now live with chronic debilitating pain and an unable to exercise, which used to help keep depression at bay. I was mugged at knife point shortly after my physical injuries. I am still rather young, and all of these things have happened almost back to back.

Because of my life experiences, and lack of social support (I don't have friends and am incapable of maintaining friendships of my Autism) I have developed severe PTSD. I am currently living with the current diagnosis of Autism, severe PTSD, severe depression, OCD, ADD and generalized panic disorder. 

I have tried reaching out to people that were my friends when I was younger. I have tried explaining to them that I am Autistic and that I am doing the best I can do but my previous employers and many of my old friends tell me to stop making excuses for my bad behavior. 

Last november I was diagnosed with cancer. My original doctor mishandled my treatment plan and now I'm getting worse. I have no emotional strength left. I am unemployed and have no support. When I was younger I was so strong. I looked at every challenge with the belief that I would survive and thrive. With every trauma that has happened to me (and I've had a lot I am not even mentioning in this post) I've lost strength. 

I feel like I have nothing left. I am exhausted and there is no system to take care of me now that I can no longer care for myself. I've looked into long term psychiatric hospitals but it seems you need to be wealthy to attend them and they're all out of state for me anyway. I don't know what to do. I'm not even sure why I'm posting here, but I have no one else to talk to.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_t5ltg,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/t5ltg/walls_are_closing_in_need_help/,

I am a high-functioning autistic who has written a book about my experiences and I hoping to self-publish it.

I am looking for a editor to give me feedback on the content. I have already had an editor go through it but they didn't feel they understood the content so they only corrected grammatical problems.

I am hoping to find someone who is intelligent and understands the mental and emotional variance I have lived with. It would also be good if I could find someone who understands how to put together a book. I don't have a lot of extra money to spend on this but I'm not asking for someone to do this for free either.

I thought there would be a good chance that there would be a Redditor who could help me or at least point me in the right direction.

I don't have these problems with him. He does throw tantrums, but nothing severe and nothing I can't handle. A little talk, removing from the situation that sent him over the edge, redirection etc, it's very easy for me to keep a full melt-down from happening.

So I'm feeling like it's a routine/handling issue with the ex. I offered to sit down and talk it out to maybe discover what we do differently. He said he will because I want to, but he's ready for meds.

1371050441.0,14,self.autism,1g77ai,"Autism! Don’t fear it, embrace it!",19,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1g77ai/autism_dont_fear_it_embrace_it/,"In the neurotypical world we tend to focus on the different as negative, rather than unique. We measure “goodness” by how it compares to the norm, and if it matches our view of value. If the qualities are “out of the norm”, than we immediately see the negative that blind us from the positive characteristics. We tend to interpret “different” as a weakness, or deficit, both something to change. We tend to interpret behavior that we do not understand as “bad”, not worthy, and needing to be suppressed. We do not look at differences as something that to value, understand, and marvel at. That differences may make our world better and enrich our lives. We are so conditioned to wanting to being “accepted” that appearing different is something to avoid. Unfortunately we block ourselves off from the true wonders that these differences may bring. 

Why is this? Why do we fear differences? Partly, I assume, is that the “unknown” scares us. We feel uncomfortable when things do not match what we are use to. How do you relate to it? How do understand it? Make it change, be like the norm, so I can feel comfortable with it! People have always been “uncomfortable”, even scared of things that are different. They are not as predictable. It doesn’t flow easily with how I regulate. It stands out as different, and will not be accepted! We become anxious; hyper-focused on the negative, and totally blind to the beauty that it may bring. It doesn’t fit our “common mode!”

I have been in the field for over thirty years. I have seen many individuals who are radically different in how they communicate, how they process information, what they attend to, and how they experience the world. I was a “behavior change agent” and employed to change these people; to make them “normal”, or at least appear normal. Like everyone else, these differences also scared me, especially since it was my job to suppress and change them. I started out in the back wards of an institution, where people with severe differences were secluded from the rest of the world. People who came from lives of abuse, torment, and despair at the hands of neglect and rejection. It was through their eyes that I learned that each had beauty, value, and worth. Values that we could not see, because we could not get past their differences. Once I stopped fearing the unknown, and embraced their uniqueness, did their differences start to appear, not as weaknesses, but as different perspectives; different ways of experiencing the world. Accepting these perspectives, allowed me to redefine them not as weaknesses, something to fear, but as strengths and gifts, that if supported, not only benefited their lives, but also enriched mine. 

I look around and still see our “fear” of that which is different, and our desire for it to “go away”. Whether embarrassed, or scared, we are definitely uncomfortable with differences, so we immediately interpreted them as bad and needing to be suppressed, or changed. We do more damage by wanting to change our children, then wanting to support them. “ If we make them “look” normal, then they will be happier, and so will we”. If it is not like us, then it is obvious unworthy. I beg you to resist this viewpoint, and try and redefine how you see things. Instead of immediately interpreting differences with a negative filter, try looking at them as potential positives; as different perspectives, that when supported, can be developed into strengths and gifts. Before suppressing the difference, observe and listen to it to understand it’s value. Look for positive value first, to redefine how you interpret it. My experience is that many of these differences are actually gifts that will enhance our own perspective of the world. Try to resist the urge to smother or change the difference because we simply don’t understand it. Try identifying the value in it, validating it, and fostering support for it. You will be surprised how the perceived “weed” can turn into a beautiful flower!

Your children come with a bundle of qualities. Many may look like ours, but many may not. Try to foster the children to develop all their qualities to see how they unfold. In my experience if we acknowledge, partner with, validate, and support the natural growth of these qualities, the children flourish, develop strong self esteems, and truly feel “safe, accepted, and competent.” Take their interests, regardless of how strange they initially appear, and try to view them from a positive perspective. What are they attracted to? What do they seek out? What do they initiate? What do they find pleasure in? Take their interests, and turn them into strengths. Start by assuming that these qualities are gifts and what strengths can occur from them. The children will not only feel accepted, supported and loved, but will also develop into more competent, self actualized human beings. In turn they may change your experiences, and possibly enrich your own perspectives . You will see the world totally different and be happier and more fulfilled as a parent, and as a person.

Any advice or knowledge would be wonderful.",16,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/14sg38/reddit_my_brother_is_autistic_and_now_20_im/,"Ok, first off I'll take some time to describe you my brother.  He's mildly autistic, but many of the severely autistic kids I know can't speak and use PECS (using pictures for words and to form sentences) to communicate.  He has a HS Diploma, but all his classes were modified; but it's still a real diploma.  He loves video games, especially the simple ones.  Frankly, if he had it his way, he would probably play them all day.  He also really likes comics, but not serious stuff.  He likes the Disney comics a ton and the Simpsons.  Socially, he's pretty closed off.  He really only spends considerable time with me, my parents, and a tutor.  Every weekend we see a movie, go bowling, minigolf, or something like that.  We play a decent amount of video games together because I like it and we really bond during that time (and I've never seen anyone so good with fucking Yoshi in super smash bros).  However, he still has temper problems sometimes, but they're rare now.  He self talks quite a bit, but he knows that this is weird and usually doesn't do it in public too much and what he does is usually under his breath.

I've talked to my dad about it, and when he can't do it any more, I'm going to manage a trust for my brother.  I don't want to sound like a dick, but my dad has been successful as a lawyer, and I don't see me needing to support my brother so long as I manage the trust decently.  This is really a great blessing as I'm free of a major financial responsibility.

That being said, I know I'll have the money, but I don't know what the plan really is.  Now that he's out of school, he goes to an animal shelter in Concord, but he has to be accompanied by his tutor because...well you know.  The other two days he goes to Creative Growth in Oakland.  We really do think that he likes making art, but he doesn't really communicate well.

Side note: if you want a pretty sweet Ghostbusters backpack and want to donate to a good cause, ring up Creative Growth.  One of the guys makes them, but they're a little pricey, but it's a good cause.

But this really just seems like temporary measures.  We live in the Bay Area, so I'd assume that we have access to most resources that would be available.  I'd like my brother to live as independently as possible.  However, I fear that if he were completely independent he would do nothing but game all day, which is a life that I don't see being healthy for him.  So maybe some kind of group home type setting that could give him some work and activities to do?

My parents are old (which is a major source of guilt for them) at 65 and 62 respectively.  Frankly, I can tell that they're starting to burn out.  Dealing with autism is a 24/7 job and my parents deserve the time alone.  Besides, my dad's retiring and I know that he wants to travel.  My parents have sacrificed a lot of my brother and they've earned some freedom.  Besides, they won't be able to take care of my brother forever mentally or physically.

Basically, I'd love to hear from some people who have siblings with autism (or other disorders) who are older or who have plans on what they're doing.  I'd really appreciate any help reddit has to offer.

Plug: check out the Dan Marino Foundation; they do a lot of good for families with autistic kids who can't afford the therapy that can really help.

Posco is an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) app. I created it for my high school senior year independent study. For the past year, I have worked hard creating Posco for Android, iOS, and recently over the summer, for Windows 8.
Parents of autistic children are most likely already familiar with AAC apps, but for those who are not, AAC apps allow user to touch buttons on the screen, causing the device to speak what was selected. For example, a user could press ""Hello"" and then ""My name is Bobby,"" and the device would speak that out loud using speech synthesis technology.

Developing Posco has been about more than just learning new programming languages and SDKs - a large amount of time has been spent testing Posco with children and teenagers with autism at my school and in my community. The feedback I've received has helped me create an easy to use, powerful app.

How can reddit help? Well, I should get this out of the way: Posco costs $10, but I can give it to 50 people for free. (The leading competitor costs $180). The reason I charge money is simply to save money for college (which I'll be starting in the Fall). Autism Centers and schools have expressed their appreciation for such a low price (compared to the competition), many suggesting I charge more. I've opted not to, though, because I know that there are parents out there who, unlike schools and autism centers, don't have bags of money to throw around.

I don't want you guys to buy it. I have 50 promo codes to give out for iOS (iPhone and iPad). PM me or leave a comment asking for a promo code (and a little explanation of who will be using the app would be nice too) and I'll be more than happy to PM you a promo code or link to APK for android.
Thank you so much!

EDIT 2: TL;DR - developed an AAC app that helps people with speech disabilities communicate. I have 50 promo codes for people who think it could help them or someone they know. PM me or leave a comment and I'll get you one! (Android and iOS available)

I told them I've been given a diagnosis of Asperger's and ADHD and HFA but I don't know which one is right. People tell me EVERYONE has some form of autism or that it's over diagnosed. When I feel comfortable enough to confide in people they attack me and make me out to be a liar. It's nerve racking and gives me so much anxiety. I try to decide not to tell them EVER but then they mock me and the things I do. I tend to flap my hands, especially my right one. One of my peers started mimicking this action whenever I do it to mock me, he think's it's a great laugh! I try to put myself in social situations to help overcome some of my problems but it seems like I create conflict wherever I go. Whenever I try to explain I didn't mean harm to anyone and that sometimes I say things that are offensive unintentionally they say stuff like ""Asperger's doesn't give you the right to be rude"" or ""I don't care what you have, you don't get to be an asshole."" I'm not trying to use it as some excuse to get out of bad stuff I do but I want people to understand there's no intention behind it! How do I cope with this?

I have been with my 'husband' for almost a decade now. We're not married but we've been living together for two years and I don't like calling him my boyfriend. He hates when I stim it bothers him and he gets very annoyed with me. I try to do it alone in another room so it doesn't bug him but he comes in and stops me because he thinks it's unhealthy. Is it? I hate it when he makes me stop, I feel like my entire life is being interrupted for NOTHING!

I'm kind of alone out here really. My family threw me out after my diagnosis. They felt like it was an excuse for ""All the shitty things I'd been doing my whole life.""  My husband and his family is my support network but none of them have taken any time to understand what I've been diagnosed with. I identify most with Asperger's, maybe it's just the name, I don't know. I've had several diagnosis's but that was the most recent and the one that made the most sense. Either way he and his family have done nothing to look it up or understand it. To them once again it's just some sort of fake thing that doesn't actually exist and I'm just some rude weirdo.

When I stim I tend to rock, flap my hands, wiggle my hips and tap things. I don't think these are dangerous activities though I have come to understand now that doing them in public is absolutely unacceptable unless I really have to.

Edit: I talked to my husband some more and he's being more accepting but he still worries I'm hurting myself. There's no hope for his parents I believe.

His name is Landon :) and here's kind of whats gone on since he's was born.

Landon's Mom was in denial about him being autistic. Didn't take him to get diagnosed even though it was clear as day that he was. Didn't enroll him into speech classes or any special treatment classes like she should have. He's now five years old and says very limited words. He knows some words used for manners, cars, super heroes and criminals (batman, joker, penguin etc.). 
And now he gets very discouraged when interacting with kids his age because they know so much more than him from what I interpret.

My name is Ricky, and I'm his favorite uncle, possibly his favorite person. Let me tell you, this kid is awesome. Everytime I see him, his face just lights up, and he goes crazy jumping around and repeating ""Uncle Ricky"" over and over ""echo"". He hugs me all the time, always wants to play with just me, always wants to know where I am. I take his autism as a blessing in most cases.

The rest of my family just says; ""Awww, poor Landon,"" ""Poor, guy."" And I know Landon can hear thm and get an understanding of what they mean. So I get upset when they say that around him and tell them to stop saying that, and take him for what he is and do what we can for him. 

My main question is, will I ever be able to talk to my best friend? I love this kid to death and I just want to hold a conversation with him, and really understand him. I'd like to say I'm pretty damn good with communicating with body language to him, and simple words.

Should we keep him away from kids that are more knowledgeable than him? He get visibly saddened by them and starts tugging on my shirt to hold him when they're near.

And what is the best way to explain to my family to have them stop saying ""poor guy"" and such? I try to tell them he's a smart kid and that as long as we find something he likes doing, he'll be just as happy as any other living person.. yet it still gets repeated.


Btw some of the things he does and I have not educated myself about, I just know its common.
Covers his ears
Flaps his hands
And echos words

When he covers his ears I just take his hands off slowly and tell him everything's ok.. I don't even know if thats the right thing to do for him.


This may not be very structured, but it's whats on my mind. :)

In every class she noticed the same issues; kids are lonely, isolated and don't know what to do about it. They want friends, boy/girlfriends but don't know where to start.

A few months ago my mother and I started [Social Signals](https://socialsignalsed.com/) and finished a DVD and curriculum that uses movies we made (I went to film school) to teach social skills to teens and adults and now we're about to finish the home version. 

Just to be upfront, of course we would like to make a profit eventually for our hard work. But right now, we’re just trying help as many people as possible because kids and adults are having a horrible time teaching social skills to themselves and some are even going to jail when they absolutely don't need to.

We'd love to hear your questions but because every person with autism is so different and we haven't met them, we can't be held liable for advice. That being said, we know parents are very nervous and scared about this topic and really want to help.

His brother was a very nice kid when I knew him. Here are the updates from the family. Hopefully someone here has some information that could help them out to give Tyler the graduation he has worked so hard for and deserves:

Tyler is an 18 year old high school student with special needs. As a special education student he will be in the public school system until he turns 22. We had scheduled his ""Official Senior Year"" for the 2013-2014 school year. This was supported and approved by the school and district administration at the first of the school year, and reconfirmed by email in November 2012. We have had no other communication about this matter UNTIL April 12, 2013. On April 12, 2013 we were informed by telephone that things had changed. Suddenly he was now a Senior with enough credits to graduate and would be forced to receive a Special Diploma at the end of this school year. He would also be forced to leave his current school and attend another facility, even further from home, for vocational training until age 22. He is being denied the ""Senior Experience"" which he has worked so hard to enjoy. No picture in the yearbook. No Prom. No grad-night. No graduation ceremony with his family in attendance (there isn't time to arrange this now.) We have sent emails and made phone calls to EVERYONE we think could help us, but without success. If you have an idea, please share your thoughts.

Most recent Update:

Some of you have asked for some clarification of our issue. Actually we have two issues going on. First is the issue of the school denying Tyler his Senior year of high school. I've explained that in the 'About' section above. Basically, we were told and reassured more than once, that he would be participating in graduation and all senior activities in 2014. They school is now denying this, even though I have written documentation and notes that prove otherwise.

The second issue is the reason we have the first issue. It is the new transition plan for students with disabilities that Duval county schools has just put in place. Up until now, high school students with disabilities could stay in their current school program until they were 22 or earned a regular diploma. Between ages 18-22 they could choose which year to participate in graduation and ""walk"", but would not accept a Special Diploma until age 22. This left options open to them to attend vocational programs at FSCJ as a dual-enrollment student. The students could also choose to transition to another program if it was deemed appropriate for them. 

The new plan is forcing students with disabilities to graduate with a Special Diploma at the end of their 4th year of high school. Then they must transition to another facility until they are 22. There are very few options to choose from, and none of the options are very good for Tyler. The option for FSCJ is still there but can only be taken the first year after they leave high school, and most students are not quite ready at 18 and don't have the testing scores needed to be enrolled. (like Tyler)

Tyler's teachers did not become aware of this new plan until the same day we did, April 12, 2013. They say they had heard rumors but could not get anyone from district to meet with them to explain the plan until April 12. His teachers are great! They are creative and excited to be teaching these special students. I am at a loss as to why they would not be told of this new plan so they could prepare the students from the beginning of the year. I also cannot understand WHY THE PARENTS WERE NOT INFORMED before now. There just isn't an excuse possible to explain this.

As I said, none of the transition options for Tyler are good ones, and none of them allow him to stay where he is and have his senior year. We have already been informed that he will be placed at Alden Road Exceptional Student Center. This is a facility that houses students with disabilities from ages 11-22. A large percentage of those students are profoundly disabled. There are NO non-disabled students at this center. We toured it today and knew within a few minutes that it was not appropriate for Tyler. We had already been told by several people who know Tyler and know about this facility, that it would not be a place for him to thrive. 

We had NO part in deciding if this would be an appropriate placement for Tyler. This decision was made mostly by people who don't know Tyler at all. They may have read about him in a file, but they don't actually know him. After all these years of inclusion into a regular, normal, typical, non-disabled school experience, our school district is taking a GIANT leap backwards. Students that have been included in regular education whenever possible, and have thrived there, are now being sent to spend all of their school time with students that are disabled. There will be regression for these students. We cannot and will not let this happen to our son. We have been advocating for him for 18 years and we will never stop!

Should I talk to my GP? I've discussed this with my wife who suggested I take the autism spectrum quiz with which I am sure you are all familiar. I scored well within the autistic range.

Maybe it's just me, maybe it's just because I live in an area where there isn't even a pediatric neurologist in the state and only 1 developmental pediatrician. But it seems to me that because autism isn't life threatening, it gets passed by. 1 in 88 children has autism according to autismspeaks.org and that number is growing, so why the lack of attention? 

Autism isn't without it's dangers, my son has epilepsy which I am told goes hand in hand with autism. Last year I ended up having to do CPR on him because a massive seizure stopped his heart. He was 4 at the time. He was molested this past school year and we can't do anything about it. The police say he is an unreliable witness because his verbal skills aren't great. His medications and therapies cost thousands, but you can't get disability for high functioning autism to help provide these for him. My husband took a job working on location in the oilfield just to help us pay for what he needs and provide good insurance. We only get to see him 6 days a month. Why is there not more awareness and help available?

Before I had my son, I had only heard of one instance of a child with autism, my best friend's little brother. He is moderately autistic, with the right therapies early on he might have been high functioning, but as an adult he's moderate. I thought he was mentally handicapped. That is what autism was to me. Another friend had a son 8 months after I had my son. Early on you could tell something was wrong. He didn't develop like other children and was happy sitting alone. He was diagnosed before a year as having autism. My son didn't talk much or well, and he seemed a little different than other kids, but surely he couldn't have autism, he ran and played with other kids. I didn't know the difference between playing next to and playing with at that time. At 2 I asked his neurologist if my son might have autism. He called my sons name and when my son turned to look at him, he said, ""See, he's not autistic. He responds to his name and looks at you."" It was another year before I dared bring up my worries again. 

I have read every one of Jenny McCarthy's books and most of it wasn't appropriate for my son. I couldn't get any doctor to run a blood test on him for heavy metal except for lead. No ABA therapies anywhere. The gluten and casein free diet just made him miserable. I've read everything else I can lay my hands on, the only thing that helped was ""Look Me In The Eye"" By John Elder Robison. At least that gave me some peace, if not answer. 

I worry constantly about what will happen after I am gone. Will one of his sister's take him in? Will their husbands accept him and be kind? Will he be able to manage on his own? How is he going to afford to live? Will he be able to work? He is so lost in his own world most of the time, will he remember to take his medications? 

I'm sorry this turned into a rant. My original intention was just to ask if my perceptions of how autism is treated and handled was correct. It went way beyond that and I am sorry.

How does it feel when my senses are overwhelmed and I have a melt down. I've tried and tried to come up with the appropriate response, but I was an adult when I was diagnosed. When I was a child, I was told that I was making things up and acting bad on purpose. My parents saw me as willful and disobedient and never asked me how I was feeling or why I did what I did. As an adult, I just can't describe it now. It is like me asking a normal person what it feels like to be normal. 

I was talking with a friend a while back. She is NT but she has two autistic children. She once asked her more verbal child (who was under the age of 5 at the time) what it felt like when his senses went haywire.

His response: PAIN. Worse than a physical injury or a spanking. I had never thought about it that way. But it is true. That is what I feel. Intense and overwhelming pain. 

I hope that this helps you understand your loved ones. This may be what they feel like too. Be gentle with them. Let them stim when it is appropriate. Remember, we live our lives like exposed nerves chafing at every sound, every touch. It is especially true when I have to look someone in the eye. I now have the words.

We are either looking for a vacation in which we have activity that he can be supervised and cared for while we do something else nearby like grab a lunch together, or find a camp which takes him while we can relax for a little while, or maybe even a vacation in which they have qualified child care so that we do not get called back in half an hour to come get him.

Obviously, we're simple folk and money is a factor, but we'd like to really try to do this instead of sitting at home alone for our vacation time this year.

I'll start.",15,6,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/j8hk5/rautism_lets_chat_tell_us_a_few_unique_things/,"I have an older brother who's autistic.  That right there is unusual by itself, because parents often stop having kids after an autistic child.  I was a ""happy accident"". *trollface*

His autism is quite severe, and he will never live an independent life.  He has caretakers full time.  Luckily, he lives in a place where there are government programs to finance his caretaking needs.

When I was growing up, I was jealous of the amount of extra attention and consideration he got.  Occasionally I would even mimic autistic behaviors to compete with him for attention.

I'm told that when my brother was little, he would not make direct eye contact.  My parents felt that he had a way of ""looking right through you"".  They attempted to remedy this by teaching him about looking at peoples' eyes.  Evidently this early retraining worked, only too well.  It resulted in my brother having a lifelong, permanent obsession with eyes.  Whenever he sees someone he knows well, he will get a big grin on his face and ask them to open their eyes big, close them tight, then blink them repeatedly.  He can tell you the eye color of any significant person in his life.

Being his jealous younger brother, I was intimately acquainted with his rage triggers.  I could do certain things which anyone else would see as innocuous, that I knew would set him off.  For instance, I could grin at him and subtly point at any glass window, and he would become upset that I might break the window (I've never in my life broken a window).

He's now in his late 30's but still has the vocabulary of about a 3 year old.  And as a recent article pointed out, he does not seem to understand proper use of pronouns.  He understands best when you never use the 1st or 2nd person pronouns -- i.e., just refer to himself, yourself and anybody else by their first name.  The words ""You"" and ""Me/I"" do not compute.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,True,,,True,t3_j8hk5,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/j8hk5/rautism_lets_chat_tell_us_a_few_unique_things/,

I have been doing intensive early intervention with children with ASDs for over ten years now.




One thing that has always struck me is that there is a lack of social skills materials aimed at children that truly speak to a child's experience and perspective. A lot of the literature available for children seems to have the same ""do not do this, because you should not."", or it talks dow to the target audience. 




As such, I am writing my own series. One that takes a child's perspective into account. One that treats the child as a person, and explains things in a way that makes sense to them. 




I have written a few already, which are in the process of being edited and illustrated. I know a number of topics that I would like to address, but it is much more valuable to me to know what topics YOU would like to see addressed. There is no better input than that of parents, professionals, and individuals on the spectrum.





I won't disclose which ones have already been done, and which ones are in the works, because I'd rather see an unbiased comparison of how my target topics align with yours.




I hope to get these published, but if I cannot, I will be publishing them independently and distributing them myself. I believe that these books can be an extremely valuable ressource.

Wow, I didn't know that.""",12,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/11qi7l/you_have_autism_wow_i_didnt_know_that/,"Yeah, I get that a lot. It's not like I have missing limbs or bigger eyes that show I'm different. Yeah, I'm described as ""the shy type"" or ""the class nerd"" or ""that weird kid who just gets over obsessive"". Is it okay to share an idea to what goes through the mind of an autistic person? I'll try my best, explaining is not my strongest skill. In 2000, I was diagnosed with PDD. I have no idea what that means, all I know is it means I'm different. I know it's autism, but does it really change to who I am? Let me think here...

Teachers think I don't try hard enough. My parents think I don't get out enough. I try, and try, but no matter what, this world just ends up biting me in the leg. Making friends? How does one do this? Maybe this means I'm stupid. I have an idea! My computer! I love my computer. I love computers in general. They way they work, what they're used for, computers are just wicked! Want to know how a computer works? I can go on about computers all day! Oh, I was explaining something... um... well... Oh, Speaking of computers, did you know the human brain is estimated to hold the memory of over 2 petabytes? Ever heard of a petabyte? A terabyte even? A terabyte is 1000 gigabytes. A petabyte is 1000 terabytes! No single computer has the capacity to hold even one of these bad boys. 1 Pedabyte is every photo on Facebook, and every video on Netflix available to stream. Basically, The brain is just a very, very powerful computer, created by nature. Oh, I love computers they're amazing! Since the brain is just a super computer, this means the brain is programable? This is commonly known as ""natural instinct"". The thing our brains are programmed to do. One of them being; faces. A face? Yes, recognizing faces. We all know what a face is. A face, is a face, which is a face. It doesn't take much to recognize what a face is. (--&gt; [:)](http://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=happy+face&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=Qd6AUIUapvLIAZyigIgP&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=680&amp;sei=Q96AUO2uJ8KiyAGhyoCQCw) &lt;--) To just two dots and a line, to that dude who looks familiar but you forget his name. Humans are built/programmed to recognize even the smallest of changes on a face. It let's us figure out emotion, and stuff. For me... not so much. I don't understand what... what ever that frown means when I try to make you smile. What if I'm just programmed differently? Nah, that's silly. I'm just stupid. I can't even figure out if this meat I'm eating is horse, or something else. ""I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse"" he said. I'm kind of nervous, now. Anyway, I think we should learn how to count in binary in math class. I'm pretty good at math. I wish I was at english. Sometimes, to show off, I count out loud using 1's and 0's. Binary is simple, really. It's like the decimal system, but instead of 10 digits, than repeating it's self after 11, binary repeats after 2 digits. Computers only have two fingers you know. 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101. I just counted to five. I can show you how to convert binary, but it's so long to explain, and you're probably not as interested as I am. What am I saying? Society says I'm stupid, and it's clear that I am. I need to be more active, they all say. What do they mean by that? Aren't I active now? Man, I wish it was easy to walk up to someone and say hi. That boy who sits beside me in class, I think he likes computers too. He's seems pretty cool. Even if I did say hi to him, then what? Hi again? Now that I think about it, I think my math grade is low, too. All we ever do is graph things, and these stupid words, I don't know what they mean. After all, I am pretty stupid. I can never focus to these lectures, it's so hard because I don't know what the teacher is talking about. My brain may be a computer, but it's not a calculator. Lots go through my head, enough that it keeps me occupied. I have nearly unlimited patience. Patterns on the ceiling above my bed are so interesting. Looking at them keeps my head busy, even in the middle of a conversation. There's so much to think about. I could count them. Let's see, they're circle shaped. That means the length of the window of is the same size of less than three and a half of these shapes. It looks like the length is the same if one of these shapes rolled, it would roll once. That's pi? I wish my grandmother would stop trying to change me. She knows I'm different, but she doesn't know how. If it was as easy to talk to people as much as it was for her, than I'd have tons of friends by now. It's 2 am, and I can't sleep because her criticism makes me feel like I'm a bad person. It's not like I do drugs, or smoke, or have the urge to vandalize. So what if I don't have many friends, or the fact I spend most of my time on computers. Am I hurting people? I don't hate her, but I think she fells I do. She wonders why I don't say hi, bye, or good morning to her, and I wish I knew why, too. Am I bad person? ""I ask because you don't tell me things"" she says. Please, continue asking. I don't mind. I can't really speak out anyway. I can't tell her I don't like being touched when she tries to hug me, but that doesn't mean I don't hate her. I lack in confidence, because this world we live in confuses me.

I hope this was insightful...

My son seems pretty normal to me - he is almost 5, has some issues with speech but is very friendly, happy and smart! he loves technology, video games, and likes talking with me when we are together. He does have issues with potty training but its only when he is dropping a deuce.

I just never had to think about this before - I dont know where to turn and the wikipedia article is pretty damn verbose when explaining autism. 

I just am curious - what should i expect? should i expect anything? what kind of things have you guys done to help your children grow? should i approach parenting any differently?

Im probably asking all the wrong questions but im a mess with everything that has happend before he was diagnosed - I just want to be the best dad I can for my son.

1340072864.0,11,self.autism,v98rz,My brother's uncontrollable and i need some advice,12,1,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/v98rz/my_brothers_uncontrollable_and_i_need_some_advice/,"Hi guys sorry if this is a long post but i want to describe the situation fully in the hope that someone can offer help or advice. 

My youngest brother was diagnosed with autism at a young age, it was never really a problem, his tantrums rarely got out of hand and my family were content. He had a personal helper throughout primary school and his progress was described as remarkable to the point i remember forgetting he had autism. Now he's 13 and over 6ft tall (we're a tall family apart from my mum and er me, milkman?).

Since he's started secondary school his behaviour has regressed to the point i believe he might be dangerous to my family. He's never been punished or told no as he knows how to manipulate my mum into doing anything for him. I'll give an example of some of his episodes for context. I'm not really sure where to start as every day his behaviour gets more shocking

- He has hit my parents and brothers on countless occasions over trivial things for example i refused to give him a burger this morning so he snapped and hit me round the head twice then threatened to kill me. He will also throw himself against things and hit his head on cabinets. 

- He'll swear at anyone who says no to him including telling his headmistress to f*** off

- He's gone for knives before when in a fit. The police were called one night when my Dad couldn't control him, i was at university at this point so i'm unaware of the exact details. 

- He has no empathy or concept of other people's feelings for example he threw a huge tantrum on the day of my grandad's funeral because he wanted the new pokemon game.  My uncle, whose father the funeral was for, drove to Game (i'm from the UK by the way) to get it for him half an hour before the funeral. Nintendo and retro games is his obsession. 

- He refuses to go to bed until around 2-3 at night which means none of my family who live at home have had a proper night sleep in the last 3 or so years which has turned my mum into an exhausted wreck.

- He will accuse people of trying to murder him, of being pedophiles (this includes teachers, myself and my parents) and just blatantly lie to get his way. For example he refused to go to school this morning because he said there was a women hiding in the bushes waiting to smash his phone. This one worried me, he most likely has anger management issues but could there be other issues in addition to autism? he convinced himself he couldn't go to school otherwise this women in the bushes would break his phone, maybe he might be slightly schizophrenic? or he might just be trying to avoid school i'm merely speculating.

I could literally go on for hours my point being he's becoming extremely aggressive, is uncontrollable when he's in a full fit, has no concept of reason and refuses to go to bed at a reasonable time.

How has it affected the family? Me and my older brother have been at university for the last few years so have missed the worst of it. I would get phone calls from my mum every few days in tears. She's an emotional, depressed wreck but refuses to get any help for herself. My Dad's work has suffered as a result of limited sleep and my other brother has been going into exams exhausted.

He towers over my mum and is surprisingly strong for a 13 year old, it takes more then one of us to restrain him. After this summer the house will be my youngest brother and my parents alone for the first time as me and my other two brothers go to university. My dad works all day so she will be alone with him when he's not at school. Im genuinely worried something will happen, he's only going to get taller and more out of control, my parents have seen a few specialists and he's on melatonin, but today i finally lost the last bit of hope i had   after he tried to hit my mum at 2AM while she was trying to go to bed because he wanted her to buy him a screwdriver off amazon to open his old NES cartridges.

However I love the kid, when he's not having a tantrum he's the funniest and best company to jam with, as my mum says he's like Dr Jackal and Mr Hyde. He has a sense of humour far beyond his years having been brought up with 3 older brothers and spending his life on the internet. He'll hug me goodnight and take the piss out of me when we're joking around he's so much fun. 

So reddit what the feck can we do? Apparently there's places we could send him who are more capable of looking after him and my mum could get her life back but it would be completely heartbreaking. I never thought i would think it and resented my family for saying it but it might be time to send him somewhere else. Im worried he might become a danger to society, he's going to get bigger and more uncontrollable what if he takes a liking to a girl and does something terrible?

Any advice would be appreciated, as i mentioned he's currently on melatonin but has little professional help as he refuses to talk to them at meetings. He doesn't have a personal helper at secondary school and their main tactic with dealing with him is to give him detentions and reduce his school hours. This probably isn't the best way of handling him but he's already moved schools once.

If there's anyone in a similar situation please let me know. Any suggestions are welcome and i can fill in anymore details if needed. 

TL;DR 13 year old autistic brother is violent and uncontrollable, my mums a wreck and its only going to get worse as he gets older please

#UPDATE So as i mentioned my parents were having a meeting with the school and i went along to it today for the first time. I stressed the need for medication and psychiatric help. As a result about 5 people are referring him for rest-bite care to get him professional help such as medication. In addition they're funding me to go away to Cornwall with him for a week with other kids with special needs and professionals, hopefully this will give my parents a deserved rest and get my bro away from his computer and games for a while. Thanks for all the advice i'll update further when there's developments.

Recent legislation requires RC's to access the client's private insurance before providing services on the RC's buck, so it is easy to see that families above the threshold would not get their deductibles, co-pay and co-insurance paid by the RC, which would place financial, emotional and familial stress on them.

If you only push yourself to do ONE more thing tomorrow, PLEASE DO THIS
 
Dear Friends,

The fight goes on to have regional centers cover the health insurance deductibles and copayments for autism and other medical treatments required by IPPs and IFSPs -- but we only have a day or two more to make our voices heard.

Thank you to the hundreds of you who emailed Senator William Monning asking him to reject the Brown administration ""trailer bill"" that says regional centers don't have to cover copays and that they cannot not cover deductibles. Unfortunately, Senator Monning's subcommittee approved the trailer bill anyway.

Now the fight has moved to the budget conference committee chaired by Senator Mark Leno, which is meeting now. We and the autism groups statewide are directing our advocacy to Senator Leno and the other seven legislators on the conference committee.

Here are the two things we're asking everyone to do now. TODAY:

1. If you live in the district represented by any of the eight legislators on the conference committee, please pick up the phone and call your legislator now. Tell him or her that it is an outrage that the Brown administration wants to undermine the Lanterman Act promise by making families with insurance pay for services that everyone else gets at no charge. Say you want him or her to vote to reject the trailer bill that would allow regional centers to refuse to cover health insurance deductibles and copays for treatments that IPPs and ISFPs require.

Before your call, please take a minute to look at these suggestions for how to make calls like this: thearcca.org/46.html. It's easier than you might think.

Here are the eight conference committee members and their phone numbers:

Senator Mark Leno, Chair, (916) 651-4011
Senator Kevin DeLeon, (916) 651-4022
Senator Bill Emmerson, (916) 651-4023

If you don't know whether you live in a district that one of these legislators represents, here's what to do: click on thearcCA.org; scroll down to red, white, and blue ""Write Your Legislators"" button; enter your ZIP code; click on ""Go""; and scroll down to the ""California Legislative Action Center"" and ""May Elected Officials.""

2. No matter where you live, take 45 seconds to call or send an email to the chair of the committee, Senator Leno. Besides being the committee chair, Senator Leno is considering running for statewide office and so should pay more attention than most legislators do to people from all over the state. His email address is senator.leno@senate.ca.gov and his phone number is (916) 651-4011.

Thank you for your advocacy.

The only time I go outside is to buy groceries.
I don't have any friends anymore and I still live in my mothers basement.
This has been going on for the past 3-4 years. 
I feel very bad in my skin, I am short, fat, bad eyesight, unhealthy lifestyle...
I don't have any social skills, I can't bring out a sentence when someone talks to me I don't know good enough.
The doctor I have been talking to has diagnosed me with high functioning asbergers, depression, and something else, I personally don't really think I have ""asbergers"". 
He has prescribed me medication, but I refuse to take any medication.
I am scared it might leave me with permanent brain damage or other side effects and I want to life my life without any drugs.
Sometimes I have plans to do something to improve my life but always end up escaping from them with entertainment like games.
I really don't know what to do anymore, can anyone relate to this and try to give me tips?

He is high functioning (verbal, etc) but is very delayed maturity wise, is incredibly impulsive which can be very dangerous for him on so many levels (never met a stranger, runs into street without looking, etc). He also has huge problems with frustration and meltdowns. One thing we have always noticed is that he calms right down around animals and so we would love to get him an autism service dog. The reason for a service dog is he could then have him at school with him, and we could take it on outings with us as a family (which we don't take many of because it's so difficult for the whole family...we have 4 kids all together and it's so hard on his siblings). These dogs are trained to sense agitation in these kids and calm them down by placing pressure on them, allowing the child to focus on them to help them relax, help them stay out of dangerous situations like preventing them from stepping out into the street, etc. We think the benefits for him would be huge! The only problem is they cost around $13,000 and we just barely make our day to day bills (still recovering from husband being unemployed on and off for 2 years...wiped out everything we had, most going towards medical bills/insurance). I have raised money before for Team In Training to benefit The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, most recently $5,000 in memory of my dad and my friends were awesome, but many are tapped financially too and I just can't ask them again. I've done raffles, silent auctions, etc, but again...did it all recently and can't see doing it again any time soon as I don't think people who donated to me before will do so again so recently and for another cause. I just found out about this amazing program and would just about sell a kidney if I could to raise these funds. I know Redditors are amazing and resourceful people...any ideas?

I've posted this here a few times now - I hope you all don't mind! Basically, whenever I release an update to my app, I get 50 more promo codes to give out. I'd love to give everyone a chance to try it!

For those who don't know, Posco AAC is an app that I made which aims to duplicate the core functionality of Proloquo2go, but at 1/19th of the cost ($9.99). Posco AAC is a robust AAC solution that features an extremely high quality voice, a built in library of common words and phrases, a sentence builder, and the ability to add and edit words and phrases.

For those who are looking for an affordable, easy to use, professional AAC solution, I encourage you to check out Posco AAC. If you'd like to see some of the reviews that Posco has received, you can find those here http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/posco/id545435661?mt=8
For screen shots / a detailed list of features, you can check out the Posco AAC blog at http://poscoapp.blogspot.com

**If you would like to try Posco for free, just PM me or leave a comment asking for a promo code and I will be more than happy to send you one!**

Also, if anyone would be comfortable recording a video of someone using Posco AAC, I'd really like to have one so that I can show people how well Posco AAC works before they decide to try it. I know that this is a lot to ask for, but if you're a speech therapist or someone who works with these kinds of apps on a regular basis, I would really appreciate it.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_13ycud,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/13ycud/posco_aac_app_for_ipad_and_iphone_50_promo_codes/,
1353824944.0,9,self.autism,13r150,Almost 2 months in to ABA Therapy and it's every bit as amazing as I hoped it would be!,16,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/13r150/almost_2_months_in_to_aba_therapy_and_its_every/,"I was reminded when I saw another post on here today that the last time I posted here, I was having an extremely hard time coping with the day-to-day care of my son, who is now 4 years old and has an official diagnosis of PDD-NOS.

I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/yxgt6/just_need_to_vent_feel_like_a_prisoner_in_my_own/) about 2 months ago, and my life has dramatically changed for the better, so I thought it would be good to do a positive follow up post!

As I mentioned in my post, I spent the last few years being a SAHM/Student working on another bachelors degree.  I graduated in June and spent a few months looking for a job, and it was during this time that I felt like I was slowly going nuts taking care of my son.

Well, in early September I finally got a job offer, and the job itself was pretty much about as amazing as I could have hoped to find, in every measure.  The most significant part was that it pays well, which meant we could finally start considering ABA therapy!

Without digressing too much, ABA in my state is not mandated to be required by state law, and most insurance companies deny it.  There are currently no known cases of a family being able to get our current provider to cover it.  So we basically planned on footing the bill up front, but navigating the appeals process to hopefully eventually get some money back and set a precedent for other families in the future.

We knew we'd need to save up for a few months before we could afford it (it's about $1,500 a month for 10 hours/week).  But that was when we thought we'd also have to be paying about 2K a month for a nanny too.  And that was the wild card that changed everything.

As it so happens, a good friend of ours found herself in a bit of a bind and wanted to move back home to our town.  She knew I had gotten a job offer and would be searching for a nanny, so she volunteered herself in exchange for free room and board and a modest stipend.

Not only is she a dear friend that I trust, she's lived with us before so I felt completely comfortable sharing our house with her.

The arrangement immediately freed up our finances, and we started ABA on October 1st, which was a mere week after I started my new job!

Transitioning back to working full time and also not being a SAHM any more has been great for me, and a mixed bag for my son.  He definitely seems to appreciate me more (he's nicer to me...ha ha), but he's gotten clingier too.

But ABA...oh my, it has already made such a huge difference, and we're not even halfway through!  He's making and holding eye contact.  He's using speech appropriately and spontaneously.  He is finally starting to ""play pretend"" on his own and seems to enjoy it!  He is using his words to communicate his feelings or what he wants instead of just screaming or getting physical.  He is showing interest in things like books and baby dolls and new foods!  He's even learning how to play a board game with his therapists.  

I always had a feeling he would respond well to ABA, mostly because he's a pretty secure kid despite his communication struggles and social issues.  

I keep looking back at where he was a year ago, 6 months ago, and even 2 months ago and am finding myself at this state where I can finally start to see some real glimmers of hope.  And it feels *so. good.*

I was trying to get food when this was going on and I threw the plate at my wall. I literally did not sleep because I was worried about the barking dog so I couldn't sleep. Then I woke up at 8am. Then 9am. Then 10am. I'm really sick with a chronic health problem so I need sleep to rest, but this has been going on for months. Since way before summer. I missed my last doctor appointment because I was too busy having a meltdown from barking dog. I make myself constipated because the dog is barking right outside my window. THe fence is so close to my house. I have digestion problems from anxiety. I have a bum fissure/tear and it's going to bleed a lot because of the dog. 

It's still barking. It's been barking for 12 hours. I've been doing all I can. I'm listening to music, but that doesn't work when I'm trying to sleep. I also use about 50 lbs of weighted blankets. 

What do I do? 

Should I write a note telling him I'm autistic? Should I phone the cops? I'm asking this board because it deals specifically with noise sensitivities related to autism, and maybe it will help other people learn how to deal with it or make some people aware of how bad sensory issues can be for some people. Also I just needed to vent. Anyone else want to at least vent about noise problems too? Anyone have experiences liek this? How did you deal with it? 

edit: i throw dog treats to it from my upstairs window. but i cant do that nonstop and its a long throw so my neighbor is kind of weirded out how there are a lot of dog treats ove rhis lawn. 

dad tried phoning dog catcher A LOT too. they sent a letter that did nothing. I want to phone the cops but i have PTSD triggered by cops and paramedics and anything like that.

I have been reading a lot about the subject, but I am still a bit nervous about what I have gotten my self into! I will of course receive training when I start the job, but I always like to do my own research as well. 

So can anyone give me some pointers on how to behave with these kids? 
Like good ways to solve conflicts, not upsetting them, how to introduce yourself and so on. Also links to good resources on autism would be very much appreciated.

In this house he also figured out how to unlock the deadbolt on the front door. There is a park about 12 blocks away that we have walked to a few times.

  Today while I was at work and his mom was getting clothes out of the dryer he booked it out the door. She was only gone a minute. Grabbed the clothes out of the dryer in the garage and came back in. She looked for him and couldn't find him anywhere. That is when she realized the front door was wide open. He had managed to get a little more than 3 blocks from the house. He had already crossed several busy streets that were luckily empty at that moment. Being the little guy he is he didn't pause before running into the street. He never slowed down, he just kept running. It took another 2 blocks before she was able to catch him. 

Until this incident we have been able to successfully keep him confined to our yard even if he managed to get outside. It was still rare. At this new house it is a constant event that he is trying to get out. I put slide locks up high on the doors. (landlords might be a bit pissed, but oh well)... Still we are considering what else we could do in case he makes it out. So anyone have a tracking system or some such thing that they'd recommend?

She had looked this up: http://www.mypreciouskid.com/loc8tor-tracking-device.html

I was leaning toward GPS myself, but would prefer not having a monthly fee... but it might be worth it. 

Another consideration is size. A bulky box that must be attached to him at all times might not work... a bracelet would be great. Perhaps even something that can clip to his shoes...

I don't know, I'm in need of advice.

The problem I am having is with getting him to communicate properly and with his behaviour. My sister uses autism as an excuse for him but I am not convinced.

If you dare speak the word NO around him, even if it isn't to him just in his presence, he screams the place down. My sister say's this is because of his autism, I think he is just being naughty. How can you tell?

Also I read a lot about people with autism being helped by a gluten free diet. Is this true? Could it help my nephew?

He's behaviour really isn't expectable he often hits me, if I ignore him he will scratch me and so it escalates. My parents won't go out with him because they are embarrassed by his screaming.

I'm writing a story with a character who is autistic and would like to do it justice.  He is a young man in his early 20s and with possibly a mild form of Aspergers (if this is too common please let me know).  I am asking this subreddit for any information that is true to form, to not insult or to spread misinformation.  

The inspiration that I had for this story has to deal with people who are not considered as the same as others; not considered ""normal.""

She is very sick (I am on the fence as to what she may have) and wants to find someone to watch over her son; a person to take care of him then possibly to start a friendship.  The girl who answers her ad is a young pregnant teen who has no one else to rely on and is willing to help them.  These characters find solace with each other; a group of people who are unlikely people who understand each other.

For example, an autistic child lacking language created naturalistic artwork much like that from the Upper Paleolithic, on the basis of which it was suggested that fAMHS could have also lacked fully modern cognition (Humphrey. 1998).

Note: Some of our immediate ancestors had brains that were, on average, bigger than our own.  However, modern humans have a much greater range of variation, which might indicate a partial retention of ancestral phenotypes in the general populaton.  [Lord Byron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron) (*She Walks in Beauty*) had an enormous head (2200cc), and his daughter [wrote the first computer program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#First_computer_program) **in the Victorian era**.

She's gotten pretty good at pantomiming, with some ASL but mostly her own gestures, and recently she's even started speaking in limited sentences, almost always negation: ""I not sleepy"", ""I not stinky"", but last night she started saying ""I love you, Mom."" ""I love you, Daddy.""

Izzy is SUPER affectionate. She LOVES hugs. She loves tickles. She loves to give kisses at bedtime.

She speaks with a severe impediment, which sounds like apraxia to me, but we have no diagnosis except ""Autism"".

One of her therapists, a teacher who uses ABA, came to the house yesterday and for once, I was home to see the session.

Izzy completed lots of tasks led by the teacher, like building a castle out of Duplo blocks and then making a little princess figure go in and out of doors, sit at a table, and so on. She painted, and colored, and put puzzles together.

Then the therapist brought out a big Rubbermaid tub full of paper excelsior and tried to get Izzy to grab a few handfuls of it.

She was TERRIFIED of the stuff. She cringed and shrank back and cried. When the therapist handed her some, she recoiled as if she had been burned.

I've NEVER seen her react to a texture like that before in my life. 

With some coaxing, Izzy did finally help clean up the paper shreds. She seemed comforted that it was being put away and she wouldn't have to play with it. Even so, she grabbed very small handfuls and pinched the paper in a way that it wouldn't curl around and touch the backs of sides of her hands. I've never, ever seen her do that before.

We're brand new to this and we have no idea at all of where Izzy falls on the spectrum. How do we figure it out? The teachers and therapists are mum on this topic.

Izzy is receiving therapy 3 days a week, sometimes up to 4 hours per day. My wife is adamant that we need to reduce the hours because it's too intrusive and she can't get anything done, visit her parents with Izzy, or basically ever leave the house (Izzy's schedule is pretty regimented but that's more our doing than hers, I honestly think.)

How do we, as parents, balance the need for therapy with the need to attend to everything else? The organization that works with Izzy almost certainly has a vested interest in maximizing hours, not only to justify their existence but so that they can bill as much as possible. How do you keep the hours reasonable while still making sure that it's enough?",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_oatz3,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/oatz3/i_really_didnt_believe_my_little_girl_was/,

Hi r/autism!

My name is Dan and I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of 13, ten years ago.

After I was diagnosed, I decided to dedicate myself to learning social skills. I've spent the past ten years studying social skills---reading books, talking to experts, and seeking out friendships and interactions wherever I could.

My study paid off. I grew from a lonely, bullied boy to a confident, charismatic man. Relationships, which were once a source of fear and stress for me, are now the most important part of my life, and I love meeting new people.

One year ago, I realized that I needed to share what I've learned so it can help others. So I've spent the past year writing an online social skills guide called [Improve Your Social Skills](http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com). It has over 50 lessons covering everything from conversation to body language to making friends. I was very deliberate when I wrote it to make every lesson practical, easy to understand and easy to apply. If you want an example, why not jump in with the section on [how to make conversation](http://improveyoursocialskills.com/conversation)?

Check it out now, and let me know your feedback in the comments :) I'm especially interested to know what  parts of the guide you particularly liked, so I can add more of that in the future",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,True,,,True,t3_o0qae,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/o0qae/announcing_improveyoursocialskillscom_a/,

You can read more about it here: http://www.symbly.us

In a nutshell, you can use it to create all kinds of visual supports: visual schedules, communication boards, social stories, etc. It features a quick and easy interface, image searching (including access to the full SymbolStix symbol library), and sharing. 

There's also a companion iPad app that lets you sync the supports you create wirelessly, and then take them with you on the go (even if you don't have Internet access wherever you're going). 

We're working on getting all the bugs worked out, and need folks willing to beta test it and help us (and use it for free!)

If you use (or know someone who uses) visual supports, this may be something that can make your life a little easier. If you're interested, you can send me a message here on Reddit, or via email directly: riley@symbly.us

Help?,13,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/mgv7i/daughter_diagnosed_with_autism_at_27_months_help/,"Izzy is a sweet little girl who just doesn't talk very much. She has about 5 words. Sometimes she learns new ones, but then loses them again. She has a flat affect, we've been told, but we're not sure we agree. She's shy around strangers, but happy and affectionate with her family. She smiles, she laughs, and she gives hugs and kisses. She points things out and looks where we point. She understands everything we tell her to do, but has trouble expressing what she needs or wants.

She's been evaluated four times. The first two times she was found in normal ranges even though we thought she was speech delayed. The second two times, she was diagnosed with Autism.

Now we're being told she qualifies for services. When we tried to just make appointments with speech pathologists before now, we were asked if she had been evaluated for Autism, as if it was some sort of passport to deserving care. We were told that without an Autism diagnosis, the wait list is a year or more for any sort of speech, physical, or occupational therapy. What the fuck?

Anyway, now we've got an Autism diagnosis for Izzy. The subcontractors sent out by the state told us that they will offer her therapy using ABA which hs Analyzed Behavior something something.... I think?

I asked whether we were obligated to use them or whether there was a choice and they got offended and left their card but didn't schedule a consultation to determine which specific services Izzy needs as they initially said they would. They implied that there would now be a significant delay in treating Izzy because of my indecision over whether to use them.

What other methodologies than ABA are out there? We really think she only needs speech therapy. We think she may be apraxic because she has feeding/swallowing difficulty as well as speech problems. But the evaluators pointed out all sorts of behaviors and facial expressions that were ""wrong"".

We feel sort of adrift here. Any insight or advice would be appreciated. We feel as though we're already behind schedule on getting Izzy some intervention at least for her speech and it seems as though the programs in our state are eager to stretch those delays even longer, ESPECIALLY if we dare to question them or don't say the proper code words in every interaction.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_mgv7i,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/mgv7i/daughter_diagnosed_with_autism_at_27_months_help/,

However, today we were presented with a new problem which I need Reddit's help with... a little background first.

My son is 11 years old and autistic from birth. He is non-verbal and does not perceive words as communication. He has learned very limited sign language but only relating to his immediate wants and needs. He cannot express himself emotionally except through violence to himself when angry or wild unchecked behavior when he is happy. Conversation is lost on him, although he does enjoy being talked to.

Now to the problem... As I said he is going through puberty. it's hitting him hard. He has begun masturbating in his room with his door open as he does not understand boundaries or acceptable behavior in society. The only remedy to this I know is to try and tell him that he needs to close his door and do this in private for obvious reasons. Today it became a problem.

When he got home from school today his bus driver had a disgusted look an her face and her assistant was busy with the paper towels and disinfectant working furiously to clean the seat he was sitting in. As I approached the bus she informed me of his extra-curricular activities on his trip home from school. This was the first time, but it doesn't take a genius to know that it wont be the last.

To the question... Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to help him get control of this or make him understand that this is not acceptable behavior outside of his home? I though about taking him to and from school every day, but we are limited financially and already stretched paper thin with a vehicle I dread driving just a few blocks. My thinking is it's just a matter of time before this starts happening in the middle of class. Once that starts he will not be allowed back into school until this issue is dealt with. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advanced. :)

tl;dr... my 11y-o non-verbal autistic son has hit puberty and is engaging in inappropriate behavior at school and on the bus ride home. Any suggestions as to how we can deal with this without completely isolating him from the rest of the world for the next 3 to 5 years?

I'm currently a 20 year old college student (studying sociology) and for the past 5 summers I've worked very extensively with local programs that help kids with developmental disadvantages. One of these kids in particular has become a pretty big part of my life. I started working with him when he was about 3 years old and he's currently counting down the days until his 7th birthday.

Early on, James (named changed for the internet) was pronounced by doctors to be within the autistic spectrum. He is also non-verbal, he wears hearing aids and has low muscle tone. And he is also one of the smartest kids I have ever met. Things that he does constantly amaze me. He can read and type (writing is tough with his low muscle tone) but I work with him on his speech every time I'm with him. He knows sign language, english, and spanish. Though, he still talks mostly in concrete terms, communicating his abstract notions seems difficult for him.

I understand he sees the world differently than I do. But, since I can't ask him question like this I would like to know from any one who can answer:

**What sorts of activities appeal to you and why?** (For example, I like swimming on a hot day because it cools me down. But, perhaps, you enjoy swimming because it makes you feel weightless)

**What commonly accepted teaching methods** (in standard curriculums)**worked effectively and which didn't?**

**What commonly accepted teaching methods** (for autism and special education curriculums) **worked effectively and which didn't?**

Most importantly:

**Do the majority of people you meet, have an accurate or inaccurate perception of your diagnosis?** (Do they understand the implications of autism? If any, which false notions recur the most often?)",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_dvgb4,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/dvgb4/a_couple_questions_for_anyone_who_grew_up_with/,

He likes to slam doors/drawers and may have pinched his finger in it.  We noticed it was swollen last night, and my wife took him to the doctor today to get it checked out.

They did an X-ray and saw a VERY faint line on the very tip of his finger.  They aren't even sure it's broken, and admitted it could just be that he was wiggling during the X-ray, could be a skin fold, a line in his fingernail, etc.

He is non-verbal (4-and-a-half years old), and very sensory sensitive.  He doesn't like wearing clothes, but tolerates it for the most part..picks at his fingers, etc.  They tried wrapping his finger with tape but he immediately took it off.  They said the only real option is to put a cast on it for a week to keep him from breaking it worse, but said the chances were slim that would actually happen.

My worry is that he is fairly physical when he's mad (slams things, bangs his head, throws himself on the floor) and a cast is going to PISS him off..possibly setting him off to bang the hand on something and make it worse in spite of the cast, or possibly injuring himself in other manners.

I'm hesitant to do the cast as the negatives far outweigh the positives, especially when they aren't even sure it's a break for sure.  We figure we would just keep an eye on him, keep him from slamming doors/drawers for a while, and ice the finger at night when he's sleepy and calm-ish, and see how that goes.

Any opinions/experience?  Thanks in advance...

Edit:  Thanks for all the great advice.  We'll be forgoing the cast and just keep an eye on him and the finger to make sure it doesn't get worse.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,1372865927.0,,,True,t3_1hiz8c,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1hiz8c/help_maybe_broken_finger_what_to_do/,

I am an autistic twenty-year-old indie film writer/director from Austin, TX and I have just posted a new kickstarter for my first feature film, ""SLEIGHT"" (www.facebook.com/sleightfilm, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2728986/combined)
Sleight was shot in its entirety last year and has since been about 50% completed in post so we are trying to raise $5,000 to finish all of post-production and distribute to film festivals.
This film centers around a man named Dennis Clemens who is diagnosed with a neurological disorder called Multiple Sclerosis. It affects him in every aspect of his life--his job, his money, his friends, right down to the core of his happiness.
He is forced to struggle this way his entire life and must find a way to accept who he is, disability and all, and be happy despite what he is handed. The friendships he encounters along the way push him along and through his disease, he learns more about himself than he ever thought possible.
A teaser for the movie can be watched here: https://vimeo.com/66934659
And the Kickstarter can be found here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noelanimeilee/sleight
This film is not about finding a cure and it isn't about magically overcoming disabilities, because that is not realistic. It's about learning to live with them and discovering ways to take control of your life without letting a disease take control of you.
Please take a moment to check out this project--spread the word, donate if you can and keep it mind. Soon, this movie (with yours' and others' help) will be complete and hopefully will open many eyes to the lives those of us with disabilities, visible and invisible, live every day.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_1gv067,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1gv067/im_an_autistic_director_making_a_movie_about/,

Alex is a thing of beauty, akin to a hummingbird or another small, delicate creature that you might admire from a distance with that chest-swelling feeling of awe for being lucky enough to have the opportunity to be in its presence, so fragile that you can hardly comprehend how its skeleton holds. I was pulled away from Sedaris to return to my post, a sentry seated next to her tiny body, curled up on a love seat and wrapped in blankets with only her face peering out just so, dimly illuminated by the glow of the television. I bristle when I hear her moan and whimper in her dreams, wishing I could defeat the demons in her mind and bridge the split between our worlds, make sense of the sensory chaos, but I cannot. 

So I position myself now on the couch beside her, her feet spilling over her sofa into mine, her audible breathing a steady beat that quells the demons in my own mind, only to be stirred again when her sharp exhales raise the hair on the back of my neck.

Tomorrow morning, I will wake her up for 8am meds and she will nod at me, maybe take my hand or if I am lucky, she will hug me, but beyond this, my words may as well be a dog's bark echoing in the distance, indiscernible and fading.

For now, I will continue watching the rises and falls of her breathing through the waves of blankets and like a dog, will wait by her side should she wake, squeeze her hands, and whisper nonsense that we both might understand, both trying with our entire bodies to communicate the simple transaction that needs desperately to end with the words, or rather the feeling, of safety.

This will be a MAPS-sponsored collaborative study between Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the Stanford University School of Medicine. Social anxiety is prevalent in autistic adults, and often compounds the considerable social challenges faced by autistic adults. The main objective of this study is to collect data on the safety of MDMA-assisted therapy in autistic adults, and to use standard clinical measures to estimate the extent to which MDMA-assisted therapy may reduce social anxiety symptoms in this group.

He is not verbal, therefore they do not consider him high-functioning.  He is a very loving, and intelligent little man.
He is going to be transitioning him into a structured Kindergarten class in the fall.

During his most recent IEP the school psychologist said that she would like to add intellectually disabled (the new term for mentally retarded) to his diagnosis.  

The school psychologist sees him maybe 30 minutes a month.  The tests that she preforms ask him to do tasks for example ""put on your shoes"" if he does not do it, he gets a zero.  He can put on his shoes, he is capable of it, but he is not going to always do it on command.
I am not trying to knock psychology, but not everything is so black and white.  

His teacher, along with everybody who works daily with him, entirely disagreed.  I asked if he would get more help, and how his services would change.  The school district employees assured me that it would not change his services.  

I thought about it and was worried that if he was labeled 'I.D.' that they wouldn't give him the same treatment that they would a child with just a diagnosis of autism.  I was concerned that they would just think ""this is as far as he will go"".  His teachers, speech therapist, occupational therapist all have high hopes he will speak, and be a successful high functioning person.

Has this happened to any of you other parents out there?  What was your reaction.  Parents who went along with the diagnosis (I had it removed from his IEP) what was the outcome?

I see and hear a lot more about it now.  Whenever I watch videos with parents talking about their autistic child, they tend to focus a lot on the meltdowns.  I'm not a parent, but I can empathize.

I'm just curious, for those of you who had meltdowns as a child (I didn't), as an adult, are you able to look back on them with anymore clarity, and offer advice to parents?  Children aren't able to communicate a mature and insightful explanation to exactly why they're screaming and thrashing around, but maybe we can?

I never had meltdowns as a child, but as an adult, I often get what I can best describe as ""whole body restless leg syndrome.""  I just go into this mode where I want to tense all my muscles and everything just feels ""off"".  It makes me want to go sit in a closet and scream and cry while tensing all my muscles, and then eventually I get to a point where I can relax.  I have a hard time explaining it as an adult, I can imagine it's even harder for a child.  I've always wondered if this might be a cause for some of the meltdowns.  

As an adult, I've developed some work arounds, because it's not appropriate to scream and cry at work.  I'm not sure if this is something that kids can express or rationalize, but if you feel as though your child (or you) experiences something like this, these are some things that help me.

1. Removing as much stimulation as possible.  NT's think it's weird, but nothing can calm me down quicker than hiding in a closet.  It's dark, normally quiet, it's a closed in space and I can focus on calming down without the distractions of everything else attacking me.  There's nothing wrong with it.

2. Sometimes it helps when my husband either sits on my legs or lays on top of me completely.  It took him awhile to believe that yes, I want ALL of his body weight on me, and I want the world to continue as normal.  But once he accepted the idea, it really does help.  I can't explain it.  We'll be sitting on the couch and I'll feel this come on, and he sits on my legs with all of his weight and it forces them to not move.  I can tense my muscles easier, and it doesn't hurt as bad.  While he does this, he just keeps watching TV and acting like everything is normal.  If it gets really bad, he'll lay on top of me, full weight.  I can't explain why this works, but it does.

Is this sort of thing helpful?  Is there anything else anyone can contribute to parents to help ease some of the more outwardly hard aspects of raising an autistic child?",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_12iqlt,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/12iqlt/questions_about_meltdowns/,

I've had no friends most of my life, except for fake friends who truly cared little to none about me. I've been to the point of suicide before, I've had depression most of my life. I'm also gay. And I live in Kentucky. So all of it has built up and made my life hard. Tonight I dealt with more problems that I'm facing because I'm autistic, because I have trouble seeing social signs that I should see, and I've gotten completely drunk just so the pain would go away.
Earlier tonight a girl I believed to be my friend texted me to tell me to be careful at her housewarming party, to not be stupid or get upset at what she was saying. She however never made it clear that she didn't want me to go to her party. So I got ready, got some friends, and drove to her house. As soon as I got there, I was told to leave please because I was not welcome. I was shocked, I had no idea why I was being asked to go but I left. I asked my friend why I was asked to go, since she told me I could go days ago and showed her her text where she never said she wasn't uninviting me. I left, went back to my dorm with some friends and texted her saying how much that had hurt me and how I don't understand why she had done it. I will now show you her response:

Why do you think i didnt invite you, all you do is act silly, i was trying to uninvite you nicely but i guess you just dont get it that you upset people, your rude, and you make not funny comments that offend people, i know you have a problem but its not good for my party. I dont care or give one fuck if your not my friend, all you talk about is your sex life anyway and try to brag about your 'new guys' that no one gives a fuck about. Most those people didnt want you there, they dont know you,or dont like you, im not having them be upset when we could just do something later.

I asked her why she's saying she didn't invite me after she had invited me, twice! Her response was that she was ""fucked up"" and didn't know why she hadn't clearly stated I was uninvited on her text. Also know that I knew half the people there, and that what she was stating is very over exaggerated.
I cried for almost an hour before I got to the point where I was drunk enough to not feel the pain anymore. I know it's not healthy to do so, but it's kept me from crying my eyes out all night.

I'm upset because this has happened all my life, it never stops, it never will. That's why I hate have AS, I can't stand not understanding that when I'm saying something that its pissing someone off. I don't mean to, I don't want to, but sometimes I do it. I hate myself for having this problem, I hate myself for everything. I'm not suicidal, I promise but I just hate myself as a person and its hard to keep dealing with all the drama that I'm having to face. It hurts so much to deal with everything that I have to deal with because I'm autistic, because I just can't see when I'm doing something wrong that's hurting others. I've gotten better at signs, I try to make sure that Im not upsetting people but sometimes it just can't be stopped.

I have recently fallen in love with my best friend. She's smart, cute, and really sweet, and we've been able to get along for a long time (5 years). It's my first time falling in love, and I'm 17 years old.

However, as you probably already guessed from the title and the fact that I'm posting this in /autism, I have PDD-NOS. As a result, I freak out with everything that happens a first time, whether it's a pleasant thing or not.

So now, I've fallen in love. I've already been on a few dates with her, but I can't get myself to make a move. I'm not afraid of a rejection; life is full of disappointments and sad moments, and I'm an optimistic person. Plus, I see love as an emotion. So if she rejects me, I just turn the emotion off.

Due to my PDD-NOS, I'm afraid of touches. Not if she touches me; I like that. She's already done it before, jokingly (and yes, I'm sure of that. I was acting ""sad"", exaggerated of course, and she ""counseled"" me).  But I am afraid of touching her. That's why I just can't make my move.

There are also several questions bugging me.

The cantine has a lot of unknown people, and of course her friends, who are not mine. Would I have to start hanging out in the cantine? 
*What if we break up? She's my best friend - I already have so little friends that I can't afford losing one.
*I already have so little free time. Would I lose the last bit of free time I have if I'd manage to start something with her (I don't consider hanging out with people free time as it's a planned action, and I consider free time to be a period with little to no planning).
*If I manage to start something with her, would she do it because she has actual feelings for me, or because she pities me due to my, well, disabilities/problems/challenges (whatever you wanna call it :P)?

Advice from people with experience would be greatly appreciated. Please, only give me advice and no pep talking. I know that sounds rude, but for some reason pep talks are the only things that can make me feel down, and I don't really like feeling down :P.

I have concerns that my 19 month old son is autistic and we have an appointment in the upcoming week to discuss it with his PCP. I'm really nervous about what to expect in the screening/diagnosis process. I'm worried about what kind of stress it's going to put on him.

The things that have been raising my concern have been becoming more and more apparent over the past 3-4 months. I didn't want to put off making an appointment any longer; the little research I've done so far has told me that the best thing for a child with autism is to find out early and go from there.



The things that have been raising my concerns are;

* **Delayed speech**. He says a few words (Hi, Mom, Dad, 'Bubble' in reference to 'Bubble Guppies' which is a cartoon he is obsessed with.) Whereas his twin brother has a very, very wide vocabulary and even says several phrases. *(But he also having a procedure done soon because his upper-lip frenulum is attached between his two front teeth, and we think that may have something to do with his speech being hindered)* But, he also has this habit of saying words once, very quietly like he's whispering.. and then not saying them again.
* **High-strung**. He is generally a really happy toddler, full of smiles and giggles... but when he gets upset, all hell breaks loose. I can't so much as raise my voice around him without him having a meltdown. It also doesn't take much for him to have a meltdown. As mentioned above, he is absolutely fascinated with ""Bubble Guppies."" In the morning while we wake up, the boys will have their milk and watch their once-daily episode of Bubble Guppies. He will usually have a massive meltdown when it goes to commercial and tenfold when the show is over.
* **Violent(?) Temper-tantrums**. When he throws fits, he will hit himself in the head. He has also hit his head against walls and against the floor. Even recently, I stepped outside to feed our dogs and left the door open, but a glass screen-door closed. He went into a meltdown and started screaming and hitting his head very hard against the glass until I came back in. Sometimes when he throws fits, he will also pinch/bite me... if not just out-right slap me across the face.
* **""Selective"" Hearing**. (I'm not sure if there's a better term for that.) He generally will not respond to his name. Sometimes he just kind of.. walks around in his own little world and only makes contact when he feels like it.
* **Toys are not toys**. He is very, very analytical and observant of toys before he plays with them. He will stack them, arrange them. He will analyze every possible side and angle of the object. He seems to ""test"" them, banging them against various surfaces and then banging another toy almost as if he's comparing the outcome. The entire time he has this very, very determined and analytical look on his face. Only after his toys have gone through this rigorous testing can he actually play with them regularly.
* **Rocking**. It started off where he would get on his hands and knees and rock back and forth to fall asleep.. this being since he was even nine months old. But now, he will just randomly get on the floor during the day and do that same thing while kind of humming to himself. And when he watches Bubble Guppies (what else?!) he will rock back and forth on the couch.


Other than that.. He's a very loving, warm, sweet, affectionate kid. He plays well with his brother and in public places, he is pretty out-going and tries to play with other kids. He is even social towards adults. Probably more-so towards adults.

I don't think he is mentally challenged. He has always shown a great deal of intelligence. He can identify body parts. If I ask him where his nose is, for example, he will point to it. The same goes for objects. He uses gestures a lot to get his point across. Great problem solving skills, as well. He can do things for himself easily, get things for himself easily, and even get his point across.


I am scared. I'm not sure what I am scared of, though. I think most parents just want their kids to have a normal life and be treated like a normal person. That's probably my biggest fear - being the outcast, the kid that gets picked on because he's sensitive or does things differently. I can love him to pieces and make sure he knows that on a daily basis... but the older he gets, the less I will be able to protect him from shitty people. 

I feel guilty - almost like I'm perpetuating some stigma about people with autism because I am scared. But it's not that. I just feel so unprepared for this. I feel like maybe I'm putting the cart before the horse. But I'm pretty goddamned positive he is. And I don't know what to do, what I can do to for my baby to make sure that he gets everything that he needs to reach his full potential. I don't want to be in this state of mind 20 years from now where I'm saying, *""I should have done this, or that, or that.. or even that!""* I have bipolar disorder, a panic and anxiety disorder, and OCD. It wasn't dealt with until I was 15 and it fucked my life up. I realize fully that my parents just... didn't know how to handle it. And that is the exact position that I want to avoid being in.


Christ, this is making me emotional. It's just new. And it's a little scary. Any thoughts/opinions/advice is more than welcomed.. 

Thank-you in advance.

When she was younger she refused to let us brush her teeth, or, if we got a brush close enough, she wouldn't let us brush them well.  Our dental office couldn't seem to handle having an autistic patient but they were all we could afford at the time.  Eventually her teeth rotted and required oral surgery.  After drama with the current office and eventually switching dentists she had a fixed up mouth and an amazing new smile. 

However, we had just spent four figures (thank goodness for payment plans) on her baby teeth, so my husband and I knew something had to change.  We cracked down on teeth brushing.  Most nights this meant an hour long fight culminating in one of us holding her down while the other scrubbed her teeth.  It was traumatic for all of us.  We tried all sorts of routines and tricks and most nights it felt like I would have to brush her teeth when she went to college.  But...things started to get better.  

It's been two years since she had oral surgery and for most of that brushing her teeth has been a challenge.  Then, the other night, we told her it was time to brush her teeth.  She left the room and we gave her a few minutes, thinking that she was probably trying to avoid the dreaded ritual.  But then, when we went looking for her, she was in the bathroom...finishing brushing her teeth.  All by herself.  I was almost in tears I was so proud.  It made me realize how far she had come and it gives me hope that all the issues we still have (washing her hair, I'm looking at you) will one day be but a memory.

I wanted to share that and I thought here was a good place.  But I would love to hear your success stories.  If you are autistic or know some who is, I would love to hear stories of triumph!

My mom told me last night that they went to a consultation and he has been officially diagnosed with autism (not sure of details, a lot has happened today and yesterday, so my house is in chaos, we had a family friend go into critical condition this morning). I'm assuming it's very mild, because he's functioned fine in elementary and just this year his first year in middle school. He is just... Anti-social. He doesn't have friends or a desire to go out and make any. Also this is (from what i've seen) a late diagnosis? I really just don't know. 

My questions are simple. I'm 22 (soon to be 23) and away at college most of the time but home for a few months. What does this mean? Is there something I should do? Is there anything I can do? What does this mean for his future ( I saw a post about someone who said no one believed he would get a BA because he's autistic). He's very smart and I'm sure he could go and do something great for himself. I want him to be successful in life... I'm just trying to figure out what this all means. Thanks reddit.

Our little one has gone from an almost entirely flat affect, with only periodic affection and a very rare smile, almost no eye contact, very little socialization, etc, to being pretty much a totally ""normal"" 2 and a half year old who laughs like crazy, smiles when we smile at her, plays normally with toys and with peers, and basically, is ""just a kid"" now.

Also, even now, sometimes it takes me a long time how to learn to pronounce a word (one reason I don't think I could ever pick up a second language).

I was also a gullible kid, pretty oblivious to my surroundings, and had difficulty picking up jokes (especially sarcasm).  I'm still not the best at detecting jokes or telling jokes even as an adult.  Then I'm also quick to anger, forgetful, and fairly impulsive.

1320183455.0,9,self.autism,lwwfy,36 month old only partially showing signs of autism and we are confused.  Help!,11,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/lwwfy/36_month_old_only_partially_showing_signs_of/,"Hi everyone.  I just found this sub-Reddit after realizing that this could be the first in a long series of steps that my hubby and I take into educating ourselves on the autism spectrum and all the myriad (overwhelming!) things that go with it.

Anyway, we started the process of going through referrals and looking into Early Intervention services about a month ago.  It will take almost another month before they finish doing their evaluations and such, and so it puts us in a sort of limbo.

Obviously I am no way attempting to make a proper diagnosis myself, but the process has left me desiring information and guidance.  We've spent the last few months going back and forth on the ""does-he-or-doesn't-he"" and keep feeling so confused.  At home he seems so normal...I wouldn't even realize there was a ""problem"" unless someone else pointed something out.  I guess I just don't overthink it or have expectations of how else he should be.  And when we did the MCHAT and the ASQ, there were sooo many things that I felt like ""proved"" (at least to me) that autism couldn't be the problem (particularly, I can't pinpoint anything in the restricted/repetitive behavior problems at all). As far as I understand it, this would make him fail the DSM-IV diagnosis for autism.  But...clearly he DOES have developmental concerns.  *So what do you do with something that only ""sort of"" looks like autism?*


Some background:  we have a 36 month old son who is an only child, and he currently doesn't really have any ""friends"" from our social group, as we were the first to have a child (although a few friends now have newborns/are pregnant).  He has been in daycare since he was 12 months old, anywhere from 2-4 days per week.  I am a full-time student/SAHM, and his father works full-time and is a part-time student as well.

Beings that we have always had a very informal (neither of us can stand ""helicopter parents"") approach to parenting and child development, we spent the last year going through the hard transition of ""oh, he's just a tiny bit delayed in his speech...he'll probably just start talking when he turns 3"" to ""I think we may have a problem"" to OTHER people saying ""I think he may have a problem.""  Suffice to say, it has not been an easy transition, and it has felt very isolating at times.  

His first area of concern is a language/speech delay (he only says maybe 2 dozen words consistently; a good chunk of his words/phrases are hard to understand, and he stopped saying words after successfully saying them for a short while...red flag, we know).  He does not call me mommy unless asked to repeat it (which also is hit-and-miss), but clearly knows who ""mommy"" is (he'll get excited if I'm not home and say ""mommy"" over and over if his dad asks something like ""do you want to go pick up mommy?"").  Same thing with ""daddy"".

His other area, which took longer to observe/understand is a social issue.  As he doesn't really have other kids to hang out with at home (since I never felt comfortable with play groups and none of our friends have kids), this was really hard to observe.  When he's at daycare obviously we aren't there, but over time his teachers have reported that he generally plays alone, and at times can be overly aggressive (especially to smaller kids).  This was also hard to gauge because 1) preferring solo play seemed like it could be a personality thing and 2) being aggressive is often tied into language/communication frustrations.  The other social issues are that he does tend to avoid (about half the time) eye contact, he infrequently responds to his own name, he doesn't always use ""proper"" gestures (he prefers to use an open hand rather than pointing), and he doesn't do much ""pretend play"" other than with cars (moving them, making car noises).  

And since the third component of autism (at least as the medical community is concerned) is repetitive/restricted behavior, here's where it gets confusing.  He has NONE of theses issues.  We don't keep a set schedule at all.  He transitions from activity to activity with relative ease.  His life has a lot of inconsistency in it, and it really doesn't seem to phase him.  The only thing that remotely might be an ""issue"" is that he's a picky eater.  I have a hard time buying this a problem, because I really don't think he's all that different than any other kid his age.  He prefers the obvious foods; pizza, spaghetti, chicken nuggets, ice cream, etc..  Every question in that section in both the MCHAT and the ASQ and the ASQ-S/E came back with nothing.


Anyway, I know in the long run he is going to get help, but I am just having such a hard time making sense of this.  I keep going back and forth as to whether it's even really a problem (""autism is overdiagnosed!!!!1one"") or a life lesson (""this is what it means to be a good parent"").

Any suggestions, guidance, information, words of wisdom, etc would be very much appreciated.  I guess mostly I'm hoping to start off on the right path and this is a place to do it.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_lwwfy,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/lwwfy/36_month_old_only_partially_showing_signs_of/,

He is highly autistic and has been his whole life, his communication is through mumbles, sounds, and occasional hand gestures. He LOVES to walk, pace, and jog. At times he will scream out and sort of giggle in a sense, purely by monitoring him over years I have assumed when he makes these noises he is happy, although it will happen randomly but a lot of the time when he is playing in the bath tub. He is a wonderful person and I love both him and his family, they are very close to me. My main reason for this post is I have a question about a single behavior that I cannon't understand and neither can his family. Randomly at times he will begin to hit both of his temples extremely hard to the point of swelling and redness if he has enough time to get multiple hits. By first guess I am assuming he's angry but with more monitoring it will come at times when I am just completely confused.

*Before I get started, I'd like to let y'all know that in this post I express views which treat autism as a disease, focus almost exclusively on my experiences as a neurotypical person, dehumanizingly describe a person with autism as a burden, and negate his experiences and wants. I want my first act to be to apologize for holding these views, and to clarify that my purpose in this post is not to advocate for them, but to ask for help in confronting and changing them.*

My soon-to-be seventeen-year-old little brother is a low-functioning autistic. He is completely non-verbal, is not able to read or write, and does not communicate using PECS or any other system. I'm not sure whether the way I've described him here is accurate, as I'm not really clear on the terminology. But then, that's the problem.

I'm nineteen years old, and know next to nothing about my little brother. I've never really been involved in his schooling or worked with him at home, and now for most of the year I'm out-of-state at school. In the past, I've struggled with the idea that I might have to provide for my brother in the future. He's not completely toilet-trained yet, so (forgive me for saying this) I don't think a job or independent living is in the future for him. He's also over 6 feet tall and quite heavy for his age, and my (4'11"") mother isn't getting any younger. I can't discuss my worries or other feelings with her because every time I express any reluctance to support my brother, she (understandably) gets angry and tells me that I just don't love him enough. The problem is, I think that's true.

I don't love my brother. I'm angry at him for ruining our family, for sleeping in my parents' bed for the past 17 years, for being the reason we've never had a family vacation, and for, on top of that, expecting me, my parents, and my other brother to support him for the rest of our lives. Of course, I realize that I probably should have gotten all these problems sorted out a long time ago, but I've had no outlet. My parents have never sent me or my neurotypical brother to therapy, or explained to us what would happen if they died, or attended a support group as a family.

I don't know what to do. I feel lost and abandoned and scared. I should sympathize with the autism rights movement a lot — I'm gay, and I when I came out to my mother, she seemed so upset and treated me with such pity that I couldn't help but feel she thought I had some incurable disease. I see the parallels, and I feel like I should be able to sympathize with autistic people, but I just can't understand how y'all, who write books and invent things and support yourselves, are anything at all like my brother who shits in the bathtub, spits water into electrical sockets, walks around the house naked, and has never said my name.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting to get out of this post. I have a lot of problems, and advice would be appreciated on any of them, but I recognize that this post is mostly screaming (whining) into the void. Again, I want to emphasize that all the views I've described are horrible, and I feel like an awful hypocrite for feeling this way.

I know I'm no expert on autism or its manifestations in this little guy, so I guess I'm just trying to ask what I can do to help, if anything.

We caught it early, and she's doing quite well, all things considered. She's semi-verbal (she can request and label stuff, though has problems with pronoun reversal), and generally a happy, affectionate, child.

We're having a serious problem with some of the typical ""little kid"" stuff she does, and her complete lack of care for authority or consequences is making it impossible. 

Take mornings, for example. She knows exactly what the routine is. We get up, eat breakfast, get dressed, and go to daycare/work. Some mornings are alright, but most are completely horrible. She'll eat most of her breakfast, and then run off to play. When I ask if it's time to get dressed, she runs back to her breakfast and pretends that she's going to eat. The second I turn my back to go about my routine, she's off again. The same thing happens with getting dressed. She'll even go as far as say, getting her pants half on, but when I leave to go do my stuff, I'll come back to find her completely undressed again. I literally have to stand over her every second, and even then she goes so painfully slow.

At the time, she was speech delayed, had really just learned to walk confidently, would make no eye contact, was emotionally flat, almost never smiled or laughed (but would cry and get angry), and even though we were convinced that her severe jaundice at birth had done something to her just short of kernicterus, we went along with the autism ""thing"" to get therapy for her. Speech therapy. Behavioral therapy. Motor therapy. All that stuff.

She's now in preschool through our town's special education program.

Let me try to explain what's happened over the past year, and why I'm confused about whether Izzy really is autistic, or something else is going on:

A year ago, Izzy was 6 months into her speech, behavioral, and motor therapy. A very slight aversion to textures had mostly vanished, or at least seems to have vanished. Otherwise, she was much the same as when we started. She had a few words now to request things like juice or milk or food, and that was about all. 

Then one day, maybe 6 months and one week into her therapy, Izzy looked at me and said, ""Daddy, I love you. I'm hungry, can I have a snack?""

I bawled. I'm crying writing this. That was the first time Izzy expressed love verbally (we'd gotten some half hearted hugs in the past, in response to requests most often).

over the next 6-8 months, Izzy came alive. She went from being a little wooden puppet to a real girl, if you'll pardon the metaphor, it really is the only way I can think of to relate her transformation.

Izzy started talking in ever more complex sentences, which is I guess what happens with any toddler, but after so much silence and apparent indifference, it really seemed revelatory in her case. But talking wasn't the only thing. She started smiling easily. Laughing. Hugging. She started showing spontaneous imaginative play with her toys. A few months ago, Christmas 2012 was the first thing that Izzy had ever expressed excitement for in her life (previously the gift of one of her favorite things elicited a rather terse, ""Oh, I like that. Thank you."") Recently, she was bouncing in her seat, smiling and laughing, as we drove to the aquarium to ""see the sea lions and penguins.""

It's like the lights are coming back on inside her head, one at a time.

Is this typical for ASD kids? My impression is that progress like this is very hard won for most kids with autism. That sudden, dramatic breakthroughs like this aren't common or even in line with the expected progress of the disorder(s).

Has anyone else here had an experience like this?

About the only ""relic"" left of Izzy's ASD presentation is her moderate-and-sometimes-extreme aversion to eye contact. If not for that, I don't think she'd be diagnosed today. She becomes adamant about routine when exhausted (she gave me a ten minute lecture this morning for turning on the bathroom light to wash up, instead of waking her up to do it), but I think a lot of young kids are like that..?

It's not so much that I'm in denial as that I either have a hole in my knowledge of the way autism works, or Izzy's case doesn't fit.

This is something I have struggled with for a few years.  Since I first started learning about Autism/HFA/Asperger's and the like, I've felt like many things I have gone through made more sense.

I've been clinically depressed for most of my life and I also have generalized anxiety disorder -- all of this according to a psychiatric assessment done 8 years ago, when I was 15.  I am quite intelligent (I'm not trying to toot my own horn, please forgive me) and did really well in school initially, but my performance declined in high school and into college -- it isn't that I cannot learn or do not know the subject matter, it's just that none of it interests me.  I don't feel it is worth my time (good or bad -- it's a constant struggle with myself).

I have always had *immense* difficulty maintaining eye contact, and I still struggle with allowing people to touch me.  However, I can read people/their motivations and read between the lines very well.  I have a hard time with social boundaries and have to constantly remind myself not to say what I think AS I think it.  The inability to always do that has bit me in the ass before.

I have a freakish memory for numbers...I still remember the phone number for that language-learning software, Muzzy -- commercials for which I haven't seen since the mid-'90s (800-424-0700, if you were considering making a purchase...).

I'm always considered the ""weird"" one in any group of friends I've had.  I make jokes that are sometimes kind of ""out there"", I tend to isolate myself at inappropriate times, I dwell obsessively on details, and I have a very, very hard time letting things go/moving on.

Due to my difficulties in college classes, I was tested for ADD/ADHD a couple of years ago but I tested negative for both.  Based on the research I've done, I feel it could be beneficial for me to at least be assessed to see if I am ""on the spectrum"", as it were...even if only to put to rest this idea that I could have HFA.  The problem is, I'm afraid that I'll be laughed out of my GP's office for suggesting such a test.  Also, since I have been assessed for attention deficit disorders in the past, I'm concerned that this will all just look like a ploy for ""the spotlight"" or whatever -- which is the last thing I want.

I'm sure this community deals with this kind of post every day, so for that I'm sorry.  I'm just feeling more and more lost with this nagging feeling that depression isn't the reason for all of the social oddities I've noticed about myself.

Any advice anyone can offer is greatly appreciated.

Sam answers to his name so obviously he is not autistic is what I was told. The preschool finally convinced the behavioral specialists to do the ADOS test and low and behold, we have a diagnosis. Kind of. Now we're told he's somewhere between cerebal palsy and autism. Whichever, he's my kid and he's awesome.

My first thought was the excellent ""Bullshit"" Penn and Teller episode. Not exactly the sort of evidence she'd even consider listening to-she might respect the studies, but the presentation would have her against it immediately. (can't go with the ""heck, my kid has autism, could it MAYBE be genetic?"" route, it's her step-kid's kid, I think, so no biological link between our loved ones w/ autism)

I also don't want to sound patronizing to her, but I'm afraid I might. Especially since it's out of the blue. It's just past idiotic to not vaccinate your kid because of a damn near criminal fraudulent study, and all the bullshit that's been spouted by all the bullshitters since then.

Her father and her co-wrote Carly's Voice, a book about her experiences. More info here: 
http://carlysvoice.com/

I'm interested in hearing what others, particularly those with children with autism thought of this book. I don't have much experience with children on the spectrum but I do work with several adults who have autism. 

My thoughts:
While the size of Carly's accomplishments cannot be understated, it was what went unsaid in this book that seemed to speak the loudest to me.  While Carly's ability to type and the obvious mental development she shows in her words are amazing, they are by and large the result of a lifetime of intensive one on one therapy.  Carly's therapists are acknowledged extensively in the book but what isn't said is the fact that many (or most) children with autism could likely achieve what she has, if they had access to the same programming she did.  Several times it comes up that Carly or her father does not want her to be around 'lower functioning' children, and it seems as though her father prefers to think of his daughter as a gifted, special child with autism rather than acknowledge that many of these 'lower functioning' children could realistically be at Carly's level if they had been born into a family able to afford the level of care Carly received.  Rather than feeling compassion for these children they are almost dismissed as 'below' them.  This is highlighted especially well when it is repeatedly acknowledged that Carly still partakes in many behaviors classified as 'lower functioning' (stimming, rocking, slapping, making noises, outbursts, etc) but doesn't want to be with individuals classed as lower functioning, while she herself insists that these people have an inner voice and intelligence similar to her own, especially when the only difference (in my eyes) is the money and therapy she had available to her. 

Beyond this the father goes on to disparage the respite and supported living programs offered to people with autism, using overdramatic language such as describing lighting as 'urine coloured' instead of just 'yellow'.  He doesn't look past his disgust for the support workers or house directors who, for the most part, are doing the best they can with what little funding they have.  He blames them for the 'poor' care in these facilities when really it is government underfunding that has caused these problems. 

Overall I applaud Carly's work at becoming an autism advocate, but I wish that more acknowledgement had been given to role her socio-economic status played in getting her where she is.    I think her and her father continuing to subtly place less value on 'lower functioning' individuals is a direct contradiction to Carly's insistence people with autism have an inner voice and intelligence that is not recognized.  As an autism advocate myself I believe the real boon to people with autism comes as a package - we need to raise the perceived value of people with autism AND work to ensure everyone with autism can access the level of care Carly received without having to be born into a well-off family or go massively into debt. 

I have a tendency to be overcritical (thanks university!) and I acknowledge this might be nitpicky, but criticism sparks discussion, and what I'm really interested in is the opinions of others with autism.  I will admit I am fairly new to the world of autism, having only worked in the field for a little under a year, so any responses would be greatly appreciated.

I am fairly new to the site and began reading this subreddit a few weeks ago.  I do not have an autistic child, my best girlfriend does. I came here with hopes of learning about the trials and joys of raising an autistic child to better understand what she is going through and be a good auntie to this wonderful little boy.

I need help, fellow redditors. She is struggling with her son's educational program and I am hoping you all can provide your experience, strength and hope. She is unfamiliar with reddit so I created this thread and sent her a link so she can provide all of the specifics.

Overview (to the best of my understanding): He is high-functioning, very bright and in public kindergarden.  He has different sensory needs than the other children. He is being treated as disruptive.  for example, yesterday he was playing a game with some of the other children that they were not aware they were involved and got into a fair amount of trouble for pinching. His teacher is a wonderful woman but is very young and inexperienced, especially with special needs children.  

My girlfriend can provide additional details shortly.  I just wanted to open this door for her to A) help her feel not so alone in her circumstances and B) discover resources and C) get a feel for what has and has not worked for you. Thank you all in advance, Heather.

It took me a while to cope with the fact that the real diagnosis was kept from me for ages, but once I came to terms with it, It helps explain some things about my personal history. It also motivated me to begin my journey of overcoming the disorder. 

I'm too stubborn and Texan to be restrained by fate and by God or whatever force is out there in the universe, so if I have a chance to rattle my chains and scream against the hand dealt to me, I will do it. 

It occurs to me that I'm still not very good with social situations, and writing requires dialogue and discussion, so now I find myself on a precipice of a decision, I think. I've been writing since before I knew I had Asperger's, and since then, but ever since a recent family tragedy in May I've been questioning my drive.

There's not much of a creative spark going on, and the trouble of writing dialogue has always been there, but now I don't know if I should take a hiatus to focus on other things I desperately need to remedy in my life or to toss this creative phase behind me.

Brother is about to lose it.,9,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/ky0ej/please_help_my_3yearold_autistic_nephew_likes_to/,"My brother is at his wits' end.  He is an awesome stay-at-home dad (mom works) and has 3 sweet little boys: 5, 3, and 2 years old.  His 3-year-old (we'll call him Poopcasso) is autistic, and is a wizard at escaping from his clothing, dipping into his diaper, and smearing every available surface in the house with feces.  This week alone, it has happened 5 times.  He got the TV more than once, and they are going to have to replace it; they can't clean it out of the crevices.

My brother is a very doting and attentive father, and all three boys are crazy about him.  The oldest is in kindergarten and goes to see his Grandma and Uncle down the block often, giving my brother a chance to spend more time with the younger ones.  However, he can't keep an eye on Poopcasso every second of the day.  And he cannot ask more of his in-laws, as his mother-in-law is battling cancer and very sick; she enjoys seeing her grandson, but one kid at a time is about all they can handle, and the five-year-old is the easiest to care for.

My brother is losing it.  He is tired of cleaning up poop almost every single day.  It is becoming a health hazard in their home.

He layers clothing on Poopcasso, but the little guy always finds a way out.  Even if he can't get his pants off (he'll leave the shirt, but hates pants), he will still try to dig in there for some media to create with.  And it is difficult to catch him at night.

Redirective play hasn't met with any success. He has fun with the Play-Doh and mushing up bananas, but he still goes back to the diaper.

I have zero idea of how to help.  If ANYONE has had a similar experience and has any words of advice, it would be greatly appreciated.  Poopcasso's doctor predicts that he will most likely be in diapers until he is around 8-12 years old.  While his parents can accept that, they cannot deal with the constant poop-smearing habits.

How does someone get diagnosed as being autistic?  Just because they have difficulty making friends?  So if a black kid is ostracized from his purely white peer group, he magically becomes autistic, even though he was fine earlier?  Or is it because they have difficulty making friends in all peer groups, in which case I don't qualify and neither do most people diagnosed as autistic, because we've have found we can get on just fine with certain peer groups.

Now what triggers these are myself or my wife ending a fun activity like playing outside, nintendo ds, cartoons and so forth. In order to have dinner or brush his teeth. At this point he's a pretty good sized 6 year old so these tantrums have become full blown blood curdling screaming ragefests. He scratches at me, kicks ,and in some cases bites. I try to ease the transitions by saying ok 10 more minutes and letting him now its time to end an activity but it doesnt help. Right now we are visiting family and he's had like 3 tantrums in the course of the week. I feel like a total fail dad because the only way to calm him down is to basically isolate me and him in a room and hold him until he quits freaking out or give in and let him continue doing what he wants in order to not freak everyone else out.

They are young and now sharing responsibility of my nephew. While my brother has him, I watch him while he is at work. A little background, I have education in early childhood development and three kids of my own.
   I believe my nephew has autism. He is a month away from three years old and says only 3 words. Makes no eye contact. REFUSES any food besides Pediasure. Cannot drink from a cup. Does not play with toys, instead he categorizes them buy size and color. Does not play with his cousins. Does not like affection and does not respond to his name. 
   Now my brother sees that there is something wrong here, but he is a bit of a non-confrotatonalist. His mother on the other hand refuses to get him evaluated. She says he is going to grow out of it. And thats that. I fear that by the time she HAS to accept it, it will be too far gone. He wont receive the affect of therapy as much as he would when he is still so young. 
   My question is, what can I do to help? How can I help her to see that he needs help, that there is nothing wrong with him, but its the same as if you had a hearing impaired child.

1370759775.0,6,self.autism,1fyybk,My son is showing some characteristics of autism and I have a few questions.,7,1,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fyybk/my_son_is_showing_some_characteristics_of_autism/,"(TL;DR at the end) Last week I became aware of the fact that my son (5 years old today actually) may have ADHD, but he's too young for an official diagnosis. I have been paying close attention to the way he reacts to everything and today he did something pretty typical for him and I realized that it's likely he could have a mild form of autism. I'm going to make an appointment for him to be evaluated, but in the mean time, I'm hoping to put some of my fears at ease. 

First of all, what he did today that raised my curiosity was the way he reacted to a birthday present. It was a hat like Finn's from Adventure Time. He didn't want to wear it, he FREAKED out about it and didn't want anyone else to wear it. I messaged my therapist friend and asked why he would act this way and she said that it's a typical behavior in autistic children. They are hyper literal and focus on one thing and don't see the bigger picture. My son DEFINITELY does this. For example, sometimes I will say ""hold my fin hold my fin!"" like on Nemo and he gets SO mad because he doesn't have a fin, he has a hand. There are COUNTLESS examples of this that I kind of just ignored because I am so used to them. 

He never showed early signs of autism and he was evaluated when he was younger and nothing significant stood out so I know it's not severe, but I'm still a mom with an enormous amount of love for my son and I'm scared. I know I am only scared because I don't know what this means, what is going to happen, if we can afford proper treatment (just right now, I'm not worried about it for the future), etc. So here are my questions:

-I have always felt like he needs to be homeschooled. In general I love the idea of homeschooling, or more home education/unschooling. There are a lot of home school groups where I live and he will be able to have plenty of interaction with others. What are your thoughts on someone who has some autism? I'm not worried about it being frustrating for me. It is what it is. But hypothetically speaking, if we can do it the right way, do you think that would be beneficial? A big fear is that teachers will just get frustrated by him. This already happened to him in preschool.

-I know this sounds like a stupid question, but will he always have trouble functioning in society? Is this a life long battle? Or will he figure out how to cope well?

TL;DR-My son (5 years) is showing some characteristics of autism. While I'm waiting until he can have an evaluation, can you just tell me that if it is autism, everything is going to be ok?

She has a nine year old son, and we spend time with them once every couple months (they live several hours away) and have since he was born. Over the years since watching him grow I have noticed that he shows an overwhelming number of symptoms of something that may be Asperger's syndrome. He has a great deal many interests (bordering on obsessions) that while admirable intellectually aren't even remotely age-appropriate (Greek mythology at the age of six, for example) and no interest in anything other kids his age enjoy, he doesn't really understand the concept of personal space or boundaries (he met my aunt on the other side of the family for the first time at my sister's wedding and immediately sat on her lap, at the age of seven, and attached to her the entire night) he has never really grasped the ideas of body language or interpreting someone's tone of voice, he is incredibly intelligent (he watches the Big Bang Theory and gets most of it) and condescends to adults (even ones he doesn't know)- that's a short list, but there are many things over the years we have noticed that concern us (my mother and I are both nurses and work in pediatrics, so we're very familiar with typical child development, and she agrees with me that something isn't quite right). Anyway, he has never been tested for anything on the spectrum, and my mother has never said anything to her cousin about her suspicions, which I find a but frustrating. I'm not a huge fan of labeling kids and normally I'd be happy to mind my own business, but it has gotten to the point where he is being bullied so severely that he has told his mom he wants to kill himself (specifically to take a knife and cut off his head until he dies, because that's how they killed Medusa in the story he read- his words). It breaks my heart, and I think if he were to actually have something like Asperger's and be diagnosed, it would open doors for him to get therapy to control some of the more troubling behaviors (inappropriate attachment to strangers, etc.) and at the VERY least, could have some opportunities to connect with other kids who are like him so he didn't feel so lonely and could actually make some friends.

Anyway, so, to my question. Would it be extremely rude to suggest to his mom that he may have a problem? Is there any good way to do it? If a close friend/family member had noticed the signs of an autism spectrum disorder in your child, would you want to know? I don't want to offend her or damage our relationship, but I'm so concerned about his future, especially since he's expressed suicidal thoughts. He's a very lonely kid and it breaks my heart.

yeah. My beautiful, mischievous and incredibly puzzling boy is now on the spectrum somewhere, supposedly. He's been doing great this week. He's finally getting the hang of toilet training, realizing that he doesn't have to be buck ass naked to drop a deposit in the commode. 6 peepee stickers on the chart earned from multiple spaces. Today was a good day, Dun dun Dun. Then we got to the psychologist office.

I've known my little frogman has not been developing like a typical child for quite sometime. He came into the earth two weeks early and got jammed in the canal along the way. Then he was cut out of me all bruised but a mighty sucker. He would go on the nurse another 18 months. I miss the cure all of the powerful ninny. It was around this weaning age we realized he had a delay in speech development. He'd mastered about 10 words by the time he turned 2. That's when this mama freaked out and started looking for help.

I got him an assessment through our state's program, a screening at the local autism center, a meeting with his old neurologist from frogman's mysterious bout of staring spells that cleared up just before a rigmarole of testing to find their cause. And finally frogman met with a speech language pathologist who accessed his skills to be at the lowest end of average.

So we got frogman speech therapy for a year. The year is up and she says he needs more. We tried a different route this time and went straight to a psychologist. She didn't impress me but I think she's right. Frogman is on the spectrum. I broke down on the drive home and wailed through 6 lanes of traffic. Frogman sat in the back oddly quite but occasionally commenting on his precious cars bestowed upon him after exiting the doctor's office. 

So now here were are a year later with a diagnosis we suspected a year ago. I've spent the past 6 hours reading about autism and therapies. Trying to find all of our options. Frogman is a talker, a repeater, a big singer, and swimmer and some of the things add up. Like him calling every tall dirty blonde guy in the grocery store daddy. Or when Frogman first learned his cousin's names Lerp and Derp. All little girls were Lerps and Derps for a while. He used to confuse Aunt Ray with Baby Boon. When he saw Queen Latifa in a movie he exclaimed praise to Ms. Shorenay his preschool teacher. I had no idea that facial recognition had anything to do with autism.

Frogman does not know he is a man. He can say penis. Today when he was drawing a face he drew a big circle, added eyes, added a nose, added arms, added legs, added a neck and chin. Then of course he said, let's add a penis and so he drew two long ones on either side of the neck.

Well, frogman has arisen from his slumber for a midnight cuddle with mom. He is demanding yogurt drink with reversed pronouns so I must go. Any advice here on how to raise up my strange creature to be a healthy and happy being? Any personal anecdotes? What about school? He's in a normal school now running circles around everyone but being well loved. His speech therapist says more structure would be key as he is in a montessori school currently. I want him in a normal school but I'm afraid the private schools will not want him with the ASD label.",,False,self,t5_2qhs6,False,,,True,t3_19p23f,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/19p23f/my_three_year_old_is_autistic_from_this_day_forth/,

I'm an aspiring author and I'm writing a story about a premodern society in central Alaska. I'm hoping to write one of the characters as autistic, but need help. 

Some background about me: I have a high-functioning cousin that I've always been very close with. Experiences with him made me think that instead of high-functioning autism being a 'bad thing' or a 'disorder' as many seem to think of it, it's just a specific personality type, and it fills one of the many irreplaceable roles which a society needs to function. I have always believed that a high-functioning autistic person would not only fit in great with a small, premodern society, but would be a really helpful asset. For example, my cousin has an incredible ability to do impressions of people's voices, which is an extremely useful skill in a premodern society because of their close interactions with birds (especially bird calls) and other animals in nature. He also has a fantastic memory, especially for stories, which is the main method of communicating information in hunter-gatherer societies. And of course, he has extremely strong morals and an unflinching positive attitude even in the face of terrible difficulties, which is honestly pretty rare in the modern world.

I want to make a character which has mannerisms that will identify them as being on the spectrum, but nothing too obvious. I also am interested in any special skills or assets that you have noticed of people on the spectrum. It would also be helpful if you could think of possible discussion topics or interests which could apply to people from 100,000 years ago just as much as they would to people today.

Edit: The character I'm writing is a girl, around age 25-35. I have no idea if that would affect anything.

**tl;dr I am an aspiring author and would like to write a character with ASD which is an asset to the group of hunter-gatherers that they live with. Please help me think of more useful talents they could have, some conversation topics they would mention, and mannerisms which could subtly identify them as being on the spectrum.

We're thinking that we'll try to slowly spend more time in his bedroom to do arts and crafts, play board games, and even decorate the room to his liking. I'm hoping that we'll gradually spend more and more time in the bedroom while moving more and more of his stuff there. Does this sound like a feasible idea? Any help would be great.

He struggles to do his job, and I need advice.",8,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/zfn96/i_think_i_have_an_autistic_intern_he_struggles_to/,"To make a long story short, I work with animals and just got an intern for the next 4 months or so. We had interviewed him once and he came off as a little odd but we pegged it to him being nervous and my boss offered him the internship (He honestly wouldn't have been my first choice normally but we only had 2 students apply for this semester and the other declined).

I've now worked with him for about a week, and although he has never outwardly said it, I believe he is autistic. I'll be the first to admit I am not very familiar with autism so tell me if you think these actions would suggest autism. (Multiple coworkers have approached me with that diagnosis as well). 

He is very jumpy and nervous, constantly seeming uncomfortable. He is well read and seemingly intelligent but lacks common sense about relatively straight forward things like cutting fruit (He wound up with a large knife from behind his head and slammed it down an inch from his fingers to cut a banana). He takes things very literally, and seems to confuse social cues that a 'normal' person would not think twice about. Making small talk, I asked him today what he does for fun in his spare time and his first response was to sort of moan and say ""Ohh..ahh I dunno, my head kinda hurts today."" 

The job involves a lot of feeding and caring for animals, and after about a week he hasn't shown much improvement. He regularly forgets about certain animals he is required to care for. Today when I pointed out he missed a group of animals he needs to feed everyday (and has fed daily 3 or 4 times prior) his comment was to say that he didn't even know those animals existed.

My boss doesn't trust him alone, and rightfully so based on the knife incident and other incidents that ended in the death of small animals (for instance he killed an insect in a cage door he closed on it and made the comment that the animal wasn't smart enough to get out of the way, and he has thrown away some animals with their old food after being shown how to check it), so I've had to shadow him almost non stop. He is also very slow, taking as much as ten times longer than previous interns to do daily chores.  

The goal of the internship is to give them experience but also free up time for us to do other projects, and when I'm shadowing someone and they are taking much longer to do daily tasks than if I had done it myself it makes the entire process counter productive, and instead of freeing up time for me it has been a distraction that is taking away from my other tasks.

So I guess my questions for reddit is, 
A.) does this sound like autism or something else? In case it matters the guy is in his mid/late 20's when most interns we get are around 20.
B.) If he is autistic, how likely will it be that he improves to the point where he can take care of the animals in a safe way to himself and the animals without needing constant supervision?
C.) He seems very uncomfortable, but says he enjoys himself when asked. Are we putting him in an unfair situation or environment by expecting him to be self reliant?

I am the big sister of a teen with autism. This teen has had the most rough time in school than anyone I've ever known. He was viciously bullied by kids who were too ignorant to see the potential in him, ignored by aides who were clearly just in it for the money, and then he written off as a ""slow kid"" by his teachers. All in all, elementary school was definitely not fun for him. 

Me and our other brother, we've never seen him as particularly challenged or abnormal. With us, everything was natural, so we just guessed he was physically sick or something. He's the most funny person I know, very smart too of course. He was so close to being on the honour roll, just a couple of points! He's come so far since he was a kid, screaming when there were loud noises, putting a 30 second clip on loop over, and over and over again.

But through his whole life really, the only thing I saw different in this brother of mine was that he was funnier than the other kids.

So this summer, I've had the incredible luck, thanks to him, to work at a local autism centre. We are just a family support group, we don't do therapy or behavioural interventions or anything like that. All we do is plan conferences and activities. This summer, we were given the task, the other students and I, to make a social skills camp from scratch. 

Not a small task. We printed and laminated dozens of visual schedules, we scoured for and bought materials for crafts and sports activities, we researched some ABA techniques and a real smorgasbord of terms and studies. 

When it was finally time to start, we had our strict schedule in hand, thinking we were going to be ready. 

More than once, our visual schedules were just tossed aside, adjusting the activities a bit for every group. 

The teenagers were pretty easy to handle. Of course the group included my brother, and we had the best of times. At the end of camp, he told me I did a really good job and that I was a good sister, and that would have been enough to make me cry. But there's so much more.

We had 3 other groups: 2 of them were younger children, and the other pre teens. 

The pre teen one was pretty much controlled chaos, but the forgiveness they had for each other was simply beautiful. Lots of squabbles, but very few unsolved. Their group dynamic was based on teasing and arguing, so we had to cut in a lot with them. It was very exhausting, but they often understood how they hurt their peers, so it went well all in all. 

The youngest groups were definitely the most cuddly ones. The best way to describe it by comparing them to kittens. They were all talking at the same time and they would not stop with the hugs. Again, they came with their challenges. Understanding that paint makes a mess, staying in the room, not running off. But all of them were so caring. One made a mess with some tie-dye and he said ""Don't worry, I'll pick it up!"" Our slight anger was of course, instantly dissipated.

All of them have made such tremendous progress. From some that barely talked to us to some that wouldn't stop talking, everyone has learned. The parents all told us how they were grateful, but I think we might have been more grateful. I can help my lil' bro now, I can now get through to him when he doesn't understand something. Most of those kids have real conversations and show interest in each other, and the ones who don't now know to look people in the eye when they talk.

Autism was always a part of my life, and clearly since I am the big sister, will always be there. These kids and teens, they were all so intelligent, so talented, and they will go far. 

For their families, it's hard, NO doubt about it. Our journey with my brother was a constant fight uphill with the stupid elementary school that didn't think he had a problem, but treated him like crap because he was different. He turned out great in the end though, so don't give up!

My SO lost his job back in March. He's always had some emotional turbulence (his father was emotionally abusive, and then died of cancer when my SO was only 11 - so lotsa guilt/anger there) but it's pretty natural, considering, and he manages it pretty well for the most part. But months of prolonged unemployment have made his moods so much more volatile and dark - and frequent. Each rejection letter or reminder that he doesn't have a job just makes things worse, and as millions are finding out in this economy, long-term unemployment can take a severe and lasting toll on even the most emotionally robust.

He's told me repeatedly that I'm one of the only things keeping him sane, that he'd be lost without my support, etc. Which feels great, except as the weeks drag on, I feel more and more like I'm failing as he slips further into depression. He's on an antidepressant right now but it, too, seems to be less and less effective.

All fairly run-of-the-mill in this recession (sadly), but here's where things get sticky: as an autistic, I feel *myself* being pushed closer and closer to the brink of overload. I'm fairly high-functioning and since being officially diagnosed, now I know what the heck is going on with my own mind and I can recognize and deal with my own reactions to things around me. But with me, personally, I've found one of the number one manifestations of my autism is a hyper-empathy. If someone around me is happy, I'm delirious for/with them. Similarly, if someone around me is anxious, I pull my hair out - even if the cause of the anxiety has nothing to do with me. I just seem to pick up on other people's wavelengths - it's a huge reason why I almost only ever watch comedies and action movies and have to be in the most exaggeratedly tranquil settings to watch/read anything even remotely depressing or terrifying - it's like I feel everything everyone else feels, but with the volume at 11.

Does anyone have *any* advice for how to deal with this? I've been trying things that calm myself down (reading calming things, keeping a positive outlook, I work out daily, etc), but it's getting to the point where I'm afraid I myself might have a meltdown if something doesn't give soon with his depression. I love him fiercely and want to do everything I can for him, and he's said he recognizes that, but as we all know, depression is not just something you can turn off like a light switch and I feel like things are coming to a head. Sorry this is so long, I just haven't really spoken with anyone about this and I guess it all kinda came pouring out.

The company I work for provides one-on-one school support and home sessions (both of which I do). 

One of the skills we work on with the kids is eye contact. I understand the purpose of this -- eye contact is pretty much expected in our society, and the ability to make it will likely help our kids form and maintain social relationships in life. However, I've also read about how uncomfortable (in terms of emotional overload) it can be for people with autism (or autistic people, depending on your naming preference).

To be clear, we do not punish for not making eye contact (or anything else, for that matter) -- we are not ever punitive; in fact, we're forbidden from saying ""no""... everything has to be worded/staged in terms of the positive and strengths and reinforcement. But we do ask for eye contact and if it isn't made, we'll continue asking and provide some prompts (usually verbal/pointing, sometimes making a ""tunnel"" with our hands between our faces so the kid looks at us -- but personally I try to avoid that; it just seems a bit intrusive to me). Then we reinforce any success with enthusiasm.

So my question, to those with autism or any other professionals/relatives/etc: What are your opinions? Will eye contact ever improve naturally, without it being worked on/reinforced like this? Is it actually distressing, or just kind of uncomfortable (it doesn't seem distressing with any of my kids, but they're quite young and some are nonverbal, so they can't really explain how they feel to me)? Any suggestions for understanding and working on the skill?

I was in Arizona for a wedding and happened to go to the Celtic Crossing pub in Prescott for dinner one night. There was about 18 of us at the table, an assortment of kids, parents, grandparents and my Brother-in-law. My BIL is 23 years old and mostly non functioning autistic. He usually hates eating out especially if there is a lot of ambient noise. That night there was a singer, Karl Jones, at the restaurant. For close to three hours he played non stop as we ate and talked and drank. My BIL smiled and rocked to the music and seemed to have a better time than usual. As we were leaving, I stopped to put a five in the tip jar in between songs and Mr. Jones put his guitar down and asked to meet, 'that guy'. I thought he meant big Jim, the patriarch of the family at close to 84. He said no, the young man who's been smiling all night and pointed to my BIL. Well, I brought him up and the singer shook his hand and gave him CD. The same CD he has been charging people 20 bucks for all night. He said, ""let him listen to this and it will remind him of tonight when he was so happy"". So thank you Karl Jones, for a great night of music and a great act of compassion. Usually people only see my BIL's *condition*, but you saw his humanity and joy.

TL;DR A singer at the pub gave me autistic brother a free cd after watching him rock and smile all night.

Growing up it was pretty obvious that there was something different about my brother, but I always just thought he had pretty extreme social anxiety.  He hasn't really had friends since middle school, and he's always been really lazy with school even though he's pretty smart.

I always thought he had more potential than he gave himself credit for, so I tried to push him to work harder.  For example, I found out two days before his college applications were due that he hadn't really started them.  I started out by gently encouraging him, but ended up yelling at him a few hours before his deadline.  I guess it worked though-- he made it on time, and got into a few colleges (though he dropped out a few months after starting).  Clearly he's a fairly mild case, but my parents are amazed that he made it through any college at all.  Apparently his therapists have recommended sending him to a permanent living facility, but my dad's unwilling to do that which I'm glad about.

Anyway, I treated him like this before I knew he was autistic.  I think I pushed him a little too hard a couple months ago (he was refusing to get in the car to go out to dinner with me and my dad), and my dad finally told me that he's been in therapy for years and his diagnosis once we were alone.

I'm glad my parents didn't tell me when I was growing up, since I feel like I might have treated him differently or even used it against him in a moment of teenage spite.  Now that I'm older, obviously that's not something I would do.

I've been trying to treat him the same, only now I never yell at him about anything.  I decided to completely let my dad dole out any advice/discipline.  If he starts being difficult I just let it be, and try to be as nice as possible.  I really have no idea what I'm supposed to do in this situation, though.  Any advice?

It only takes a few minutes, and I'm limiting her mobility (moving her into her room with a gate up) when I do an activity that will last longer than 10 minutes with her out of my sight.  

However, lately she has been bolting out of the house in a matter of a minute or two.  Our door has a bolt lock and knob lock, does anyone have any success with a device that prevents the opening of the door?

Keeping in mind she can't talk and uses very basic sign language, the idea of microchipping her is looking more and more like a good idea.  (that is me half joking!  Really though, has anyone done that?)

Thank you much!

Its based on similar ideas as PECS, Proloquo2Go and Tap2Talk, but its much simpler, easy to use and to customize, and more importantly its much cheaper than any other available options.  

I have close friends with an Autistic child and after listening to them complain about how expensive applications for autistic children can be (some are literally hundreds of dollars) I thought that I could create an app that would do exactly what my friend's needed and provide it at a cost that is a fraction of what the other companies are charging.

My app contains 6 categories that each contain up to 12 images.  The images and sounds in the app can be easily customized by the parent or care giver.  If you find that your child is struggling to learn all 12 items at the same time, the app even features a ""Learning Mode"" where you can selectively disable some of the pictures.

The findings in this study suggest that autistic [Tourette's is another neurodevelopmental syndrome] kids adapt to the world around them and any of the ""biomedical"" treatments/cures are useless at best. I am not talking about attempts at teaching kids social rules and how to get along easier in the world, only the abusive things like hyperbaric oxygen, chemical castration, multiple supplements, chelation treatments etc.that are included in ""biomedical"" ""treatments"". 

Quote: 

Paradox in Tourette Kids

Against expectations, researchers have found that children with Tourette syndrome actually have greater cognitive control of their bodies than do normal children -- perhaps because of the constant struggle to suppress the condition's hallmark tics.

Stephen Jackson, PhD, and colleagues at the University of Nottingham in England had groups of children with and without Tourette syndrome manipulate symbols with one hand or the other depending on the symbol's color. Such a task requires keeping motor control firmly under the conscious brain's authority.

The Tourette children did better than the controls, the researchers reported online in Current Biology.

Moreover, functional MRI scans and neural pathway analysis showed that better performance in the Tourette group was associated with particular white matter microstructures in the prefrontal cortex.

Jackson and colleagues suggested that the findings shed light on one of the enduring mysteries of Tourette syndrome -- the disappearance or reduction of tics in many patients as they pass into adulthood.

""Children growing up with a neurological disorder may develop adaptive changes in the way that their brain is organized that will help them overcome their difficulties and gain control over their symptoms,"" said Jackson in a press release.  http://www.medpagetoday.com/LabNotes/LabNotes/25552

I ask because I was first diagnosed in college, so not one person in my family knows. My roommate, a close friend from high school, and the head of HR @ work know (and that last one was only because of an emergency situation where I was having a panic attack moments before a one-on-one meeting with the CEO). Oh and I'm pretty public online, so the information is out there for anyone who knows me who really wants to dig around online (i.e. if they suspect it for some reason).

I'm sure my parents know that something is up. After all, I'm almost 25 and have never had a girlfriend. They don't even ask me about it, which might be more awkward than if they did. At the very least, they think I'm really shy. I'm worried that they think I'm hiding my life from them, i.e. that I'm gay or similar, and they just don't want to bring it up.

One of many reasons I moved across the country from my family is so that they would forget about me. I feel as though being close to my family would increase the awkwardness. This way, I only talk to them once a month or so.

I'd really like to be more open, and it's hard to maintain the dual life of being public online and keeping the secret from my family and a couple of friends.

1376353215.0,7,self.autism,1k8stk,Horrible experience,7,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1k8stk/horrible_experience/,"My son is almost 3 and has been diagnosed in the mild range of autism. He is currently nonverbal, though he is making great strides in early intervention. His child psychologist has also been exploring the possibility of a sensory processing disorder.

We noticed a few months ago that one of his eyes seemed to be going lazy. I got a referral to a children's opthamologist from our pedi. I didn't want to waste any time because two of my uncles had lazy eyes that required several surgeries, as well as my own brother and my husban's sister.

Our appointment was today and I had called in advance to let them know he has autism and make sure it would not be a problem. (Been turned away from dentists in the past because of autism.) They assured me it was no problem and that they had specialized staff.

The nurse, assistant, whatever her title was, she was very friendly and gentle with my son. He didn't put up much of a fight for the drops to dilate his eyes and was fine after that.

The actual doctor comes in and my son starts to panic. (Meltdowns are not common with him.) I was holding him trying to calm him down. The doctor alternated between trying to force lights in his eyes and smiling &amp; laughing while staring at his computer screen. I was trying to explain to him the autism and the possible SPD, and the doctor just completely ignored me. He didn't even acknowledge my presence in the room and certainly didn't speak to me or listen to anything I was saying.

Without saying a word, he gets up and leaves the fucking room. I calm my son down and play puzzle games with him. Doctor was gone about 20 minutes and then returned with the nurse. The nurse asks me to sit in the exam chair and hold my son.

Next thing I know, she has his head pinned against me and is holding his arms down while the doctor pins his legs against me and pries (I feel like I'm spelling that wrong) open my sons eyes and begins shining the lights to do the exam.

He spends no more than 30 seconds examining both eyes and then says ""He doesn't need glasses, you can go.""

He was acting like a complete fucking asshole. I'm trying to calm my son down and gather my things (my mom was with me and so was my 5 month old son). My son is screaming and hyperventilating and all I can focus on is calming him down. It wasn't even a meltdown, he was fucking terrified. The doctor is in such a rush that he starts picking up our things to hand us as he's opening the door, motioning us out, with out saying a word still.

My son screamed the entire way out to the car. Once in the car he was still hyperventilating, his face was red and purple, tears running down his cheeks, and he just kept letting out the most heart breaking whimpers.

He still didn't calm down &amp; return to his normal for half a fucking hour.

I don't even know what to think. 

This is the same kid that doesn't flinch when he gets shots, that did fine when he had his ears checked, fine at the dentist, hell - he didn't even react as much when he dislocated his elbow and had to have it popped back in. I know my son and this fucking scared him.

I don't even know what to think. I checked in advance. Whether they lied and didn't have staff for autistic or special needs children, or they were just tired and didn't give a shit... I don't know.

He didn't even discuss with me why my son has a lazy eye, what we should watch for, if he should have a check up. Nothing. He wanted us out the moment he saw that my son was difficult.

Is this common? Is it common for people to be so shitty towards autistic children and their families? I don't know if I can get used to that.

But I am going to call the pedi first thing in the morning and ask for a referral to a different eye doc because I do not trust this one, and to let them know they probably should not refer children with special needs to this doctor.

What is the typical protocol for diagnosis, and what are the best practices for helping him?


I admit up front I am not very educated in this subject, so please go easy on me if I ignorantly stick my foot in my mouth in some way causing offense. Hmmm, where to start? I (and several other family members) suspect my 10 year old nephew falls somewhere on the autism/aspergers spectrum. After the most recent visit with family, my concern for his overall wellbeing is growing and I'd love some perspective as I'm not sure what, if anything, I should or could do to help. I don't want to go into all the long details of his family life, but I think his parents are in denial about his needs.


He started taking ADHD meds at age 4. The people who evaluated him said he tested off the charts for it. I don't know the exact amounts, but he takes medicine 4 times a day and then needs a different medication at night to help bring him down so he can sleep. He's painfully thin, as he usually has no appetite. I know at some point later in elementary school he was evaluated and that report included either the word autism or aspergers. However, my sister has been very cagey in mentioning further details. I'm not sure how much of a diagnosis they have. However, when our mother tried to ask her she said insurance covered a psychiatrist visit every 6 weeks and that seems to be all they've done. She doesn't seem interested in educating herself further on what he may be facing, seeking further diagnosis or treatment options, or providing him or their family with tools to better deal with his needs.


Some details on what makes those around him suspect it's more than ADHD:
~He's always had trouble with eye contact, it's next to impossible with him
~When he's together with all his cousins, they are all playing and interacting together and he's just kind of zoned out in his own world
~He gets terribly anxious about all kinds of things kids shouldn't worry about, it's very common for his parents and other adults around him to say something to the effect of ""Don't worry about it.""

She is a terror- my children don't like her.I know she is non-verbal and unable tk help her disability, but this is a little overkill.

I've been googling, and found a bunch of scientific data about the heritability of autism, but much of the specifics went over my head. I'm hoping somebody with a better understanding could explain it to me like I'm 5.

How heritable is Autism? I'm not autistic. Although I have plenty of family history risk factors. Including a very eccentric grandfather who probably would have been diagnosed if he lived today. I get asked occasionally if I'm on the spectrum. It doesn't come up enough for me to pursue getting a diagnosis. Though the thought does cross my mind.

I've dated girls with autistic family members. But in the back of my mind was always concern over our future. Would it be moral for us to have children, if it dramatically increased the chances of low-functioning autism?

I am here looking to gain more knowledge and have a better understanding of autism. I have an opportunity to work as a direct caregiver to children and adults with varying levels of autism living in a facility that works towards improving behaviors so they can live more independently. I currently live with someone who has been working there for 4 years and from what I understand is this position, being entry level, becomes a sort of revolving door and is not taken as seriously as it should be. I don't want to be one of those people.

Now, what I am looking for are any recommendations on books or articles that produced somewhat of an ""ah-ha"" moment for you, or anything that provides insight to what it is like living with this disorder, maybe something not so clinical that describes what it feels like to live with autism if that makes sense. I do understand that every person is different and there will be no blanket advice but I am hoping to go into this position as prepared as possible and would like to do research outside of their training program.  

Any advice outside of that is very much welcomed as well. Some of the points that stuck out to me from people who do similar work is patience with the children as well as their parents, picking up on cues from the children, not straying from routine, positive reenforcement and smiling :) Also when someone said ""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism"" struck a chord.

My parents are professors at the University of Utah who organize a program called iSTAR that tries to meet the needs of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in a way that traditional education does not—building on their visual-spatial strengths. The iSTAR program began in 2009 in conjunction with Google’s Project Spectrum (now Trimble) when Google developers realized that children with ASD enjoyed using SketchUp and had a gift for 3D modeling. Since then, the iSTAR team at the University of Utah has worked to develop a curriculum that not only creates employable computer skills but also provides a bonding experience that allow real friendships to form around mutual interests. In addition to these peer friendships, studies have shown that iSTAR program also helps improve the relationships between youth and their siblings, parents, and grandparents. 

Currently, my parents are trying to find funding on RocketHub so that they can expand their program into other communities. Personally, I think what they are doing is pretty cool so I thought I would do my part to help spread the word. Any support you could give would be great!
