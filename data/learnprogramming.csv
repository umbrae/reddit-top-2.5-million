I would be live-streaming the entire process of programming it, business planning, etc. Is there interest for something like this?",1518,306,192,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jcg0j/i_am_thinking_about_starting_a_course_soon_on_how/,"There are a lot of tutorials out there on the basics of programming when it comes to ""silly things"" like small games, little web applications, etc. All of these are really just simple examples designed to help people learn the basics of programming, but lack when it comes to real world application.

I want to do something more ambitious, and create a tutorial series on the entire process of how one person goes about creating a real world web application from scratch that people actually use, and that actually generates real income.

I would be live streaming the entire process from start to finish, from the point of ""This is an idea I have"" to the point of ""Now money is being deposited into my bank account from this idea."" That means all the programming, business setup and planning, logistics, setting up servers, etc. 

I feel this would be valuable both for those who are looking to obtain real employment in programming related fields, as well as the entrepreneurial types who have an idea but have no idea how to take it to fruition. Both types will benefit from a stronger understanding of what goes into a real functioning web business.

Thoughts?

I have seen a lot of coding tutorials online, but most of them go *too fast*! Maybe some people can learn variables and loops and functions all in one day, but not my students.

So after some prompting from my wife, I've finally decided to post a link to the 200+ assignments I have used to teach Java to my own classes. 

* I almost never lecture.
* Students learn programming by DOING it.
* They work through the assignments at their own pace.
* Each assignment is only SLIGHTLY harder than the previous one.
* The concepts move at normal person speed.
* Hopefully the programs are at least *somewhat* interesting.

Anyway, I'll be happy to help anyone get started. Installing the Java compiler (JDK) and getting your first program to compile is BY FAR the hardest part.

My assignments are at [programmingbydoing.com](http://programmingbydoing.com/).

Cheers, and thanks for reading this far.

-Graham ""holyteach"" Mitchell

tl;dr - If you've tried to teach yourself to code but quickly got lost and frustrated, then [my assignments](http://programmingbydoing.com) might be for you.

**Edit**: Wow! Thanks so much for all the support. I knew my assignments were great for my own students, but it is good to hear others enjoy them, too. Some FAQs:

* I've created /r/programmingbydoing. Feel free to post questions and help each other out there.
* No, there are currently no solutions available. My current students use these assignments, too.

I present to you a prioritized Android Cheat Sheet with every single resource I used!,1109,178,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1dy9wj/im_a_cpa_who_learned_java_android_and_published/,"Hi all,
I've been tinkering with computers and programming languages since I was 8 years old and my dad bought me a Commodore 64 (what a great memory). I'm 31 years old now and I've finally published my first piece of software, a free Android app that helps users save money (I'm a CPA after all) called [**Saving Made Simple**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ootpapps.saving.made.simple).

Since publishing this app, I have had NUMEROUS questions about how I learned Java/Android and published an app in this time frame. Given the constant interest, I spent 3 days coming up with a cheat sheet that lists every single resource (all free) I used to learn Java/Android and publish my first app. Grab your PDF copy of the [**Android App Development Cheat Sheet**](http://ootpapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Android-App-Development-Cheat-Sheet-ootpapps.com-Publication.pdf)  [Edit 3] or checkout the original [**Google Doc Spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aiakq5EFgZZTdGlmblFNMFZLN3huRnNUNzdkWDRoekE&amp;output=html) for updates.

I have painstakingly gone over each and every tutorial in this list to give you a sense of context, namely: how each tutorial benefits you, where the tutorial fits in Android and which order/priority you should complete them in.

I have received a lot of positive feedback on this guide and it's prompted me to post it over here. If you find the guide useful, I do ask for a favor in return: please socially share the guide and help others learn to code!

Enjoy!


**TL;DR If you're looking to learn Android, I compiled every source I used to learn Java/Android &amp; create my first app [**Saving Made Simple**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ootpapps.saving.made.simple) in an [**Android App Development Cheat Sheet**](http://ootpapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Android-App-Development-Cheat-Sheet-ootpapps.com-Publication.pdf). If this helps you, please show some appreciation, that's all I ask. :)**


Edit: I'm not going to do the cliche, ""oh boy it made it to the front page"", thing... But, I'd like to thank you all for supporting the spread of knowledge, who knows what fire may get lit, this is what excites me!


Edit 2: It's been pointed out the wrapping of some of the urls is causing the last ""-"" in the url to be left out (even if you cut and paste the url into the browser).

The more I think about it, the more it blows my mind. I've always been a person that liked to look at the big picture, and to understand the entire process hazily before focusing, so as I learnt about opengl, I kept on thinking about how complicated programming really is.

(And my knowledge of all this is fuzzy). Even at the basic level, machine code is just electricity going through circuits. Then you get this meaningless code of zeros and ones. And from there, you get all the way up to an operating system. Even the modern operating system is incredible, so many lines of codes, all comes down to series of zeros and ones. They are meaningless in themselves yet somehow we can arrange them in a meaningful way to produce something that we can understand and manipulate.

Then you get to graphics, and using numbers as coordinates to make triangles, and then to display them on a screen, creating variables, defining them, doing this and that, rendering this, and then finally to display it on the screen with each individual pixel with a certain color that can change at many times per second. It completely blows my mind.

The more I learn, (and there is so much to learn, i see like i just put a toe in the ocean) the more I realize how much there is to learn. And I don't even know anything about hardware. It's truly amazing what people have created, and that it's so complicated, I feel like I will never fully understand the process, only parts of it. The idea that binary code can be arranged in such a way to provide all the games, programs and things we use everything on the internet is just unbelievable. We are truly the smartest monkeys on the block.

Anyways, just wanted to share my awe. Of course my knowledge of programming is null so there might be many errors above. 

EDIT: I made this thread last night at around this time and I'm amazed how much you guys responded in that time. Since last night, I learnt (roughly) about boolean logic, circuits, logic gates, and now going to half adders, full adders, compliments, and now learning about feedback, basic set and reset memory. OMFG MEMORY!!!!! YOU CAN USE A FEW LOGIC GATES AND SWITCHES AND IT ACTUALLY RETAINS INFORMATION. THAT'S. FUCKING. CRAZY. Maybe that's how the brain works.

Anyways, thanks for all your posts and all your suggestions. You guys have only helped me become even more fascinated with all things computers.

This is an html5 game I am working on that is designed to give people a fun way to learn javascript.  Its an RTS where you write the AI for your units in javascript and compete against an enemy AI.

Its very early on and I am just getting started on the game but I was hoping to get some feedback from people who are interested in learning JS so that I can try and make the game more approachable, fun and educational.

The game itself is open source and you can also view and learn from all the game code at the link above or fork it and use it to make your own games.

I wanted to say this place is one of the least where people are really helpful and with nice attitude towards eachother. 

Thanks to you I was able to turn around my career. I've lost almost 3 years of my life studying things I didn't like and was really depressed about it. Then I learned about programming and loved it right away. Thanks to this subreddit I was able to learn so many things and was saved so much time, I cannot imagine where would I have been if not your help. Thanks guys, you are the best ! Keep on good work.

1369618061.0,562,self.learnprogramming,1f41o5,CGI and Computer Graphics - Just asking a few questions; please don't upvote,804,242,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1f41o5/cgi_and_computer_graphics_just_asking_a_few/,"I copied and pasted this from my original post in r/computers. Read the FAQ after I posted and realized I'd get a better answer here. Anything helps, and thanks in advance :)


Not sure if this is the correct subreddit. If I'd get a better answer from another one, please direct me. Below I have a short list of questions and if you could answer even one of them, I'd be appreciative.

So specifically what I'm talking about are game trailers, movie trailers, etc, but more along the line of game trailers and animation. Am I correct in saying that those are created using CGI and the likes of that, or is it something else?

Whichever it is, how would I get started in learning how to do it? I understand this would not be something I could just pick up and be good at and would definitely be willing to put in years of practice just to understand it, let alone actually be good at it, if I remained interested in it. Is there any book or online introductory course on either a programming language I need to know before I even get started with the actual CGI (or whatever it is if I was wrong above) or the CGI itself that you would recommend? Are there any college or online courses that would be a good introduction? I figure if I can get started with it I would be able to find the right path towards a major in the respective field I'm talking about. I've done a bit of research already but it's kind of difficult to find a starting point and I would rather get a recommendation from someone who already knows what they're doing rather than just google.

Basically what I'm asking is for a starting point in CGI, for someone with little background in it and any computer programming languages in general. What would be a basic guideline of steps that help me get started with learning? I need only that, but if you're experienced enough and willing to give me anything extra that you'd think would help me, I'd appreciate it even more. If there's a website that's a good introduction you can just link me that, but even after a bit of research on my end, I'm still a little unsure of where I should start. And again, if this isn't the correct subreddit, please send to the appropriate one. Sorry for the unorganized post, but as you can tell, I really don't know what I'm talking about nor where I exactly and going, but I am willing to try hard. I have a whole Summer to see how far I can go in learning the basics. Thanks in advance :)

EDIT: Just read the FAQ and noticed the programming subreddit. If you really recommend I go there for help, I'll ask there, but if you could answer my question here, it'd be a great help. I'll probably end up asking there eventually.

EDIT2: Thank you so much for the responses guys! Really appreciate them and am taking them all into consideration :)

EDIT3: Again, thanks for all these responses guys. I have an oasis of information that I can now use to get started and I'm looking forward to it.

These things are out of the scope of what I am currently learning.  Why did I read the question?  Because I want to soak up as much information as I can.

On this sub I've learned about frameworks I would have never thought of to help solve a problem I am having.  There have been many posts that were beyond what I was trying to, and I read them.

**IRC** (Don't overlook this)

irc://irc.undernet.org/bookz

irc://irc.irchighway.net/ebooks

If you don't know how to use IRC to download books, [check out this link](http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/Bookz) or read this:

&amp;gt;*IRC Guide*

&amp;gt;You obviously need an IRC client installed, a quick google search should find you a bunch of decent free ones.

&amp;gt;Load up the client and then type:

&amp;gt;/server irc.irchighway.net



&amp;gt;This will connect you to the irchighway server. Once you're on there, type:

&amp;gt;/join #ebooks



&amp;gt;This will take you into the ebooks channel, which has more than 2.2Terabytes of ebooks for free download. Once you're in, all you have to do to find what you want is to simply type:

&amp;gt;@search ""Author or book title""



&amp;gt;... removing the inverted commas.


&amp;gt;You'll get a message saying that your search has been accepted. A few seconds later a searchbot will offer you a file, so accept the download. That will send you a .txt file that's zipped. Extract that and you'll get a list of files. I searched for Lian Hearn and got a list of 147 files. Here's an extract from it:

&amp;gt;!bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 02] - Grass For His Pillow .rar - 142.1 KB

!bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of the Otori 05] - Heaven's Net Is Wide (v5.0) (epub).rar - 588.40 KB



&amp;gt;Say I wanted to download the first book. I'd copy the text shown below, deliberately removing the file size information (I've been booted for that before ):

&amp;gt;!bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 02] - Grass For His Pillow .rar



&amp;gt;Then just paste that into the IRC window then press enter. After 2-3 seconds you get a prompt asking you to accept or decline the file.You know how to do the rest.

Here we go.

Most popular languages:

* Java
* C
* C++
* Python
* C#
* Objective-C
* Ruby
* Perl

[quoted from [LINK](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)]

So what should you learn as your first language:

Well, I would suggest either Python, Java or Ruby.

**Python** is always a popular suggestion to new programmers, because of it's easy syntax and it's easy to pick up.

The most widely suggested links are: 

[Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

If you are into game development: [Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python](http://inventwithpython.com/)

Then there is **Java**. It's a little hard to start with at first, but you have to stick it out with until the end, as it is very rewarding. The main thing is, there is a lot of stuff you won't understand at the start, because as a newbie you don't need to know that yet and it'll be very confusing (e.g. what is main method ? what is class ? why do we need void ? and such..). 

Where to learn Java:

I would strongly recommend The New Boston tutorials. This guy makes one the best tutorials on the web. [Java tutorial.](http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=31)

And of course the ""official"" tutorials from Oracle: [Tutorials.](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

And the third one on my list, **Ruby**. 

*Do you really want to learn programming but have no skill? Are you a system administrator who wants to learn Puppet or Chef? Are you a designer who wants to build your own websites? Are you a Ruby on Rails programmer who's ashamed that you don't really know Ruby? Then you should read this book. It assumes absolutely no prior programming knowledge and will guide you carefully and slowly through the learning process.* [quoted from ""Learn Ruby The Hard Way""]

To learn Ruby this would be most useful links:

[Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/)

[Try Ruby In Your Browser](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)

I didn't quite know how to put it. Over the last few months I've started to dip my feet into programming by using the Code Academy website. I started with JavaScript and liked it a lot. I didn't finish all the courses for it at CA yet because I took a short hiatus from programming due to other things coming up. 

Recently I've wanted to get back into programming in general. I started doing the Python and HTML/CSS courses at Code Academy but haven't gotten very far in either. I think I'm most interested in writing apps for smartphones and simpler 2D video games and such to start. I like the idea of coming up for an idea for an app, conceptualizing and designing the layout then making it actually work. 

What worries me is that I read posts here and I am absolutely lost in the amount of technical jargon and such. More than jargon I am worried about the mathematical aspects of programming. I've struggled for most of my educational career up to and including my 2 years at a local college with anything beyond advanced algebra. I've changed a lot since then as far as how I think so I might just have to give it another try. Can anyone give me some insight into what level of math I should be proficient in or expected to be proficient in if I want to go anywhere with programming?",,False,,t5_2r7yd,False,,,True,t3_128lzm,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/128lzm/i_want_to_really_dig_into_programming_but_i_am/,

I think if there's a high enough demographic I can spend maybe a few hours a day going through it.

I'm a pretty good programmer, I use standard naming conventions, and all object orientation (which isn't a big deal to good programmers, like those which are most frequently on this subreddit, but maybe around 90% of the kids in my class still handle everything through the main() method).

So yeah.  Let me know if you're interested.  I'll go over the details of the game if I get positive feedback.

My first experience was at a robot camp where I used BASIC to program it to move around and play a series of tones. Ever since, I've been reading about it, learning syntax for C, C++, Java, Javascript, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and others, but making no real progress.

I've tried expanding my skills with places like Project Euler, but without luck. Just recently, I've forced myself to pick a simple, but extendable project and focus on getting one part working at a time and I'm finally beginning to break the barrier from dabbler to actually being able to make something.

My message to you is this: You will not get better unless you *force yourself to focus on and achieve a goal.* Don't rely on reading books or articles, and don't devalue the mundane practices that most tutorials will teach. Don't begin envisioning programs of grandeur just yet. Make the simplest things you can think of and then keep elaborating it to allow additional functionality. My problem came from wanting to do everything at once; I couldn't focus on the details. It's no wonder nothing I tried would work and I would only be frustrated. At the moment I'm working on a little fighting game/simulation in javascript.

1344455918.0,339,self.learnprogramming,xwd16,Had a technical phone interview today for an Entry Level Software Engineering position and nailed it.  Here are the questions they asked:,416,77,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xwd16/had_a_technical_phone_interview_today_for_an/,"I thought you guys would find this useful.  

The position is in a really great medium sized software company that uses Java as their primary development language.  This was my second interview (first was with HR, this one was with an engineer).  

1. What kind of data structure would you use to hold an arbitrary amount of objects in which retrieval is not an issue?  

2. Follow up: what are the advantages and disadvantages of using a linked list over a dynamic array structure? [good time to talk about Big-O performance]

3. Describe the main properties of a binary search tree.

4.  What would happen if you inserted a sorted list into a binary search tree?

5.  Follow up: how can you avoid this problem?

6. Say you want to retrieve from a data set a person's name based on an alphanumeric ID number.  What kind of data structure would you use?

7.  Compare a hash table and a map type structure and their big-O performance on various common functionality (search, insert, etc.).

8.  What is the worst case retrieval time for a hash table and how can this happen?

9.  Briefly describe object oriented programming and it's main principles (MAKE SURE TO SAY: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, (and abstraction if you want)).

10.  He specifically asked me to elaborate more on encapsulation and polymorphism.

11.  Why is polymorphism useful?

He then asked me if I had done any multithreading, which I have not, and if I've worked in SQL, which I have done a little. For SQL questions he asked:

12. What is a join and an outer join? 

Despite not knowing 12 and not doing any multithreading, he told me I did great and they immediately gave me a time for the final on-site technical interview.  

I think my situation is unique and many budding programmers will find my profile interesting/helpful in context:

I have a BA in philosophy from the University of Michigan, with about 20 computer science credit hours (no minor).  C++ is my main language.  They very much like C++ people.

On my resume I put the projects I've worked on, what concepts they taught me and put it all on github and put the github link in my resume.   I've also done an IT management (no development) internship at a very large corporation.  I have a 3.1 GPA. 

I've spent a LOT of time outside of class programming on my own and hammering in concepts that I may have missed by not completing a full CS degree.  

That is all.  Hope you guys find this useful.  Wish me luck on the final interview!",,False,,t5_2r7yd,False,,,True,t3_xwd16,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xwd16/had_a_technical_phone_interview_today_for_an/,

1358280744.0,330,self.learnprogramming,16mxpr,My 1 year experience from internship to full time job.,368,38,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/16mxpr/my_1_year_experience_from_internship_to_full_time/,"So here's my story :

When I was 25 back in 2008 I decided to get a bachelor degree in Computer Science. At that time I was working as a Front Desk clerk for a resort here in Cancun. So I managed to convince my boss to let me study in the mornings and work on the evening. So basically I was in school through the morning and then to work.

Four years passed and its 2012. Got my bachelor degree and really wanted to leave the front desk job and start taking advantage from my degree. My main goal since I started university was to learn to code, and to be honest... I learned almost nothing .. lol... See when you study and work it gets pretty hard to even coupe with homework even worse when you only have one day off so I learn some bits of C++ and Java here and there enough to pass terms.

So as I was saying , its 2012 and I need to get a job on IT , I really didn't wanted to work at Help Desk fixing printers, I wanted to code and build software, the only problems was that most companies needed at least 3 year experience... fuck my life.So I made a huge decision and started to look for a internship somewhere in Cancun... I started to send emails to a few companies (to my surprise there's around 8 software companies down here) . 1 week later I got an email back from one of them, they ask me if I could come over for an Interview. Feeling nervous and dumb there I went.. lol I remember they ask me to do two exercises... the first one was to take any kind of string and reverse it.. without using functions...(they use Java) the other I don't remember cause I fail miserably on both... I got to nervous and couldn't think of a solution...  bummer. They said....thank you.. we will call you, ouch.

A month pass by and suddenly I got another email. Another company , .NET developers, 10 minutes from home(holy shit) for an internship. You see from the few things I was able to learn in university was C#. My final project was made in it so that help me a lot. Ok so , they ask me to do online test's for basic and some advance C# features + TSQL. I didn't fail miserably but got enough basic concepts to got me another interview. 

The interview goes pretty good, they like the fact that I speak English since most of their clients are from Canada and the US. They offer me an internship position for 6 months. After that time I have to take a certification test to see how much I learned, plus they gonna paid me(around 500USD a month). So I said.... fuck it lets do this. The only downside... the job was from 9am to 6pm... shit... what I'm gonna do with the front desk job?? I talked to my boss in the resort and told him I need to work in the evening shift. He was OK with it, on the internship place I convince them to let me work from 9 to 2pm even without pay, they agree and still pay me. For 4 months I spend all day working like literally ,I started the internship at 9am then rush out at 2pm and start at 3pm at the resort were I leave at 11pm. 

This was from Monday to Friday. So as you can imagine I started to feel miserably.

On the other hand... I was learning a lot.

Right away I get my hands on books , courses and videos on everything .NET.

They put me on a MVC4 project that was going to start from zero. The project leader was kind enough to go easy on me and started to explain everything... so there I was learning Entity Framework, MVC, Repositories, Moq,SCRUM  .... at some point my brain almost explode from all that information.

One day I talk to the wife and decided to leave the front desk job. This was like 4 months into the internship , I really wanted to get that certification. 

As you can imagine I pass the certification and land me the full time job.

Its been almost 1 year since I decided to do a complete change on my life. I think it was a good decision.

So far I been working with ASP, SQL server, MVC, Jquery, JavaScript, Unit Test,Reporting Services  and hope to get a new certification in a couple of months in HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

So , thank you learnprogamming cause some of the stuff I studied / study comes from here !

[Code Project] (http://www.codeproject.com)
Good examples of how to do this and that project

[DotNet Curry](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/)
Nice blog with examples

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
Always a starting point if you feel lost through a project or how to do x task.

Like I said previously you are never to old to learn and apply something new. Life is funny on how the decisions that you make change everything. Something that I realize now that I'm close to 30 is that you need to plan ahead, don't plan for today but for tomorrow. Save money, invest in your development , that steam game can wait. 

The rewards will come sooner or later but it's up to you.

Be taught about Computer Science by the [Chancellor of MIT](http://www.csail.mit.edu/user/807)!

The course will cover a broad section of 'computer science', starting with installing and programming in python (procedural, 'functional', object-oriented) and moving through statistics (plotting, monte carlo simulations), graphs, dynamic programming, etc.

I think it's important to understand the aims of the course. 6.00x is a *computer science* course, not a *programming* course. In the process of teaching you about computer science, you will be taught a language (Python) and the staff will be ready to assist you with any troubles you have with the language. But it's *more* than that; after the first month or so the course moves on from 'how to program' to 'how to use programming to achieve things'. My point is that Python is not, as such, the point of the exercise, and the skills learnt are transferrable to other languages. To view learning Python as the *primary* goal would be a mistake, though it's certainly *a* goal.

Beyond that, the aim of the course is to give you a wide – but not very deep – view of a number of topics in computer science. It is suited for non-computer-scientists who would be behooved to have some scripting capability/CS understanding, those who are simply interested, as well as computer scientists just starting out.

On an apologetic note towards those who took it last semester: we know the site was… buggy. And unreliable. Some of the backend is a great example of how *not* to design a system. This semester we are committed to it being less buggy and more stable. We can even actually get hold of ops guys when it breaks in the middle of the night on Saturday this time! It still won't work in Internet Explorer, though.

As a staff member for 6.00x, feel free to ask questions; I may or may not have any useful answers for you. Be excited!

**tl;dr**: [Learn how to computer science (and python)](https://www.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.00x/2013_Spring/about)! Starts Monday.

I wanted to give my story thus far to help others get started, because I am now on a progress high from how exciting it is to make an app.


**""*No* experience""**

It would be a lie to say I had absolutely no experience, but the experience I had was limited to my engineering 101 course, where we learn how to draft algorithms and make small programs in C++ and Matlab. If you can make a [game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) then you are at the level of familiarity I was when I began.

I had also dabbled in learning Ruby, Rails, CSS/HTML but literally had only done the codeacademy [web fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) track.

**Timeline**

Week 1 - lynda.com [objective-c course](http://www.lynda.com/Xcode-4-tutorials/Objective-C-Essential-Training/77860-2.html) completed. I originally went for the lynda iOS SDK course but in the first section it tells you to do the objective-c one. Not completely necessary if you're familiar, but helps get you comfortable with the environment (Xcode). I have a free account on lynda through my university, otherwise its like $25/mo.

Week 2 - lynda.com [iOS SDK](http://www.lynda.com/iOS-tutorials/iOS-SDK-Essential-Training/92179-2.html) course completed. Great videos that come highly recommended. All done through screen capture so you can watch them code in real time, as well as copy/paste or reference source files.

Week 3 - I took this week to brainstorm and draft a practice app. This may be a very difficult step for some and can be skipped but it helps keep you motivated to learn more. You will immediately discover something you want in your app (paged scroll views) that you dont know how to implement. So **google it** and begin learning. I can **guarantee** someone has already tried it and there is a tutorial available.

Week 4 - complete a decent, [testflight-able](https://testflightapp.com/dashboard/) app that you can share with people and **use**. Mine was an app to help you make decisions. The user was prompted with what options they have (i.e. competing products, iphone vs. galaxy), their criteria (i.e. price, graphics, ect.) and how much they care about each criteria, then an algorithm I knew would tell them which was the better product for them. PM me for source files.

Week 5 - Here is where I hit roadblock #1: Paged Scroll View. Hit up one of my developer friends and he sent me to [Ray Wenderlich's site](http://www.raywenderlich.com) which has **tons** of very helpful, very specific tutorials. Several other roadblocks and tutorials followed throughout the week.

Week 6 - completed [Stanford's iPhone App course](http://itunes.stanford.edu) on iTunes U. This is very informative with a good instructor but you dont get access to homework or grading so all you can do is follow along. Still worth watching.

Week 7 - completed Nick Kuh's [Foundation iPhone App Development](http://www.apress.com/9781430243748) book. This was a great read, and walks you through making a Birthday Reminder app in 5 days. Still using it as a reference, and was probably the best tool I used in the process.

Week 8 - if you haven't already started on a legit app, do it now. This is ultimately the best way to learn to code. Although that is said over and over again, I still dont always do that and I understand it is hard. But thats why we do it, right? to make stuff we would use. So make something. In the end, the cycle of having problems, finding a suitable solution, and implementing it, is the truest way to learn.

I just finished my first app with the help of a designer friend and I'm submitting it to the app store after this post!

TL;DR version: 

1. Set a goal and talk about it. You’ll need the pressure.
2. I recommend Codecademy as a learning platform. CodeYear 2013 has just started. No better time to start than now.
3. Once the euphoria is over, it gets really tough. But fun will be back.
4. Allow yourself a few weeks’ break after failing for the first time.
5. Get an account at Github. Be it only as an ironic statement first.
6. Tackle your first personal project as soon as you feel comfortable enough to apply some creativity.
7. Find an experienced programmer you can ask for help when you’re stuck.
8. And then it all comes together. From there, the sky’s the limit (okay, let’s say something sky-ish).
9. Don’t fixate on the journalistic value. It will get obvious soon enough.
10. Being able to code is a USP for journalists and allows you to think beyond existing formats.

So, in the wee hours of this morning, I did a thing. In response to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tkabf/mentorship/) I wrote [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tkabf/mentorship/c4neodc). Wherein I suggested that we form a github organization to collect some 'newbie-friendly' projects. The idea is to get a few of /r/learnprogramming's best and brightest, people who are skilled at certain technologies, languages, or whatever, and have them preside as curators over a set of projects which encourage open hacking. I've created such an organization at [github.com/LearnProgramming](http://www.github.com/LearnProgramming). I also included this in it's (presently sole) repository, detailing the idea behind the organization:

-------------------

#Overview 

LearnProgramming is an organization that grew out of the subreddit /r/learnprogramming, our aim is to provide a set of 'hackable' projects for beginners to contribute to in a open, encouraging atmosphere. In many cases, it seems, new programmers feel daunted by the task of contributing to open source, they don't know what to do, how to write code that meets standards, or how to really contribute in an effective way to open source projects. This organization intends to provide a playground, staffed by the best and brightest self-elected members of the /r/programming community, where the new open source contributor can cut their teeth; contributing to real projects used in the real world, without fear of reproach or denial due to their beginner status.

-------------------

So, the purpose of my post is twofold. Firstly, I want to know if this would garner any interest from potential mentors and learners alike. Secondly, I'm interested in volunteers. Presently there are three people, I think 6 or 8 is a good number for a first iteration to flesh out the idea. I hope to set up a fairly lightweight standards to help guide how we deal with projects. In principle, the members of the organization are responsible for the overall architecture as well as the more Product Owner-y duties of determining features and such. Of course, being a member of the organization is not requisite for participating in discussions regarding how it does it's work, or what works it does (in terms of projects, etc).

I would like it if anyone self-electing themselves to potential membership write out what kind of experience they have, and what their specialities are. At present, I would like to aim for one person in a 'region' of expertise (eg, I'm a Ruby and Haskell developer with a strong emphasis on CS Theory and 'Architecture'; Another might be a Java developer experienced with enterprise style development; another might be a C hacker who writes kernel code; etc), the aim being to give us a broad mix of people from which to draw ideas for projects. The guiding principle always being high code quality standards (for whatever that means for the given language), clearly defined standards for patch acceptance, and -- crucially -- an emphasis on not rejecting out of hand with minimal explanation, but rather taking opportunity to use patch rejection as a teaching opportunity. Emphasizing that rejection because you need to refactor/because you lack documentation/etc is not  something to be ashamed of, but rather an opportunity to learn why it is important to have good docs, good tests, and clean code.

------------------

To clarify, I think such an organization is necessary because too often we see eager young hackers trying to contribute, but are overcome by fear of rejection when contributing to ""big"" projects that they actually use. Even those that overcome that fear are often rejected in the worst possible way -- curt responses denying the request but never helping the requester to _learn why_. Even when they do 'help', it often comes in the form of 'RTFStandards Doc', rather than taking time to tell them that -- ""You need to refactor this code to use X pattern, it will make it more maintainable in the long run"". The reason they don't is understandable. Big project maintainers have better things to do then say, ""Hey, your code needs to change in ways X Y and Z because of reasons Q and R."" To that end, I hope that this organization can take some of that burden of training new programmers to contribute to open source away from the big projects. In essence, I see it as a community service, we get the learning contributor to understand how to craft a quality patch, and then they go and contribute to Rails or Django or whereever knowing that -- yah, it's important to have good commit messages, and you should really take time to clean up and refactor code, and all of the things we -- as experienced developers -- know intuitively.

-----------------

In summary, I don't know if this is a great idea, or even a good idea. I hope that it is met with as much enthusiasm as I have for it. I want to know what you think -- both experienced developers and newbies alike. Those already in the github org and myself have a few ideas for projects, I hope to have many projects operating concurrently, to provide a wide target for contribution. 

Please, be honest, even if it's brutal. I promise I won't be offended and will certainly try to be open and honest with you in return. I want to know if you think this idea is terrible, or fantastic, or anywhere in between.

If you are interested in being a mentor in the org, or already are, please leave a message here with a short summary of who you are an what your experience is. I'll leave an example below to help guide you. As we add more members to the org, I'll add this information to an AUTHORS in the standards and practices repo, so format it as if you would like it to last for perpetuity.

Also. Sorry for the wall of text. :)


-------------------------


Holy crap. This is an awesome response, I'm going to attempt to get things organized and add some more people to the Org as mentors. We'll then aim to come up with some initial projects (probably starting with a website, and I'm hearing a lot of interest in a roguelike or other kind of game, so maybe something along those lines).",,False,,t5_2r7yd,True,,,True,t3_tl1qy,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tl1qy/learnprogramming_on_github_a_place_for_you_to/,

&gt;##-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- Why Code? -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
&gt;
&gt;Start your coding journey by choosing a language that fits your needs: jQuery for animating websites, Python for analyzing data, or JavaScript for prototyping your next big idea. Which will you start with?
&gt;
&gt;**1. Python: Analyze data**
&gt;
&gt;If you work with information like neuroscientist Akira here, you need a quick and painless way to organize all &gt;your numbers, files or texts. Python, to the rescue!

&gt;
&gt;**2. jQuery: Animate a website**
&gt;
&gt;Pick up the basic skills to create, manage and maintain an interactive website. Jennifer learned jQuery to see her work in action — give it a try!

&gt;
&gt;**3. JavaScript: Build an app**
&gt;
&gt;Have an idea for an app? So did Jonathan. He learned JavaScript to build out his app, Simple Tax. Start making it real with this dynamic language.

A pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development: everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius. In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration. We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.

I have a good grasp (nowhere near complete) of python and dabbled in javascript.  
  
About half way through the summer, I found a novel problem that had no current solution at my work, and I decided to tackle it.  
  
Prior to this, I found it hard to program on my own volition, I couldn't think of a need to fill that I couldn't find elsewhere and tutorials were growing stale. And they have a ""known answer"".  
  
The project was to script a workflow from the input of an SD card to the output of a watermarked video with fading, (and plenty of steps in between) ready for our duplicator.  
A project with OSX applications, and decent applescript support.  
I took on the project entirely in applescript (with a few lines of bash) -- a mistake, but a necessary one.  
  
On my own, with clever searching, and plenty of brainstorming (boy did I learn that writing ideas/psuedocode is incredibly useful), I conquered problems more difficult than anything I have ever experienced.  
I figured out how to input user supplied variables into a 14.5k line XML file to edit a Motion template using sed.  
I suffered through the limitations and idiosynchrosies of applescript.  
I used sketchy workarounds.  
  
**I did it**  
I know I want to program for the rest of my life. I have much more in store for this.  
  
I am thinking about porting it to Python next, would another language be a better idea? Can I call applescript (it's needed for instructing apps in our workflow) from another language?  
  
I know I'll find the answer. I know I'll *make* the answer, if I have to.  
It's liberating. It's invigorating. It's edifying.

Has anyone felt this, and does it go away?",323,59,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ckl6r/im_currently_a_college_senior_less_than_a_year/,"(EDIT: The title should read ""When coding, I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, even though *my program* works"")

Like the title says, I'm currently less than a year away from completing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but I'm also a software testing intern at a major tech company.

I tend to strongly doubt my own programming ability, but from what I'm seeing, I really shouldn't be.  In one of my CS classes, we had ungraded practice assignments, and the professor pointed out that I was the only person in the class that finished them all, and that I had clean code.

At my internship, it was originally not intended to be a coding position.  I'm working for a team developing a driver, and originally I was only supposed to be testing things, making debugging logs, and looking through the source code to potentially find fixes.  I ended up fixing a minor bug that's plagued us for months, and found the cause (though not a fix) of a major bug that's been bothering us since I discovered it a couple months ago.

I've written code that can read Minecraft worlds and exports them to a ray-tracer for high-quality renders.

My supervisor asked me to write some code to extract status data from the driver we are developing and display it in a UI.  My supervisor was impressed that I pulled it off in only a few hours, and is now asking me to expand on it and create an API that the other engineers can use for performing automated testing.

And yet...I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.  I doubt myself.

A friend of mine said its the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

I had some knowledge of programming in high school and partly through college (though I dropped out of school because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and was failing all of my classes), but I realize now that it was very incomplete. I had many gaps in my knowledge and I did not grasp fundamentals, instead ""winging it"" through my school projects. For example, even though I had heard of and seen signed and unsigned integers used everywhere, I had no clue what the difference was and only figured that somehow signed integers were larger than unsigned integers. Now, of course, I understand that the difference is that a signed integer allocates the first bit as a sign bit in order to represent negative numbers!

With my time off from college and my current no-job situation, I realized that I actually did like to program and that computer science was interesting after all. I think the dislike that I felt toward the field in school was that I had never tried it recreationally and therefore always thought of it as a chore. Now, I want to start a career out of it. There's a bit of irony in that I have been studying harder the past couple of weeks than I have ever done in school.

I am about to finish my double major in CS and CE at a state University. I have worked as a professional web developer and I am currently finishing up an internship at Intel as a Software Engineering Intern. Though, I am in no way confident I could pass a Google coding interview. I know it's grueling. I have done similarly hard interviews with Microsoft and Amazon got fair but no cake. (it was a lie). This is the source of much turmoil in my life right now. I don't want to feel subpar at what I do for a living.

 I have tried to prepare, honestly. I pick up my copy of Cracking the Code (which you should get a copy of if you don't have one) but I just can't sit and study like that. It's dismal. I feel no excitement in just reading solutions. I want to build cool shit, fun shit, not reimplement  data structures then analyze it's BigOh complexity. That's been done millions of times.

&lt;I think what I mean here is I see little incentive to redo a problem from a book when I can look it up. I would like a more interesting approach that allows me to see the value. Or possibly an approach with feed back where creating a custom solution makes sense because people can inform me what I am doing wrong and why. I think they have a training package on Cracking the Code website but I am not willing to spend all that money for that.&gt; 

 I was wondering if anybody had a fun way to prepare for this type of interview. I guess I am looking for some type of challenge or community where I can solve interview style questions and have people tell me how stupid or awesome I am.....probably stupid at least at first. Sort of like a Sudoku a day type thing. Anybody have any resources? If you want to see some of what I have done in the past check out my GitHub (follow me plz...) https://github.com/SeanDunford

TLDR: I am an alright programmer. Are there any fun resources to become good enough to pass a Google coding interview. 


&lt;EDIT&gt;: People were misunderstanding me. I know that Big-Oh is good, cool, awesome, need to know it. I know data structures are the toolbelt to every great programmer. I want to gain knowledge of this but I can't really read and regurgitate. So what are some more interesting ways to learn them. 

&lt;Edit&gt;: /r/dailyprogrammer seems to be a great resource for what I am trying to achieve. I think exercism.io might have something similar as well. Thanks for all the responses please keep them going.  

&lt;Edit&gt; TIL: No matter what my approach is it's probably not going to be fun. So I should suck it up and stop being a baby.

Continuing from the recent success of my previous post on dungeon generation (**[Procedural Dungeon Generation Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/)**) I decided that I will post more game development articles and videos in the future to inspire the community and also hopefully promote my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com) as well!

This is the first of the multi-part series of updates about TinyKeep's AI, over the next few days I will be posting a series of videos about the monster intelligence system that I've developed for the game. Today I'm going to talk about simple roaming and chasing behaviours for a single monster. For the later parts, I'll progress to more sophisticated concepts such as Group Tactics and Rivalry.

I've posted a detailed **[YouTube video of the Roaming and Chasing behaviour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxfnFRB1Dg)**

In a nutshell, here's how it works:

1 . A connected waypoint graph is calculated for a new procedurally generated dungeon. Generally we will have one waypoint per room (though some larger rooms may contain 2 or 3), and a few waypoints along long corridors.

2 . By default a monster will be in non-alert (roam/patrol) mode, as it's not chasing anything. So, it will use A* (shortest path) pathfinding to travel to randomly selected waypoints in the dungeon.

3 . The monster has a FOV of 90 degrees, and can only detect another entity if it is in within its FOV and direct line of sight (we use raycasting to determine if a nearby enemy is in its direct line of sight).

4 . Once an enemy is detected, it's alert level is increased to 200 and it begins chase. We use the Seek Steering Behaviour on the monster to follow its target.

5 . If the enemy escapes line of sight, the monster is still able to follow it even though it can't see it. It does this by targeting ""smell trails"" or ""breadcrumbs"" that the enemy has left behind. Again the monster uses Seek to follow the trail. Most recent trails are detected via line of sight (raycasting) and are tracked first. Trails are not detected if the monster is not in alert mode. 

This is the most important part of the AI, as it allows the monster to follow an enemy all around the dungeon even though it can't see its quarry - so if an enemy hides behind a corner the monster can still find him. The best thing about this elegant solution is that it does not need to use any expensive or complicated pathfinding, planning AI or anything like that. Neither does the monster need to have any internal representation of the dungeon layout. The player has done the hard work for the AI, by leaving behind the trail to follow.

6 . Trails decay over time (smells disappear), so eventually the monster will stop following if it hasn't seen the enemy for a while. At this point, the monster's alert level runs down. The monster is confused, looks around for a bit, decides that he has lost the enemy and goes back to the patrol routine.

7 . All the while - a handful of rays are cast (about 6) around the monster to detect nearby walls. If it exceeds a certain distance the monster is repelled from the wall using the Separate Steering Behaviour. This pretty much guarantees that monsters won't get stuck on walls, corners and other awkward features of the dungeon.


That's pretty much it!


You can have a play yourself on the interactive demo shown on the video:

If you like what you see, stay tuned for parts 2-5 where I'll be discussing more complex aspects of the AI:


Part 2: Retreating and Defense

Part 3: Foraging

Part 4: Group Tactics and Luring

Part 5: Monster Rivarly!

I currently work at a large startup in a sales/support role, and after talking with some of the developers, they seem to have a better day-to-day experience, higher pay, and higher job satisfaction.  It's amazing how passionate some are about developing and solving challenges.

How can I train myself to code, so as to be employable?  It seems from poking around here that going back to school for a CS degree isn't really necessary as long as I can build a ""portfolio"" and talk about my experience/knowledge.

How long might this take given I have to work full time during the day?  When could I potentially start looking for a job?  1 year, 2 years?

I know I'll likely need to be familiar with multiple languages, which ones are experiencing growth and most likely to get me employed?

I'm assuming I'd be going after a junior level position, which sucks at 30, but I'm guessing I might be able to make more than I'm making now.  What is the expected pay range for a junior developer?

It's sometimes an unpopular opinion in programming circles, but I prefer the structure of a good book when learning a language rather than just looking things up on the internet or following ""Joe's PHP#.Net 4.0 Tutorial"". 

Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad programming books out there. Even O'Reilly, once a symbol for tech book excellence, puts out its share of stinkers these days. Another problem is that some books are just too shallow. I don't need a book showing me the syntax for if statements and loops.

What I'd like to do is keep this post as a master reference for suggesting language books. They might not be the best books to buy and keep in a cherished place on your bookshelf, next to the copies of SICP and TAOCP that you *swear* you've read, but they're great to read once if you've got a Safari Library subscription or something.

Here's what I propose:

* Top-level comments should be a single language (might be worth it to separate C# and .Net as separate topics). No commentary or book recommendations here.  
* Second level comments should be a *single* book recommendation, with a ""skill level"" clearly marked (see below).  
* Third level and below, discussion about the book.  

Skill Levels:
  
* Intro: Aimed at programmers new to a particular language. Use 'Basic Intro' if it assumes you've never programmed before at all.  
* Intermediate: Assumes a familiarity with a language, and that the reader is already a competent programmer in said language or similar ones. These are probably books showing how to write ""idiomatic code"" in the language. These are the books you read and absorb to become a senior developer.  
* Pro: Nuts and bolts of a language. A new programmer would have no hope of getting through these books without serious struggles. Specific implementation details are discussed in depth, etc.

On the one hand, I was very clear that I only really *knew* Java, C# and C++ - and I got hired anyway, so maybe I'm being hard on myself... but I can't help but feel like I am about to be getting in over my head. As far as I understand it (I'm meeting with him tomorrow to go a little bit more in-depth), his company is being contracted by local businesses to create websites and he hires freelance programmers (and the occasional misfit such as myself) to code them up and speak to the clients about what their needs are.

Here is the agreement that my new boss and I came to:

&gt; REDACTED will contract with you on a project-by-project basis for an agreed price on delivery and approval by the client. It is understood you will invoice REDACTED when the work is complete: a simple numbered and dated invoice will do.

&gt; Work undertaken for REDACTED but not directly involved in programming for a project or in getting information about the project (e.g., requesting files, content, or seeking clarification) should be tracked and invoiced at REDACTED/hour. I have in mind client meetings, or assistance with technical matters for the company, etc. You would track those hours, when they occurred and what they were for.

&gt; You will likely also want to track the time you spend directly on projects to see how you're doing in terms of effective $/hr. I expect that as you learn and become familiar with the toolset your productivity will increase to a level much higher than REDACTED/hr. I would want that too since it means we can deliver projects more quickly. Time you spend in learning the toolset is not billable.

**He is basically taking a chance at me;** a self-taught programmer with no **real-world** (filling a clients needs) experience. 

I told him my goal was to get some industry experience before I start school in the fall, and he has accepted me with the above general agreement (and another agreement which is protected by NDA, but involves the same type of work). I am both extremely excited but also very nervous. My experience is in the languages stated above, and the work that he will have me doing (as far as I understand it) will be primarily in CakePHP / PHP / HTML5 / CSS / JS. 

I told him I can pick up languages quickly, and I do. My worry is about how much the ""web development"" world differs from my current experience in programming (non-web-based applications). He is taking me on with confidence that I will spend sufficient unpaid on-the-side time to learn the skills I need. This is something which I am **wholeheartedly** willing to do because it means I am going to get a sweet reference on my resume, some insight as to what programming for a client is like, and most importantly a kick-start to my career before I even attend college in the fall. 

He has also said that he is interested in, if I do the work well, continuing to have me work for him during my degree.

I realize this is long-winded but I guess I'm just looking for some... reassurance, or advice. Was anyone else this nervous stepping into the ACTUAL software industry for the first time, or am I unprepared if I feel this way? One side of me is happy and thinks I can learn the new languages + fundamentals of web development quickly enough, the other side thinks I'm about to be way in over my head and that this will turn out to be a disaster. Imposter syndrome! :(

**TL;DR: Got hired with no industry experience to do contract web development work through a local company. I have no experience with web development; all my experience lies in Java, C++, and C#. My newfound employer understood this and is hiring me anyway, with the understanding that I'll put in the necessary time to learn the languages and skills on the side. I'm worried that I am in over my head, and that me feeling this nervous about stepping into the industry for the first time means that I am unprepared, and that other people weren't this nervous. Any advice to give me?**

The more your question reveals about what you are thinking, the easier it will be for a knowledgeable expert to answer it. Programmers sometimes have a reputation for being grumpy about answering questions, but I think the reason is that they want to make progress in a conversation, and that requires both sides to put in effort. If you ask a smart, detailed question that shows you are thinking, you will generally get good results.

after reading this: http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/128lzm/i_want_to_really_dig_into_programming_but_i_am/

i decided that it might be a good idea the make a tutorial on how to apply math to programming, focussed on people who don't know a whole lot about math. 

(see my post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/128lzm/i_want_to_really_dig_into_programming_but_i_am/c6ta82w )

because those are basicly all about the math behind them, and i think something like this is a nice way to get into math and programming.


but just so you know, i'm deffinetly no professional programmer/mathematician, i just do this as a hobby in my free time. meaning that there are probably other people who have similar tutorials who know way more than me. thing is, i never found them, and when i found something similar it was always either to simple, or too advanced.

so just let me know what you think.

I was a man without a major taking classes that sounded interesting.  Additionally, my math and science background was/is incredibly weak.  

I fell in love the first moment a dark console window happily greeted the world.  It reminded me of 2nd grade sitting my on grandpa's lap as we tinkered with pre-written basic code(possibly) on some ancient technology, taking breaks between games of donkey kong and frogger. It took me almost 2 decades to rediscover coding.   For the first time in my life I  discovered something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. Something that is challenging , fun, and I could perhaps con someone into paying me for if I were motivated by money. I quickly got a new major, C++ turned into computer science, visual basic, java, html, sql, and all manner of coursework related to them.  



I never felt like a programmer at any point.  Every assignment was a struggle.  Some concepts I absorbed like oil into water, some I still don't totally grasp(OOP).  It embarrassed me to see talented programming students effortlessly come up with solutions to what I thought were complex problems.  I always felt like I was running into a wall.  I never really found reddit helpful either, all the code I encounter here is like some masters level project or a poorly documented compiler hack-fu orgasm that would scare away most novices.  


My fall term ended up being a disaster.  I was working 5 days a week and had 6 classes at the same time.  I got burnt out and began to question why I was even doing any of this.  I had lost sight of learning and was trying to have the worlds greatest GPA and graduate as fast as possible.  


Then came this winter term.  I had run out of pell finacing due to my major switch, my fall burnout, and 2 serious illnesses.    I only signed up for one class, Assembly and Computer Architecture.  One of the scarier beasts in the programing world.  I walked in prepared to have it proven to me I didn't belong in coding, what really happened was instantly bliss.  I was back on the ground level , all of the layers of abstraction that were confusing the hell out of me were gone.  I was back to learning to problem solve in tandem with a machine.  Epiphanies occurred while working on each assignment.  My enthusiasm was becoming obnoxious.  I was spending 16 hr sessions fighting bit by bit trench warfare and loving it.  I was very likely spending 40+ hours a week just learning/coding assembly.  After the first month I would come to class and watch as the same classmates I felt inferior too were struggling with the problems I thought were obvious.   Yesterday, after 5 days straight of doing nothing but working on my final project (a program that makes building sprites in assembly, with assembly , fast and easy) I received what I consider the first high praise of anything I have ever coded (or done in school period) , an endorsement to have my code published on the easy68k website. I don't even think it is that great, and I still need to finish a few things, still, I'm ecstatic about having anything I've done consider not terrible and worthy of teaching others. 


So,  I just want to say to anyone struggling out there, narrow your focus, put your head down, and just keep running into these walls.  You'll break them down with your tireless effort.  

Also, I recommend that everyone study a lower level language, it really opens your eyes to how all the high level code is doing what it does.

It just makes me happy that it works well, and I just want to share it with you all!

I knew very little about web development (As in, I didn't even know how to link a CSS sheet to an HTML page) and I noticed that a lot of jobs were looking for some web developers. Given that my main languages have been in .NET, I chose to stick with ASP.NET and make a page about finding subreddits and graphing their subscribers over time. I wrote a bot in C# to do the following:

Every 80 seconds, grab the subreddit information (as well as a few other relevant pieces of information) from the newest 100 posts posted in /all/. Then, every 2 seconds, iterate to a new subreddit on the list of all subreddits ever seen using this method and grab subscriber data and log the time as well. 

Then, I spent a lot of time looking at how to make ASP.NET pages work. I learned all about state variables and post backs, I learned about calling javascript functions and the use of nice libraries (I used Shadowbox and jqPlot), I learned all about CSS and leveraged my decent C# skills to create a custom tag cloud (All of the controls available to the public I found didn't do exactly what I wanted). 

I want to add some nice design to it, but that takes a bit more learning because I have no designer's eye at all unfortunately. :(. It's on my list of things to do, though, for sure.

(If you are thinking about stepping forward as a mentor, a word of advice: use email. Seriously. Reddit's messaging system is not designed for this. At all.)

---

You're a new programmer. You're a high school student; you're studying computer science at a university; you don't like your current job and you want to try something new; you've been programming for fun for a while but you want to get serious; whatever. I think a mentorship might be a good way to go about that.

I don't have a lesson plan or anything. This isn't a tutorial, though I'll hopefully compile helpful questions and answers into a (free online) book later. I was thinking I'd put this out there and see what the response was and go from there. Optimally you would have an idea in mind, like ""I want to make a side-scrolling platformer game"" or ""I want to make a website where people can vote on cat pictures,"" and I'd tell you the sorts of things you need to study in order to do that, helping you along the way. Or if you just want someone to consult every now and then when you get stuck, I can do that too.

I found the hardest part of learning to program is just getting a handle on what's out there: where do you start? What's the first step towards making a website? What's a ""compiler""? There are few high-level overviews of this sort of thing, so I thought having someone to ask might be helpful. It's what I wanted when I was learning to program, anyway.

This isn't a homework helper or anything. If you just want to pass your CS classes, there are plenty of resources for that. I'm interested in teaching long-term skills for people who want to program because they like programming, not just because the money's so good.

**Do you have any weird pedagogic opinions that will impact your mentoring style?**

I would like to try teaching multiple programming languages at the same time. That might sound a little crazy, but I think it would be valuable for people to see that there are lots of ways of doing things, and tying yourself down to a single language is very limiting. All statements in Java are in methods because that's a Java design decision, not because it has to be that way. Strings are immutable in Python but mutable in Ruby; that's another decision.

Optimally you would have single language that you want to learn (or I would help you pick one). It can be just about anything. But along the way, we'd look at other languages just to get an idea of the landscape and hopefully to reinforce concepts in your ""main"" language.

I am very experienced with Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, CoffeeScript, Objective-C, C, and C++. I have light experience with Ruby, Haskell, Scheme, Clojure, PHP, Perl, and a slew of other lesser-known languages. As far as related skills go, I'm also very proficient with HTML, CSS, SQL, and a healthy dose of frameworks (jQuery, Cocoa Touch, blah blah blah). But the main thing that I want to impress is that learning to program isn't about learning a language; it's about learning to program. Yes, you need to know a language or two to do that. But learning a programming language is like learning to talk: it don't make you a good speaker.

**Who are you?**

I'm a long time Stack Overflow contributor who recently discovered this subreddit. I like helping people program; I don't know why. I'm about to graduate from one of the top ten computer science programs in the US. I've been programming for over ten years, I've been doing software internships throughout my college career, and I have a great job lined up after school. I'm not certified to teach or anything; I just thought this would be a Good Thing to do.

I've definitely still got a lot to learn, and there are lots of areas that I wouldn't be much help at. Want to become a kernel security auditor? Look elsewhere. But as far as the basics are concerned, I've been through everything you're about to go through and made it out to the other side.

**What do you get out of this?**

I'd like to write a book for beginning programmers. But it's been a while since I learned how to code, so I'm not completely in tune with what sorts of questions new programmers have. Basically, I don't want to make the sort of assumptions that tend to make beginner resources inaccessible, like ""make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`"" -- that's the sort of thing that an experienced *nix user would say, but would probably turn off a beginner. I want someone to call me out on that sort of thing.

I'm also designing my own programming language, and I'd like to make it as accessible to beginners as possible. I think it would be valuable to see what concepts are intuitive and what concepts are tend to be difficult for new programmers.

**What do I do?**

Comment or message me with what you want to do (specific is better than general) and we'll go from there. Email is probably the best way to do this long term, though some kind of live screensharing thing might be helpful sometimes.

**TL;DR** You want to learn how to program; I want to teach you.

**Edit**: Okay, I clearly didn't think this through very well. I was thinking one-on-one would be the best way to get a feel for the types of questions and stumbling blocks people go through, and I'd actually have time for that sort of thing.

If you're really serious about this, send me a message describing where you'd like to start (like a specific project) or questions that you currently have. Not necessarily, like, a ton of detail, but it'll be a lot easier to differentiate that sort of post than a bunch of people saying they're interested.

If this turns into something valuable I'll compile exchanged messages or something into something more useful for a larger audience, so if I'm slighting you now there may be some recompense down the road.

**Further edit**: I've gotten a ton of requests so far but they show no sign of slowing down. I'm going to wait until this calms down a bit before I start sorting through requests and responding to people, so if you write me don't expect a response immediately. I'd like to help more than one person, but I definitely can't take on 50, so apologies in advance if I say I can't help. (I've never done this before!)

Also, I'm getting a lot of requests for people wanting to learn Android development. While I'm pretty familiar with Java, I have no experience with Android. If you're someone completely new to programming in general who wants to one day make Android apps, I can help, but if you're an experienced Java developer looking to get into the ecosystem I'm not going to be much use. Maybe there are some Android pros out there who are interested in mentoring?

**Here's where I'm coming from**

* My previous experience with coding is limited. I know the basics of HTML and CSS and have played around with Python and PHP.
* I'm doing this for personal (rather than professional) reasons. I don't work in tech, I'm just interested in it.

**What I'm planning on doing**

* I'll have about an hour a day to dedicate to the project.
* I'm planning on following Zed Shaw's ""[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)"" with the PDF and videos. I'm estimating that this'll take up about half of my allotted time, so I'm looking for suggestions on what else to practice/study/build.
* I know learning something is easier with a project in mind, so my project is to build a simple [Pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)-like timer that'll run automatically and count and display the number of cycles it has run.
* I'm trying to keep my expectations of what I can learn in a month realistic. If I learn a lot, great. If I learn a little, also great. I just want the time to be well spent.

**Where I hope this takes me**

* Eventually I'd like to be able to build and program wireless environmental sensors (sort of like what [this guy](http://www.howmuchsnow.com/arduino/dylos/) is doing, but including [XBee](http://www.adafruit.com/category/29) or something similar), but I know that goal is a long way off.
* I'd also like to incorporate what I learn into my classroom (I'm a teacher).

Yesterday was a big day for the LearnProgramming community.  We have officially passed 75,000 subscribers, with more joining every day.  We're steadily growing out of our ""small community"" phase and into one of the larger subreddits on the site.  With this milestone, the moderators thought you might enjoy seeing some statistics about this community.

* We have [over 150,000 unique visitors every month](http://i.imgur.com/rASBzuz.png), almost reaching 300,000 at times.
* Those visitors view [800,000 pages per month](http://i.imgur.com/4uxfb1U.png) (An average of 5 pages per person)

**New Design**  
With the growing number of users, things have gotten a little cluttered.  We receive constant requests to add/update the Sidebar with new tools, resources, and links.  We hope to consolidate many of these suggestions into a redesign.  If anyone is experience with CSS (and particularly, theming Subreddits), please message the moderators with some examples of your work (ideally, other subreddits).  If you've got what it takes you'll be the official designer (and another moderator) for the subreddit.

**Moderator Applications**  
With the community growing at a steady pace, the moderation team has decided that we need to ""hire"" two more moderators to assist in keeping the community in check.  Who better to decide who should help keep this place tidy than the community itself.  **If anyone is interested in becoming a moderator, please follow the steps below:**

* Make a top-level comment on **this thread** explaining your experience in the industry, and your expertise
* In your comment, also mention any Subreddits you currently moderate
* In your comment, please explain _why_ you would like to moderate the community
* The community will vote up the best applications
* The moderators will contact the applicants to make final decisions

We are looking for dedicated, intelligent people that are ""geographically distinct"" from the rest of the team, as well as active on the subreddit.  We're hoping to have round-the-clock access to keep everyone happy, remove inappropriate comments, and save posts from the (overzealous) spam filter.  

  
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Thanks**  
Finally, the moderators would like to thank the community for being the mature, responsible community that it is.

-----------------------------

**The first session was done on Monday, despite so many of you saying that you would attend only 3 guys attended the session. It does no make sense for me to continue putting so much time into building these sessions if there is no interest. So I have decided to discontinue the sessions. The video of the first session will be available for the next 7 days at [Learn C# at Justin.tv](http://justin.tv/sanddy19).**



**SCHEDULE**

This will keep getting updated, but here is the rough schedule for first 2 days:

* Monday 21 May - 8:30AM EDT to 10:30AM EDT - Day1 - .NET Platform, Introduction to C#, Programing your first application, understanding your first application.

~~Tuesday 22 May -  8:30AM EDT to 10:30AM EDT - Day2 - Data Types/Variables, Operators, Conditional Statements~~

**Stream Link** 

[Learn C# at Justin.tv](http://justin.tv/sanddy19)


--------------------------------------

I have been a Microsoft MVP C# for 4 years as well as I have co-authored and edited a couple of books on the MS .NET Platform. 

I have some free time in office in the coming weeks and would like to teach C# over Skype (or any other video sharing platform) to redditors for **free**! 
I have not completely planned it, but it should take about 2 weeks of 1-2 hrs calls every week day to get C# basics done. More totally depends on the response that I get from the community. 

Only hiccup is that I stay in Mumbai, India, so the best suitable time for me would be between 6pm (Indian Standard Time GMT +5:30) - to 8pm. 

It makes sense for me to conduct these sessions if there are at least 5 people interested. More the better. So let me know your views and if you would find this kind of training helpful. 

Disclosure: I own a software small development company [AksTech](http://akstech.com) in Mumbai as well as I write articles on my site [Master C#](http://mastercsharp.com) (older content). I am not a professional trainer, although I have spoken at various local Microsoft events. I am not looking at any promotion or any way to make money off this effort. 
If there are any questions please do ask, I'll clarify. 

**EDIT**: 
It will help me if the users who are interested could verify if the time 8:30 EDT to 10:30 EDT would work out for them as well as their level of general programming knowledge.   

I do plan to upload the recoded videos later. 

**No Need to Sign-up:** I have got enough interest expressed, so I am working on drawing up a schedule and will post it to this same thread by tomorrow latest. So please check back at this post tomorrow for updated information.

**Note for those who plan to attend**

**System Requirements**
Windows Vista/Windows 7/8 PC

Please install [Visual C# 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-csharp-express) - its a free download from Microsoft. Make sure after installation you have got the product key and activated it.

/////////////////

 **C**

////////////////

*Introduction*
 
(Procedural language, No Garbage Collection) Is a general purpose language developed between 1969 and 1973  by Dennis Ritchie. C greatly influenced other programming languages. The language encouraged cross platform programming. Because C has a straight forward compiler, it was used for applications that formally coded in assembly Language. *Difficulty*: It is a difficult language to learn for beginners, but doable. Learning this language will create a strong foundation for learning other languages.

 **C++**

 /////////////////

*Introduction*
 
 is a statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, compiled, general-purpose programming language. Jargon aside for the beginners, this language is suppose to be enhancement to the C language. It introduces the concept of reusing code(Object Oriented). As stated, it is a General Purpose language and is used everywhere. *Difficulty* It is a difficult language to learn for beginners but also doable. C++ has a lot of features to work with and is very flexible compared to other languages, because of this it can be hard to learn and easy to make a mistake while coding.

 **C#**

/////////////////

*Introduction*
 
 C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 4.0, which was released on April 12, 2010. It is a Windows version of Java without the cross platfrom ability of Java.

 **JAVA**

/////////////////

*Introduction*
 
 The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. In other words, writing in Java allows your to write the source code once, and works on every computer. This language is rapidly growing in popularity due to its cross-platform flexibility. FYI: Android apps are written in Java.

I first made a carbon copy changing only the syntax. Last week I got it running with matching results. The run time in my fortran version was 14 seconds with the original code taking about 21 seconds. Hooray fortran is faster. I then made some small changes to get a runtime of 12 seconds using output from gprof. But then I noticed the output from the gnu profiler (gprof) only accounted for about 1 second of run time. So I looked it up. Apparently gprof does not track standard function calls like read and write. So I broke out the big guns. I installed valgrind (an amazing open source profiler). I used the callgrind tool and kcachegrind to make a call table that showed where my program spent all of its time. My program spent 80% of its time in a simple routine. The routine interploated a table. The reason it took so long was that I reread the table each time the routine was called. So I made it read once and store to a variable. I ran it again and the new run time was 1.6 seconds. Almost an 8x speed up. The original plan was to go parallel, but now I shouldn't have to. So remember, profile your code and know what it is up to. 

EDIT: A lot of people are making good points about when to optimize. Optimization should only be done when it is worth your time. My program currently runs in 12 seconds, but it will later be built up and be run for two dimensions (21 gridspaces each running this code and likely other changes). Not only will the IO slow me down, it will hurt any future attempts to parallelize the code. Also, this is a code that will likely get passed around to other researchers and it is likely that some poor sap will later inherit this code to change and adapt for their research. I want it to be a good representation of myself. Please remember that this is a tool, and just because you have a tool, does not mean it is the right tool for every job.

However, I can't do any cool, useful stuff. I hear about someone going through his computer trying to rename each file in his drive in a laborious way, and someone else comes along and goes into the command line and whips out a short code that does it quickly. I hear in another thread some kid gets into the command shell on his school's computers and changes permissions so he can get at games. etc.

These things are cool, useful, often associated with ""computer programming,"" and I don't know how to do them, or even what category they fall into so that I can *start* learning.

Things I'd be interested in:
--Learning enough python to write scripts that actually work with the internet. I have little interest in writing stuff that can't work with things I scour off web pages and feeds, because that's where the world is now. Don't know where to find it.

--Command line scripts that let me automate handy stuff on the computer aka be a power user?

Hello everyone,

Today (Sat, Oct 20) I am going to continue my ongoing series about how to build a web application framework from scratch. (It is over now, but you can watch it at http://www.justin.tv/livecompsci )

In this course, I plan on covering most of the different skills and technologies you need in order to be an effective web developer. For example, you need to set up a web server and for that you need a web server software, such as Apache. You also will typically need a server side scripting language, to handle everything that happens to your code in order to create what the end-user will see, and for that we will be using PHP. You also need a database to store your information, and for that we will be using MySQL, and so on.

In this course you will learn about how to build your own complex web applications, as well as learn about the different technologies that make it possible. In addition, you will be able to see what it is like for someone to work real-time including research and troubleshooting when necessary.

When you have completed this course, you should be able to build your own web applications from scratch as well as have a significant understanding of a wide range of technologies relevant to that process including web servers, databases, version control, and more. 

In the previous sessions, we have covered the following:

----

[Session #1, Oct 6, 2012 (Click to watch)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WdftjZepww)

Major topics that were covered:

* Setting up a server (Amazon EC2, Cloud based virtual machine server)
* Setting up a web server (Apache 2.0 on an Ubuntu Linux Machine)
* Configuring a development environment (GNU Screen, VIM, using bash, etc.)
* The basics of networking and IT security (firewall rules, how to open/close ports, etc.)
* The basics of using a version control system (GIT)
* The basics of server side scripting (PHP)

In this session, we created a simple web server and demonstrated the ability to create a web page that is accessible over the internet, as well as the basics of creating dynamic webpages using PHP.

----

[Session #2, Oct 13, 2012 (Click to watch)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHuH19D8JtU)

Major topics that were covered: 

* How to use GNU Screen to save your work/session for later.
* The basics of HTML and Forms
* The basics of how to use log files, including using error log files.
* Using .htaccess to force all URLs to go to a central ""controller""
* The basics of Model View Controller methodology.
* The basics of Regular Expressions.

In this session we explored GNU screen more, including how to log off and log back into our server without losing our work. We also modified the .htaccess file and used Mod Rewrite in order to create a basic PHP controller so that all URLs hitting our server would be forced to go through that centralized PHP page. 

----

[Session #3, Oct 20, 2012 @ 9:00 PM EST (Watch it live!)](http://www.justin.tv/livecompsci)

Major topics expected to be covered:

* Setting up a MySQL Server, the basics of SQL
* Creating simple PHP scripts that store data in a MySQL database
* The basics of using Sessions
* More about using GIT for version control, including saving entire repositories for later.
* Further development of the MVC itself

As with all sessions, I am doing this ""blind"". I am not doing any preparation before the session, that way you get the experience of seeing what it is really like to do something like this from scratch. I am going into this only with my prior know-how and experience, so expect me to Google for things when I get stuck, and to perhaps spend some time troubleshooting when something doesn't work right.

1345699189.0,159,self.learnprogramming,yojok,Something I just realized I thought might help some of those learning,184,25,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yojok/something_i_just_realized_i_thought_might_help/,"So I've been learning C++ on my own via a book.  Standard dry material that is hard for me personally to stick to.  I've gotten better about it and have gotten farther than I have been before.

Something I realized today though, is that I need to **slow down**.  I read fairly quickly, and programming material usually isn't stuff you should read quickly.  If I read at my regular speed when it comes to programming material, things slip through the cracks.  I end up in the middle of a paragraph and forget how I got there.  

When reading dense material (as in information-ally dense), getting the gist of what you're reading isn't enough, as it usually is for regular books.  You need to thoroughly grasp and understand every sentence when it comes to programming.  If you don't, you're just making it harder for yourself.

I also realized that concepts won't sink in immediately, **and that's OK**.  If you follow a video tutorial for something and feel a bit lost, stick with it and finish it.  Then go back and do it again.  It's an entirely different experience the second time around.  Once you have the basic concepts understood, your eyes open to the complexities of the material and you see it much clearer.  I used to say to myself 'I shouldn't have to watch something twice, I should understand it the first time.', but that isn't true.  Programming is too complex, and it's not always going to be that way.  

It's not a race.  The goal is to learn.  If you have to read something 5 times to get it to sink in, **do it** so that it sinks in, because that's the result you're after.  This is a bit of a ramble, but I thought it might be relevant to others.

As /r/learnprogramming exists as a resource for users to pose questions and get help regarding specific issues, it has been realized that it would be beneficial for those who are coding, those who are learning, those who are teaching and helping to be able to gather together and work on practical projects.

It is understood that while there are incredible books, a vast library of online resources, and Massively Open Online Courses popping up left and right, working alongside real humans can be incredibly rewarding.

It is with this introduction that I introduce /r/collaboratecode.

The aim of this subreddit is not to take away from /r/learnprogramming but rather to expand upon it, build upon it, and complement it. We aim to bring coders together, whether they are looking to learn [LTL] or looking for a group [LFG].

------

**Looking To Learn [LTL]:**

This tag is used for posts made by those looking to learn. This helps others connect with those who are ready and eager to learn by offering their services (teaching). 

**Looking For Group [LFG]:**

This is for those looking for a group; that is, they need some people to help them with a given project. This allows others to search the postings for projects and join forces on a project of interest. (Note: This is not a ""Do My Project For Me"" thing.)

------

**Mentors:**

We are in talks to get various mentors of various programming languages to help out. This will be immensely helpful to those looking to learn and to those who are looking for help on a project. Mentors are mentioned countless times all over the internet when it comes to how someone really got going in improving their skill level. People are also encouraged to talk to us about becoming a mentor! The help is greatly appreciated, both by the moderators and the members of the community who need the help.

**Google+ Community:**

We'll be using Google+ pretty extensively due to the fact that it has Hangouts. Hangouts are great in that we can video chat with multiple simultaneously and archive our sessions for those who may miss a session or someone who might just be visiting (also will be uploaded to YouTube). Link below.

**Active Project List:**

We maintain an active project list in the sidebar that lists the projects that are posted on the subreddit. It's a nice and quick way to view all the current projects that are ongoing, as well as links to the project's repo. Further, we will implement project status in the future. Link below.

------

**UPCOMING EVENT**

*Android Session:*

Our very own /u/plaid_pancakes is hosting the first of his introductory Android development sessions tomorrow **Thursday, June 6** at **2:30 PM PDT**. This will be hosted as a Hangout through our Google+ community! We encourage you to go!

*Here's the kicker:*

The site is targeted towards novice programmers. While they're coding stuff up online, they have the option to request on-the-spot help if they get stuck at any point. The experienced coders(you), will see these help requests popping up on your dashboard and can answer them.
When that happens, you go into a live chat session with them and you can see their code and collaborate, edit, and chat with them. When you answer a call for help, you get paid for helping out.
So basically, think of it like a live-help version of stack overflow. This is something you could do on the side, fielding questions and help requests in multiple tabs while getting paid to do so, on your own schedule.

Is this a site you'd be interested in using?
What kind of features would you like to see?
How much would you be willing to pay for on-demand on-the-fly coding help?

2 months ago I began my planned internship at a small company, iPinion - Hired to develop an application for their business and private users. 
With no previous experience with either Android or Java I set out on the most challenging development journey I had ever ventured. 

Today I released an early version of my app. I'm head over heels excited. Even though this is a small feat for many I can't help but feel a certain amount of pride thinking about actually having a piece of software that I made myself out there, on the market for the whole world to see.

[Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lite.ipinion) is a link to my app on Google Play. It's not much and it's practically useless for non-customers but it's given me so much in terms of pure teoretical knowledge, know-how and a general idea of what it's like to develop an entire product from scratch.

I've been programming for nearly 1 year now, and I've currently been working on a small little chess program just for more practice and to refine my skills more. My friend, who has been coding for a lot longer than I have, also decided to write one at the same time. I came across a problem in the midst of my work that I asked him for some help with. When he looked at my code he was astounded at how ""overly complicated"" I had made everything. He was referring to the way I had made nearly every aspect of the chess game an object. For instance, I had a Chessboard object that held subclasses of the Chesspiece object, like pawn/knight/rook/etc. His implementation, on the other hand, was more or less an array representing all the chess spaces with integer values in each index representing which piece if any was there. This seems pretty smart, and maybe much easier to me, but at the same time I'm very confused - all of my tutorials and learning up until now have preached the greatness of object oriented programming. If I have a car, I don't represent the car as an array with car parts as integer values; I make a car object with smaller objects composing it.

Am I thinking about OOP in the wrong way? Is my friend thinking about OOP in the wrong way? Is OOP not the end-all-be-all of programming?

Also, like I mentioned up top, does this apply to all languages? My knowledge outside of Java is very limited :/

Thanks for any help.

Edit: Thanks everyone for posting, I'm glad this was able to spark a healthy discussion. An especially big thanks to /u/zzyzzyxx , ""the great OOP scholar"" :) Basically, I wasn't even aware before this post that other paradigms even *existed* besides OOP, so it's very enlightening to know there is variation, and I certainly have more reading to do.

Think of each statement like a Lego piece.  It has a fairly specific set of limitations, but the number or ways in which it can be used is nearly infinite.  Some pieces, or even combinations of pieces are very basic and core to the task.  Others are highly specialized and a total bitch to track down when you need them.

Each programming language is like a specialty Lego set.  There a dinosaur sets, Star Wars sets, pirate sets, etc.  You can adapt them to make anything you want, but they will always excel at the task for which they were intended.  It's the specialty pieces that make this so.

I learned to program when I was 10, and I never saw it as something that I had to accomplish to finish a project or start a career.  For me, at that age, it was just playing with something new.  Each time I hit a road block, I would see it as a puzzle to be solved - a mystery to figure out.  Each lesson learned resulted in a new puzzle piece to add to my repertuar.

That's the thing about programming that is akin to magic for me.  Eventually, you realize that you're not beholden to the set of Lego pieces you're given.  You have, at your fingertips, a machine shop that will cut the casting dies to make any piece you desire.  The statements of any programming language aren't limited to that which you've been given.  You can add your own special statements and make your own special purpose Lego sets that build the things you want to build.  This is why colleges try to teach you the fundamentals like C++ or Java.  These are the core sets which can make anything.

In the end, programming is very much like sculpting.  It's a playground of the mind where the only limitation is your imagination.  Learn how to take joy in that activity and honestly see it as play.

The curriculum is simple: I have the semester to write an application, a useful one (or, one my teacher thinks is useful), with documentation, binaries, portability, et al.. My grade for the entire semester will be based on the quality of this project.

This project is my first ""big"" one. It's been a really exciting experience to write and develop, and I am not anywhere near done. I think that after the semester is over, I will continue developing it, especially if it takes an audience wider than just my friends (which is not something I particularly anticipate, but oh well). Anyway, the point is: I'm invested in it, and to me the quality of this project is worth more than my feelings about this first draft, so criticise it brutally. I've already rewritten it a few times for reasons smaller than what I predict you will point out, so I'm not hesitant to start over if it means a cleaner/more stable/more modular codebase.

[Here](http://paytonturnage.github.com/Charl/) is a link to the github pages. The pages includes download links for binaries if you don't feel like configuring allegro, enet, and libtomcrypt for building the source distribution. You can find a link to the repository in the top left. Please tell me everything you think about it, good and bad, so I know what I can do better, what to change and what to keep!

If you'd like to test it, you can PM me for the address of my personal server (I'd rather not post my IP in public), and if you want to test it on your own without bothering with portforwarding and crap, you can run the server and connect clients all on your own machine (the ip would be 127.0.0.1).

A few things I'll note first though: 

* I am learning how to use make, so the sh and batch files are an interim solution.

* The code indicates mute, isolate, kick, and a few other commands that aren't implemented yet; those are coming.

I'll call this Group A.

Then of course, we have Group B, which consists of the people who wrote their first line of code in a college CS 101 class. I admit, I fall into this category. Initially, Group A blows us out of the water because they've had more experience writing really trivial programs. But after a few semesters, IF Group B works insanely hard, the skill level between the two groups seems to level off.

I started to wonder if the people who started early really have a significant advantage in programming over those who started in college. On one hand, it seems logical that those who've been programming longer would have a much easier time solving difficult problems. On the other hand, I don't expect a 12 year old kid to have a solid understanding of concepts like data structures or algorithms which are important for developing meaningful programs. While its impressive to ""code"" some video game, how complicated are these games honestly? At a young age its probably easy to develop bad habits and have them persist throughout the years. I think a college aged student would have an easier time wrapping his/her mind around abstract concepts and learning good practices from professional instructors.

Just as an example. My current Data Structures class consists of Groups A and B, and I think the playing field is level. I really can't tell the difference between those who've been programming for 10+ years or those who've been programming for 2+ semesters.

Anyway, I'm interested in hearing what others have to say. Perhaps hear some feedback from people who started early or late and how they ended up doing in their CS careers.

#My Learn to Program Manifesto

My view of learning to program is that you can't learn everything from
one source, so consulting multiple sources helps you to understand the
subject matter. Some sources favor a Project-first approach and some
favor a Fundamentals-first approach is lots of small exercises. I
personally favor the later.

So my suggestion is to start slow and view learning Ruby on Rails as a
journey, there are no shortcuts. I suggest you start with the [Ruby
Course](http://www.learnstreet.com/lessons/study/ruby) by Learn
Street, it's like a course that is nothing but code challenges, it
just teaches you about a concept then gives you an exercise to try it
out with. To help cement this knowledge I suggest you read the online
book [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) by Chris Pine.
It's written for those brand new to program and very chapter has
exercises with it. I suggest you work on those exercises in [Ruby
Fiddle](http://rubyfiddle.com/). After you finish the book and the
Learn Street course, then there are the Learn Street projects.
Complete 3 beginner projects, then complete 3 intermediate projects.

Having a solid grasp of Ruby now it's time to fill in any gaps in your
knowledge around some of the intermeidate concepts. I'd suggest you
check out the intermediate course called [Ruby
Bits](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits) by Code School. The
reason I'm recommending Code School's course here over Treehouse's
[Ruby Foundations](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/ruby-foundations)
is because there are Code Challenges after the videos in *Ruby Bits*
in *Ruby Foundations* there are only quizzes. As I'm sure you probably
learned with CSS, the only way to learn a language is to use it to
solve problems.

Quizzes do little to cement understanding. Programming languages like
natural languages tend to be **use it or lose it**. So you tend to
forget the syntax you haven't used recently to solve a problem. Now
you can offset this issue by taking notes on the syntax during the
videos and then creating out your own exercises to solve and doing
them in [Ruby Fiddle](http://rubyfiddle.com).

Now that you are pretty solid with Ruby it's time to get an
introduction to Ruby on Rails. Rails has a lot of moving parts so
first a guided tour of all of these moving parts is in order, that's
what [One Month Rails](http://onemonthrails.com/) is for. It won't
teach you to build a whole Rails app in a month (despite marketing
hype to the contray) however it will provide you something essential
an understanding on how these parts fit together. The goal here is to
get high level overview on how stuff fits together so you can spend
more time worrying about the actual Ruby on Rails when you get there
than worrying about tools that are merely a means to end. About the
time you finish *One Month Rails* you probably won't get learn about
Twitter Bootstrap.

You've probably already built a your site from scratch using HTML &amp;
CSS and learned all about nerding out on Typography as well as other
important design concepts. If you don't know about all of those things
well there's a [Learning
Adventure](http://teamtreehouse.com/learning-adventures/learn-html-and-css)
for that. So since you've got all of that down, here's the idea when
you are learning Rails you should be doing just that **focusing on
Rails** no trying to decide at which weight your body typeface looks
best. So my modest proposal is that when building a Rails app for
learning purposes don't worry about design.

The easiest way to not worry about design is to use Twitter Bootstrap
which happens to be the very same framework that is used the *Build a
Basic Ruby on Rails* course. So work through the [Twitter Bootstrap
101](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/twitter-bootstrap-101/)
tutorial by tutsplus to get up to speed on Twitter Bootstrap. Build
yourself a site with Twitter bootstrap and now would be a good time to
learn about changing bootstrap's default stylings. Practice
customizing everything so it looks like it was coded from scratch and
put that knowledge in your back pocket for after you make your first
Ruby on Rails app from scratch you will no doubt want to but your web
design skills to use then.

So now that you've gone through all of that, it's time to learn how to
put everything you've learned together into a functioning app with the
[Build a Simple Ruby on
Rails](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/build-a-simple-ruby-on-rails-application)
Application.

Like I said at top, this is **my** learn to program manifesto and
remember, *free advice is worth what you paid* for it. So I suggest
you take some time and write down your thoughts about your own journey

By the time I get more of the prerequisite CS courses out of the way, it'll have been a full 2.5 years since I took a math course. I'm worried that I won't be as brushed up on math as I need to be.

In your experiences, what kind of math is used in courses or in the workplace? I realize this is a very general question, so I understand if it can't be answered.

In the near future there are going to be some changes to the LearnProgramming community.  Some will start today, and some will start as soon as we have time to implement them.  
  

The changes we're making are to ensure that LearnProgramming remains a useful, friendly, and helpful community for people to learn all aspects of software development, from code and syntax, to frameworks and algorithms.  

#### **Self-Posts Only**:  
Starting today, LearnProgramming will only allow Self Posts.  This means that no Karma will be received for anything posted in this subreddit.  Feel free to make a Self Post about an external resource (blog, documentation, etc), but try to be verbose and describe the content if you can.  
  

#### **Reporting and Rules**:  
New rules will be implemented in the near future.  Many subreddits have strict posting guidelines, and we will be adopting some form of a ruleset.  The new rules will be posted in the sidebar.  If you feel that a post has broken a rule, please report it and the moderation staff will remove or approve it accordingly.  
  

#### **User Flair**:  
There was a lot of discourse and questions about whether we should implement user flair, and if we do, what sort of data should be displayed.  As a trial run, we've decided that we're going to allow users to edit their own flair, and flair will be used to display your **points of interest**.  This is in no way a statement of qualification, and if it is used as such, it will be removed.  
  

The point of flair on LearnProgramming is to provide a convenient way for like-minded community members to find eachother.  This will (hopefully) give members an easy way to find open source projects, mentors, partners, and resources.  User Flair will be implemented in the near future once an appropriate style/template has been figured out.
  

#### **This isn't Rent-a-Coder**:  
While this is going to be one of the official rules, it goes without saying that offering any type of reward (be it monetary or otherwise) is strictly prohibited on this subreddit.  This is not a place to find cheap labour, it is a place to learn.

(For all three classes, the course code is the access code, i.e. cs106a, cs106b, cs107 respectively)

**One point worthy of mentioning: if you follow along with all lectures, AND the textbook, then you will be ahead of many Stanford students, or at least on par. Although you won't have access to grading or sections, following the textbook will put you in a good place.**

BTW: don't sign up for multiple. Just do whichever one suits you best. Very basic programming experience? 106A. Done a university class or self-taught a reasonable amount? 106B. Multiple university classes/theoretical instruction? 107.

----------


**Warnings and Disclaimers**

This will be harder to follow than it is at Stanford!

Without an in person group, motivation, energy, discipline, etc will all be harder to conjure - hopefully the Piazza group can bring some of this back.

CS107 may not work out - I might have to drop this from the offerings. While on campus, all programming with 107 is done on the schools computers which we log into remotely. Try and set up your environment on your local unix machine (or set up a VM if you want), but this will be a challenge!

Also - cut some slack - e.g. all the notes/guides that I just put up in the 107 forum have formatting issues, that's just something that will have to be looked past unfortunately. 

Regarding exams - let's try and catch up to Stanford's own summer offerings. Although I won't be able to grade exams (I *might* be able to look over some depending on how many people take the class, worst case there will be solutions), we could maybe try a google hangout session where everyone takes the exams? I'm not sure.

**My question which I'd like your help discussing**

What will be the biggest barrier for you in completing this?

Are you likely to sign up, really want to do it, and then forget/just stop doing it?

1346174877.0,135,self.learnprogramming,yyycd,[UPDATE] I'm the guy who had the phone interview the other week.  Here's details on the in-house interview and the results!,170,35,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yyycd/update_im_the_guy_who_had_the_phone_interview_the/,"I got the job!

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xwd16/had_a_technical_phone_interview_today_for_an/)

Here's how the final in house interview went:

When I first arrived I met up with the hiring manager for the software engineers, one of the project managers, and another person whose job title I have forgotten.  They took me out to lunch and for the most part we had a pretty casual interaction.  They did ask me many questions but it was more authentic ""get to know me"" questions rather than them drilling me on anything.  

They asked a lot about the projects I listed in my resume and put on github, especially about my simple 2D game.  And they asked a lot about what I enjoyed about coding and how I got started as a programmer, especially since I have philosophy degree.

After lunch, we went back to the office and the hiring manager and another software engineer had me do a problem on the white board for them.  The problem was as follows:

Given two arbitrarily sized linked lists, create a new linked list such that each node in the new list is the sum of the elements in the first two lists if the first two lists are right justified.

For example:

List 1: [1]-&gt;[2]-&gt;[3]

List 2: ........[5]-&gt;[6] (right justified)

Output list:  [1]-&gt;[7]-&gt;[9]

Rather than giving me a linked list class, they only gave me a node class that contained the value of the node and a reference to the next node.  The function header they started me with was:

    public node sumRightJustified(node firstList, node secondList)

I'll leave you guys to solve it.  It's not terribly difficult.  I was allowed to write other functions too.  I wrote a simple constructor in the node class and a function that finds lengths of lists to help me out.

Writing code on a white board in front of employers is pretty nerve racking, but they were pretty awesome about it.  I had various small errors in the code, like putting = instead of == and I had a couple other silly syntax errors.  So what they did was ask me to sort of debug it and tell them why it wouldn't compile in its current state.  I found all my little errors and they seemed to be pleased with how I worked through the problem.

After the whiteboard part they asked me some more general questions.  Here they are paraphrased to the best of my memory (recall this job uses Java):

1) Give us your methodology for commenting code and tell us about how you can write readable and maintainable code.
-Obviously fairly open ended.  I talked about the importance of good variable names, noted personal programming experience where this was an issue.  I talked about not over-commenting and allowing well written code to tell the story, etc.

2) What's the difference between an interface class and an abstract class and why would you use one over the other -I'm a C++ guy so I'm not sure I got this one right, I told them I wasn't sure and gave them an educated guess, which they seemed to be pleased with.  However I was able to talk about polymorphism in a more generic way in my answer to at least ensure to them that I knew OOD fundamentals.

3) Say you have a giant block of code that sort of works, but has a lot of bugs and is documented poorly.  At what point is it ok to rewrite the block of code and why?
-For this one I said depending on just how buggy and poorly commented it was, I would be in the camp that says to rewrite the block of code.  I told them that while in the short run it might save some time, in the long run, that block of code might haunt them as new engineers come in and need to maintain the code base.  I said it would be a good time investment to clean up the code for that reason.

4) They asked about experience in SQL and multithreading, which I don't really have any, but I was able to answer some basic SQL questions this time because I studied up on it since the phone interview.

After that portion of the interview, I had the final programming part.  For this I won't be able to give you the exact problem, but I'll try and paint a clear picture of how it went down.

They sat me in a room with a laptop (WITH internet access, the guy said that they don't expect their engineers to work without the internet; awesome company), and they had an algorithm that was running slowly when it had a lot of input.  The algorithm was part of a large class that was keeping track of data about employees and their hours.

I was given a half hour to read over the code, understand it, and figure out the problem.  When he came back he asked me the Big-Oh runtime of the algorithm (it was O( n^2 ), so pretty slow) and asked why I thought it was running so slow.  I figured out pretty quickly how things were working and why it was bottlenecking so I described to him the problem.  After that I was given over an hour to figure out a solution and implement it in the actual code.  When I was done he said I had found the optimal solution, which was great.  It's probably also important to note that I was careful to write clean and well-commented code.  

So that was that.  I waited about a week and got the job offer, so I will be a software engineer!  I am super pumped and I hope this is helpful to other aspiring developers who might not have a traditional education in CS.",,False,,t5_2r7yd,1346175107.0,,,True,t3_yyycd,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yyycd/update_im_the_guy_who_had_the_phone_interview_the/,

**I've taken 106B and 107 at Stanford, I'm happy to brush up on the 106A stuff.**

I'm hoping if I act as a guide but bring everyone on a good platform (probably thinking Piazza, which is a university course management company that was started at Stanford for the iPhone class, and I have access to and can create a 'class' on there which I think will serve as a good discussion place - however, word of warning - you'll want to adjust your email preferences on piazza! They can send quite a few)


**So if people want this, I'll create those things tonight (it's 2pm on Saturday where I am) and post the links up tomorrow so people can start on Monday (don't want to delay much longer).**

**Why?** I'm really interested in the whole MOOC and online education movement, however I believe that the right person to person groups can offer much needed motivation/energy/encouragement/help that will make for many more people successfully completing the courses! *(I'm also running a programming mentoring group for really driven individuals who want to learn languages/frameworks like Rails, JavaScript, etc, especially to build things/create projects - if you can mentor in Rails/JavaScript/Python/Django/Ruby/etc, please let me know, that would be amazing - that program will begin early this week - Monday at the earliest, Wednesday at the latest - though that's a separate thing.)*


Theoretically, with dedication and free time you could definitely go through 106A, B and 107 this summer. Time taken per assignment (there are around 6 or 7 for each class) varies widely by person and experience - those who take 3-4 hours in A might take 5-8 hours per assignment in B, and then 10 hours in 107. But some people take 20 hours per assignment in B, or 15 hours in A, or 2 hours in A - just varies on the person.

The key to success with these classes is discipline, and you can get that by knowing and constantly reminding yourself of why you want to learn to get better at programming and what that allows you to do.

Cheers


(Also if anyone has taken 106A B or 107, and wants to help out as a teacher/TA, that would be amazing - shoot me a message on reddit or drop a comment below)



**So, tl;dr**

* Want a free teacher/TA for a Stanford CS class? Tell me which one (I'll comment with the 106A/B/7 and please vote on the appropriate one) - I'll do all 3 *if I can*

* Can you help me TA? Send me a message

* That's it. Watch for a link to a Piazza class system group on reddit tomorrow :)

C programming

1) You don't have to initialize variables, because they contain useful information

2) Variable declaration goes after your #includes but before the main (ie. non-static globals)

3) Use the shortest length variable names as possible, this will save you memory.

 * 48 hours is plenty of time to learn the basics of a new programming language or library.

 * 48 hours absolutely *is* enough time to make a small, complete game that you can actually play and show off to your friends.

I'm not saying it's easy: it isn't. Game jams are grueling, like running a marathon. But it's also fun, and the sheer intensity of focus required is what makes it such a great opportunity to learn.

Finding a topic was tricky, but given that I am already doing a series on C programming, I thought it would be a nice change of pace to focus on web technology. Therefore, I am going to build an MVC PHP based web application framework from scratch. 

For those who do not know, a web application framework is basically a programmer's toolkit to design and build web applications. This one will be written using the PHP scripting language. MVC is short for ""Model View Controller"", which will be explained in depth during my live stream. So by watching this, you will learn not only how to build your own web applications, but also about the technology behind web applications in general.

Part of the reason I picked this topic is because of the wealth of relevant information that can be learned. I will be covering aspects of system administration, networking, databases, security, project organization, and a lot more. 

This will be interactive and you will be able to ask questions throughout the process. I will be explaining everything I do as I do it, as well as recording and saving the sessions so that you can watch them later. The code will also be made available, so that you can download and experiment with it.

I did not think that a tutorial/""learn programming"" type of series was the best choice for a live stream. If someone missed a session, they would not be able to follow along for the next. Anyone joining later would need to watch all of the prior archived videos before they could catch up with everyone else. I wanted to choose a topic that would be friendly to those who were just joining, even after the series had started. 

Questions and comments welcome.

A question I find really interesting; I have a lot of programming skills (CS degree + industry experience), yet I truthfully don't always feel like a programmer. It opens up more questions, like, ""What is a programmer anyway?"" 

My job isn't considered development, I'm a technical consultant who dabbles in API/integration work with .Net. My job involves programming but it's not my single focus; hence my hesitation to label myself a programmer.

My moment came when I hesitantly entered my company's  [HackDay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon). My team-mates and I were locked in a room and had to come out with a prototype. I was terrified, I program (in my eyes) *very* slowly and I almost always use old code from internal sources to finish projects. How could I ever program something quickly enough, on the fly, all by myself? I was sure I'd be the weak link in the team and sink the ship.

Well I didnt! I did it, I programmed on the fly and we came up with a great idea. I didn't slow down the team, and I actually took on a heavy load. Our team didnt place (4th out of 8 teams) but it was a great experience. I really walked away with the confidence to jump into any project head first. 

**TL;DR**: I entered a programming competition and found the confidence to program without training wheels. I announced this life lesson out-loud when I heard a slow piano track kick in at the end of my day.

CodeCademy.com: 1,000,000 users signup, but how many beginners have learnt to code? And how many found it easy?",163,40,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/x9y9g/codecademycom_1000000_users_signup_but_how_many/,"I am a big fan EdTech and think CodeCademy has FANTASTIC potential. If I lived in the USA I would have loved to work with them. When CodeCademy launched last August I raced through the lessons and excitedly tried them on my wife and 4 of my siblings. They felt they learned very little and didn't overly enjoy it. Many have blogged about the poor design of the CodeCademy lessons (i.e. lack of pedagogy).

I tried writing my own JavaScript lessons on CodeCademy but found the authoring platform too restrictive.
So I decided to have a go at creating my own platform, to see how hard it was to create a JavaScript course that was both FUN and EFFECTIVE.

The result is http://CodeAvengers.com

I have received a lot of feedback from beginners who have tried CodeCademy but found the lessons progressed to quickly and got frustrated by bugs in lessons, so came to CodeAvengers seeking an alternative. Many of my beginner users claim that my JavaScript course is more effective and fun than the equivalent CodeCademy courses; they also claim my site provides better feedback when you make mistakes and that the general design and difficulty of the lessons is better suited to beginners. I am interested to know if these beginners are in the minority, or are there thousands of beginners who feel the same way.

I would LOVE to hear the experiences complete BEGINNERS among the 1 million CodeCademy users.

My definition of BEGINNGER = 0 previous experience with JavaScript or any other programming language.

###CodeCademy Feedback

For those who don't want to read all the comments here is a summary of the feedback so far:

## Positive
 
* Q&amp;A forum: helpful when you get stuck; good to see how others solved problems; encourages a community culture; helps you learn to work with others
* Gamification: Badges are very motivating; easy to share to Twitter and Facebook
* HTML/CSS courses: enjoyable, effective and challenging
* Good coverage of introductory topics: variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, functions, objects, recursion etc.
* NON-BEGINNERS: Great review and practice for those who have some programming background

## Neutral

* Lesson quality: some are ""great"", ""interesting"", etc. others ""suck"" are ""tedious"" etc.
* Lesson topics: some are ""interesting"", others are ""boring"" and not practical (blackjack etc.)
* Lesson examples: some give good examples that show the usefulness of code; more of these types of examples are needed

## Negative

* Different authors: courses are have varied and inconsistent teaching styles; courses repeat material from previous courses; seem to assume knowledge of concepts not yet introduced
* Lesson descriptions: are necessarily long; the important information is not always in the bold section; are often poorly worded; contain technical terminology not introduced in previous lessons
* Code checking and feedback: some courses are buggy and have been so for months; many lessons will pass your code even when it is incorrect
* Course design: lessons tell you the what (code syntax); but many don't teach the how and why very well; learners get to the end and feel as though they didn't learn much
* Course pace: lessons progress too fast for the average beginner
* UI: Minor complaints about unhelpful error messages in the code editor, and other minor UI issues

I basically raised him (10+ years older) so i definitely love the little dork but hes going to have trouble functioning in adult life. The last thing i want is for him to go all dexter on everyone but i also dont want him to have to milk off the family for his entire adult life. Our family has more than more than enough to care for him throughout life, but i want him to be independent.


He loves computer, a relationship built from a childhood of watching me on one. But his focus is too much on gaming and not enough on understanding the computer.


How do i put him down the path of being able to make a living on a computer. Hes not artistic, design is out lol. But he has a mild rain man thing going when he enjoys a subject, and a complete lack of effort (more effort avoiding what he doesnt like actually) for subjects he doesnt like. 

I would get a new game on release, and he would try and coach me through the game on my first play through. ""Go here, turn left here turn left i saw it on a video""



So how do i make him enjoy learning Computer science. I took several courses in college on the subject, but not enough to really teach. Ive tried inspiring him with stories of notch and how he made minecraft (he loves the game) but havent followed up with actual education on it. I was thinking about showing him Alice.

(20 things to consider),153,37,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/u1wl1/so_you_want_to_be_a_programmer_20_things_to/,"This post is a post out of frustration, but I'll try to make it conversation worthy and informative.

A little background on me:
  I'm a 28 year old programmer that is a web developer professionally.
  I know a lot of languages, but I don't want that to be the focus here so I won't dredge the list out. Suffice to say, I'm versed in legacy and modern languages, from low-level assembly to high level scripting / dynamic languages.
  I've professionally worked the industry for about 6 years now.
  I did not graduate college; I began learning to program at around 8 years old. By the time I was an adult, I felt I was well versed enough that I didn't need schooling, and found that any information I needed was accessible at the local library or the internet.
  I have spent a large amount of time (around 10,000 conservative hours) programming and learning to program. I have taught myself discrete math, basic electrical engineering, philosophy, basic statistics, and logic in this pursuit. Additionally, I've read every white paper I could get my hands on, even those going back to the 70's.

In this time, I've come to realize a few truths, or at least opinions that I believe strongly enough to call truths.

This comes up often because people ask me how to get into the profession or the hobby, or professional/hobbyist programmers complain to me about various things.

So, in case you want to be a programmer, I'd like to share a few things with you.

1) If you do not enjoy learning, building, and deep thought, get out now. This is a profession/hobby that lends itself to a lifetime of homework. Furthermore, it is a world that exists in idea, and is not tangible: if you do not have the motivation to sit and think about it, you will not be able to understand it. If you can do anything else and be happy, I suggest you go do that.

2) Speaking of the world of intangible ideas: Despite what you may thing, programming has absolutely nothing to do with computers any more than being a butcher has to do with knives. These wonderful tools are just that: tools. They are not conscious (yet), they do not want to make your life hard (despite what you might think after a seg fault or two), and they are essentially your bitch. You are the user. You are the one that uses. Do not get used by the computer; if it does not do what you want it to do, what you want it to do is either impossible, or you are approaching it wrong.

3) You, me, Linus, Stallman, Dijkstra, etc; we're all effectively idiots. Do not ever get into the habit of thinking you truly know everything about anything. You only know what you know, and you do not know the things you do not know are out there to know. Information is doubling every 2 years, at least, do not think for a second you have all of it. There is an effectively infinite array of programmy 'things' to learn and do; keep an open mind and always seek novel ideas.

4) That said, not every new idea that you have is a good idea. Be particularly suspicious of ""I'm gonna make code that is like -insert name here-, except -some detail-"". They tend to be solutions to problems that don't exist. Make sure you understand the problem you are facing before you approach the solution.

5) This one is important, so listen up: OOp, MVC, behavior driven programing, functional programing, graph structure, relational structure, structured programming, etc, etc, etc are ideas and paradigms. They are not the solution to everything, they are not features. There is no such thing as an OO feature. There are features that are useful for OO programming. All languages and all paradigms do essentially the same things in different ways. Those differences can get in your way, or they can help you. You do not need to write a 50 line program as 10 files just because ""that's MVC"". Procedural programming is not horrible, it's just easy to make horrible procedural programs. Functional programming will not save you from having to think about concurrency, but it just might help (alot).

6) Just as important: XML, HTML, JSON/YML, etc are just documentation languages: ways of containing and presenting data. Avoid putting logic inside your data. It is unavoidable or even useful for somethings to do so, but those are a tiny minority.

7) There are exceptions to everything.

8) Your code today is somebody else's code in half a year. Be kind to yourself and comment.

9) The community of programmers is a wonderful place with excellent people and awesome dialog. There are a lot of assholes (myself included). Just ignore them.

10) Teach somebody else how to program. It will put what you do in a new light.

11) You need to know C, LISP, and a database language (SQL). C is used everywhere. LISP will revolutionize your brain. You need to understand databases.

12) There are no bad languages. There are a surprising amount of bad programmers.

13) Stop hating on Microsoft. They are a horrible business and evil and whatever else, but they standardized the industry to a point that we could all start working together, and they did not take over the world.

14) If, in your profession, you ever stop learning, then it's time to dust of the resume and find a new job. Do not get stuck in a rut.

15) Do not work more than 50 hours a week. It is very easy to do so. Do not drink too much caffeine. Eat correctly. Get up at least once an hour.

16) A large portion of programming happens in your head. If you are stumped, take a bike ride. You do not need to be on the keyboard to program.

17) Learn to talk to non-technical people about technical things. Half your profession will be spent doing so.

18) Try not to play more than one video game at a time. Avoid MMORPGs. Video games are wonderful, but they will destroy your ability to start hobby projects.

19) Always be making something for yourself. Have a personal project.

20) Concurrency is the future.

Remember, above all things, simplicity is your sword, abstraction is your shield, and your community is your armor. Your enemies are complexity and obfuscated code/data.

I've been interested in programming for a long time, and am currently majoring in ComSci. For the majority of my programming career, I've been told I'm good at programming and regularly gotten good marks and whatnot. However, the further I've progressed down my chosen path of study, the more I realize that knowing how to do stuff in a specific language is nowhere near as important as knowing how to be a good programmer. I *really* want to be a good programmer. Unfortunately, I suffer from a crippling lack of ambition (I play too many vidya), and a woeful inability to not look at what I have to learn in small sections. I recently started a development internship and have been given a ""reading list"" from the guy who seems to have taken the responsibility of mentoring me. I'm reading up on the stuff he's mentioned, and it's interesting, but I feel like a lot of it isn't really sinking in, and am confronted by this gigantic wall of things I don't understand yet, which causes me to shrink away and go back to other, simpler things (I'm up to 600ish points on codeacademy in the space of about a week, currently working on python).

Anyways, that's all just a lot of backstory for a simple question, which is: Where do I start? How do I get involved in the greater programming community, such that I can learn how to be good at what I do, as opposed to just know a lot of languages and be bad at all of them? I know that the key is practice, practice, practice - I'm just afraid that I don't have enough knowledge yet, and that I'd only be reinforcing bad habits.

[Procedural Generation Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/)


All techniques demonstrated are implemented in my game **[TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com)**, which is currently **[Kickstarting](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep)** (only 10 days of funding left to go!)


Interactive demos for Parts 1, 1.1 &amp; Part 2 are at the usual place:

http://tinykeep.com/ai


**Part 1 Improvements**

Before I crack on with Part 2, I want to quickly mention some minor improvements I've made to Part 1 as a result of community feedback from Reddit and elsewhere. Thanks everyone for helping me improve on the AI so far!

[Part 1.1 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/YttkpNdS5bY)

In short, the changes are: 

1 . The co-ordinate of the last detected entity (either player character or breadcrumb) is saved as a variable every frame. So, while in Alert mode, if the Skeleton loses sight and smell of the target (all raycasts to the player character or dropped breadcrumbs return false), he will still continue to head towards this last detected location as its final target and re-evaluate from there. This is an improvement from the previous version where a monster would stop and go back to patrolling even though it has detected a target in the past - which is not expected behaviour.

2 . If the Skeleton still cannot detect anything from this point (all raycasts to the player and breadcrumbs again return false), Alert mode is dropped and the monster makes a ""best guess"" where the character is and sets the patrol waypoint target. For this initial version, the ""best guess"" is simply the nearest waypoint to the character at the time. If the character moves away after this point, the best guess waypoint remains the same. I admit it's a little bit cheaty of the AI - since it now knows exactly where the character is in order to set the waypoint - but it works well and looks realistic enough because of its slow movement during non-alert patrol mode. Most players won't know the difference, it just looks like the the monster is heading in the general direction and its likely the player has moved on from this point anyway. Still - for completeness I may modify best guess to take into account the target's last seen velocity and extrapolate from there.

Given these changes, we've removed the alert level (range 0-200 etc...) as we've found this feature has become redundant and offers no extra intelligence. It has simply been replaced with a boolean, so either alert or not. The ""smell trails"" have also been shortened significantly to balance out the extra added behaviours - with the last detected code there is no need to have such a long trail, lest we give the impression that the AI is cheating all of the time! This also gives the player the opportunity to hide behind corners and ambush monsters walking past.

Let's move on to the fun stuff!


**TinyKeep AI System (Part 2 of 5) : Retreating and Defense**

Today we'll be following a little Fire Imp as we discuss Retreating and Defensive behaviours. Fire Imps (and other monsters marked with the ""Shy"" personality flag) will run away from the player if he gets too close. Put him in this level of distress for too long, and he'll breathe fire on you, while still attempting to flee.

[Part 2 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/dIBuIELYd4c)

1 . For the demo, Fire Imps in non-alert mode stay in one position, although other Shy monsters may roam/patrol in the same way as Skeletons. The Fire Imp is constantly looking around for signs of danger - every approximate second or so the monster rotates between a random range of -270 to 270.

2 . Like the Skeletons, the Fire Imps employ line of sight, the FOV being slightly greater than the Skeletons due to it being prey and not predator. If a raycast to a threat returns true (threat being the player or aggressive monster), Alert mode is turned on and the Fire Imp faces the target. It will continue to face the target while in Alert mode, as long as it can still see and smell the target. At this point the Fire Imp will not flee just yet - the target is not close enough to be a major threat, but it is alerted and wary, and constantly tracking you with its sight.

3 . While in Alert mode, if the player exceeds a certain distance threshold then the Fire Imp begins the flee. We use an inverse of the Seek Steering Behaviour, which creates the Flee Steering Behaviour. (Subtract the destination vector from the source vector, rather than the other way around). The resultant vector is normalized and scaled to the Fire Imp's max speed, so now the monster is repelled away from the player if it gets too close.

4 . Unlike the Seek Behaviour, Fleeing comes with a greater risk of getting stuck on walls and sharp corners. Because it is being repelled by the player, the target destination could be anything - a wall, another monster etc.. We don't get this problem with Seeking, because the target is always the player, who is always in the an empty space. To prevent problems with getting stuck - we must increase the wall avoidance distance. The Fire Imp now follows the corridors and rooms rather getting stuck on them. This is also useful for when the Imp is stuck in a corner - it will slide nicely away if the player tries to advance further.

5 . Each monster has it's own type of defensive behaviours while retreating. For this demo, if the Fire Imp is in Alert mode and is being chased around for a sustained period of time, it will begin to breathe fire at the player. This is simply a fire particle with a velocity towards the player at the time. Fire particles are short lived and decay after a second. If the Fire Imp is no longer being chased or comes off Alert mode, a cooldown period is activated before it breathes fire again.

And that's it! Quite simple reactive behaviour but effective. I did try to use some kind of pathfinding to accomplish fleeing but the results were buggy and there was a lot more consideration required to make it look realistic. In the end the reactive technique using Fleeing Steering Behaviour returned better results. The key takeaway with game AI is that a combination of simpler rules often work better than a monolithic and complicated top-down system. Also - exaggerate your behaviours! Make them look around often, give them surprised animations, make use of sounds and speech. It doesn't matter how intelligent the AI is, if the player isn't given cues as to what is going on under the hood - the monsters will not SEEM intelligent.

Everything from picking a language, to feeling out the fundamentals of programming, to answering my dumb questions about object oriented design, why my code isn't running, etc. Everyone has been super helpful and understanding of myself and many other newbies who want to learn the art of programming.

A year ago, I knew the basics of HTML and nothing else. I was pretty decent with computers, but never pursued it further than learning how to do basic OS tweaks and playing video games. I was a Finance major, and I hated what I was doing. I really dreaded getting a full time job in Finance, and didn't get along with other people in my major. I just wasn't into it, but I didn't know where else to turn. It wasn't until I found r/learnprogramming that I realized working with computers could be a viable career, and programming was actually something I could someday be decent at.

Now, I'm finally getting decent with Java, I've dabbled in C (with the CS50 class), and I've explored some other languages. I've made a few simple websites, and I'm in the process of developing an app for Android. I changed my major officially to Computer Science BS last semester, and I have an internship next summer as a Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 company.

And finally, with exception of class projects and small practice exercises I've done, I'm happy to say that I've shipped my first piece of software. It's a Chrome extension called Simple Blocker:

http://simpleblocker.com/

As the name suggests, it is a simple website blocker that lets you block any number of sites to help you concentrate. It has a sleep timer, as well as additional ""enhanced blocking"" features which make it difficult to turn on, if you have trouble with self control. The app is free, but in the future I may provide a Bitcoin address or something for donations ;) But I really just wanted to create it to learn JavaScript and mess around with the Chrome API rather than make money.

I don't want to rant on for too long, I really just wanted to say THANK YOU! And also wanted to get some quality feedback on my new app!

The database is setup, all I need are a few general fields (title, description, startdate and enddate) and their episodes with similar information.

However, I'm having a few difficulties getting started:

**What API?**

I've done some searching and I've stumbled upon these few promising APIs.

* [MyMovie](http://mymovieapi.com/)

This seems good, but slight remark: even though the Field description of `episodes` says 

&gt; The TV series's episodes(only TV series). Fields: date season episode title.

I can only manage to get the season + episode number of an episode, both title and date don't show up. Have I entered the wrong query data? When I try it with `Game of Thrones` I receive episode, season and title for every episode of season 1 and 2, but not 3. even though I confirmed on the website the titles are shown there.

* [TheTVDB](http://www.thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Programmers_API)

Looks very promising, but in the example of `GetSeries` there is no notion of episodes, even though the file structure indicated there should be. Did they just omit it?

* [TVDB API \(C#\)](https://code.google.com/p/tvdb-api/)

This is a API DLL written in C# that is supposed to take away some of the work. It's 5 years old though, so I'm not sure if it's wise to rely on that.



**How to start?**

The main problem I'm facing is that I don't know how to start. I've never used an API before, I've never actually used XML/JSON and I'm fairly new to HTTP/Sockets/Networking in general. Is the usage of APIs generally the same? I'll do the CodeAcademy API course later today, but I'd still like some input.

One of the things I've noticed is that there is no such option as 'retrieve all tv-series', it's always a search query. [TheTVDB](http://www.thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Programmers_API) does provide some explanation to this, but I wouldn't know what to do with the things noted there.

I'm building a C# ASP.NET MVC 4 application, so ideally I'd like to create everything in C#. All I need from this API is to seed my database once with a few fields of all the series and their episodes and afterwards (at set intervals) to keep it updated.
If needed I could also look into writing it in another language, but other than Java and COBOL I have little experience with other languages (scripting is a minimal amount of basic jquery and bash).

It was my first taste of a *real* programming job and I learned so much in that time.  I have lots of things I know now that I wish I knew then.  Before I left, I found myself giving advice to fresh interns, so I thought some of the advice could resonate in this subreddit:

    Note: 
      This is based on my experience at a large company (50,000+ employees).
      Your experience may vary.

* **Relax!**

 * The people you will work with know you are fresh out of school. The environment I worked in was extremely low-pressure. I was able to set my own deadlines for the project I was working on.  I didn't have to handle tickets, answer phones, or provide support for anyone. No one expected me to do anything except work on my intern project.

* **Network!**

 * Get to know people around the company.  When your name comes up during the review, you'll want people to remember you.  Also, people move around in the industry and there's a good chance you'll meet these same people at other companies; they may even interview you!  Having an employee vouch for you makes you stand out against other applicants.

* **""Think outside the box""**

 * Consider this: The problem you're solving may already be solved. The best software developer is one that doesn't have to write any code to solve a problem ... or one that can solve the problem with one line of code.  

 * An intern I worked with was given a project and 3 months to complete it.  He searched for a full day through documentation and found a tool which already solves the problem.  In essence, he completed the intern project in one day!  This made the intern appear very resourceful and independent.  The team had to find another project for him to accomplish.

* **Don't be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck**

 * By ""stuck"", I mean when you have hit a wall and searching for the answer has not helped.  Try to understand the problem as best you can before asking.  You don't want to waste your co-workers' time solving something you should be able to figure out on your own.  However, don't waste *your* time trying to figure out something that a co-worker can easily explain to you in 3 minutes.

* **Check in with your boss/mentor at least once a week**

 * This helped me immensely.  My boss/mentor would tell me how I'm doing (positive feedback) and also how I could improve (constructive criticism). This is much better than hearing ways you could improve *after* you've completed the internship.

* **Be honest**

 * I didn't expect this to come up, but it did.  When people ask if I knew something that I *sort of knew*, I would claim to know it.  This led to problems and confusion on both sides.  Don't be afraid to tell people you don't know something! It can save time, avoid headaches, and admitting your own faults and shortcomings shows integrity.

 * I [accidentally] submitted code to the repository that was not peer-reviewed (which is against the company policy).  No one noticed but I was worried about getting caught, so I fessed up to my mentor.  He acted like it was no big deal, admired my honesty, and helped recover the situation.  Other companies may not be so forgiving, so be sure that if *you* don't know what you're doing, *someone* does, and *fast*.

I know I left some things out but these points stood out the most to me.

Seasoned Veterans: If you have experiences or advice you'd like to share, feel free to add to the discussion in the comments.

# *Edit #1*

crombodin's comment makes a excellent point which reminds me of a recurring problem I had:

* **Be prepared to bother people!**

 * I found that relying on other people was an integral part of my internship.  My project's progress was blocked for *3 weeks* because another team was too busy to implement a feature that I was waiting on.  I ended up poking the people daily (via email and in-person) to remind them that I was still waiting. At first I was afraid that I was the annoying new guy, but I had a job to do and needed them to do theirs.  Other engineers told me that this is part of working in software dev: reminding other people to do their job so you can move forward.

Now, on to recursion.

As I'm growing more and more able to solve problems recursively, I have begun to really enjoy the simplicity and elegance of the recursive form.   But I'm told that in general, anything recursive can be done with a loop, and should be.  Is this way of thinking outdated?  Is there a rule that recursive structures are inherently more resource intensive under such and such a circumstance?  When is it acceptable to choose a recursive problem solving structure?

I'll compile a list of pro's and cons below and try to update them as they are mentioned.  The list is currently just my opinion.

**Recursion**

**CONS**

* each loop adds a frame to the stack  &lt;---but when does this become a problem?
* trickier to conceptualize
* difficult to read for the non-recursively inclined.

**PROS**

* simple, elegant structure
* fewer lines of code
* can often be just as resource consumptive as a non recursive approach
* once conceptualized, easier to debug.
* easy to read for the recursively inclined.



Edit:

Okay, here are the two points that seem to be at the forefront of the conversation.

* **1. Recursion arguably increases the possibility of a crash.**

I'm not entirely sure whether it is meant that recursion is intrinsically less stable, or just intrinsically harder to prevent from having an unintended effect.  If it is the former, how is that so?  If the latter, what are the most important trappings to keep in mind when programming recursively -- where does it usually all go wrong?

Furthermore, if it is the latter case, and recursion is just more likely to provoke human error, is it any more dangerous than, say, using pointers or other ""dangerous"" techniques?

* **2. There are no definitive rules for when to and when not to use recursion.  There are some times when recursion is necessary, and at other times, you have to use your ""programming instincts"" to decide whether or not to solve recursively.**

As it has been pointed out, this is kind of frustrating to a beginner.  Personally, I'm probably more prone to seek a recursive solution than not, now that I've been exposed to it so much.  Where does one go about acquiring this intuition that experienced programmers have concerning recursion?  I mean, I realize I can't go pick some up from Staples, but are there certain ""case studies"" I can examine, or do I just have to wait until I ruin a program from mishandling recursion to get on the level?

I'd like to learn to automate some simple tasks I do that get very repetitive at work which uses some simple proprietary windows software.  Where would I even start?  I'll give an example of what I'd like to do.

1. I have a list of partnumbers.  I take one part number and enter them in a program at work.
2. Click a save button in this program to save the file as a text document.  I must manually enter the name of the file and browse to the path I want to save.
3. Next I open the file with MS Word to format it nicer (The file is saved as one long text file with no carriage returns,  I found MS word is easily able to fix this when I open the file.)
4.  Re-save the file in MS Word.
5.  Then repeat...  

All of this get very old and I feel like there must be an easier way to do this.  I'm willing to learn but not sure where to start.

This is just one simplified example.  There are other things like this that also get very repetitive but I figured I could start here.

Does anyone have any idea of how I could go about being more efficient at my everyday tasks.


I took C++ and some JAVA in college but it's been 5+ years since I've really messed with it.  

Thanks in advance.

For those who already know enough to start on a project. I have a few ideas that might stir up some motivation or general brainstorming. I will try to set up a time and place we can all actively communicate and share ideas.

I've recently got back into programming and web development and trying to pursue it as a career. I have a MySQL certification and I've done some minor PHP in the past. I've got a good working knowledge of CSS/HTML and quite capable of building sites with it. 


I've been given the opportunity to do a bunch of Microsoft Certifications for free and I've got to decide which ones I want to do. 
I've done a bunch of research and read around a bit but I'm still unsure of a couple of things. The person paying for these exams is setting up a 'technology solutions' sort of company. So he'll have a few people with different skillsets covering all areas. I assume it will be web development, database development mainly.

What exactly is ASP.NET? Is it the same as .NET? 

The web applications certification uses ASP.NET, Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. Is that a solid skill set in a development environment? Will I have to add C# down the road? 

What exactly is Azure? How is it used?


Long term goal is to get into serious software development and create applications that people use in their everyday lives but I'm thinking that it might be best to follow through with the web development route through to the end before I dive into C#? 

What place does C# have in a web development/application environment?

What do you guys think? Anybody have any idea which certifications are most likely to get you hired elsewhere?

Let me cut to the chase.   
I'm gonna be fairly bored this summer, so I thought I'd throw this out in the open. Would anyone be interested in learning Android coding with me?   
I'm guessing some of you are fairly well versed in Java, or even Android itself. But for those of you who aren't, and want another skillset under your belt, then why not learn to program for Android?   
A friend and I are considering starting a text/video series on how to program for Android. Obviously we're not going to make the next FourSquare or Hashable, but you can still make some pretty cool stuff, and have something else to claim at all those parties I know you all go to.   
If we get a fair enough interest, then we'll start the project. We're looking at both a picture/text version of instructions, and a video version as well. Please note, we're not going to teach like ""okay, type this, and then this, and tada, you have a button."" We plan on teaching and going over things in a way that can show by example, but so you understand what's going on as well (something none of my college instructors seem to be able to do.) I'm not an expert in Android development, but I know how to do the basics, and would love to learn along side you guys by helping out and researching in the spare time that I'll have (which, will be a lot).   
If you think you'd be interested in learning, drop a comment or drop me a message. I'll try and set some things up this week if I can garner enough interest (even 5-10 people would be awesome; otherwise, I'll just go over everything on my own.)    
Also, if you have suggestions or requests, let me know! I would love to hear what YOU want to learn. I want to do whatever I can to make this an awesome learning experience for everyone.   
**TL;DR**: Starting an Android/Java tutorial set. If you want to participate or have suggestions, leave a comment! You guys are awesome.     

**EDIT** WOW everyone, thanks for the interest. This seems like it's gonna be awesome! Some time in the next few days, I'll get everything created. My web server is down, and will be done for a while..so no website for the time being. I'll probably create a blog of some sort and throw the videos on my youtube page (unless anyone has better suggestions, then I'd love to hear them!) once we get started. I'll also make some type of survey to take, to see where everyone stands in their java knowledge. Thanks again!

So, I thought it would be useful to make a longer post describing some of the useful features that ViM offers to programmers.

**vimrc**

Before I get started with  my brain dump, here is my .vimrc file. It is a copy and paste from a few sources, sorry
I haven't remembered who they were

https://gist.github.com/4059839

**Syntax Highlighting**

This can be turned on with the command:

    :syntax on

Vim comes packaged with syntax highlighters for most programming languages. Look at how pretty C++ can look:

http://imgur.com/cQPlB

In this image I am using a few things to get this effect:

* http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/256_colors_in_vim (enabling 256 colors in your terminal and vim)
* http://robotsrule.us/vim/ (extra information if you are using screen)
* http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id*3797 (Syntax highlighter for cpp 11 (default works fine as well if you aren't using cpp11 stuff))
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/736701/class-function-names-highlighting-in-vim (make the functions and scope highlight)

my .vimrc stuff related to this:

    syntax on
    set background=dark
    set t_Co=256
    colo desert256
    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.cpp set syntax=cpp11

ViM comes with syntax highlighters for basically all programming languages (and if it doesn't come with the language you are using, someone will have written one that you can download)

**Source Tree Navigation**

One of the best things about ViM is its ability to jump around large code bases with out
requiring the user to touch a mouse. Here some of the tricks I have:

**ctags**

ctags are a special file that index your code and allows you to jump from file to file based
on the name of a function and its parameters.

eg: Say you have 50 files in your project. File myThing.cpp contains the implementation of some function:

    void myThing::do_stuff(int arg){ ... }

else where in code you might have something that looks like:

    myThing thing; //create a new ""myThing""
    thing.do_stuff(42); //call do stuff

For the life of you, you cannot remember what do_stuff does and you want to take a look at the
implementation.

With ctags you can move your cursor over the ""do_stuff"" method call and press 

    ctrl+]

and like magic, you will jump to myThing.cpp and be at the line of the method. You can 
read the method, remember what it does. To jump back to your code you press

    ctrl+t

Alternatively you could type:

    :tselect do_stuff
    or
    :ts do_stuff

and ViM will list all known ""do_stuff"" functions in a list, and you can choose which one to
jump to.

to create a tag file, read:

http://linux.byexamples.com/archives/177/vim-with-ctags/ (creating tags)

**split screen**

Another handy feature when moving around code is to simply have a split screen within vim so
you can look at one thing, while editing another.

You can achieve this by using the commands:

    :vsplit filename "" vertical split
    :split filename  "" horizontal split

to move between windows you can use:

    ctrl + w  followed by up, down, left, or right ( or h j k l ), or w to toggle

to change the file in a window, navigate to that window and type:

    :e filename

**file system integration**

Don't know the file name you want to open? or the directory.. no problem.. open a file system
explorer:

    :e .

This opens the current directory in a file browser you can navigate with the arrows and enter:

http://i.imgur.com/qcw4F.png

I will often split my screen into a file explorer, find the file I want, press enter, edit

**Editing tabs**

ViM has things called markers. I don't really use them. Instead I suggest you try a program
called screen.

This tutorial seems short and simple, comment if you want more details

http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/


**Code navigation, short cuts**

ViM is amazing at general editing of code and has a lot of tricks which can speed things up

**First and foremost, jumping around**

To jump to a line number, type:

    :42

That will jump to line 42 (surprising how many people don't know this)

To move to the start of a line and end:

    ^    "" start of line (first non blank character)
    $    "" end of the line

move forward to the letter:

    fz   "" move to the next z on the line

This is very handy to get used to

    gg   "" move to the start of the file
    G    "" move to the end of the file

There are many more, but these are the more obscure ones that people don't know.

**Copy and pasting**

so you can copy and paste like a normal text editor quite easily.

    yy  "" yank the current line
    dd  "" cut the current line
    d$  "" cut to the end of the line from the cursor
    p   "" paste what is in the clip board


Often you don't want to yank/cut a single line, so I often use the visual selection tool to 
cut a chunk:

    shift + v   Start visual highlighting line wise (select full lines) (capital V)
    use the arrows to select the chunk I want to copy/cut
    press y or d to copy or cut

    navigate elsewhere, press p

This makes it similar to how people usually do it a graphical editor. But.. no touching the mouse!

http://imgur.com/iaVRb (here is what it looks like)

You can also do amazing things with visual blocks (not visual lines). I might explain in comments. someone remind me.

**Regular expressions find and replace**

Once you understand how to use regular expressions you can make very expressive single line
modifications

Here are some ViM specific tips:

    :s/foo/bar    ""  Switches the first instance of foo to bar on the line your cursor is on
    :s/foo/bar/g  ""  Switches ALL instances of foo to bar on the line your cursor is on
    :%s/foo/bar/g ""  Switches ALL instances of foo to bar in the whole file

I often use it in tandum with visual select, here is an example:

    shift + v and select some chunk of code

when you type : it will say -

    :'&lt;,'&gt;

This means ""for the range I've selected"" and then you can type:

    :'&lt;,'&gt;s/foo/bar/g   "" for the range i've selected, swap foo to bar
    :'&lt;,'&gt;s/^/#/        "" for the range i've selected, put a hash at the start of the line
    :'&lt;,'&gt;s/$/,/        "" for the range i've selected, put a comma at the end of the line
    :'&lt;,'&gt;s/int/long/g  "" swap int for long for this selected bit of code

I could keep going, the usefulness of regular expressions cannot be overstated. There are many many places to learn them.

**Searching**

I have discussed how to search within your code base with :tselect but often you just want to
find something within the current file, here is how

ViM uses regular expression searches (as described above) there are a few ways you can use it

    /foo    "" search for foo, going downwards
    ?foo    "" search for foo, going upwards

after you have started searching you can press:

    n   "" next result
    N   "" previous result

you can search for the word under the cursor:

    navigate to a word with the cursor
    press * (shift + 8)

I have vim configured to jump to the search phrase as I type it (very handy). You can turn
this on with the following .vimrc command

    set incsearch

**Code completion**

Everyone loves intellisense in Visual Studio.. Not many people bother trying to set it up for ViM. (I must admit
I often don't bother) but.. You can, this page describes how for cpp.

http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/C%2B%2B_code_completion

It can be set up for any language you can generate ctags for (basically all languages)

To use it, you can simply start typing and press 

    ctrl + n

You will get a drop down list of all possible ""valid"" things you can type. It will also search the current file
you are editing for matching keywords (this is how I often use this feature)

Here is what it looks like:

http://vissale.neang.free.fr/Vim/OmniCppComplete/ScreenShots/screenshots.htm

Here is how I use it:

http://imgur.com/JFWOn


**Interaction with other coding products**

ViM plays pretty well with other programs, here are some things I do often

**Building**

To build a simple program I often type:

    :!g++ -O3 %
    :!./a.out

This will build the program (with optimisation) and then run the a.out binary. The bang (!) denotes ""run this in a shell please""

ViM also has a nice integration with makefiles, you can invoke it with:

    :make makerule
    eg
    :make hello
    this will compile hello.*** with the appropriate compiler (the make program will decide)

Using this, if there is an error it will allow you to jump to the line number in ViM

You can also suspend ViM, do your commands and jump back into it with (with bash)

    ctrl + z
    do your stuff now
    fg

**getting the output of another program**

Sometimes I want to grab the output of another program and throw it into something I am editing.
You can do that with:

    :.!ls -la

Dump the output of ""ls -la"" into the text I am editing now

The book is about 360 pages, but about a third of that is source code listing. It's made for people who know a little bit of Python already, but you don't have to know the Pygame library at all. The book is made to be readable by adults and young adults, and features the source code for 7 games (clones of Tetris, Nibbles, Sokoban, etc.) and explains how the code works. (There's also the source only for four additional games.)

Important: You need to have an account on Amazon that you've made a purchase with in order to write reviews. (This is their basic anti-spam policy.)

I'm paying for these copies out of pocket, and I have to trust people to a certain extent that they'll actually write reviews. I can shell out for about 20 copies to people, and I'll give preference to older Reddit accounts. Only make the request if you are fairly sure you can do the review. If stuff happens and you don't have time, you don't have to return the book. Maybe you can hand it over to someone else who could read it and do a review.

If you'd like to review the book anyway, that'd be great! You can always download and read the book for free from http://inventwithpython.com/pygame

Here's some things you can talk about in your review:

What's your level of coding experience? (Beginner? Professional? etc.)
Do you feel like the book helped you learn the Pygame library?

Do you feel like you know how to program games better after reading this book?

Was the book enjoyable to read, or did you have to slog your way through it?

How old are you? (Teenager, adult, senior citizen, etc.) Do you think other people your age would be able to follow the book?

EDIT: There's also a kindle version on Amazon, but I haven't really put effort into making it look nice. You can download the mobi file from: http://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.mobi

ANOTHER EDIT: Wow, lots of interest. That's awesome.

I'm quitting a job with fairly good pay for my age. (50 k with good growth potential at age 24) 

I am quitting because I want to focus on learning to code full time. I had a consulting business before I started this job and I am going to go back to that part time so I am not broke, but really I am just gonna spend all day erryday learning to program. 

Programming is just too exciting not to. So many possibilities, so many ideas I can now make real I just couldn't resist. I have like 5 projects I can't wait to have enough knowledge to get started on.

I would much rather spin the wheel with programming and hope for the best than grind it out at a job I hate with a boss that doesn't appreciate me. 

As for the plan: 

I am studying using udacity CS 101, invent with python book, and learn to program by Pine. I am also going to keep attempting projects that are outside my ability. What made it click and make me think I could actually learn it is that I started to keep the end in mind. It is much easier to slog through some of the beginner stuff if you keep it crystal clear in your head what the end result is going to be when you actually build something. I learned that by lurking in the subreddit.

I am focusing on learning ruby and python at the same time.  I figure if I am stuck on one I can work on the other. Right now I am in love with ruby. It is so incredibly elegant and intuitive. If ruby was a girl she would be a beautiful french girl. I mostly can't understand her, but damn she looks good. I hope python isn't jealous.

[LPMC on Github](http://github.com/LearnProgramming)

## Why we Mentor

Recently (okay, a while ago...) I posted about starting a group on github
dedicated to providing free, libre, open source software projects for new FLOSS
contributors to work on in an environment conducive to learning, rather than the
more usual environment of comfortable (usually polite) hostility that is seen in
so many major FLOSS projects.

In particular, our goal is to take what usually results in a ""Nope"" and a
rejected pull request and use it as a teaching opportunity, to better train
individuals interested in OSS contribution on _how to contribute effectively_.

To those experienced among us, we know that that means writing tests, being
idiomatic, refactoring, and generally writing good code. To a neophyte
contributor -- full of vim (or emacs) and vigor to contribute -- they may not
know better, and submit a patch which -- while admirable in it's intent, is
unfortunate in it's content.

The idea of LPMC is similar, then, to that of the Apache Incubator -- except the
focus is not on the projects, but the contributors. Where the Apache Incubator
aims to take maintainence of open source projects which are being EOLed (like
Wave), or released from holding by a company (like Thrift), or otherwise in need
of a new home. LPMC aims to help nuture and grow effective FLOSS contributors,
to the benefit of the whole community.

## Why I'm posting

To that end, I'm here to tell you all about some recent changes in the LPMC
which should hopefully motivate us toward our aforementioned goals.

First of all, I've decided that -- for the time being -- We're going to need a
Benevolent Dictator. This is to facilitate rapidly forming all of the structure
needed to build out the community of mentors, projects, websites, irc channels,
mailing lists, and assorted other things needed in starting a community. To wit,
I'm in charge[1] as the ""Dictatus Benedictus Perpetuum"" (because if you can't
say it in dog latin, is it really worth saying?)

Secondly, and in reference to the above, there are many of you (in fact, very
many of you) who posted in response to my previous post with your interest in
being a mentor, I haven't been able to message many of you, simply for lack of
time amidst my other responsibilities. However, I will be going through the list
and rounding out the mentoring team soon.

Thirdly, we have some projects (and indeed, some issues which are to be worked
on for those projects). In particular, we have Percival -- a Ruby IRC bot based
on the Cinch framework. Because of Cinch's plugin architecture, it's very easy
to write isolated code which will work with Percy without issue. There is also
opportunity for building a better testing apparatus for Percy. Right now there
is a very simple mock IRC channel which he interacts with to exercise some of
the plugin functionality, but it is far from ideal. 

Fourthly, we also have the LPMC website to think about. It is much earlier in
the creation process than Percy[2], we're still in the hashing-out-features
phase. I'm working on a minimum viable feature list, and I encourage you all
(designers especially) to look at the site's sole issue on github to get an idea
of where I'm going, and to think about some front end designs for the site.

Fifthly, there is an IRC channel on freenode for the LPMC, convienently located
at #lpmc. I'm in there most of the time, and if I'm not, ideally Percival (the
LPMC IRC bot) will be (though thats a feature that needs to be implemented).

Finally, Jacob Gulotta (better known as zzyzzyxx) will be adding two projects
based in C++. One is an idea for a generic, pluggable A\* pathfinder, which --
when provided an interface to your coordinate system and some other information
-- will provide a fast pathfinding algorithm with minimal fuss.

He will also be adding a project to port [galib](http://lancet.mit.edu/ga) to C++11.

As we add more mentors, I hope we also expand our project list to include more
languages, more paradigms, and generally, more styles of programming. If you'd
like to participate (and you haven't already posted on the previous post) please
feel free to PM me with your name, email, github name, and a description of your
experience. While there is no strict requirement of professional or
non-professional experience, I've been using the general rule of more experience
is better, good github contributions/projects is better, and good contributions
in this subreddit and elsewhere are also important. If I don't respond to you,
don't take it to mean you are not welcome to contribute (and even mentor)
unofficially on any of the LPMC projects. Official mentor status will, ideally,
come through community merit _most of the time_.

## TL;DR

LPMC is live! There are some tickets on Percival and the site already. Shortly
there will be some C++ projects up there. I'll be messaging more of you to drum
up some more projects and mentors. 

I'll be adding more tickets to the existing projects as they come up. So -- get
coding!

It's very hard for me to determine what level I'm at with programming, and if I'm ready for this. Hopefully I've come to the right place to ask.

I'm a comp-sci student, and I've been programming for one and a half years now. The languages I've worked with are C and java. 
All the projects I've done have been for school, and I really want to start creating things for fun/for me.

In C, I've made basic text based programs, like a yahtzee game, dice games, a small shell, a small webserver etc. 
I've never done anything with a graphical user interface in C and I have no idea where I'd even start or what to look for.

The latest project I did in java was a game using swing (a tower defence game). It was lots of fun and I really want to make more non-text based programs.

I'm not too fond of java though. I love C and I want to learn C++ so I thought I might be able to combine learning to use C++ into this little project of mine.

I'm not saying I want to create Call of duty here. What I would be happy with right now is having a window, 
with a circle in (a character) that moves up, down, left and right according to the arrow buttons on my keyboard. I want to build on it more, obviously. But slowly.

What I'm looking for is: What do I need? My genius roomate mumbled something about a renderer when I asked him but I have no idea what that means. 
What do I search for? Are there any basic tutorials for these things? GUI's and c++? Eventually I'd like my game to use 3D, is that extremely different from making a 2D game?

I have experience with C++, C, Java, C#, Perl, Python, Scala, relational databases, CouchDB, blah blah blah....

A fella approached me and stated that he needed someone to redesign and reimplement his entire website.  It includes login forms and customer information where they can view their invoices, make partial payments, add products to current invoices and pay later, so on and so forth.

I told him that I could code.  I didn't think about anything else.  I started laying out the relationships between data tables, I started thinking about profit-margins, how costs, invoices, balances, and inventories would be calculated and stored.

I didn't think about the fact that I've never touched HTML, even though I've spent so much time programming in other languages.  I've never used Ajax, JavaScript, or CSS.  I've never had to deal with the configuration of a web server, LDAP server, or POP3 server.

When I hunkered down, I figured: HTML's easy peasy.  And, well, it isn't difficult if you are good at rote memorization. 

I sucked.  I sucked so hard.  The website turned into shit.  I don't understand what colors looked good together, how the tables show up, why all of the browsers display the most minute fucking things differently, or why my goddamn &lt;p&gt; is just *a liiiiittle bit* off center.  My images looked like crap because I can't edit worth a damn (and I don't have the patience).  Nothing was turning out right.  The guy ended up thinking I was a joke and was lying the entire time to try and make a buck.  I'll see if he'll let me create a desktop application that can generate reports...

Don't make assumptions about things that you hear are easy.  I never took the time to really sit down and understand it because I thought when the time came that I did need it, it would be quick to pick up.  I didn't think about design concepts.  I don't have a knowledge of the ***vast*** libraries of scripts that are out there.  I still have no idea if WordPress is any better than Joomla or Drupal.  I knew not to reinvent the wheel, but I make a habit of just building things on my own.

That will destroy you with web stuff.

A little over a year ago, I started teaching myself php, mysql, and web-hosting. First I wanted to build a website to show the locations of all the DC-area foodtrucks by mining their locations out of Twitter. After a few weeks I abandoned the project because I found a couple of other sites that did the same, though they did it poorly IMO and because I found the natural language parsing rather difficult.

Then I thought about making a map of all the Capital Bikeshare locations along with some data analysis on station and system usage, outages, etc. I started it to see if I could figure out when I'd need to get to work in order to ensure I could dock my bike (i.e. ensure the station wasn't full).  I made [this post about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/h7cr7/check_out_this_site_i_developed_to_track_the/) which goes into more detail.

The site uses a few snazzy plug-ins like [flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/), [this date-picker](http://www.triconsole.com/php/calendar_datepicker.php), google maps, and [sorttable](http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/).

Fast forward a few months and I realize the company that runs the system was actually using my site along with another to assist their re-balancing vans!

Now, I get to join their IT team!

It might be worth mentioning that I was employed during this time, but doing SharePoint front-end stuff with very little development. Also, I didn't teach myself programming per se, I got a CS degree in college 7 years ago, so I knew java, database theory, software design, etc. I just had to learn PHP, databases in practice, some linux server administration (I &lt;3 cron jobs), etc. Also, I had done some C# stuff a few years back as well.

1371063872.0,95,self.learnprogramming,1g7pzw,[Python/Pygame] Just finished coding my first game: Solitaire. My thoughts about the process. Criticism welcome!,105,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1g7pzw/pythonpygame_just_finished_coding_my_first_game/,"The code for the program is [here](https://github.com/Rolandde/Solitaire). Any thoughts/criticisms would be greatly appreciated.

This is my first 'big' coding project I've completed. I've been dabbling in coding for the past two years, writing code snippets here and there, so writing a complete GUI based program was quite an experience. I lurk quite a lot, so I'll take this opportunity to share my experiences in the hope of helping other beginners.

* Start simple. It took me 2 months of sporadic coding to complete this project, but it all started with sitting down and writing the Card class. This helped cement the basic concepts required for the program, such as loading images, keeping track of image location, and how to detect collisions. Most importantly, it gives you an early confidence boost that you'll need to deal with the more complex challenges.

* Really think about the system you are trying to code and don't be afraid to start from scratch. DO NOT try to shoehorn in solutions just because you are married to your code. The version I posted is my fourth rewrite. I hit a wall with the previous three, because I did not think clearly about the problem. I got discouraged and stopped coding. Luckily, in all three cases, I kept thinking about why it did not work and realized I can make it work better if I rewrite the program. The best feeling was writing the final fourth version, where I would still come across unexpected problems (bad), but my code was clean enough for me to write simple solutions (good) that did not feel like bad code.

* As an example for the above lesson, my first two version of the game used the 52 cards as the basic logic unit. In hindsight, this was stupid. I had to keep track of 52 objects and the Card class was giant. More insidiously, as each card had to have it's own behaviour depending on it's location, my code soon became a mess. I threw a tantrum and stopped coding. However, it soon dawned on me that the basic currency of Solitaire wasn't the card, but it was the pile the card was in. Suddenly, I went from 52 giant and convoluted objects to 3 different types of piles. The pile takes a card and keeps track of all the logic. In hindsight this was the obvious solution to the problem, but I did not think ahead.

* Get it working, then perfect it. Don't pull out your hair on every single imperfection. My double click implementation did not work perfectly. A double click was between the first up-click and the second up-click. The last thing I did was properly code a double click as between the first down-click and the second up-click.

Since then I've spent my weekends adding server-side storage of code, the ability for players to learn from each other by  downloading code from leaderboards, and 4 campaign levels that teach some game/rts/algorithm programming concepts.

What I need now is a handful of eager players who are willing to give me feedback on whats too easy, whats too hard, whats fun and whats not, etc so that I can use that to build out a complete set of levels/challenges/game mechanics and take the game from an alpha to a beta.

To that end, I'd like to offer the following to the first 5 people who beat at least two levels of the campaign and one level of the gauntlet.

1.  I'll update the ""contribute"" menu to list you as a play tester
2.  If you click ""Save my mod"" and send me a link, I'll critique your code, give you feedback on javascript design patterns, classes, closures, etc.  (I definitely don't claim to write perfect code, but I've got a fair deal of experience with web development that might be helpful to beginners.  I certainly have a long list of things I'd wish I'd known when I started writing JS).
3.  I'll prioritize any suggestions you have for improvements to the game very highly

Note that you are DO NOT have to beat these levels without help.  If you get stuck and post here with a question I will do my best to help you overcome any coding hurdles that come up.  My goal is to figure out what the big road blocks are so please tell me anything that is confusing as you are playing.

My text based adventure has a sortof ActivityOnVertex Network organization. You start at one ""node"", each node being the game's screenplay housed in a text file. In order to branch off into different plot arcs, I simply scoot to the desired text file that the players actions have caused.
This leads to a directional-graph structure of text files all holding different parts of the script/screenplay.
The plot/AOV converges to one point after each huge plot event, so about 12 times in the story it all comes back to the main storyline with no divergence, and the ending splits off into about 6 different directions in order to complete the ""choose your own adventure"" feel. 

The things I like about this method is that it limits me to the story I want to tell, as in order to branch too far out I'd have to write ALL THAT EXTRA SCRIPT, and that it allows very easily understandable branching storylines.
The things I don't like about this method however, is indeed the fact that it limits me, and that I honestly don't know how to organize a game like Zork Dungeon, for example, in which you can just do pretty much anything. I'm forcing the player along my route (although in this case, to tell a story, maybe a good thing?)

I'm coding this in both C++ and javascript, as the actual code to run the game is simple enough to do in both, and the text files will be compatible with both I think.

If I can give any advice it's to be honest. A lot of really good programmers that I have met are very forthcoming about their shortcomings but in reality they know a lot.

I'm a high school teacher, who has been thrown into teaching grade 10, 11, and 12 communication technology courses.

Due to staffing issues, I got placed in this position, and I'm super excited to do it.  Despite being under-qualified for the position I've been a fan of technology for my whole life, I just don't know the ins and outs of certain things.

Anyways, to the subject...I really want to make coding a part of the program because, apps are a part of every day life now...  However, I don't know much about it...I'd be dealing with beginners and would like to put a continuum in place (a growth from program to program or language to language as students progress through grades).

I'm looking at doing some HTML, and Java...As they seem to be the most important languages from what I've read.

My ultimate goal is to allow the students to see something on their screen, whether it be a game, or a simple program.  Also, to allow them to use the app on a device (Android phone, iPad) but that might be saved for the senior levels.

So, I guess my questions are:

What is a solid program language that is easy for beginners to learn, but will allow them to experience success?

Is there an order in which one should learn programming languages?

I'm thinking about focusing on Java...What is a good program to allow the students to code?  It will need to be installed on our system.

I've found some sites like CodeHS, and MIT App Inventor, but does anyone else have any suggestions on where to start for tutorials?

I'm hoping that there won't be a Reddit DDOS against my school though where they take them down lol.  Anyways, enjoy.  The CS department at UMass Amherst is a great if anyone is considering attending and was ranked highly last time I checked.  Feel free to recommend other courses too.

[CS220: Programming Methodology](http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/cs220/sched.html)

This course is taken after Java 1 and Data Structures and Algorithms.  Java 1 teaches the basic syntax of Java/OOP and the DS course goes over common data structures (and the Java equivalent).  The point of this course is to introduce testing, design patterns, and best practices relating to Java.  If you do well in this course then you can definitely consider yourself at least intermediate with Java.

[CS377: Operating Systems](http://none.cs.umass.edu/~dganesan/courses/spring13/schedule.html)

This class covers all the fundamental parts to an operating system such as scheduling algorithms, handling I/O, caching and memory management, etc.  By far my favorite class.

[CS445: Information Systems](http://avid.cs.umass.edu/courses/445/s2013/schedule.html)

This class is an introductory database class.  It's a bit heavy on the formal relational algebra part, but still has a lot of good stuff in it.

[CS230: Computer System Principles](http://cs230.wikispaces.com/Lecture+Material)

This class is essentially an intro to hardware class.  Cool to learn what is going on under the hood.  This is a prerequisite to the CS377 class.

[CS240: Reasoning About Uncertainty](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/courses/CS240S13/)

Your standard statistics class geared towards CS.  I took an engineering version of this.

[CS320: Introduction to Software Engineering](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/class/2013Spring/CS320/#schedule)

An introduction to software engineering where you learn about how coding works in the real world.  This is mostly a project course, but the slides are still interesting to me.

[CS390DB: Practice and Applications of Data Management](http://avid.cs.umass.edu/courses/390DB/s2013/schedule.html)

This is an easier version of CS445.

[CS326: Web Programming](http://cs326.wikispaces.com/Lecture+Material)

This is an intro to web programming.  You learn Javascript, HTML5, some frameworks like Node.js, and more.

[CS446: Search Engines](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/cmpsci446/)

Learn about how complicated search engines work.

[CS491: iPhone Programming](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~weems/homepage/491IP_Notes/491IP_Notes.html)

This class was experimental and only a seminar IIRC so I'm not sure how in depth it is.  I'm an Android programmer so didn't bother. :P

After going through many tutorials, I feel like I know how to use a hammer; I know what nails are; and I know how to cut the boards-- but I have no idea how to build the house.

I've decided to go with a sub reddit.  it's under [/r/pythonclass](http://reddit.com/r/pythonclass/) I'm doing it this way so people don't need to sign up for *another* website.  This should keep things centrally located.  Stay tuned for the first class.

______________________________________

Hey guys, I've decided to create my own group for people interested in starting at the beginning and learning Python.  


I've created a website (forum) for it and I'll keep it up to date and whatnot in the next couple days.  We will not be starting the ""class"" for a few days, but I would like some feedback asap.  

I'll post the link to the forum, but just in case, I'll post here what I posted there.  If enough people think I should just create a sub-reddit I'll go ahead and do that instead.  It may be easier.  

Here is the link to the forum: [mcbadass.com/forum](http://mcbadass.com/forum) and the [post in question](http://mcbadass.com/forum/topic/python-learning-class) and here's the info:

Here is what I'm thinking and please leave some feedback.

* We will agree on a free source of classes. I've been pointed to [here](http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/index.html) and this looks like an excellent place to start. It may not cover everything we want but since it's totally free and includes video, let's start there!
* We will pick a ""schedule"" that works for the majority. This is always going to be tough because of everyone's different schedules. I would love some feedback on the way to do this. As of now, the only thing I can think of is do a 2 or 3 day cycle for each lesson (which will give everyone time to keep up) and then discuss that particular lesson until the next one and so on. If anyone has any suggestions for a better way of doing this, I'm all ears!
* I will post the lesson for the cycle on my website as well as one of the learning Reddit forums (unless that ticks people off) and it will include all the links for the lesson that cycle. We can discuss it here on this forum (if this forum sucks, I'll change it. It supposedly integrates with Wordpress well, though) and on our brand new IRC channel! Here is the IRC info: 

* Server = Freenode 

* Channel = #McPy 

That should do it!

Let's see if we can make this work! I'll take it upon myself to keep things going and keep us all motivated. I am self employed with time on my hands and I would love to get some programming knowledge down!

I have a small amount of knowledge now and totally understand the basics but it'll take some work to get proficient. I hope we can make this happen and that enough people will be interested in something like this.

Let me know what you guys think!

My brother is ALWAYS trying to create things.

Since I'm an IT guy, he is always asking me questions on how games are created and is programming hard or anything (with his hunger to learn and drive this will be something he loves doing). I can't provide these answers, I'm more interested in network systems and security and such. I remember someone posted about this same type of thing for a 9 yr old, not sure if that's the same stuff I'd get my bro.

Edit: I showed my bro this thread... seeing so many people coming here to provide him these links was pretty inspiring for him. He couldn't get the grin off his face, and he couldn't really wrap his head around the fact that people are helping us! Thanks so much! Then he asked me, ""Wait..what website is this""? And the atmosphere changed a bit . . . 


But anyways! 


I think I'm going to have him try out PyGame first, seems to be the most popular and more people are sharing experiences with it over others. We might just try EVERYTHING listed. I'm going to try to learn this stuff as well so I can try to guide him as best as I can. We have a long journey ahead of us :)


Anyways, I guess my question is, where would my brother start? What software will allow him to create, and at the same time learn about programming/gaming. What programming language should he focus on and is there any specific way I may set up his laptop to be optimal for learning?

I know that GIMP is an option, but I've tried using it and I would rate it half as good as photoshop, if that.  In almost every nuance, it is inferior.  As one of hundreds of examples, when you create a layer mask, and move the layer that should have the mask applied to it, you dont see it update in real time.  You are essentially blind to your changes until you complete the movement.

Are there any free equivalents to photoshop?  If not, why?  Is it just exceedingly hard to produce such a program?

Any answers are welcome.  Basically the only reason the price is a problem for me is because I became ill and had to stop working, so I'm very poor now making it hard to justify photoshop's cost.

SavantWS--Not very strong, merely an experiment in nano(&lt;250 codesize) wavesurfing.

MagicD2--My first bot, haven't made it much stronger since then.

Mercutio--A decent melee bot(designed for battles with 10 robots in a 1000x1000 field), but weak in 1v1.

SavantVS--Another nano bot; this one has adaptive movement.

[Capulet](https://sites.google.com/site/crazybassoon/oog.melee.Capulet_1.1.jar)--A very strong melee bot, and a moderate 1v1 contender.

Fuatisha--A strong nano bot, using a gun that analyses patterns in the opponents movement and an adaptive movement based on the sine function!

Caligula--A nano bot with multiple modes designed to beat different types of robots.

[Maui](https://sites.google.com/site/crazybassoon/oog.micro.Maui_1.2.jar)--A micro(&lt;750 codesize) bot that uses wavesurfing, a form of adaptive movement that tracks virtual enemy bullets for very precise dodging.

MagicD3--A micro with a decent random movement and a strong gun.

[SavantMicro](https://sites.google.com/site/crazybassoon/oog.micro.SavantMicro_1.1.jar)--A micro with the same gun as Fuatisha, but with a much stronger version of SavantVS's movement.

AlphaDragon--A mini(&lt;1500 codesize) bot that uses MagicD3's gun and a much better version of Maui's movement.

[PricklyPear](https://sites.google.com/site/crazybassoon/oog.PricklyPear_1.0.6.jar)--My best robot! It's a mega(unrestricted codesize) with very advanced systems all around.

The mistake is to *assume* something about where the problem is.

For example, someone will come to me for help, saying, *""My program was working just fine, then I added this one line and now nothing works!""*

I'll ask them: did you try removing the line to see that it's working again?

They'll respond: *""no, that's silly! Why would I do that? I know that's the only change I made!""*

I say, ""well, it will only take a second to test that hypothesis.""

I comment out the line they're *sure* is the problem. The program still fails. Now, as soon as I've ruled out the only place they were looking, the problem jumps out. Maybe it was an extra character that they added to the top of the file without realizing it. Maybe they renamed a function and didn't think it was important. Maybe the hard disk filled up and the program stopped working because they ran out of disk space.

The point is, the only way to debug a program is to first figure out the problem, and then fix it.

If you think you know what the problem is, first test your hypothesis - not by fixing it, but by proving that's why it's broken. If you're right, then you're on track to fixing it. But if you're wrong, throw out that hypothesis and start looking for another!

Once you learn how to avoid making wrong assumptions, you'll never be ""stuck"" again. When all else fails, you can test your program one line at a time until you find the first line where something goes wrong. Tedious, yes - but it's just methodical and you will always succeed in finding the problem.

Now I'm a 28 year old guy with a job he hates - but with a prospect.

I subbed to r/learnprogramming after seeing someone mention it in a random post on Reddit.  The concept of programming was always a subject I found interesting, but never took seriously.  The extent of my ""programming skills"" didn't go beyond copying code from a .bas file in Visual Basic 4 back in the 90s to make a Punter back on AOL 3.0.  After that, I kind of just let the concept sit on my mind's backburner and went into college without a clue about what I wanted to major in.

I ended up majoring in something I thought would let me do a lot of travelling, because it's what I wanted to do.  After I graduated with a bachelor's and couldn't find a job in the field, I took a bookkeeping temp job, which eventually turned into a full time deal.  I don't like the job, but it pays the bills.

After lurking on this subreddit, that spark I had lost some time ago suddenly re-ignited and my thirst for learning that which I had forgotten about is now unquenchable.  I signed up for Codecademy and messed around on the Javascript tutorials and now I'm taking CS50 over at edx.org and i'm loving every minute of it.

I'm looking to build a website for a family member which, on a basic level, seeks to sell clothing. As someone with no programming experience, I was wondering which the best way to go about this would be.

I've learnt (or been learning :p) vim which I hope will be helpful for when I start my website build and have now started the HTML tutorial on w3schools and that's been working out fine. After I've done that I'll move on to learning CSS and then perhaps some more in-depth HTML.

First of all, any other recommendations for online-learning of HTML/CSS?

Second of all, how would I go about implementing a shop once I create the website? Ideally there would be the standard sign-up with an email account and password (think Amazon), and people could pay how they wish to. Would one accomplish this with JavaScript or a different language, or alternatively are there any open-source shopping services I could implement into my website to help me get the site running more quickly?

I guess the other option is to have a more simple email-to-order with PayPal as a payment, but I've heard bad things about PayPal seller protection so I'd rather steer clear of that.


I'm really just aiming to learn some basic programming with a fun yet useful project, and I'm not under any time constraints. Any help would be appreciated to do with building the website and learning the languages I need to do as such.

It's the same reason you would learn French, Spanish or any other language.  It opens you up to new ideas, people and opportunities.  The cool thing is, it's a lot easier to learn than French or Spanish because there's fewer parts of speech and you get to make up most of the words.

Allow me to draw a comparison between linguistic syntax and programming syntax. You have variables (nouns) and functions (verbs).  Using those two things you can do a lot.

Functions do things to variables, like verbs modifying nouns in regular speech.

    verb(noun)

Most of the time this makes something new as a result:

    new_noun = verb(noun)

Then you get classes, or proper nouns.  They’re nouns that can verb/perform actions, i.e. variables that can do things.  In Python every variable is also a class, so even the most lowly noun/variable can verb/perform actions.

Now that you have these two things down, you're asking yourself what can you do?  Well to answer that question you have to understand what the computer is good at: math and repetitive tasks.  From there you create loops to help automate those repetitive tasks:

    for item in collection_of_things:
         noun = verb(item)

Computers are also great at logic.  The trick about logic is that you have to break the problem down to simple yes or no questions that the computer can answer. This is because the way that the computer answers questions is by doing math.

    if noun == other_noun:
        other_noun = verb(noun)
    else:
        noun = other_noun

There’s shorthand to make typing all this information into the computer easier, but it comes down to the same thing you learned in 4th grade math class: equals, greater than and less than.  You still have your conjunctions as well, namely, and, or and but (except but is called not or !) Everything else.... is just building on those ideas or combinations of those ideas and technique, just like English or any other language.

You take packages of proper nouns called libraries and do cool things with them. In the example below, ""requests"" is an example of a library:

    import requests
    website_page = requests.get(url)

Boom, you now have a webpage that you can look at and do cool things to.  It’s really that simple. There's libraries that do all kinds of things: graphics, web processing, videos etc. and using them you are only limited by your imagination.

Now why should you invest the time to do this?  Well, let me tell you my story. 

In 2008 I was making $9.50 an hour as a temp customer service representative.  9 months after I taught myself Python I made 2-3x that, and I make a lot more here after only a year and a half in the industry. I've only taken one real programming class, and I don't have a degree.  Did you know that all you have to do to apply to be an Engineer at many companies is pass a programming test?

Even if you don’t want to get into this as a job, do you think your life is going to become less computer centric in the next 20 years?

I find programming simple games like these to have been an immense help when I was trying to learn how to program and wanted different ideas of stuff to code (plus, games are fun!)

Anyway the course only consists of ""lab projects"" in which students must create programs such as a text editor, calculator and a game in C#.

This would all be fine and dandy if the professors did not insist on using Visual Studio 2005 for the projects and NET framework 2.0.

The main issue for me is that I own VS2010 which I got from Microsoft DreamSpark, and for the project to work in VS2010 it has to be converted. However if I convert the project to 2010 I won't be able to open it in 2005 anymore. 

I thought that i might be able to get VS2005 from DreamSpark but it doesn't seem to offer it.

So now I have no idea what to do here. I must work on the projects at home otherwise I won't be able to finish them just in 2hrs a week I get in the lab. I can't talk the professors into using VS2010 or 2012 since then they would be ""out of their comfort zone"" or something and I do not wish to resort to piracy to procure VS2005.

Edit: I was able to build sin. The rest is just a matter of time now.

Edit again: cos is done, need to figure out tan. After Il post all three for anyone who wants to see it

Here's the trick:

  


    **! = factorial            ie,  
                                        4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24 
                                        5!  =  5x4x3x2x1  =  120
                                        6!  =  6x5x4x3x2x1 = 720**

**--------And this is the equation--------**

**sin = a - (a ** 3)/3! + (a ** 5)/5! - (a ** 7)/q7! +** 



**Note**: if you want to do this without using higher-order symbols, you can build a factorial program like this :

    def fact(x):
    a = x
    b = 0
    c = a * (b + 1)
    d = 1
    while d &lt;= 20:
        c = c * (b + 1)
        b += 1
        d += 1
        if d == a:
            return c

**And**: You will be entering a -DEGREE-, and sin is calculated in -RADIANS-, the conversion goes like this;
  
    deg = input('Enter the degrees: ')          # rads = degrees x (pi/180)
    a = deg x (3.1415 / 180)
    rad1 = a

Then write it out like this:

    sin = a - (a ** 3)/fact(3) + (a ** 5)/fact(5) - (a ** 7)/fact(7) 
    print sin

And lastly:
- TWO IMPORTANT POINTS
1) Make sure you see that the signs in

    **sin = a - (a ** 3)/3! + (a ** 5)/5! - (a ** 7)/q7!** 

are alternating, from + to -, they are not the same every time

2) The more chucks of numbers (what do you call those),
    
    (a ** 5)/5!         #these

The more precise your equation will be!


Here is the entire program :D :

    def fact(x):
    a = x
    b = 0
    c = a * (b + 1)
    d = 1
    while d &lt;= 20:
        c = c * (b + 1)
        b += 1
        d += 1
        if d == a:
            return c

    def fn():
    deg = input('Enter the degrees: ')
    a = deg * (3.1415 / 180)
    rad1 = a
    sin1 = rad1 - (rad1**3) / fact(3) + (rad1**5) / fact(5) - (rad1**7) / fact(7)
    print 'The sin of', deg, 'degrees is', sin1

* Imperative
* Object-oriented
* Functional
* I'm pretty sure there are some other essential paradigms, but nothing comes to my mind, probably because I'm not even slightly familiar with them. Any ideas?

**Imperative** programming is about telling the machine what it should do. A simple program may look like this: request variables A, B and C from user, divide them by 3 and put the result into variable D, print variable D. We simply describe the algorithm, the order of actions.

I'm not quite sure about other paradigms, though. It seems to me that at the end of the day, **object-oriented** programming is also about telling the machine what to do (but isn't it the main point of programming, huh? Perhaps there is a better way of describing programs written in imperative style)... However, before telling the program what it should do we describe some things (objects), which will later be used to state the program's purpose. We can describe, for example, a triangle: it is an object which has 3 sides, 3 angles, perimeter and area. We may go a little bit deeper and add that triangle has apexes, which are objects as well; they're objects of class Point, which has 2 coordinates, X and Y. There are some other concepts used in OOP such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation, but I guess I'll just mention their existence and move along.

And then there is **functional** programming. Welp, it's a tough one. I'm not really sure what is the main feature, the main concept of it. I do understand that functional programming is different from imperative and object-oriented languages (well, it's hard not to see that after seeing some tiny bits of Haskell code), yet I can't fully grasp its main idea. Functional programming heavily relies on functions (quite expected, heh), but functions are present in imperative and OO languages as well (although I suppose they should be called *methods* if we're talking about OOP)...

So, I'd like to know if there any other major paradigms that I'm missing, if my conceptions of imperative and object-oriented programming are correct (and if not or you have a better explanation, I'd love to hear corrections or your version) and I'd like to learn the main idea of functional programming.

TL;DR

* Build something you actually need right now.
* Port an existing, well known program to the new language.
* Find a decent book on the language and read through it all as fast as you can.
* Mix action with equal parts learning (reading books/tutorials).
* Study reference works on public repositories.
* Devote large, uninterrupted chunks of time, at least half a day, to learning the new language.
* Learning a language shouldn’t just be a solitary endeavor.
* Use an editor with syntax highlighting.
* Working on a real project with real customers and deadlines is a white hot crucible for learning a new programming language.
* Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio: Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways.

1369981296.0,84,self.learnprogramming,1fe28b,I can't progress beyond bullshitting Object Oriented Programming.,105,21,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1fe28b/i_cant_progress_beyond_bullshitting_object/,"I yearn for the time when I first started coding when a solution was a solution, and as soon as I solved the problem I'd have it knocked out in a matter of hours. Looking back on that time, however, I clearly see that a ""solution"" was a solution in the moment, but now it's just a series of functions calling loops through multidimensional arrays that go to outerspace and back and poop out something that is a workable program. Heaven help my future self or anybody ever looking through that code again, but it sure was easy to code.

These days, I'm glad to add some bureaucracy to my code via OOP to clean things up. The problem is, I'm totally bullshitting it, and I just hope nobody notices. I feel as though I've been bullshitting it since I learned it, hoping that one day I would develop some serious standards. The reality is that at the beginning of each project, I swear to keep it spotless and maintain this rigid standard of perfect OOP, but it just never works out.

What is absolutely killing me is that I'm not even sure I'm making progress anymore. Every class I make, I'm insecure if it's necessary. Every public function terrifies me. If I make a reference to a state, or another class through getters and setters, I'm sitting there for hours staring at the code trying to figure out a way around it. And the worst part is, I have no idea why the things I'm scared of are ""bad practice"" half of the time. I feel like I've just been spoonfed the principles of Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Decoupling, Cohesion and so on, but I don't understand when it's okay to bend any of these rules. For me, specifically, I feel like I get Inheritance, and Polymorphism, and Abstraction. I put them in the same boat, and that boat works for me. When it comes to encapsulation, and decoupling, and perfect cohesion, my boat starts to sink.

For an example off the top of my head, a very typical problem would be something like this: If I make a class that handles X action whenever Y happens in another unrelated class, what do I do? Do I have Y's unrelated class have a reference to X's, and have it notify it about Y? Do I have a parent that's allowed to know about both things, and have IT be in charge of action Y and alerting X? I bullshit it, every time. I don't know the right way to handle it, and I've probably handled it EVERY way. That's probably a classic example of not wanting to couple these unrelated classes, but having two actions that inevitably happen in a related manner.

And then I sit there thinking, ""you know what would be great? Some static or global state that is in charge of alerting whatever needs to know about that."" But I don't do that, because it's bad. I understand why it's bad to a degree, but then I don't. But I'm a pussy, and I avoid it, and I stare at my code trying to figure out how to do things the right way. 

I am at a loss of where to go from here, and I would love to hear some pieces of advice from people who have found a zen and consistency in their design. Any references of design patterns that have helped you, or tutorials, or ESPECIALLY any rules that you have for yourself. Any of that would be awesome to look at. If you'd like to include references to functional programming styles, or mixing in a functional style with OOP and identifying when that's a good choice, all of this would be terrific.

TL;DR I've hit a wall and have no confidence in breaking my code down into Object Oriented perfection, and I would love some standards and advice.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies so far. I think it's worth noting that I do like 30% web stuff, and like 70% game-dev or little applet design. The web stuff to me is not where I'm concerned. Front end is already broken down into a pretty clear style: The DOM and how you manipulate your data. The backend stuff is usually in an established framework like Rails or Django, and all the MVC stuff is pretty hard to stray away from. It's when you're in charge of completely designing something from the ground up that I start getting in my own head. When the program doesn't exactly have a precedent, it becomes a matter of abstracting it until it's a program that's been done thousands of times before.

**[ Part 4: Group Behaviours and Ranged Attacks ]**

In Part 2 (Retreating) we briefly touched on how Fire Imps in each other's line of sight were connected as a group, and that they would share alert levels. Today, I'm going to explain a little bit more about how this group movement actually works - and also introduce a new monster to the pack: The Skeleton Archer, with its Ranged Attacks. Combine Archers and Skeletons together and you have quite a challenging group of foes to deal with.

**[ Group Chasing Behaviours in Detail ]**

Let's break this group chasing behaviour down:

1 . **Detection Phase**. For each frame (more specifically each iteration of the Behaviour Tree), the monster maintains 2 lists: threats (you), and friendlies (other skeletons) - based on line of sight. Entities that cannot be seen are not included in this list. The lists are cleared at the beginning of each iteration. In addition to these, breadcrumbs dropped by both threats and friendlies are also recorded. In future versions, things like visible furniture, entrances and exit doors, walls etc... will also be added. By this point, the monster now has a reasonable view of the world on this exact frame, and we use this information to help the AI determine what to do next.

2 . **Intention Phase**. This is where the Behaviour Tree comes in handy - to aid in the decision making process. We'll not cover the specifics of the Behaviour Tree implementation here - the details are too numerous and will best fit in a future post. For an overview of Behaviour Trees, AIGameDev covers this particularly well: http://aigamedev.com/open/article/bt-overview/

So, conceptually speaking, our tree models a list of ordered priorities: A. Deal with threats, B. Follow alerted friendlies, C. Patrol. The first one we've already covered in Part 1: monsters chase after players in their line of sight, then breadcrumbs (smell trail), then to the target's last recorded location. If these actions fail - the next branch (priority) of the tree is parsed and the monster has a look at what the friendlies are up to. If his friends are alerted, this state is passed on and the monster becomes alerted also. He then proceeds to follow the alerted friend in the same way as in priority A (again line of sight, breadcrumbs, and last recorded location). If this fails also (there are no **alerted** friends visible), then we fall back to patrol (with best guess).

Priority B is particularly important - it allows the monsters to follow each other in a chain/queue-like fashion. As long as the leader of the pack is alerted and can see the enemy, this state and behaviour is propagated to other mobs down in the chain. There's some bugs and caveats to this method, one of them is that it's easy for the monsters to chase each other in a loop (or pairs), so there's some failsafe hackery code to stop this from happening. This is WIP, we plan on cleaning up this behaviour during production.

3 . **Movement Phase**. Simply apply the intentions above to actual movement (modify velocities, update positions, repel from walls, separate from nearby entities etc..)

**[ Skeleton Archers and Ranged Attacks in Detail ]**

This is where the Behaviour Trees really shine. Because we've already defined a lot of the basic maneuvers described in Part 1, 2 &amp; 3 as **behaviour nodes** we can now mix and match them to create new behaviours in our tree. A good example, is the Skeleton Archer. In our tree, there is a conditional node that switches between Chasing Behaviours (from Part 1) and Retreating Behaviours (Part 2). The condition is a whether the distance from the monster to the player is above or below 2 thresholds. To illustrate, we might have an Archer chase the player if it is 100 units away, but flee from the player if it is less than 50. The gap between the 50 and 100 threshold is to ensure we don't rubber band between the two states too quickly, so if the distance is 75 units, we remain in the current state.

So the resulting behaviour is that the Archer maintains a nice position away from you: never to engage in melee combat but always close enough to use his bow and arrow.

**[ Conclusion ]**

Apart from the new Archer behaviours, there's no special code to formulate groups here. It just so happens that a combination of melee type Skeletons (who are extremely aggressive and will chase you down as much as possible) and ranged Archers (who are cautious and will try to maintain a certain distance from you) results in quite effective emergent behaviour - it almost looks like they are working together.

**[ More Ideas for Group AI ]**

The above shows very basic, fundamental rules for group interaction. It's a work in progress - but we plan on bringing more complex manoeuvres in regards to group tactics. Depending on the monster type, critters will be able to do the following:

- Monsters won't attack if they are alone, and will flee instead. Some intelligent ones will flee towards a known group of other monsters. This results in luring, pulling the character towards a more dangerous area and then attacking again.
- Wounded skeletons prefer to escape while their friends are locked in battle - to go and find corpses, heal, and return to the fray later.
- Leaders - if a Skeleton King is in the area, his minions will tend to follow and do what he does.
- Flanking - if the player is currently engaged in battle, other monsters will attempt to flank you from either side or behind.

**[ A plea for help for the next two days ]**

If you enjoy reading these kinds of technical articles, please consider pledging so I can continue active development of the game. Currently I have accrued over half the amount I need (~70%), but as Kickstarter is all or nothing I need to make the full £22k or I lose all my pledges so far. If I get funded, I plan to keep on releasing articles on all aspects of the game's development, including AI but also game mechanics, procedural generation, multiplayer networking, 3D graphics &amp; animation, performance optimization, workflow, physics, collision detection - and everything in between! I don't claim to be an expert on all of these subejcts - this is just my journey in the world of game development, but I hope beginners out there will find inspiration from this. So please help if you can!

**Part 3: Hungry Skeletons**

YouTube Video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cwRo_kM19Ek

Today I'm going to talk about some behaviours that are specific to the Skeleton monster. The idea is that while Skeletons are not chasing or pursuing the player, they are always hungry and will seek out corpses to consume. Eating helps the Skeleton regain lost health, and also if left long enough, consumed corpses turn into more undead Skeletons! We build upon all of the behaviours discussed in the previous articles to do this.

The procedure is as follows:

1 .The Skeleton is in non-alert mode (character is not in line of sight, and there are no detected breadcrumbs) and so it proceeds to patrolling the waypoints using simple A* pathfinding as before. If while in patrol mode the Skeleton detects a corpse it will set the corpse as its destination and proceed to run directly to it using the Seek Steering Behaviour.

2 . If a player is detected, the Skeleton will switch out of this mode and chase the player instead in full alert mode. Skeletons ALWAYS prioritise the player over eating corpses.

3 . When the Skeleton reaches the corpse, it will begin eating it. The eaten variable for this corpse increments every frame. While eating, the Skeleton's field of view is reduced to 45 degrees instead of 90, this is to give the impression that the Skeletons are busy eating to notice much else. Also, it is still in non-alert mode and will not smell any breadcrumbs. This opens up gameplay opportunities such as sneaking around a group of Skeletons who are busy munching!

4 . When the eaten variable exceeds a certain amount (ie. 200) the corpse is completely consumed. At this point some corpses (such as Orc corpses) turn into more Skeletons! This has the effect of a large cluster of corpses quickly propagating into multiple Skeletons, so the player has to make sure this doesn't happen!

5 . At that's it, nice and simple behaviour made possible by combining and tweaking the previous behaviours in a certain way. This is the beauty of behaviour trees, it is quick and easy to create new meta-behaviours by combining the building blocks of the previous ones.

You guys helped me get my feet wet and find a starting point.  

I decided to learn python and completed the Code Academy classes in a few weeks then did the book linked in the subreddit faqs.  

I had the idea at work yesterday to write a program that could take in a word search field and then find any word you asked it to, on all directions, and then give back which row you could find the word.

I know there are much more elegant ways of doing it but I solved the problem by writing strings of each row, then reordering the strings to check for vertical and horizontal words (even reversing the key word in case they exist in the field backwards).

I finished it and it works as intended.  Even fool proofed the data input (mostly).  Also wrote it so it can take any size field (field size isn't hard coded).  It really feels great to have come up with my own challenge and then have the capability to complete that challenge (and in a way better than I expected).

So thanks /r/learnprogramming you got me off to a great start.

First main hiccup:
- What LANGUAGE? I've programmed in Java and C++, but I have no idea which one is more widely used, or if I'm using the wrong ones entirely... so I guess the first question is really; what language is best for a beginner programmer, which is also a widely-used language in the business world?

Second main hiccup:
- WHAT do I program? How does one breach from silly command prompt applications to actual programming? The only programming I've done aside from simple command prompt applications is Minecraft Plugins (java), however I decided that was not for me. Is there some giant comprehensive list of ""stuff you can program while learning to program"" that goes beyond simple command prompt input/output applications? Video games come to mind, but I think that's a step too far for a beginner... unless there's an easy solution.

Thanks for your input!

I have been starting to read the blogs of many programmers and different forums dedicated to programming. I often see people talk about the positives and the negatives of Ruby being a high level language. I also began noticing this while I was programming as well and began to think to myself, ""Am I doing myself a disservice by learning such a high level programming language as my first language?""

I'm not putting the language down at all, I absolutely love it.

I'm 19. I went to college (in the UK) although my interest in programming dates back to when I was a young kid. I was the best in the class. Teaching students rather than lagging behind.

I've used Python, C++, Ruby, Java and plenty of web technologies (I work as a web developer).

I've been trying to learn more over the last 4 years, but something isn't quite right. I'm not sure whether my attention span is shrinking or something but I feel like my mind has a block against programming despite it being something I love.

Writing this is pretty difficult. Everyone knows me as a programmer, a hacker. Maybe my confidence is low. The fact that I have to do a Google search every five minutes to remind myself what I'm trying to do is almost embarrassing in a professional setting.

You know how some people are bi-lingual and can think in more than one language? That's how I feel programming should be. Just being creative and getting my thoughts down into a terminal. But it's almost as if I need to make a completely conscious effort to get anything done nowadays.

I've had job offers from some huge companies and been completely terrified during the interviews. Well paid roles for my age that I don't feel comfortable taking part in.

I'm not usually a nervous person. I have an awesome social life. I have many hobbies other than programming. But there's just something frustrating about reading the same Ruby on Rails Tutorial I've read over 100 times before when I've been working professionally as a web developer for the past few years.

Mods correct me if I'm wrong.

Earlier this year I posted a thread seeking advice to advance from an intermediate programmer to an expert. Amongst the great advice I received, one piece was ""get a programming mentor"". I think that's excellent advice, but being outside the engineering hubs like the Valley (I'm in Toronto), it's difficult to find that kind of relationship. I work in a start-up with 3 engineers, and while my co-workers teach me a lot it's not the same as a mentor.

The purpose of this post is to determine if there's interest in the following idea, and see if reddit can help me flush out the best way to implement it. I want to create a means - could be a subreddit, could be a dedicated website, not sure - for programmers to be matched with mentors who can instruct them and help them advance their skills. Ideally the mentors would be proteges of someone else as well, so we are all benefiting. So you could specify that you are seeking someone to help you learn big data analysis, machine learning, map-reduce, RESTful API design, whatever, and someone with expertise in the areas could step up to help you do so. The mentors could benefit by potentially offloading projects of interest to their proteges, essentially getting free labour. Also, in my opinion, teaching is a great way to learn and enhance your skills, if you can't explain it do you really know it?

I think many of us have completed engineering or computer science degrees, but that's no reason for our education to stop. Since technology is such a fast-paced industry, staying competitive requires constant learning, and I think it would be beneficial to establish a community that helps us do that. r/learnprogramming is good start, but I think a more formal relationship with someone you can turn to regularly would be better. 

Looking forward to your feedback and criticism. Thanks!

So most probably, I am not getting hired :-( .  
But I do not want to make the same mistake next time around, and be prepared. Also the problem is interesting, at least for me.

*Question:*  

There is a large networking log file of around 1GB or more, which has ASCII text. On each line you have entries like source ip, destination ip, error report number,
start time, end time. These entries are separated by one white space.

The difference between start and end time should be as less as possible. The longer it is, we assume there was delay in that request and it is a problem child.

Your task, is to find out, the top 1% culprit requests that have the longest time, and display them or send them to a file. You can find the longest time by subtracting the start from end time. For purposes of convenience, let us not be concerned about the 24 hour time format, for the time being. That is request start at 23.59.00 and ends at 00.05.00

*My attempt:*  

The file is large, so I cannot buffer the file (I am guessing here, I have never tried). So I will have to read the file and do the the output file simultaneously, and keeping a lock on the log file.

I know what the file size is roughly around 1GB for this problem or could be more (does not matter much, it is a large file). Now I know how much is 1% of 1GB that would be 1MB, and each line could have around 16 bytes of information.

So, now I make a max heap data structure, where the comparator is based on the difference between end time and start time. The number of nodes in my heap data structure would be around 1MB / 16B. Which is the information per node, that divides the actual size of the heap.

Now iterate over the log file line by line and keep inserting into the heap data structure. By end of the file iteration, you should have heap with most time consuming requests that form around 1% of the log file or rather 1% delaying requests. With the heap data, the root and the parents, I know when I iterate and print it to a file, I will have the longest delay request at the top and the others in descending orders.

I think, this can be done in python, but the interviewer did not ask me to write the code for this one. Maybe he was horrified with my approach.

********************************************

So, what would be the correct approach to this problem? I have never attempted to solve or discussed these kinds of problem.

What is the most appropriate language to go for this one? A heavy hammer language like C++, Java. Or can it be done with basic scripting languages like awk, bash script, or Python. 

********************************************
********************************************

EDIT 1: As /u/lurgi pointed out, I have made a mistake in the calculation of 1% of 1GB, the figure should 10MB and not 1MB. Should stop thinking in terms or metres km, grams and kilograms.

/u/misho88 has pointed out that a priority queue is a good data structure. Priority queue unlike heap is flat, and easier to implement, and maintain. Though searching through it is costlier, but that is not the point of the above exercise.

EDIT 2: /u/lurgi has pointed out that priority queues are implemented as heaps, atleast the basic API that is provided with the language. This fact completly skipped my mind. Sorry for the above misleading comment.

EDIT 3:
Thank you all for the responses. All, I needed was a second opinion, on what approach would be best for the problem. And it seems, that though file size is a challenge, but not a hindrance.

First the bloopers, /u/DEiE has pointed out, next time I will have to use a pen paper, rather than pulling values of my head while converting numbers with significant number of zeros.

/u/misho88 has pointed out that my estimates for line sizes were optimistic. I should have gone with a pessimistic estimate, which would have been better in this scenario.

/u/mrfooacct has pointed out, I need not use a max heap, which I got slotted in my mind due to tunnel vision. Min heaps would be better, since I am only interested in the highest entries, the smaller entries will just not make it to the heap. This improves the time factor a lot, since I will not have to do any insertion or deletion in the min heap for 99% of my entries. As opposed to doing insertion deletion done previously in 100% of the entries, in case of max heaps.

/u/sumzup has effectively implemented a python code on the above lines, which is the most upvoted entry as I type this.

Another solution has been proposed by /u/__LikesPi especially the second entry. We assume we can give the percentile a actual number let us say 1,000 and name it m, if we have 100,000 entries. We now choose a value k of increment steps, where k &gt; m say 5000 in this case. Now we read 5,000 entries at a time, and choose the 1,000 ones by using the selection algorithm, that he has already mentioned in the post. We then store these 1000 entries, and move on to the next 5,000 entries that we get, and thus we end up with 20,000 entries. We again apply the selection algorithm previously, and then end up, with the 1,000 entries we are looking out for. This has the advantage of time O(n), and space O(mk). A elegant solution if you do not want to use heaps.

Other good solutions one proposed by /u/--jim-- is using a database query. I have used database, but had no idea that you can use a percentage while using a query. What I like about the solution is, this can be accomplished in least number of lines of code. You open a file, go over it, and use the DB API, to insert each of the lines in a DB log, and then let the data base puke out the entries, and redirect them to a file if you want. All the heavy lifting is done by the API, and thus less code and less chances of making a mistake.

/u/katyne gives a solution to a relevant problem, and the problem is interesting, if you are curious.

Thank you all for the responses. I am putting this entry as solved, since we are more or less have a consensus on what would be a good approach. Also, the refinements are subjective, and problem specific.

However, their approach is to focus their programs on music technology and its development, and the staff who teach there are phenomenal computer scientists in their own right. 

My problem is money, just like every one else. After Berklee, I won't have any funds to go to a real Comp-Sci program. I figured that self-teaching would allow me to have a good enough compromise until I can go back to school for my masters (In Comp-Sci or Comp-Eng).

Programming languages are tools. You wouldn't ask to compare a hammer to a saw, so rather than asking ""what language is best"" or ""what language should I learn"", first try to understand your problem and the needs you have to address, then ask the question. ""I need to create a program that will run on the web. It needs to be done fast and on a tight budget. Should I use .JSP / Java or PHP?"". 

2) **There's always more to learn.** The pool of knowledge when it comes to programming is never ending. When you think you've mastered a concept or a language, that's when you plateau and start to fall behind.

3) ** Diversify your knowledge.** All too often I've worked with developers who were essentially one trick ponies. They were great at what they did, but because their span of knowledge was so limited, they were unable to adapt and see things beyond the scope of what they were doing. If you're great with assembly and a wiz at algorithms, why not try learning some UI / UX concepts and dig your nails into some event based programming? Likewise, if you're a front end developer, why not try to learn some algorithms or different data structures? It will overall make you a much better developer and make things like integration a lot easier.

4) **Don't get lazy on the comments.** As tedious as they might seem, they save you a bunch of time down the road. I'm sure many experienced programmers here can recall a time when simply 5 minutes of commenting lines could have saved 5 hours of headache. 

5) **Coding is about teamwork.** If you're hoping to be a good programmer one day, make sure you work not only on your programming skills but also on your social skills. They're nearly as important.

 1. I had to change the url  in

 to this 


            git@github.com:username/mydirectoryRepository.git 


 2. Then continue as usual 


            git push origin master



This will **push** the contents on your **local repository** to **github.com** account. Again thanks for the help.

 **UPDATE 2** : Adding additional folders from your local repo to github.com


 3. Okay When you created a new folder in your local repository containing some files in it. (As i came to know github doesn't accept empty folders to be synced). Heres what you need to do. 


 4. Do a pull so that git actually knows what you are doing ( [read this answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kf5tc/a_newbie_git_question/cboiuwy) )


          git pull origin master


 5. Now Add the new folders to the git stage.


          git add * or git add --all

Programming itself can be described in term of usability. I mean if we didn't concern ourselves with usability, we'd be writing all of code in assemble language. Higher level constructs allow us to code faster and *understand* code easier.  

As such, well-named code is about empowering the user of your code to more quickly understand the behaviours and the nuances of your code. 

Avoid the traps of naming something a ""manager"". It's too generic that It really doesn't tell me what the manager responsibilities are. ""TrafficController"", ""DataTransformer"", ""EventDelegator"" are all names that evoke a more specific concept in your code. 

So look up words in the Thesaurus. Choose names for classes and variables that best fits the function or data it represents. ",,False,,t5_2r7yd,False,,,True,t3_1fttrj,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1fttrj/one_of_the_most_important_tools_of_a_programmer/,

If that will be the case I won't be able to work then, so the only option for me will be trying to work from home\on freelance. 

Since there is another person depending on my income, I must cover my bases and learn some skills to be able to do so in those years I have. 

I'm 24, I'm major in economics with a full time job in unrelated field. So basically what I have now is evenings and weekends and 3-4 years in the worst case scenario. I'm pretty good with math and logic and coding was always something I thought would be a really cool skill to learn someday, just for fun. 

So my questions are:

1). Is it possible to learn programming in such a time frame? On the level to be at least semi-employable for working from home.

2). Am I too old to try? (I've read a thread on reddit a few month back where people discussed how old they were when they started learning coding and most answers were from people that stated when they were under 20. It discouraged me from trying back then, but I was just messing with the idea of learning coding for fun back then)

3). How important having a degree is? I won't be able to afford getting a second education right now, maybe I can get some certificates\finish some courses, will that be enough?

4). I'm reading http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ now and intend to head to http://www.codecademy.com and http://www.udacity.com/ after I'm finished there. What should I read after that? Are there any other good places to learn? Maybe there is something that would be better for me considering my goal?

The last thing I must add - I'm from Russia, so I probably won't be able to use some of advices if they will be too country-specific.

I'm sorry if it's a wrong place to ask these and if there is a subreddit more appropriate for my questions, please direct me to it. 

I would greatly appreciate any answers and advices I can get, I'm really on the crossroads right now. Thanks.

I lurk here frequently, but I'm noticing that there are a lot of very similar posts. They go something like this:

""I really want to learn, but where do I start""

or

""I'm having trouble learning, is there a more fun/interactive/etc way to learn?""

Here's the problem with the first type: There are literally thousands of pages on the web dedicated to answering that sort of question. With a little bit of googling you can find the answer easily.

That's too much of a big deal though. The second type of question is far worse. 

Some beginners seem to expect that if they make enough posts about not being able to learn then eventually someone will wave a magic wand and they will become masters in programming. Unfortunately, if you want to learn, you are going to have to put some work in. If you are finding learning easy, then that's actually a bad thing, because you really aren't learning that much. 

Don't expect to get every single concept first time. Re read the page, re watch the tutorial, fiddle with the code. But don't come on here and ask for an explanation, because you aren't really interested in the answer. If you were interested in the answer you would've done a google search already.

1368570335.0,67,self.learnprogramming,1ecejs,Procedural Dungeon Generation Explained,85,18,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ecejs/procedural_dungeon_generation_explained/,"So today I'm going to be a little different and talk about one technical aspect of my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com), that is random procedural dungeon generation. It's pretty over-engineered, but hopefully will give anyone interested some ideas on generating dungeon layouts for their own games.

The interactive demo can be found here:
[Dungeon Generation Demo](http://tinykeep.com/dungen/)

Here's how I do it, step by step:

1 . First I set the number of cells I want to generate, say 150. This is an arbitrary amount really, but the higher the number the larger the dungeon and in general more complexity.

2 . For each ""cell"" I spawn a Rectangle of random width and length within some radius. Again the radius doesn't matter too much, but it should probably be proportionate to the number of cells. 

Instead of using uniformly distributed random numbers (the default Math.random generator in most languages), I'm using [Park-Miller Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). This skews the size of the cells so that they are more likely to be of a small size (more smaller cells, less larger cells). The reason for this will be explained later!

In addition to this I ensure that the ratio between the width and length of each cell is not too large, we don't want perfectly square rooms but neither do we want really skinny ones, but somewhere in between.

3 . At this point we have 150 random cells in a small area, most are overlapping. Next we use simple separation steering behaviour to separate out all of the rectangles so that none are overlapping. This technique ensures that the cells are not overlapping, yet in general remain as tightly packed together as possible.

4 . We fill in any gaps with 1x1 sized cells. The result is that we end up with a square grid of differently sized cells, all perfectly packed together.

5 . Here is where the fun begins. We determine which of the cells in the grid are rooms - any cell with a width and height above a certain threshold is made into a room. Because of the Park-Miller Normal Distribution described earlier, there will only be a small amount of rooms in comparison to the number of cells, with lots of space between. The remaining cells are still useful however... read on.

6 . For the next stage we want to link each room together. To begin we construct a graph of all of the rooms' center points using [Delaunay Triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). So now all rooms are connected to each other without intersecting lines.

7 . Because we don't want every single room to be linked to every other with a corridor (that would make for a very confusing layout), we then construct a [Minimal Spanning Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) using the previous graph. This creates a graph that guarantees all rooms are connected (and therefore reachable in the game).

8 . The minimal spanning tree looks nice, but again is a boring dungeon layout because it contains no loops, it is the other extreme to the Delaunay Triangulation. So now we re-incorporate a small number of edges from the triangulated graph (say 15% of the remaining edges after the minimal spanning tree has been created). The final layout will therefore be a graph of all rooms, each guaranteed to be reachable and containing some loops for variety.

9 . To convert the graph to corridors, for each edge we construct a series of straight lines (or L shapes) going from each room of the graph to its neighbour. This is where the cells we have not yet used (those cells in the grid which are not rooms) become useful. Any cells which intersect with the L shapes become corridor tiles. Because of the variety in cell sizes, the walls of the corridors will be twisty and uneven, perfect for a dungeon.

And here's an example of the finished result!

I'm looking for a more structured environment, but all straight-up programming jobs require a BS in CS or 4 years of relevant experience which I don't have. 

What I'm looking for is a job that I can use to help me get that four years of experience. Somewhere  that I can use the skills I've learned, but doesn't have the same pressures and expectations as say a startup on a deadline. 

The job boards are fairly intimidating and make learning programming seem that much more monumental and impossible. Most places don't seem to cater to developing developers, but rather getting the best developer for the lowest cost, which I get, but I'm at the point that I'm just flailing around with no destination.

I recently started learning Python at codecademy, I'm not that far ahead. It's my first time programming and I've heard Python is a good way to start.

In the future, when I have a solid base with Python, I plan on moving to C++. I don't plan on doing this professionally, it's just something I've always wanted to learn and might come useful down the road.

My questions are:

* People who have learnt Python and then moved to C++, was it worth the time investment? 

* Should I go straight to C++?

* Did learning Python first help you understand C++ better?

I know it all depends on what I want to do, it might sound very vague, but I just want to learn to make some simple apps, understand game engines and how scripting works.

Thank you.

http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/s657t/learning_to_code_finished_codeacademy/c4bf1c5

It's 6 months later, I've done quite a bit more programming and here's my thoughts:

If someone wants to learn Javascript, I would actually recommend learning Python first. 

Why? Because Udacity is so awesome. In particular I'd recommend CS101, CS262 (which teaches a tiny bit of JS) and CS253 (taught by Steve Huffman who built reddit). Once you have a solid handle on Computer Science and programming in general I think it would be easy enough to skip the Codecademy tutorials and jump into a book like Eloquent Javascript or even Javascript the Good Parts. But maybe not, after learning some Python, Codecademy might be just the thing to familiarize yourself with JavaScript syntax. It's certainly more fun than just plodding through a book.  

With that said, I don't consider Codeacdemy a waste of time and in fact it was quite useful to me. It was pretty nice as a beginner when you don't know what to build for someone to come along and say, ""build this"". 

So I somewhat stand by my words - if you are a total beginner and need to simply learn the syntax and basics of the JavaScript language, then Codecademy is a nice tool. 6 months later I feel like it was worth my time and I'm still popping in to do some Codecademy tutorials. I have also really enjoyed Udacity and that is what I recommend the most.",,False,,t5_2r7yd,False,,,True,t3_12a0da,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/12a0da/6_months_later_codecademy_impressions/,

Explanation: The algorithm works by first finding the minimum path-distance between the cursor and every tile on the map. Then the algorithm iterates through every tile to make a flow-field with forces that push particles towards tiles that are closer to the cursor. Every tile stores an acceleration, and when particle movement is calculated the acceleration is based off of the tile a particle is in.

I've built all the things in the videos and have learned a lot, but I don't feel like I know the content enough.  

I started a new project to make Pong, and I found myself copy/pasting a lot of code from the tutorial video lessons.  I don't know all the function names by heart, and I only know in an abstract sense what they do (i.e I know that al_register_event_source(event_queue, al_get_timer_event_source(timer)); registers a timer to event_queue as an event source, but have no clue how that actually works).  Some other things, like using a timer to set framerate I understand the concept of, but could not implement from scratch on my own (meaning I don't 100% understand the code itself).  The program structure is also a little hazy in my head regarding the timer / drawing part of it all.

Is this normal, or do I not have a strong enough grasp on the content?  Do I keep going, making something like Pong using a lot of copy paste (although I do build my own classes for things like Sprites while the tutorial uses structures to keep it simple)?   

Sorry if this is a weird question, but not being able to build from scratch makes me feel like I'm 'cheating'.

EDIT:  Thanks for the comments all, didn't want to spam and reply to each comment directly.  I feel a bit better and will probably rewatch the videos while building my Pong game to help solidify some of the concepts.

1327894892.0,59,self.learnprogramming,p2iu5,How do you guys deal with the frustration? ,75,16,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/p2iu5/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_the_frustration/,"I think one of the worst aspects of programming is the frustration it invokes. I worked in animation before I decided to part ways with art and get a degree in Computer Science. In all the years I worked in production, I'd never reached the level of frustration and hopelessness that programming gives me. I'm about a year out of college, and looking down the barrel of a career in CS. It's not my intention to just whine into the Internet with this post. I'm actually very interested to hear how you guys deal with the following issues:

- Elitist/hostile help:

Let's say that I'm trying to learn a new framework or a language. I hit a wall, and the documentation doesn't really describe how to do something very well, so I turn to someone else, be it the Internet or an associate. What I'm met with is a condescending droll of responses that essentially say ""omg... you can't do X. You're supposed to do Y. This is so simple. How could you NOT know that? lol n00b!""

This does two things: I'm already pissed that I had to give up and ask a question. Now I'm pissed and I also feel like an idiot. This was a HUGE issue in college, and I got it from fellow students, TAs, and sometimes professors.

- Problem solved. Move on to next problem.

Some of my friends enjoy programming to the point that figuring out a bug or learning a new feature is like a scavenger hunt adventure. I used to be this way... until I started working as a developer on my own. Now, bugs and glitches are the bane of my day. There is no relief when I finally crack an bug. It happens so often that I simply cross it off the list and move onto the next, mostly because I realize that it was my own inexperience that caused the issue in the first place. I broke it, so it becomes my own scavenger hunt of ""Where did I fuck up?"" Couple this with the previous issue and my day just gets rosier and rosier.

- ""How long until you're done?""

I... HATE... this question. Mostly because I have no idea. Or because I've rarely done what I've been asked to do, so while I know what has to be done in order to get from point A to point B, I have no concept of the time needed to achieve the task. Managers don't accept this as an good enough answer.

When I worked in animation and production, there was a clear path from point A to point B. There weren't land mines, or unexpected bugs that swallow an entire evening. There was palpable progression in art. In programming, I could spend a weekend implementing new features, but a client wouldn't know because it was all in the back-end. Optimizing code, memory management, parsing data are good examples.

- Idea, Plan, ???, Profit

One of the most difficult aspects of programming is taking someone's expectations and immediately understand how to follow through into development to achieve the task at hand. I've found that the Internet is far from helpful in this regard, because you'll have polarized opinions everywhere. Person A recommends X. Person B interjects as if to even consider X is an insult to everyone's intelligence. Person A calls Person B a fag and this conversation degrades into a Mac vs PC debate. This is all hilarious reading, but I'm left without an answer, and a lot of wasted time.

- Given the points listed above, overtime is expected

I dunno. Maybe it's just because I work in game development, but I despise this unwritten rule that crunch time is implied on every product. It's Sunday night, and I'd much rather be at home listening to my daughter babble out her first words. But if I don't finish what I have to do (somehow), I may not be the only one who loses their job.

I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jivwy/learnprogramming_the_moderators_need_your_help/), and the community was fairly divided on almost all of the ideas that we proposed.

Well, the community has gone through another growing spurt.  We've gone from 12,000 to nearly 20,000 in 5 months, and think it's time that we breathed a little life into the community.  We're proposing several ideas here (some old, some new), and would like your feedback on all of them.  The admins will read through the responses, and **you** will decide which features get implemented.

If you have any other ideas, suggestions, comments or concerns, please voice them here.  The ideas are as follows:

**User Flair**:  
We're still thinking of implementing user flair appropriately, but the idea behind it has changed.  The concept of a strict ""Teacher/Student"" system doesn't make sense because every teach can be a student, and every student can be a teacher.  In addition to this, we have no way to effectively vouch for any given individuals capabilities in their field.  The replacement idea for this is to allow users to have flair that designates their _languages of interest_.  This doesn't necessarily imply competency, but will allow users with similar interests to easily identify with one another

**Post Tags**:  
Adding post-tags (similar to what is implemented in /r/buildapc).  Different tags will apply different styling to posts, making tutorials, homework, questions and more easily identifiable from the home page.

**Self-Posts Only**:  
Allowing only self-posts within the /r/learnprogramming subreddit was the most widely accepted idea we proposed.  This is still on the table, and we would like any new feedback you can provide on the idea.

**Custom CSS**:  
This is just adding some custom styling to the subreddit to give it a unique feel from the default ""reddit theme"".

Any feedback is good feedback, and we look forward to hearing anything you guys have to say.

I am self taught in python and am by no means a coding genius, but I know enough to get by. I am a reising senior in highschool. My original school had no programming classes at all and I knew that it was what I wanted to do, so I decided to go to a ""boarding"" school with much better resources (ncssm.edu). I have taken the maximum amount of comp-sci courses there.

I came back home for the summer and decided to help out in my area to perhaps help children who were similar to myself. I found that my local museum (whose funding is extremely low, but somehow maintains a fairly good standing, but is quite small) had procured rasberri pi's and was starting a class in python for students aged 9-12. I jumped at the oppurtunity to help. One unfortunate aspect is that I will be at school when the actual class is held, but I am getting the person who will teach it ready. He is a 60 year old book keeper, but he is very smart, has an electrical engineering degree, and from what I can tell loves learning. He knows enough about computers to like linux over windows and stuff like that. He knows near an intermediate amount of python (about up until you get to dictionaries).

What I am asking here, is if anyone had any tips to help me out, or if someone could maybe give me some examples of people who have had some experience teaching kids. I would appreciate if someone who had a job in computer science could give some things that they thought were important to teach. Any suggestions from anyone about anything would be greatly appreciated :D. 

I was also wondering what topics were most important and which could be skipped. 

P.S. While I've been here, they've had me help out with a nanotechnology camp, and I can tell I know way more about it than the person teaching it, and she has been asking me to talk more, but I still don't really know that much about it. To me, it seems that in explaining the concepts, the kids can't understand much of it, because there are some pretty high level sutff there (about highschool level), when the kids are only about 9. If someone could point me to something that could help me out with making that kind of stuff more easy to understand for young kids would help me out a lot.

I mainly use Windows, but what if I end up making a fun game?  I want people with Linux and Mac to be able to play it if they want as well!

I've been reading that Direct3D has a massive market share (understandably. I really only play video games on my Windows partition!)  It has good driver support and the entire DirectX suite (input/sound/etc.).

I'm not too keen on using GLUT to learn OpenGL because I feel it may be outdated and a little too simple for what I would like to eventually create.

I've been searching for about an hour and a half now, an I can't find any good resources explaining what some good OpenGL implementations (APIs and Libraries) are and what they're good at.

I've found OpenSceneGraph.  Is that something I should look into using?  The Direct3D API seems easy enough to get a hold of.

I know that John Carmack spoke out and basically said that the DirectX api is ""better"" than OpenGL and related extensions.  I would start with that, but I would like some opinions on the matter.  I like the idea of any game that I make being cross-platform.

A week later, they emailed me asking me if I could come in to their office for an on-site interview.  I had my interview two weeks ago, which I thought went ok, but I definitely felt that there were huge gaps in my knowledge.

Yesterday, I got a phone call from them inviting me to work there for 12-14 weeks over the summer.  I was pretty excited, and I'll admit a little shocked, that they wanted to hire me, as I am but a lowly sophomore with no CS work experience (except for being an undergraduate TA).  What's more, they are offering me $25/hr, which is pretty damn good.  The only thing is, I don't think I'm qualified.  They're looking to do most of their coding in Python, but almost all of my background is in C/C++.  This semester I am taking a class on Python, but the class is Intro to Game Dev, and consequently not a very good survey of Python.  Furthermore, while I have completed some fairly advanced projects for a sophomore, all of those projects were done in pairs, and I honestly don't know if I could have done them by myself.

Even during their interview, they talked about things that I have no idea about.  Things like ""We're upgrading our RAID cards and the hardware changed so we need to change all of our diagnostic scripts from Perl to Python.""  I've never seen a line of Perl in my life, I just feel like if I go to work there, I'll just be in way over my head, and they'll be sorely disappointed.

Good news, everyone!

I tried setting up github but the ports seemed block at work, so i set it up using BitBucket, which i already used before.

Here's the link: [repo] (https://bitbucket.org/ahottev/reddit-learns-cpp)

There's a wiki page (still blank) and issue tracking, but if we ever need more, we'll setup a JIRA or something. It should be enough for a start ;)

Since there's been a few people interested in C++, and it's the language i'm currently learning, i'm going with that. I've committed a simple project with the SDL library. I used Visual Studio Express 2010, it's free, and everyone should probably be using the same platform...

I suggest installing Turtoise Hg for the sub-versioning but i think any other mercurial program would do. Anyway, i'm using Turtoise Hg and if you need help with it, i could help.

I'll try to set up and IRC maybe this weekend, but i have no clue about how to do that, so if anyone wants to do it...

As for AIM, it's a good idea. We could create a private wiki page for that and post our screen names there. I'll mess with the wiki during my lunch break and this week end.



For now, those interested, a great place to start would be to join the project on BitBucket. Install [Turtoise Hg] (http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/). Download the repository and make a build, just to be sure everything works...

I'm interested in learning about more languages and problems like client / server programming. I thought it would be fun to make a web IRC client that would be the ""chat room"" for my small town.

Here's my current basic understanding of how I might implement this project. HTML5/JS client using web sockets, communicating with a server that implements IRC. I realize that the server aspect could be completely written in Python, or completely written in C. The thought of doing it all in C seems a bit daunting, but I would like to do SOMETHING in C.

So here's my idea for the server side code: Use python (or maybe node.js) for the ""gateway"" that communicates with the web client, and then communicates with another running program written in C that uses an IRC library to handle the IRC stuff, which then communicates back to the gateway which communicates back to the web client. Client -&gt; Server -&gt; IRC Handler -&gt; Server -&gt; Client.

Does this sound feasible? Is it going to be awkward / difficult to have two processes server side that need to communicate with each other, versus just one server side process that gets the messages and executes the IRC commands? It doesn't have to be ideal since this is just a learning project, but if it sounds like a stupid implementation and likely to cause a lot of extra headache, I would like to know and figure out a different way of going about it.

So anyone who frequents this subreddit has probably seen me complain about the FAQ being terrible (and not really being a FAQ at all) at least once.  And for all my complaining, no one ever does anything about it (can you believe it?!).  So I decided to do something about it.

About a week and a half ago I started work on a real FAQ.  As it turned out, /u/zzyzzyxx had also been working on improved content for the FAQ, so over the past week we combined our efforts, we received some good input here and there from other well known /r/learnprogramming regulars, and we've finally got something that I consider to be a legitimate FAQ.

In actuality, the document is a full on wiki for the subreddit, with sections going over how to use the subreddit, some frequently asked questions, and a bunch of resources, many of which are pulled from [this great comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lpgg9/sites_like_codecademy/c2ukpz7) by /u/robot_zombie.

The current version of the FAQ is aimed at the essential beginner questions that get asked here very frequently. There is certainly room for more questions, and we encourage everyone with the ability to do so to add questions (and answers!) that they feel fit within the current scheme.  For now, we've deliberately stuck with questions that are more generally ""about"" learning programming rather than including very common technical problems that people run into (console closing at end of execution, = vs. ==, etc). We believe that the FAQ should focus on teaching people how to fish, not categorizing and outlining every single problem a learning programmer might possibly run into. StackOverflow covers that pretty well already.

As far as the resources section is concerned, there is currently a focus on freely available resources.  We don't want it to turn into free ad space for random startups.  The main exception here is the books section, which does have a small selection of non-free books, mostly because some of the best and most important books in the field of computer programming cost money.  There are also links to external lists of resources, which may contain a mix of free and non-free resources.

So here's the new FAQ: http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/faq

Please add to it if you feel it's missing any important information, and feel free to fix any mistakes or broken links.  Just be sure to keep a neutral tone (think Wikipedia), and make sure any information is accurate and up to date.

I find that I quickly lose interest in programming because I dont feel like I have a serious goal to accomplish. I believe that if there was a tutorial that went from the basics to a full fledged GUI application, then I would feel as if I am actually accomplishing something as I learn. Part of the difficulty is that I often have little insight as to how programming techniques are applicable in the real world. 

Think about how kids often wonder why math is relevant when they are young, but when they take a physics class, they gain an appreciation for it and understand how it is applied to solve real problems (at least for me). 

So ideally I would like to build an application like Evernote (the client version) to learn Python. It would require knowledge on how to read/write files, handle images, create a basic word processor, GUI programming, etc. 

Programming small console applications that do a few things here and there is fine in the very beginning, but I lose interest because I lose sight of the big picture.

In other words, I want to learn programming by creating something that is functional, useful, and complex.

I liked programming since highschool, we didn't have any courses, but my TI-83+ was jacked with programs.

2 Years into college I decide to switch into CS from BioTechnology (I'm a sciencey person, just had to figure out what type of science I enjoyed most.)

The past two semesters were my real experience with computer courses, only two sequential OOP introduction fall/spring courses using Java. I pretty much aced them, and loved the classes start to finish.

Now about my issue with personal projects...

I keep reading here that doing personal projects is absolutely essential to become a great programmer. And I totally agree.

But when I find a neat and (what I think to be) simple project, I slowly fade away from working on it.

During school myself and my group were given 2 big (to us beginners anyhow) projects to work on, with two weeks for each. I ended up becoming the unofficial team leader because I was always willing and excited to work on the project.

I ended up writing most of the code (which isn't very team-like, I know) because I was really into it and excited to solve problems.

So now I find myself in the summer, doing and feeling almos the exact opposite about coding than when I was in school 2 months ago. I still love programming! But the joy in a project isn't really sustained.

I know I can't be alone in feeling this way, but I don't really know how to tackle this lack of motivation.

Despite how I had some rough things happen today (rejection letter for a job listing when I had submitted my resume, stress from college, etc.), this definitely made my whole day so much better.  The app is incredibly trivial and is limited in its audience (only to those who have played Final Fantasy XIII-2), but I guess it's just awesome to know that something I've worked on is available for people to look at and download.  It won't be massively downloaded like popular games by well-known companies, but it's a first step for me and it's definitely something I can now put on my resume. :)  As Litemode had talked about in his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/s7sle/today_i_released_my_first_android_app_a_very/), it's just a great sense of accomplishment and it's definitely something I can say that I feel proud of.

EDIT:  In iOS programming, you're fairly limited on what tools you can use, and you can only use Objective-C for programming.  Xcode was my environment, but instead of using their default unit tester, I used something called [GHUnit](http://gabriel.github.com/gh-unit/).  It's a UI-based unit tester, and it's very nice.  It reports if the test passes or fails, unlike Apple's OCUnit framework, which only reports if a test fails.  I like seeing test results with ""pass"" written all over it.

I've completed the Ruby track 100% (projects included) and I'm currently 70% through the Web Fundamentals track. I should also mention I'm a university CS student. Currently, I'm taking an Intermediate C++ class as well as a Unix class (focused on bash scripting). 

After completing the Ruby track, I felt like I had a solid grasp on the syntax and usage, but had no idea what people actually use it for. Everything I learned was through their little editor and online compiler; I didn't have a clue how to use Rails (still don't).

Now working through the HTML/CSS track, I feel like I have some applicable knowledge (I've got a Linux machine w/ Apache that I use to apply what I learn). 

My thoughts on Codecademy? I think it's a great supplementary resource for someone who's learning programming. I don't think it should be the /only/ resource one uses to learn to code, because you won't learn the application, only the syntax. However, there are so many resources for learning coding on the web that I find it hard to believe someone would rely on just one.

As previously stated, I'm a CS student. I believe what Codecademy can offer to a person like me is a solid foundation to build on top of through coursework, or side-projects--some way to apply the knowledge. I use it because it's fun, rewarding (they give you points/badges/awards for f'kin everything), and relaxed--and because I believe it will be an excellent way to prepare for my web development class that's coming in a semester or two.

* Lecture 4: Imperative Programming and Scripting
* Lecture 5: Functions Part One
* Lecture 6: Functions Part Two

I'm a Cisco network engineer at a medium-to-large size manufacturing company. I've been in IT around 6 years doing mostly networking, but some helpdesk and server admin as well.

I'm interested in learning a programming language that will allow me to change my role in IT to that of development. I'm not sure what the market is like for devs, so I'm not sure which one I should focus on.

I have LOTS of resources available to me. My bosses will allow me any education, online resource, book or boot camp to learn...I just don't really know where to start.

I just graduated from college, but am curious if I should go back for a BS in computer science, or perhaps a BS in gaming development (which usually seem to be at less than great schools).

 I've also heard that programmers learn a lot on their own from books/internet and get small time work making websites for free or the like. Not in college, just the school of hard knocks. They then eventually have an impressive resume in a few years to get an actual job.

Unfortunately I was unsuccessful and they did not provide feedback at such an early stage of the process.

**Problem 1**

Given a zero-indexed array of integers A[N], we can define a *pit* as triplet of integers (P,Q,R) such that:

    0 ≤ P &lt; Q &lt; R &lt; N
    A[P] &gt; A[P+1] &gt; ... &gt; A[Q] (strictly decreasing)
    A[Q] &lt; A[Q+1] &lt; ... &lt; A[R] (strictly increasing)

The depth of a pit is defined as:

    min{A[P] − A[Q], A[R] − A[Q]}

Write a function deepest_pit(A) which returns the depth of the deepest pit in array A or -1 if it does not exit.

1. N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
2. Each element of array A is an integer within the range [−100,000,000..100,000,000].

**My Solution**

    def pit_depth(a, p, q, r):
        return min(a[p]-a[q], a[r]-a[q])

    def deepest_pit(a):
        deepest = 0
        p, q, r = (0, -1, -1)
        for i in xrange(len(a)):
            if q &lt; 0 and a[i] &gt;= a[i-1]:
                q = i-1
            if (q &gt;= 0 and r &lt; 0) and (a[i] &lt;= a[i-1] or i+1 == len(a)):
                r = i-1
                deepest = max(deepest, pit_depth(a, p, q, r))
                p = i-1
                q = r = -1
        return deepest if deepest else -1


**Problem 2**

A string is a palindrome if it has exactly the same sequence of characters when read left-to-right as it has when read right-to-left. For example, the following strings are palindromes:
    
    ""kayak"",
    ""Rats live on no evil star"",
    ""Able was I ere I saw Elba.

A string A is an anagram of a string B if A can be obtained from B by rearranging the characters. For example, in each of the following pairs one string is an anagram of the other:

    ""mary"" and ""army"",
    ""rocketboys"" and ""octobersky"",

Write a function isAnagramOfPalindrome(S) that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is an anagram of some palindrome and returns 0 otherwise.

1. N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]
2. String S consists only of English lower-case letters (a-z).
3. Expected worst-case time complexity is O(n)
4. Expected worst-case space complexity is O(1)

**My Solution**

    def isEven(n):
         return n % 2 == 0

    def isAnagramOfPalindrome(s):
        letter_counts = [s.count(c) for c in set(s)]
        n_even = len([n for n in letter_counts if isEven(n)])
        n_odd = len(letter_counts) - n_even
        can_be_palindrome = n_odd &lt;= 1
        only_palindrome = n_even &lt;= 1 if (s == s[::-1]) else False
        if can_be_palindrome and not only_palindrome:
            return 1
        return 0

I had one hour to complete both questions.

The Huffman class (which is awesome) comes out with a new lesson each week so you have to wait, but the 101 is self-paced. 

At first I wondered if the 101 would be too simple as I've done some reading and several tutorials - enough to know the basics. Man, was I wrong. 

The 101 is kicking my tail. And I like it. 

The problems/homework aren't designed to test whether you learned what was taught. Instead they are designed to test whether you are able to engineer a solution to a problem using the tools taught. Sometimes this has caused quite a bit of brain-hurt. It's also very rewarding when you get it to work. 

After going through codecademy it took me a while to catch on that there wasn't one right answer. codecademy tests for some pretty specific stuff. But Udacity just says, ""figure this out."" Each assignment has a sample solution, but often the forums are full of 10 different approaches that all work. 

I'm on lesson 4 in the 101 and getting pretty addicted. 

Anyone else loving the udacity abuse? 

**Edit:** It sounds like during round 1 you didn't get a lot of feedback. Now that the 101 course is self paced you get instant feedback. You are presented with several test cases up front to code for and when you submit your code it tells you exactly which one of the additional test cases your code failed for. Although I'm sure there are many bugs to squash from my perspective they have improved a great deal for round 2.

Basically I have taken around 4 years of programming classes, 2 classes in Highschool including AP, and 3 in College.  In High School we used Visual Basic and Java with BlueJ.  I have taken introduction to programming which we used Python, and I have taken CS1/CS2 which we used Java with BlueJ for both.  Currently I am taking a Computer Architecture class in which we are learning basics of Assembly through an emulator called ASC.

So basically, I can make simple programs.  I have never really messed with anything that was outside of the classroom.  I can make simple text based games and all of that stuff easy.  Things like card games, number games etc.  All that stuff is easy, obviously.  The number-crunching that goes behind the scenes I think I understand well enough or can figure out as I go.  What really I don't even know how to start making actual graphics that are effected by position on your screen, and how to make it run in real-time instead of a turn based input type thing.  I don't even know where to start.  How to even make that happen.  

From what I understand I should use someone else's library and then make my games through there.  But I haven't ever really imported someone else's library and used it as my own (in fact I'm not really 100% sure on what that means, I guess that it is something that has all of its own classes/functions/etc. that I can manipulate for my use?)  So yea whatever : /

I also understand that most games are made in C++, not Java.  However I haven't messed with it since High School, however I can teach myself again if need be.

So basically, I want to start making little games for myself for learning purposes and for fun.  Particularly how to incorporate things like graphics/realtime programs.  Where do I start? What do I do?  Is making something in realtime/graphics just out of my reach right now?

I recently built an Mp3 search engine as a personal project to better familiarize myself with web design concepts and the basics of search engines. I haven't had an opportunity to work with SQL data over a few thousand rows before this, so it was a learning experience in that regard too.

Anyways, the site is http://jukeboxfor.me

I don't come from a graphical/UI background at all so your advice in that regard would be more than welcome as well. There are just under 600,000 links on the site which means most of the generic Top 40 stuff should be fairly simple to find. Beyond that, it's often hit and miss. I do my best to come up with creative ways to scrape links, but it doesn't really compare to some of the largest sites like BeeMp3.

I use ASP .Net MVC 3 with MS SQL Server. The spiders are written in C# as well. I build an inverted index using a Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;string&gt;&gt; object for quick searching. Beyond that it's all the traditional HTML/CSS stuff.

One thing to note is that streaming songs is kind of hit and miss at this point. For some reason, streaming from 4shared.com in chrome doesn't seem to work unless you're using their player. In Firefox and IE it seems to work fine though, and it's the same situation on other Mp3 websites as well. It could be a referrer thing, I'm not sure.

I recently graduated from college with a CS degree and during my courses, I did well and I felt that I was learning a good amount.  However, after graduating, I feel that I did not learn enough programming to do it well for a job position.  Also, after not finding a programming position for a few months and with much less self-confidence, I feel that I am slowly losing any knowledge that I gained during college.

I want to keep teaching myself so that I can maintain any skills that I have as well as learning how to become a better programmer but with no job, and working full-time at a dry cleaners in order to pay for my school bills, I find it hard to be motivated.

Can anybody help me find any open source projects, entry-level job openings on the east coast, internships, or any advice on what you would do in my situation?  I'm just looking for some guidance but I'm afraid that I'm slowly losing my way.  Thanks.

**EDIT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Sorry guys I should've put in what technical skills I had in the first place.  I just got back from work now.  Anyway,

I started learning how to program with C++ and that is what I am most comfortable with/have the most knowledge in.

I also learned some C and Java and started teaching myself Python for fun.  I should probably go back and learn C and Java more in-depth before moving on to another language though.

I taught myself basic HTML and CSS and bought a book on PHP to teach myself how to write more dynamic websites.  I enjoy creating design concepts of websites and I really want to be able actually create them.  This is kind of my creative outlet I guess.

In terms of experience with any programming projects that I've done in school: I created a very basic openGL game in C, and started work on a sensor node network simulator in C++ with the help of my college professor in which I was the only programmer.

**Thanks to everyone that responded so far.  I really appreciate it and I'll look through all of your ideas and advice.**

I started with Pascal at my sixth form college, and now I'm moving on to C++/Python.

The problem I have is that while I do have a geniune interest in computing and other similar topics, the whole programming thing has never really clicked with me, and it's not something I really enjoy - or at least I haven't much enjoyed it up until now. I'm not sure whether this is due to a various series of events (I bombed my computing project, why I decided to try and do a timetabling program is beyond me), I'm not sure. The main problem I have is that I think of all these nifty things I could do, but never get round to implementing it.

I'd like to get better, and hopefully in doing so I'll find it more enjoyable too. I just feel a little odd, since everyone around me seems to have taken to it like a duck to water, and I'm left here wondering what I'll do with my life.

Since I've nothing to do right now, my dad asked if I wanted to help him with some of his work - to which I agreed. However, I feel way out of my depth. I've basically been tasked with making a lossless compression algorithm for astronomical images, to put it shortly. On the face of it, this wouldn't seem too bad, but given all of the rest of the project which it has to fit in with it gets kinda complicated, plus it works in real time which is something I've never done.

I realise this isn't much of a question, but I'd like to hear from other people who are/were in a similar situation.

EDIT: Thank you all for for your replies. It has been very insightful, and cleared up a few things. I'm going to put what my dad set me on the sideline for a while and focus on some more simple stuff.

I want to create a program/app/?? in which a person could enter real life goals, and track their progress toward that goal. 

I see a map of ""globes"" laid out linearly, each representing steps you've completed/not completed that lead to a larger goal. 

For example, someone could create a ""goal"" of getting a drivers license. They they could ""map"" the steps needed to achieve that goal. The program would take this input and add it to a larger ""map"" of goals that they are working on. 

Think of this as a real-life achievements/skills tree like you see in video games. 

Am I completely crazy? I know this would help me immensely to achieve goals, since I have a very hard time breaking down large goals into manageable steps. Between being lazy and being very visually driven, something like this would help me figure out what steps on need to complete, where I am in achieving my goals, and where I need to work harder.

My plan is to learn these languages, in this order:

* HTML/XHTML (already know probably 50% of what I need to)

* CSS/CSS3 (just started learning today)

* JavaScript

* HTML5

* Python (have done half of LPTHW)

After that, I have no idea what would be best to move on to. My plan now it to learn up to HTML5, then try to get into freelance website development. What other languages would I need to know/benefit from knowing for that? Also, to support myself, I'd need to make around $600-700/mo. How easy would it be to accomplish that, assuming I am competent enough in website development that I would be able to take the clients idea for the website, and make it a reality in a reasonable amount of time?

If I want to be a general-purpose ""freelance programmer"", what languages would I need to know besides what I already have on the list? I'd like to know enough that I'd basically be able to do whatever the clients need done. Any suggestions would be most helpful. I quit dealing a couple months ago, so I have 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to learn what I need to know. My hope is that by this time next year, I'll be a successful freelance website developer.

Some of the skills I've heard desires for are as follows:

* C# ASP.NET with MVC3, WCF, WPF, or Silverlight. Really here it's pick your poison. I've gotten calls about at least 20+ positions, with many of them having entry level requirements, and looking for recent grads.

* Java. Just everything Java. Of course Struts 2 is big around here, as is EJB's. So if your big on that stuff, you'll find plenty of demand for it here. Me personally, I just got out of the Java world, so you can have them all :P

* PHP. Surprisingly recent surge in PHP positions. Not sure why, but it's coming back strong here in the Triangle. Perl oddly shows up on these requests as well.

So if your a recent grad (or work has died out in your current market), and you're looking for work, and willing to move. May I suggest NC. Plus we need more redditors here in NC.

If anyone needs contact info for any of the recruiters, or more details on any jobs for a specific skill level let me know. I'm an active member in the local .NET User Group, so I tend to keep tabs on the local market. Also willing to help in any other ways for recent grads that need help finding appartments or anything else information wise that I can help with.

While I have a decade of working in technology behind me, it's always been for small companies, and I've always only learned what I've needed to in order to get a task done. I didn't go to school for CS, nor have I worked closely with other technology professionals (until the last eight months on my current job), so there are simply a lot of phrases and workflows that I know nothing about.

That being said, I'm a decent Ruby scripter. I've been a ""scripter"" for a long time, playing around with Python and Ruby, and later become a bit more serious about Ruby. I was also a web developer for many years, utilizing PHP...but again, only learned what I needed to know.

That being said, I'm finally ready to buckle down. I want to be a developer (if not professionally, at least as a hobby). I know to many of you just my dichotomy between ""scripter"" and ""developer"" is already a turn off, but it's the only way I know how to describe my current state vs where I'd like to be. 

I know nothing about planning or designing an application. Furthermore, I look at code that many experts write, and it's almost unrecognizable compared to the code I'm writing.

For example, I recently wrote a distribution point sync app that utilizes rsync to push from a master file share to any children. It's pretty rudimentary, and still needs some work (mainly error checking), but I'm pretty proud of it. It's my biggest project to date (with the exception of websites). https://github.com/ckbrumb/distro_sync

However, there are other, similar applications out there written and Ruby. The code confuses me. It makes me realize that I have huge gaps in my knowledge. https://github.com/caleb/rbsync/blob/master/lib/rbsync.rb

Part of my problem (perhaps the root of it all?) is that I've always been a ""base-level"" guy...pretty much in anything I do. A recent example being, I've been trying to write a script to parse through chunks of xml that appears in some of the logs at work. Was my first inclination to go see if there is a library or gem to help with that? Nope. It never has been. I've always stayed as pure to standard libraries as possible. When I first started with programming languages I did so simply because I had no idea what libraries were. I'd seem them mentioned in articles and such, but thought they were over my head, so I did things the hard way and wrote a lot of (mostly procedural) code to get tasks done. Now, even though I understand libraries and their uses, I still find myself int he habit (often without even considering the other options) of try tasks at the base level. In the case of my xml parsing, I spent days trying to parse xml with regular expressions, which hasn't worked out very well.

Okay, that's my sob store. Now, the question. How do you suggest I get over this hump? If I had to categorize myself, I'd say I'm more task-oriented. I have little motivation for most hobbies in my life unless I have a task in mind. Any ideas on an undertaking that would push me over this plateau? Perhaps one that will teach me some of the more ""expert""-level techniques? Should I stick with Ruby for it, or should I take up another language concurrently. I've thought about trying out a text-based game, but I'm not sure.

I'm not certain I've fully expressed how I feel about my programming prowess (or lack thereof). If you have any need for clarification, please let me know, and I really appreciate any suggestions you all have.

I started trying to make a tetris clone back in winter break using pyglet, but I had great difficulty due to the lack of tutorial for the library. This may sound weird, but I also suffocated (figuratively) from some kind of fear (if I have to identify it, I would say fear of not knowing how to start, how to fit things together, etc.), and so I gave up.

This spring break, bored with playing with django, I decided to try making tetris again, now with pygame. This time I set my ambition even lower than before, i.e., I would draw the blocks with rectangle primitives only (no sprite), I wouldn't try to make the gameplay as smooth as tetrisfriend. The fear from before also came back, but I persevered through. Now after two days, I finally finished.

Before, I thought that tetris was nothing special. In the middle of making it, I questioned why I had to struggle like this. The initial part was especially tedious since I was coding out the data abstraction without any visual input. But on the separate occasions when I finally saw a piece coming down the screen, and when I saw that the piece would stop when it hit the bottom, and when I could rotate it, move it, and clear a line with it, I got enough dopamine rush to finish the project. Now I'm really happy.

I'm also really amazed. How did that code turn into tetris? A Tetrimino is just a whole bunch of blocks stored next to each other in memory. Rotating is a lie. It is just some other 2d list pretending to be the same guy. Moving the piece around is a lie, too. It's just drawn at a different place.

I am currently learning Objective C / Cocos2d as my first programming language which I am progressing slowly as many said its not the most forgiving language to start off with. Even with this in mind, I have chosen to do it, and currently enjoying myself. 

I followed a tutorial to create a sprite, make it move &amp; reset its position when it goes off of the screen. This worked perfect, however one redditors comment stood out to me from another /learnprogramming thread. Something like ""dont copy, make up your own stuff""

So with what i learnt in the tutorial, i made another coloured ball, made it move both vertically at a faster speed, and horizontal and keep it scrolling on the screen when it scrolls off. 

I didnt get it right the first few times, so i did a little minor debugging and when i got it working i felt like i really acomplished something.

Here's a summary of the competition:
The compeitition is game based: a tetris style game drops ""packs"" with certain values on each block inside the pack.  Packs are of varying size which is randomly decided at runtime.  This information, and other information such as number of packs, width of the game map, height of the game map (I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the width and height are of the game map.  the documentation is kind of difficult), square root of the pack (packs are always square so you can also think of this as the length of one side of the square), and finally the sum needed to remove blocks from the playing field (e.g. if the sum is 5 and you drop a 3 block onto a 2 block, those blocks are removed).

The above five parameters are initially given as standard input to the program (e.g. scanf in C).  After that, blocks are given as standard input in a visual format.  In the interest of keeping your attention, I'll stop with input here and move onto solving.

The player solves the program by writing his or her solution in the programming language of his or her choice.  All information passed to the compiler at runtime is taken in as standard input.  After downloading the game client, the player can locally run (or upload for scoring) his or her compiled program to solve the game.  Points are awarded for ridding the screen of blocks and bonus points are awarded for having a chain of disappearing blocks (i.e. one block makes another block disappear which causes some block to drop starting another chain, and so on).

I think this is a really cool competition and great practice for those wanting to hone their programming skills.  If you guys have any questions feel free to comment or inbox me.

The server side of websites has always confused me. I was comfortable with writing the PHP and interfacing with MySQL, but it seems like any host you sign up for caters for LAMP and so I never had to understand how this stuff was installed or how it works together.

I really want to understand servers and stuff, I see it as taking the next step in being a real web developer. 

So...

1. What the hell is Node.js?

2. Is it popular? Do people like it?

3. Is it a useful technology or is it sort of a fad?

3. How do you install Node.JS and is it compatible with the average host?

4. Is it a substitute for PHP? Can you use it along side PHP?

5. What are the pros and cons for Node.JS?

6. Are there any alternatives that people prefer?

7. Are there any examples of popular sites that use Node.JS?

8. If Node.JS is something useful to learn, can you recommend any resources for someone with my experience?

Would it just be cmd.exe opened from inside another computer? (That might look a little boring from a filmmaker’s perspective) Also, what would it look like if he’d copy files to his own computer?

Do companies teach you how things work or is it expected knowledge?  Is having a strong grasp of basic programming enough to land an entry level job?  Also, do entry level programmers usually write code, debug, maintain, or what?

What I was trying to do was simple enough: I was trying to generate a random integer between two integer values (e.g. random(a,b)). I looked around to see if there was an existing function that I could use, and I found information about a function called ""randint"". So I added a line of code to my program that looked something like:

value = randint(1,15)

I received an error that randint was undefined. So then I looked further and saw someone state that I needed to import the random library using the following line of code:

import random

The moment I refreshed (F5) IDLE crashed. So then I figured ""welp, that was wrong"" and I went to open IDLE and make the change. I was able to open IDLE, but I can't open the file. In fact, I can't open any of the (three) files that I've made. I opened the file in Notepad++ and removed the offending lines (both randint and import random), but IDLE still crashes whenever I try to open a file.

He died in 2010, and recently I came across the programs again, for the first time since he showed them to me when I was a kid.

The programs are on punched tape that [looks like this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2000px-Papertape-Wikipedia-example-dark1.png). They are written in something called ""Extended BASIC"" and used to be run on a [Data General Nova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General_Nova) minicomputer. I know this because I found some photocopied programming manuals written by the computer science teacher of his engineering school.

Now, I've already made a small C program + shell script to transcribe the tapes bit by bit, and through this method I discovered that the tapes indeed contain BASIC source code in 7-bit ASCII:

    0075 PRINT ""KONE LASKEE. ODOTA HETKI.""
    0080 IF N9=0 THEN LET I2=0
    0090 READ N1,W9

(Those 5 lines are about 30 cm of tape!)

The tape reels are probably a hundred meters long put together, and inputting them one bit at a time is... impractical. While I don't have the skills to do something like build a tape reader or do image recognition to read the tape through running it past a webcam or something like that, I guess I could mark the tape into numbered sections, take photos of it, rearrange it into a continuous image using a shell script + imagemagick... **but how do I reliably interpret the bits from the resulting image**?",,False,,t5_2r7yd,False,,,True,t3_14bjmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/14bjmp/how_to_read_punched_tape/,

The end goal would be simple: write a program. It won't be the cleanest code, it probably won't be secure, but you will write a program that works. This would be a great opportunity for people interested in coding to dive right in and become programmers. It would also be a great opportunity for programmers to create and learn something new.

Want to build a video game in Python? Here's your motivation. How about developing your startup idea? Now or never. Want an excuse to make yet another PHP framework? Think again. Or maybe you want to finally learn Clojure, or build a simple interpreter for your own language? Reach for the stars.

The daily goal for NaNoWriMo is to write about 1,667 words, and this can range between an hour to three hours for most people. Since lines of code can mean plenty of difference between writing HTML and CSS as opposed to C++, we'd probably want a better ""near objective"" metric of success. Writing 100 lines of code a day will mean writing a ~3,000 line program by the end of the month, but a lot of us will go back and refactor code (which should, like editing in NaNoWriMo, not count towards the goal).

Lastly, everyone who participates can feel free to share their program, or at least detail what they created to the rest of the community.

I've just started learning how to code on Codeacademy. I find that when I want to achieve something it helps to have an ultimate goal in mind. 

My university has about 50 different twitter accounts for different areas of the university, and my ultimate goal is to be able to create an 'aggregate' Twitter bot that would RT all of the 'standalone' tweets these accounts make- in other words it wouldn't be selected according to a hashtag, but according to the account tweeting. 

So, I'm a bit confused about a couple of things.

One) Which language to learn on Codecademy to help me do this! I think Ruby is the best, but I'm not sure, as most of the info about twitter bots is how to create a spam one, unless I'm not looking hard enough!

Two) Is selecting according to who is tweeting possible? Or would it be best to use key words/ try and propagate a hashtag? I've not seen it done according to certain twitter users, but instead key words! 

I hope I'm posting this in the right place.

Thanks reddit :)

For anyone who missed [today's blog post](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/11/now-is-time-to-invest-in-gold.html), reddit now has a feature where you can anonymously award people reddit gold for specific comments.  That's the little ""give gold"" link which now appears on comments.

Now, this subreddit has had a policy against offering rewards in exchange for help for a while, and I believe it's a good policy.  With the addition of comment gilding, I think the act of offering a reward for good responses becomes easier.  This has never been a huge problem for the subreddit, and I don't think I've ever seen anyone offer reddit gold in return for help, but the ""give gold"" link makes it so much more direct that I think it could become an issue.

As a frequent contributor to this subreddit, I would certainly stand to benefit from a policy that lets people give out reddit gold for good responses (and I do love that sweet reddit gold), but I think it's in the best interest for the legitimacy of the subreddit to just disable it altogether.

If the mods (read zzyzzyxx) think this is a good idea, chromakode put up instructions [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cssnews/comments/12vd2n/css_howto_customizing_comment_gilding/) on how to customize comment gilding through CSS.

I recently started up a project I hope takes off. It's called Bakge -- **BAK**ersfield **G**ame **E**ngine. It's a project that I'm working on primarily as a **learning and collaborative experience between students or hobby-learners** who are interested in game engine programming or development. I emphasize this because even if you don't know C/C++ that well, or don't know a scrap about game engine programming but want to learn, THIS IS FOR YOU!


Bakge originally was just to see if there were any students at my university who might be interested, but I realized that it could be valuable many, many more budding developers like myself out in the world. Here are some details about the project.


 * Written in C/C++
 * Uses OpenGL as its graphics API (Probably stick to 2.1 for now)
 * Currently using GLFW 2.7.9 as its media library
 * Hosted on Github [here](http://github.com/palistov/bakge)
 * Extremely friendly to first-time collaborators
 * In its infancy. As of now (6/9/2013) it really doesn't do anything. Let's get it functional, yeah?
 * As of 6/9/2013 there is only a build system (GNU Make) for Linux. If you set up a project for it on Windows or OS X submit it as a contribution! Anything helps.
 * Provides frameworks and guides to help you contribute. Check out the issues page and read up on the descriptions.
 * Licensed under the MIT License


**Who?**

Everyone and anyone. If you know anyone interested in open source collaboration (even if they're not particularly interested in game engine programming) send them to Bakge! If you have any questions you can find my e-mail on my Github account page. Or send me a tweet @palistov. Also if anyone wants to set up an IRC channel that can be a means of communication as well.


**What?**

Bakge! While it is a game engine, there's plenty of things you can do, like create math classes, utility code, class hierarchy for game world objects, unit tests, bugfixes, documentation and more. You can search Twitter for the hashtag #bakge for tweets on progress, etc.


**Where?**

http://github.com/palistov/bakge


**When?**

Whenever it tickles your fancy.


**Why?**

This is a big one. Why? Personally I think it's important because the days of coding alone in a dark room by yourself are over. Software engineering these days is all about collaboration and communicating with fellow developers. This is an excellent starting point because not only will you learn the ins and outs of working with git, you will get some firsthand experience designing and building a piece of software with your peers.


As a CS student myself, I have no real perspective on what developing software is like in the real world. I very much believe this project will be a valuable experience and use of my time. I hope others feel the same way.


**How?**

Help in any way you can. Seriously.

* Hit up the [issues](https://github.com/palistov/bakge/issues) page and see if you can do anything.
* Build the engine and mess around with test programs. Find bugs and report them on the issues page. 
* Check out the DESIGN documents and add your input on how Bakge will be built.
* Spread the word. Tell your programmer buddies about it. Have them take a look. Show them how easy it is to help. Shove it in their faces! Tweet with the hashtag #bakge to sing in your birdie voice or whatever.
* Offer your advice. If you're an experienced programmer or open source developer, I personally welcome your advice, comments and criticism.
* Teach. If you're perusing the code and spot a bug that hasn't been caught, contact the author of the code. Help them spot their bug so they can build a fix.


In the spirit of collaboration, if you have anything you'd like to add to this post, let me know!

I am not a seasoned developer and am light years away from any software engineer in terms of education and understanding, but I've been writing various code for a numbers of years.

I'm the guy who knows a little about a lot, I suppose; 'a lot', relatively speaking.

I've made things using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Python, C, Lua, Ruby (Rails) and probably some other I'm not recalling at the moment.  These 'things' were with knowledge garnered on the fly with little in the way of delving deeper into the various other methods of solving the same problem.  

So, I understand what OOP is and why it is used, but I somehow cannot get a grasp on how exactly to implement it. I've read countless books, articles, etc. over the years - some concentrating on just OOP - which has gained me an extensive vocabulary on the subject. But the vocabulary means shit-all if I don't know how to put it to use.

I'm a strong advocate of learn by doing - which is exactly what I've done this entire time.  If I didn't understand something or needed to know a way of going about getting something done, I'd learn and implement until the damn thing worked correctly. However, I haven't come across anything I couldn't do without the use of OOP.  Understand, I have never made anything worth much, so the latter is no gloat.

Now, as far as 'learning by doing' thing is concerned - I've made many attempts at OOP using this route.  Most, if not all examples or tutorials I've followed all had the same premise: 

    Make a Class Car;
    Car has four wheels
    Car has four doors
    Car has 2 cup holders

    make new object from Car
    call car.color
    return 'brown'

BOOM! Now you know OOP...  I can make brown cars all day long using that same method, but when it comes around to understanding how to make something useful, I go blank and without a clue as to where to begin.

Right now, I'm concentrating a lot of my resources into really wrapping my brain around Python and Ruby. It seems like I understand most everything thrown at me but, when it comes around to objects, classes, methods, chaining, prototypes (work w/JS), etc. it all seems to go right over my head... Like, I can't even get a tiny grasp on it.  

I know this has been a whole lot of belly-aching and, if you've read this far, thanks. I suppose what I'm really after in submitting this post is any advice to help me over this plateau of understanding and finally being able to grasp OOP.

(3rd yr CS major),52,7,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/oe2ld/am_i_actually_learning_anything_in_college_3rd_yr/,"I am in my third year as a Computer Science major in college. From what I've seen in the reddit community and heard from other people I know who program professionally it doesn't seem like I'm learning anything of practical value in my classes. I'll break down my CS courses that I've taken so far for easy reading.

Year 1, Semester 1:  
Class - CS108 - Computing Fundamentals  
Language - C  
What I Was Taught - This was the first programming course that I took as a freshman. It taught about the fundamentals of programming including basic syntax, data types, arrays, file I/O, functions, pointers, and we briefly touched on structs. The class was shown how the things listed above worked but that was about it. We used cygwin and wrote all of our homework assignments using the command line.  

Year 1, Semester 2:  
Class - CS220 - Computer Organization  
Language - N/A  
What I Was Taught - This class focused on computer architecture. We learned about the von Neumann model, digital logic, binary, machine code, assembly code, and microprogramming.  

Class CS324 - Internet Tools in Windows  
Language - HTML/PHP  
What I Was Taught - This class taught me about web programming, at least, a little bit about web programming. We only learned VERY basic HTML and we never actually coded anything in PHP. The professor just showed us examples of how PHP worked.  

Year 2, Semester 1:  
Class - CS240 - Data Structures and Algorithms  
Language - C++  
What I Was Taught - This class was about data structures and sorting/searching algorithms. I learned about multi-dimensional arrays, stacks, queues, deques, vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and trees. Also recursion, sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, etc. etc.), and searching algorithms (linear, binary, etc. etc.). As in my CS108 class, I was pretty much just shown how these things worked and we wrote all homework programs using the command line in cygwin.  

Year 2, Semester 2:  
Class - CS307 - UNIX Programming Environment  
Language - N/A  
What I Was Taught - This class was an introduction to UNIX. We learned about many of the different commands and what they do (too many to list here). We also learned a little about scripting in UNIX. This was probably the most practical class I've taken thus far since we were actually in a computer lab and the teacher encouraged us to play around with commands while he was teaching.  

Year 3, Semester 1:  
Class - CS249 - Object Oriented Programming  
Language - Java  
What I Was Taught - This class was all about object oriented programming. For the first few weeks it was just a java version of my CS108 class. Then we moved on to classes/objects/methods, inheritance, sub-classes, and interfaces. The last two weeks of the course was spent on GUIs and applets. The professor wanted us to use UNIX or cygwin command line to write, compile, and execute our programs but over last summer I discovered the wonder of IDEs and have taken to using Netbeans for everything.  

So there you have it. Please note that the school I'm attending does not offer courses in the following languages: Python, C#, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Ruby, CSS, and ASP.NET. I really wish it did offer classes in more languages but it looks like I'm stuck with C/C++/Java without doing any independent study. I am teaching myself C# though. Let me know what you think and what languages I should be looking into learning myself to become more marketable.
