It seems like in Pokemon all the wild Pokemon have the one moveset, like lv.40 Gravelers you met on Victory Road always have the same moves. How would this idea sound? Wild Pokemon could have different movesets. For example a wild lv.40 Graveler have Explosion, Roll Out, Earthquake, and Rock Polish; another lv.40 Graveler can have Explosion, Rock Throw, Earthquake, and Harden. Plus possibly on rare occasions to have wild Pokemon with one egg/TM/Move Tutor move.
This can encourage players to catch wild Pokemon with certain moves, ie. egg moves, they want to pass on when breeding or use in battle.

I made this post to sort of answer the way I'm going with this.

Some of you might remember the Clubs feature. In Fianga City, you can join the Police Club, who have a series of sidequests involving Team Rocket and Mewtwo. In Kivu Town, you can join the Pokemon Rangers, who have a series of sidequests involving habitat-preservation and Manaphy.

The only one I haven't gone into detail about is the third team. I still won't reveal what it is (I want it to be a surprise), but I'll still explain how it works. 

The third club is an evil team. Not Team Asgard (the main evil team), but they still have all those evil qualities, and you guys will recognize them from another game.

In the game, they will ask you if they want to join them, and you can choose whether or not you want to. This sidequest links along with the main quest hand in hand, and the characters in the 3rd club questline will show up in the main quest if you make the right decisions.

The 3rd club is divergent. It has 3 main possible endings depending on the choices you make, and depending on which ending it ended with (or non at all if you didn't join the club) the main quest will be impacted.",,False,self,t5_2wflg,False,,1,True,t3_1dhf8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1dhf8h/modpost_on_diverging_plotlines_and_joining_the/,moderator

So, I've decided to make a FAQ for some of the questions I get more often!

(Even if you haven't had any questions and you're been subscribed for quite a while, please have a read through it! I may drop some info!)

.

***

1) Releases and Testing

***
.

**When is this game coming out**?

&gt;Not sure. I don't want to give out a concrete date because it's likely going to change. However, I want to get an alpha/beta demo thing out relatively soon.

**Will there be Alpha/Beta Releases? When?**
&gt;Yes. I'm going to be doing an alpha release fairly soon but to a closed group of testers. The beta demo will be open for whomever wants to play, a while after the final alpha comes out.

**Can I be an Alpha/Beta tester?**
&gt;Everyone can be a beta tester! The Beldum beta tester flair will be given to whomever downloads the game before the final release.

&gt;Alpha testing will be kept to a smaller group of people, mostly for easy-communication reasons. It's a easier to do testing things with a small group of people.

**Ok, but how do I get to be an Alpha tester?**
&gt;I have a couple people in mind. PLEASE don't PM me or comment asking to be one, it just guarantees I won't do it. Remember that as long as you follow this subreddit, you'll still get the beta version :D

**Can I help with [topic]?**

&gt; As of right now, no. If we need help with something, or we're looking for people of a specific talent, then we will ask.

.

***

2) The Program 

***

.

**What ROM is this game a hack of?**

&gt;This game is NOT A HACK. It is a stand-alone game, created using RPG Maker XP. It will run as an exe file.

**An exe file? Will it run on Mac?**

&gt;Hopefully, yes. It's very buggy atm, but by the final release hopefully it works out fine!

**Will there be multiple save slots?**

&gt;The way the game is designed, yes. Each save is a separate file, so you can drag and drop them out of the game folder at will.

**Will this be for iPhone/Android/Mobile/DS/Gameboy?**

&gt; Nononononononononononononono. Sorry.

.

***

3) The Game (Plot and More)

***

.

**Will these games have legendary mascots? Who are they?**

&gt;Yes. They are Jirachi (Zeta) and Victini (Omicron), though several other legendaries have subquests to themselves (Mewtwo and Manaphy, for instance).

**Will (insert pokemon here) be in the game?**

&gt;Yes. All 649 Pokemon will be avaliable in the game (However, some are version-exclusive, meaning that you'll need to play both Zeta AND Omicron to fill out the entire Pokedex).

**How do I get version-exclusive legendaries on the other game?**

&gt;There is a GTS in Zeta and Omicron, allowing you to trade.

**I have an idea! Put (idea) in!**

&gt;If you have any ideas, please suggest them. But, please suggest them [here](http://redd.it/1bxydj).

**Fakemon?**

&gt;Sort of. There are 5 currently in the game (1 is actually acquirable). 4 of them are purely for plot purposes, and if you really hate Fakemon, they don't appear as much as to ruin your playthrough. 

**I heard you had a Nuzlocke Mode! How does that work?**

&gt;It's very simple right now- your Pokemon cannot be revived. The Nurse won't heal you, and revives and Sacred Ash will be disabled (Rare Candies cannot be used on fainted Pokemon). 

&gt;There is also a Nuzlocke Shop with certain exclusive items to help you out.

**I heard you had a Secret Base! How does that work?**

&gt;It works like Skyrim does. You can find the base, and there is a guy there that you can buy upgrades off of. The program I'm using does not let you move furniture around, sorry.

**The starters are unbalanced!**

&gt; Don't worry. I boosted Bellsprout's stats and nerfed Horsea and Magby's to keep them on par with regular starters.",,False,self,t5_2wflg,1369068784.0,,1,True,t3_1cl9vv,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1cl9vv/frequently_asked_questions/,

* Perks would be added based upon what type of Pokemon you're using. For example: Flying types could fly over patches of wild grass, rock types could climb ledges, Etc.

The basic idea of a shiny is that there was some sort of mutation that caused the pokemon to have a different color and that the only real difference is a different sprite.  What if you could run into ""shinies"" with sprites that are different, but not just a slight recolor?  Sprites that make the pokemon individual and feel unique to you.  For example, maybe there's a 1/8192 chance of a pikachu to be found visibly wearing Ash's hat?  Or maybe you can find a cubone with tribal markings on its skull?  How about a magneton with 4 magnemites instead of 3?  What if you could find a slowbro that had a clampearl on its tail instead of a shellder?  I don't know how difficult it would be to implement different alternate shiny forms, and I can't say that making the sprites wouldn't be time-consuming.  But I think it's a cool idea nonetheless.

1). YOU LISTEN!- You actually listen to our suggestions and take the time to work the good suggestions into you're game, Thank you for that!

3). You're awesome!-Wouldn't change anything in that catagory!

Anyway, I do have one request, again I apologize if this has been asked before, but is there anyway that fakemon added, could be post evolution of pre-existing pokemon. Just to name a few which I believe could use another evolution...
Lapras
Mightyena
Altaria
Kecleon
Absol
Tropius
Zebstrika
Arbok
Dewgong
Marowak
Furret
Corsola

Again just a suggestion if you think you have time. (personally I'd flip out if you made a lapras evolution). 

Thanks!

TLDR-Keep up the good work, could you put in a few fakemon evolutions of actual pokemon?

Edit: You're not your, thanks slayer

Second Edit:
Darkrabbit713's idea is great! Here's a brief summary-Capture of Fakemon isnt nessisary to complete the national dex and are obtainable after the E4/end of plot.  NPCs have knowlege of ""new evolutions"" and one can trade to obtain the Fakemon if one so desires. 
That way, if one wishes to not obtain these Fakemon, they simply do not need to interact with these NPCs, with no impact on their overall gameplay experience, while those who would like these Fakemon, can interact with these NPCs and obtain these Fakemon.

So, after you do the elite four, you've mentioned there's quite an extensive 'quest' etc. and obviously there's other things to do. My idea is that every so often, you get a phone call from the elite four saying ""A trainer just beat us and wants to challenge you- are you free to come battle?"" I see it as having a 'not right now' option because sometimes it'd be annoying, but if you answer 'yes' you fly to the league and battle them. 

Also, perhaps as champion you can only use the team you used to beat the elite four? Although that puts a downer on using the elite four as training tools.

I'm not sure how it'd work if you lost. Maybe you'd have to do the league again to take back your crown or something.

A while ago I put up a short poll in which around 400 of you responded to. The results of this poll can be found in the link below, but I will be breaking it down anyway in order to explain some new content in the works.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zcTlWGuvZ9OBKocFmiOBNhOryU-YDUcgNQU72C3JHCE/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics

While 78% of you wanted the standard trainer to be like the ""Farmer McDonald"" model in which the pokemon in their team all suit a specific purpose, this will not be the case unfortunately. HOWEVER, because of the massive amount of love for this kind of trainer model, I proudly introduce a new series of sidequest trainers that will be available after you collect all 8 badges! [These can be completed before the Elite Four, if you wish]

I have come up with a handful of sidequests that will involve the occupations YOU suggested while fitting into the ""Farmer McDonald"" model. So...

As a prime example of this ""sidequest trainer"", we have, who else, Farmer McDonald. In order to battle him and receive a unique prize, you must first return to him 3 Mareep and/or Flaffy for his flock. He will then give you a moment to get your team ready [a PC will be nearby]. Farmer McDonald's team consists of Dugtrio, Cacturne, Pelliper, Tauros, and Herdier. As a prize, you will receive a level 15 Miltank with the Scrappy ability that knows Hammer Arm, Milk Drink, Stomp, and Curse.

Farmer McDonald is a good example of the kinds of modern-day RPG sidequests that will be tied into the old-school Pokemon formula. The other sidequests will include interactions and battles with Chef Pierre, Fireman George, SWAT Officer Gordan, and Politician Baldwin. Just to tease you guys some more, Chef Pierre has a Farfetch'd, Fireman George has a Blastoise, SWAT Officer Gordan has a Bastiodon, and Politician Baldwin has a Hypno.


Hope that satisfies you guys for now! Stay tuned for some more info soon.

P.S. Someone must have read my mind, because they also suggested a superhero. Perhaps this hero will have a diabolic supervillain to clash against as well...

P.P.S. If you guys have any questions for me, feel free to ask!",,False,self,t5_2wflg,1369155812.0,,3,True,t3_1erlni,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1erlni/poll_results_and_trainer_updates/,

The /s indicate where the two games diverge, being Zeta/Omicron (so it might read Ponyta/Growlithe, which would refer to Ponyta in Pokemon Zeta, and Growlithe in Pokemon Omicron).

.

Team Asgard/Olympus, led by Odin/Zeus, are already on the prowl before you first encounter them. They've been interrogating the world's leading scientists and professors trying to figure out a secret lost to the ages.

The ancient legends say Arceus created the world in the depths of the void, before matter itself existed. They say he created Time, Space and Antimatter, and created life to inhabit them all. They say he disappeared and fell into a deep sleep for millions of years.

If Arceus created the world, who maintains it?

Well, unfortunately for us, Team Asgard/Olympus found out, and they will do anything to control it. They began their takeover of the Vesryn Region, methodically taking over every town, starting with the fairly small village of Nyasa.

Your town. Now it's personal.

Your mother is one of the greatest trainers in the region. She single-handedly tamed rare Pokemon and defeated the Elite Four. Under her guidance, you escape Nyasa Town into a small bunker-cave that connects to another town. She explains what's going on, and informs you that there is an emergency stash of Pokemon within the cave. The Professor shows up, and tells her holy-crap-Team-Asgard/Olympus's-here-we-need-your-help, and being the good samitarian she is, she leaves, leaving you to find the emergency Pokemon and make your way to Zarivar Town, where the Professor awaits.

I booted up the competition earlier today, and I was thinking that this would get maybe 1-2 midcaliber responses. But, instead, we got 25 well-written well-thought out backstories to the Gideon character.

The winner is SuperShuckle.
&gt;Gideon was once a famous actor, having his own exhibit at the museum, but after an unexpected accident on stage that resulted in an injury to his right leg, Gideon was forced into retirement. Now, with the help of his grass Pokemon, he is able to use nature to his advantage and absorb nutrients through the vines running around his body, which in turn helps him walk upright with the use of a cane. He can usually be found at the museum, reminiscing about the days when he was the star of the show.

The reason we chose this is because it was relatively short and was very clever and creative, and did not interfere with the plot we already had. (also, he was one of the only ones with a positive comment score, proving that you guys didn't totally hate his story :\)

I would like to say I am blown away by the stories. [fragileteeth](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1el4fh/backstory_competition_gideon_the_2nd_gym_leader/ca1bfma)'s and [acoustic_waves](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1el4fh/backstory_competition_gideon_the_2nd_gym_leader/ca1bds8)' backstories are examples of well written ones that just ended up being too long and too complicated to fit in.

Thanks for paticipating, everyone! I'm sorry we couldn't clone this character so that he could incorporate all those backstories, they were brilliant.

1375487610.0,36,self.pokemonzetaomicron,1jlj1j,Some input on custom moves...,47,11,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1jlj1j/some_input_on_custom_moves/,"Hello! So, a while back, thesuzerain posted pics of her ""move creator"". While I do agree this is totally badass, I have a few things to say about its balance...
First off, I think that it should have limitations to who can learn what. An example of this would be Scizor. Scizor is a beastly Pokemon that has something like 8~ resistances and only one weakness - fire. However, this resistance (4x, mind you) could be mitigated completely if one were to give him a water type custom move with 70 power, as it scales off his attack (physical!) 
Secondly, IF (I'm not 100% sure on this) you can teach one Pokemon more than one custom move, it would become ""amass as much money as I can and **build** an unbeatable Pokemon!"" Rather than ""I should **train** a good team"". Imagine that Scizor again - say it was level, maybe, 25. Now assume it knows a water custom, steel custom, and bug custom along with a swords dance equivalent/swords dance. It would already have a moveset better than a, say, a non custom move Scizor at level 40.
Finally, accessibility. Even at the sixth gym like someone suggested, it would be very, very strong. If a Pokemon could get technician on these, it could easily sweep through the gyms. Example: oh no! I'm stuck on the 7th gym. Welp, time to buy a move that hard counters it! It's just simply too good. 

My suggestion: make the moves' power scale with badges you own, and only make it available AFTER beating gym 4 - in other words, you'd only be able to buy a 30-40 power move after beating gym 4 and so on. Also, only one custom move per Pokemon would be good - and that move should be something that matches its typing.

Tl;dr: custom moves need to be toned down a bit but should scale to be good later on.

I, for one, enjoy the post-Elite Four content in any Pokemon game more than the main plot itself. I love solving puzzles and trying to find out how to get Cresselia, or to unlock the Regi's chamber.

But with the ridiculous amounts of legendaries added to the game, it can feel a bit unrealistic when you're trying to catch over 47 legendaries in one game.

Since a GTS is included in the game, I'm planing on cutting several of the ""duo"" legendaries into ones that can only be accessed in one of the games. You can get it in the other one through trading, though if you guys really are against it I can add in a Mystery Gift function to get them in the other game instead.

Without further delay, here we are! If you guys don't see a legendary on here, that Pokemon is avaliable in both games :), and if you feel its imbalanced in some way (or you actually want all 47 legendary events in one game D:), please don't hesitate to comment!

The official subreddit for the WIP fan games, Pokemon Zeta and Pokemon Omicron. Created using RPG Maker XP, this game features all 649 Pokemon (maybe more) as well as tons of post Elite-Four content. 

**Introduction**
2 exciting games, 2 powerful legends, 2 evil teams, 2 nefarious plots, but only 1 hero to stop them all. Will you be that hero? Or will you fall prey to the wilds of the Vesryn region?

**Information**
These two games, unlike many other fanmade games (or hacks), feature all 649 Pokemon and viable ways to catch them, as well as being the only game that has two separate counterparts (Zeta and Omicron) which fits the Pokemon tradition. Not all Pokemon can be accessed right off the bat, however, as some legendaries will only be catchable after the main story arc, and some Pokemon are exclusive to one of the two games (there will be ways to get them in the other game, don't worry!). 

The game follows a young hero of Nyasa Town as he fights against a terrorist organization to avenge his home and save the world. The game takes place in the Vesryn region, which is made primarily of three landmasses: the mainland, the Chrome Circle as well as the Vesryn Spear. The Vesryn Spear is only accessible after beating the Elite-4 and contains the second section of the plot, as well as the third section of the Pokemon League (following Gyms and Elite 4). A very interesting location is also accessible only from the Vesryn Spear.

**Congratulations to: /u/The_Incredible_Derp!** 

We picked this one because we really felt it built on the concepts of why it was built in the Orre region, as well as a touch of creativity and a reason for arrogance/coldness/straightup insanity. 

There's also another reason why his just stood out a little more, but revealing it would spoil the plot ;)

[You can read his submission here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1j8ssg/contest_pk096s_backstory/cbcb41n)

On the other hand, Sir_Willis_CMS and I noticed the huge improvement in quality: short, simple, yet creative and elegant submisions. We couldn't just pick one, so we have some runner-ups as well:

- /u/Kylesmomabigfatbtch's story, which can be read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1j8ssg/contest_pk096s_backstory/cbc9n1l). I personally loved this one. When I read it, I just blinked and was shocked by the simple yet ingenius idea.

- /u/0LDR3D333's story, which can be read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1j8ssg/contest_pk096s_backstory/cbce79z). We felt this one was simple, down-to-earth, and provided rather sensible reasoning for it's personality traits.

- /u/snowbabe's story, which can be read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1j8ssg/contest_pk096s_backstory/cbcbosr). Sir_Willis_CMS and I both liked the idea of a human mind inside a battling robot. It was clever and reminded us of Portal (which, incidentally, was what the sprite was based off of).

Congratulations to our winner and runner-ups!

As for everyone else, I really want to stress how impressed Sir_Willis_CMS and I were over the quality of ALL the stories. We could have literally have just picked random ones and still came up with well-written ones. So pat yourself on the back, guys!

I posted this idea to /r/TruePokemon a few months ago: What if the gyms had a *theme*, as opposed to a certain typing. In the post I mentioned a Medieval-themed gym as an example. The people you battle could use Pokemon like Shieldon, Escavlier, etc., and the gym leader could be the ""King"" or whatever, and wear a crown.

A sample trainer's team for a medieval gym:

---Sir Charles---

Dragonair (A dragon

Kabutops (Swordsman)

Bisharp (Another swordsman)

Escavlier (Knight)

Obviously, a regular trainer wouldn't have a nearly full team, and changes would be made if it was a lower level gym (Bisharp -&gt; Pawniard).

I also thought a food gym or something could be fun.

---Chef Gustav---

Vanillish (Ice Cream)

Chansey (Eggs)

Paras (Mushrooms)

Miltank (Milk/Beef)

Farfetch'd (Leek)

This way, even if it was for just one gym, you could use unique pokemon that may not be found anywhere else in the region. Also, it could be more challenging because you couldn't just catch one Pokemon with a type advantage and cruise through to the Champion. What do people think?

I'm in the office right now, so won't go into extreme detail, but there are 3 options.

1. BootCamp - installing Windows on your Mac, partitioning your hard drive into two separate operating systems. This requires a copy of Windows.

2. Virtualization - Parallels, VMWare Fusion, or Crossover. These run within your Mac and have different requirements (for example, Parallels requries that you have a copy of Windows as well, but Crossover does not). All of these have free trials.

3. Wine/Boxer/etc - These are more or less alternate ways of running Windows applications. I have had trouble with these in the past. Sim City 2000 Rom runs fine in Boxer, but Pokemon Fusion Generation ran poorly in both Boxer and Wine (quit after 5 minutes in Wine, never opened in Boxer). Wineskin is another option, though this is one I have not explored.

-please keep in mind, those are just my personal thoughts and ideas, I am not saying they are great or even good, it's ok if you hate them, but keep in mind I'm just another human being, so no need to hate on me, there's always a nice and productive way to express criticism :)-


**IV's/EV's:**

I would love an easy way to see ivs and a chance to train individual ivs, maybe only one point at a time with some kind of extremely rare or hard to obtain item, so one could, with an extreme time consuming technique, get a 'perfect' pokemon, but not through pure luck.

My perfect solution for this would be, that every pokemon has the same max amount of 'traningpoints' it can earn, maybe one per level, and just drop the ivs and evs completely. Therefore one could chose one stat per level to be optimized, the lower the level you obtained your pokemon, the more training you can put into them, the more potential growth they have(maybe start at lvl 5, so you could get an optimal pokemon by breeding and raising it all by yourself) IMO hard training should be more important than pure luck when obtaining good ivs.


**Starters:**

 I would love having more than 3 starters to chose from, just because it would make everyone's adventure so different. I never liked the idea of starting with the same pokemon as 5 million other ppl, I guess it would just feel more special if one could start with one of maybe 9 different typed, 3 stage pokemon. (Maybe you could, at the start chose between 3 or so sets of starters that you and your rival then choose from, maybe a normal set(fire, water, grass) a set of weaker pokemon and one with other typing(dark, fighting, psychic), that also would encourage replaying the game and would give you a more special connection to your starter IMO. 


**Trainer Skills/Professions:**

Being able to skill your trainer, for example in categories like jobs:

Breeder(through breeding and hatching eggs), professor(through completing the pokedex), trainer(winning battles), gardener(planting berries), cook(making some kind of poke food), coordinateur(in beauty contests or sth).

Then have like 5 lvls for every job, if you for example, obtain and hatch 10 eggs you get to breeder lvl 1 and eggs hatch 10% faster or sth. On breeder lvl 5 you have a 25% higher chance of hatching a shiny.

For the professor you could get a higher encounter rate for every lvl, or make some pokemon only able to be encountered by a higher lvl professor(would also make for some better pokemon implementing)

Trainer could get the ability to rebattle others or have tougher trainers challenge him.
(All just quick examples to make a point and explain what I mean ;))


**Unique Pokemon:**

Differing sprites for a pokemon(maybe 3 or 5 or something), like spinda had them, like smaller leaves, different patterns, this is actually sth I would love so much, it would make your pokemon so special and unique, heck I'd help make them if it was possible.


**Customization:**

Ability to somehow change your trainer(some customization?, I liked the one in pokemmo, but I guess it'd be a lot of work to do the battle sprites)


**Optional Content:**

Some kind of contests/mini games that are optional, a lot of optional stuff to customize your story/trainer


**Item Storage:**

 I'd like an item storage, just a simple one to organize some things.


**Pokeball customization:**

The ability to change the pokeball a pokemon was caught(or hatched)  in into another one, or maybe just some special bought or even handmade custom ones that are not for catching, but only for putting already caught pokemon in(while losing the original one) I also liked the customizing of pokeballs.


**Tm/hm:**
 
Have the reusable tm system implemented.
 hm should get extra slot, I read about the having extra items thing instead of hms, I liked most and would like to keep them, like the surfboard and stuff but a jet pack for fly is somewhat weir IMO maybe the ones that would result in weird items could still be done b pokemon(like fly) or there could be a pokemon with fly in every city or you could have a phone or instrument to call a pokemon that'd fly you somewhere.


**Plot:**

Maybe have the main plot lead up to lvl 90, overall have a a lot longer storyline, I'd rather wait forever for the game to be finished and therefore have a lot of time playing it.
Make it somewhat challenging, please, like give other trainers good move sets and decent levels, not only 2 pokemon for a gym trainer.
Some puzzles/tricky parts like the third gen had them with the golem trio


**Poke radar:**

Have something like the poke radar or any way to obtain shinies that doesn't totally suck and is horribly random, I wouldn't want it to be easy, just thought the poke radar was a fun way to try to get your shiny


**Pokedex Completion:**

Give some reward for catching pokemon, maybe for having the original 150 being able to catch mew or for all pokemon get a shiny you choose or something else that's really special(maybe your own house like skyrim, that you can upgrade with every complete gen of pokemon you obtain)


**Trainer sprites:**

It would be amazing if other trainers would only use a sprite once, I know this is nearly impossible, but it would be amazing and I'm sure many would be willing to help with sprites


**Additional thoughts:**

- night/ day changes

- when pokemon is shiny, make following sprite shiny, too 

- rebattling trainers

- I don't know how hard this will be to implement for you, but battling and trading with real people would be amazing

Hardcore or catch'em all, I think that we can all agree on one thing. The difficulty level of Pokemon in general is too low. Perhaps it's because the combat system is linear, in the respect that (Even with the Elite 4, the supposed most difficult challenge of the game) taking a few hours to grind to a higher level can solve any problem. 

In my opinion, Nuzlocke Mode looks like a step in the right direction, but still not where I (personally) would like to see it! 

For example: Just as Nuzlocke Mode would be optional, increasing levels of difficulty could also be selected from the main menu when creating a new save file. I don't know how hard this would be to implement, but like I said, hear me out. I have a few suggestions.

**Section 1: The AI**

Plain and simple, the AI in Pokemon is not what it should be. When you are at a type disadvantage along with a level disadvantage, and you can still easily K.O the opposing pokemon by spamming a single move, you know that something is wrong. I'm going to be starting out with the less ""game changing"" ideas first, and this is where I'd like to begin. If at all possible, please add some form of more intelligent AI. Don't make it possible to beat anyone easily. Have trainers intelligently switch Pokemon if they are at a type disadvantage. And for the love of Ho-oh, please don't let the Elite 4 have typing schemes. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Simple things such as intelligent item usage, switching out, or perhaps stronger trainers using a different Pokemon in their party first depending on what is first in your party. 

**Section 2: Their Party**

As I said earlier, this is plain and simple. Stronger trainers such as gym leaders, storyline leaders, and the elite four should NOT be type based. It makes it infinitely easier when the supposedly best of the best use one type. Seriously, what kind of old fool appoints these people? (Cough Professor Oak cough) Give the stronger trainers varied typing, and if it isn't asking too much, varied style of battle. Perhaps instead of assigning them a type, they could use Pokemon found throughout their local region, but in evolved forms. I.E, if a trapinch is found around their town, why isn't their main Pokemon a Flygon, or a Vibrava, depending on when you find the gym. Anyways, moving on. That's it for the parties.

**Section 3: The Stats**

This may well fall under party, but it's important enough to create a new section for it, in my opinion. One could suggest that the difficulty modes could merely consist of doubling every opponents Poke's health, and they would be correct. You very well could do that, but it wouldn't be difficult, it would just be tedious. And that's exactly what we don't want. In my opinion, the best way to correct this is to alter their stats. Perhaps a bit of the base stats, but I was thinking more along the lines of something else. The gym leaders/Story-line leaders/elite 4 are supposed to be the big guns, right? The best of the best? Then why is it that their Pokemon always have no specific natures, appropriate IV's, EV's, or abilities? I don't know about you, but all of the ""best"" trainers I've ever battled against have bred and re-bred their Pokemon until it was perfect, and then EV/IV trained that lab-bred monster until it was damn near unstoppable. Why is it that the best trainers in all of the regions have never heard of this? In short, my possible suggestion for increasing the difficulty AND realistic-ness of this game is to have every major ""Boss""'s Poke's be fully EV, IV, and ability trained. Honestly, it just makes sense. 

**Section 4: The Spoils of War**

What's the point, you ask? Why make it more difficult? Personally, I think that plenty of people will be well interested in the mode itself, but how about we offer an extra incentive. Perhaps a slightly tweaked questline with an extra catch-able Fakemon, or legendary. My favorite idea to avoid anything unfair to people who aren't as good at battling as others is this: Alter the rate of shinies appearing on harder difficulties. You risk it all, you get the reward. Not by TOO much, but say you had 5 difficulties. For the sake of convenience, lets go with Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. The rate of shinies wouldn't differ from Very Easy-Normal, but on Hard, the rate could double (Just a ballpark figure here), and on Very Hard, the rate could triple. Perhaps add in an extra item shop with bonus held items. Again, nothing too game breaking, just fun things specific to this game. Maybe those could be your custom 1HKO moves? They seem the same as all other 1HKO's, and should offer too much of an advantage in battle.

**TL;DR: Change the AI, the party, the stats, and add in a reward(s).**

P.S. Sorry for the massive wall of text and slur of ideas, but I'm very interested in difficulty being done right, and becoming FUN rather than tedious in a Pokemon game.

When you leave your pokemon you can choose whether you want them to train your EV's or IV's. They would train around 0.25 EV's per step, or something along those lines, so that you can't just walk up and leave. To pay them off you would need to have some rare, but unlimited, item (something like red/blue/green shards). For IV training they could only train one IV per pokemon and for EV's they could only train 1 or 2 stats. Also if the your pokemon already has 510 Ev's they couldn't be EV trained in a daycare.

Contests were a big thing that popped up in my head. In no particular order, here are some that have popped into my head:

* Original contest from the earlier games (where you charm the judges using moves that have preset attributes [cool, beauty, 1 point, 2 points, etc])

* The newer contest where you dress up the pokemon and make them dance

* The Safari

* Bug catching contest from I think HGSS

* The Pokeathlon from HGSS as well I think.

* Underground from DPPt (yeah, this isn't really a contest but most of my friends made it awesome with traps and capture the flag that it felt like a contest)

* Battle Frontier from Emerald/HGSS (the whole thing and not only the Battle Tower) (and toss the Battle Subway into that category too from BW)

These are some, but I'm definitely sure that there were more that aren't on this list. I want to know how many of these or are there any specific ones coming back or are they ALL (which would be awesome) coming back.

There are other smaller (or bigger) things that I'm not sure would or would not be put into Zeta/Omicron like Join Avenue or if Apricorns, Pokeblocks and Poffins are coming back.

Well this just popped into my head midway through this post, there was a friendlist kind of thing from DPPt. I have no idea what it's called but I'm 100% sure it was in one of the earlier DS games.

What if we could have some sort of a friendlist that we could accept each other over the internet (won't know if it would cause problems with viruses and stuff) but we could add each other and have a Join Avenue populated like that.

This is both for making areas interesting to really explore and spend time in a few times in the same save, and on a new play through if you wanted to.


And for the community here: mind sharing your thoughts or ideas of ways you would want to return to an area and go back, again not just for a pokemon you missed that was a 5% chance or whatever,  and for a new play through to not have the ""i've done this all before its boring, nothing new or interesting""


I suppose the clubs and sidequests can open up different areas based on choices in the story, so in one play though you choose option A and that opens the corresponding area A, but next playthrough you might choose B or C instead.  You could also have plot events change previous areas so they are interesting when you go back, something big happens and suddenly some Pokemon become distressed and migrate, and you might find 1 or 2 new pokemon in previous zones from a displacement.

1. Make it locked until you beat the E4 on normal or nuzlocke, than you can use the first evolution of any pokemon you have beaten the E4 with for the solorun.

2. Have a ""Switch"" feature. This means that catching a pokemon releases your current pokemon and replaces it with the newly caught pokemon.

Breeders - Go back and meet them at their house to fight again, but with a specific team they give you! This introduces in interesting difficulty aspect, as well as a difference in type and the normally chosen move set from your normal team.

The developers made a lot of choices there that are really beneficial to those playing both Pokemon or the particular version for the first time.

1. Start off with smaller parts of grass. Grinding on a bunch of wild Pokemon should be an option very early on, not nessesary just by walking. 

2. There should be about 2 easy Pokemon to catch almost immediately. Again, they can be cannon fodder or assets to the team, but let the player choose that. Don't decide ""This way is better/harder so I'm going to do that"" Giving the players the option to sort of choose their difficulty is a good part of a lot of games.

a. The Pokemon also shouldn't be too strong compared to the others. Generally there's a Normal type that can also function as an HM slave if needed. A little later in the game, there's always the tried and true method of throwing in a bug type or two. These Pokemon should also learn a good amount of moves early on, I've seen really low level Pokemon that basically can't do anything because they're a fire type but all they can use is tackle.

3. Put short distances between healing spots early on. As the player is building up their team, give them a little space to test and try things out without too much consequence.

4. Early trainers generally should have simply stronger/more Pokemon that are already in the area, especially since type advantages aren't really something they can cater to.

5. Try to save the first forest/cave/dungeon type thing until after the first gym, because by that point it's likely that the player has a fairly decently built team to tackle something a little longer like a cave full of Zubats and Geodudes.

6. After the 2nd gym, go hog-wild. At this point, the trainer should easily be able to have a solid team of 6 and their personal experience will develop from there.

Anyways, those are my pseudo-tips just based from experience. Take them as you wish, some may be silly contrivances but I think they are pretty important for not making the beginning of your game really frustrating. If you've already gotten past this that's not my beef, just wanted to put this out there.

Ever since i first watched Voice of the Forest I've wanted a ball like this. One that allows you to capture and steal pokemon while unlocking their ""true power"". They could have a high catch rate (higher than ultra but not as good as a master) and whenever a pokemon is caught they would become a darker shade and start glowing gray. You could only catch pokemon that don't have enough willpower to break free (celebi, victini, jirachi, manaphy, most legendaries, etc. can't be caught like with a dark ball). Anyone caught with one should have the word 'Dark' before their name and have dark moves like Darkness Beam instead of hyper beam (still keeps the original type).

in the books there are different houses with different sigils like lions, direwolves, krakens ....

so i got the idea of having a trainer or some trainers ASOIAF related and having pokemons similar to house sigils and it will go something like this (pokemon [sigil / house]):

- Mightyena [direwolf / stark]
- Entei (or Arcanine but that looks closer to a dog IMHO) [lion / lannister]
- Dragonite [dragon / targaryen]
- Magikarp [trout / tully]
- Tentacruel [Kraken / greyjoy]
- Sawsbuck (or Stantler as suggested) [stag / baratheon]
- Lilligant (or another flower pokemon) [rose / Tyrel]
- Staraptor (or Braviary as suggested) [eagle / arryn]
- Solrock [sun / martel]

and you could go even deeper and have pokemons out sigils of other minor houses or characters (bears, dogs, trouts, mockingbirds, bats and many more) and have a trainer from the north, other from the vale, the reach, dorne...

After you get this item I was thinking after you defeat a wild pokemon there could be a random chance to get a ""component."" You could implement things like quests or obtainable blue prints with this. For example we could go to an area where you can find Hitmonchan's and after some luck you pick up a ""Hitmonchan's glove."" After getting a blueprint you can say combine it with ""grimer's goo"" and a ""qwilfish thorn"" to make an item called ""poison knuckles"" and gives all punch moves a small chance to poison.
