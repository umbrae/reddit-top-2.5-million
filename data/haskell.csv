I wrote this over the weekend. A simple Try Ruby!-like interface (though for some reason [my code](http://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console) is a lot shorter, and works on Opera). It uses mueval as a persistent process, that's why it's *really* responsive. Not sure how it will do under heavy usage. It restarts the mueval process automatically when it's killed.

Modules loaded (for now):
Control.Monad, Control.Monad.Fix, Data.Char, Data.Ord, Data.Function, Data.Maybe, Data.List, Control.Arrow, Control.Applicative

**Future work:** A proper interactive tutorial, which I have laid the foundation for in this, I can use the types returned as a way to see what the user typed a la Try Ruby. I don't intend on publishing it to anywhere outside of Haskell reddit until I've tested it more, had other people test it, and written the interactive tutorial. I wouldn't want a simple bug to give people a bad vibe about Haskell, it has to be solid.

**JSONRPC interface**:
It uses a JSONRPC service which provides the mueval evaluator, you can access it like this:

http://tryhaskell.org/haskell-eval.json?jsonrpc=2.0&amp;method=eval&amp;id=1&amp;params={""expr"":""24*42""}

It just supports GET at the moment, not POST. But you could use this in your programs. Not sure if you can use it from your JavaScript; the domain might be filtered, so I'll setup a script on my server that you can include, similar to how Google Maps API works. Try Haskell uses this generic service.

Please let me know what you think, chaps, and post any bugs here. It's mostly surprisingly more stable than I expected. Hopefully when I get up in the morning someone won't have crashed it.",,False,,t5_2qh36,False,,,True,t3_b58rk,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/b58rk/try_haskell/,

Personally, as a bio/math major, I was kind of reluctant to take this course, as I did not really want to learn C++ (felt that R was enough for most of my needs), but it was a requirement for math. And then, I got so ridiculously lucky with the aforementioned change, since I've wanted to learn a functional language for a long time, and apparently haskell also fits with the mathematical thought pattern a lot (the category theory I've dabbled in so far has been very interesting).

1341526954.0,87,self.haskell,w3k4v,This is what my first attempt at writing code in Haskell went like,104,17,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/w3k4v/this_is_what_my_first_attempt_at_writing_code_in/,"So, after reading /r/haskell and skimming/reading the first few chapters of LYAH and RWH over the last few months, I finally decided to give it a go and actually do some exercises and try to learn Haskell for real.

Please don't mistake this text for whining about Haskell being hard/stupid/whatever. I write this because I know that the perspective of someone ignorant can be useful when trying to make things easy to learn and use. (If it is not, then hopefully it can be amusing ;)

**So, the first exercise of 99 Haskell problems is 'Find the last element of a list.'**

I remembered how QuickSort is solved in the Haskell FAQ, and come up with this:

    someList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    lastElem (xs:p) = p
    main = do
        lastElem someList

The error message is cryptic enough (""Couldn't match expected type `IO t0' with actual type `[t1]'""), I also made the assumption that main would be called at soon as the script were loaded in ghci.

When I realize that the good old ""Hello World!"" isn't being introduced in LYAH until chapter 9 (of 14), I take the hint and just define the functions in the file and call them in WinGHCi.

The above code obviously didn't work, and reading about lists I soon found the 'last' function. 


**Over to ""Problem 2: Find the last but one element of a list."". I try the following code:**

    Prelude&gt; list
    [2,34,5,6,7,8]
    Prelude&gt; let secondLast list = list !! length list - 2
    Prelude&gt; secondLast list
        *** Exception: Prelude.(!!): index too large

I verify that the !! operator works as I expect, and that length does what I want it to.  Prelude should have timestamps so I could know how long time it took before I figured why this happened, but I figure at least 10 minutes.

Solution: let secondLast list = list !! (length list - 2)
 

**Next ""Problem 3: Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.""**

Apparently, I can't use 'variables' with upper case letters.

Otherwise easy, solution: let elemAt list k = list !! (k-1)
 

**""Problem 4: Find the number of elements of a list.""
""Problem 5: Reverse a list.""**

Skipping because I know of built in functions...
 

**""Problem 6: Find out whether a list is a palindrome. A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).""**

Uh.. definitely harder. Went to look up if statements and something sort of equal to for-each, then slowly began to write a compare function. Realized that the compare function would be a lot easier if I used reverse. Then I realized I were being silly.

Solution: let isPalindrome list = list == reverse list
 

**Then theres ""Problem 7: Flatten a nested list structure.""**

At this point, I decided to go back to start and try to solve the problems without using the built in functions. They're too helpful, and I'm not learning enough using them too be able to do this. 

**""Problem 1: Find the last element of a list.""**

Uh.. it's hard to say what's off limits. I'd say the !! operator is good, but length not? I click the view the solution:

    myLast [x] = x
    myLast (_:xs) = myLast xs

Uh... Functional programming is hard, not only because you have to think 'differently', but because you have to be open to ideas that would be *ridiculous* stupid to implement in traditional languages. 

Another solution:

    myLast' = foldr1 (const id)

I end up reading about Fold (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Fold (dead link to identity element in section 2 btw)) and can feel my mind bend when trying to make sense of the definitions of foldr and foldl. No mention of foldr1 though. And there are two stackoverflow questions for const and id respectively which asks what's the point of them.

Anyway, folds are not introduced in LYAH until chapter 6, so I decide to worry about it later.
 

Moving on, I solved problem 2 and 3 without resorting to use any built in functions, so I check the solutions. Curious about '.', which LYAH doesn't introduce (afaik), but SO answes that well enough.  No surprises in the solution of problem 2 or 3, and I'm able to understand why the recursive solutions work. And thats it for today.

I've spent the past 2-3 hours doing this, and will continue by creating a recursive function to solve problem 4 tomorrow. Now I have to sleep :)",,False,,t5_2qh36,1341527349.0,,,True,t3_w3k4v,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/w3k4v/this_is_what_my_first_attempt_at_writing_code_in/,

1339377038.0,79,self.haskell,uved7,Waldo - the Haskell powered codebase behind xkcd’s Umwelt comic,99,20,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/uved7/waldo_the_haskell_powered_codebase_behind_xkcds/,"As with all but one xkcd April 1st plan[1], this was conceived briefly before the 1st and rushed into production for the 1st. One year we will plan ahead but that year is far off. This project had, for one of our April 1st events, an extremely long timeline in fact of several days. Usually less than 24 hours is available for implementation.

A short reflection on what went right and wrong seems warranted.

Things that went well:

* Initially Waldo.BrowserCap.mergeBE was a mess of fairly imperative code. Due to many errors in the dataset it was iteratively cleaned up until it became the current functional implementation. This implementation is far more resilient, shorter, and clearer. While this repository does not show the progression it was a beautiful progression of iterative refinement from imperative to functional styles that reminded me the benefits of the lazy programming.
* Testing via Waldo.LoadTest. Early on we launched a small script that recorded the requests waldo would receive. Our testing merely was to replay these, as they’d come in through the heart of waldo. While not exactly matching release day requests they were very similar - on release day people poked at the code base and more unusual requests were made - allowing testing of both stability and performance. A typical test run involved several million requests. On April 1st we used the actual April 1st traffic to test improvements (primarily for efficiency). This testing was both cheap and effective catching every bug we are aware of in the core code prior to release. The only bug we know of that actually made release was a bug in the stats system we used to see how fast people were receiving each possible combination of each story. This bug didn’t show up until April 2nd when we’d gone to bed and stopped checking the stats religiously. Why? Because that bug was an issue of us building up too many function applications. If they weren’t forced quickly enough it caused a stack overflow. Notably this was not tested by the LoadTest module but it was explored with said after it was discovered. As the stats system was a quick hack that had been added around the start of the 1st and was no longer needed for our use, the decision was merely to scrap it instead of fixing the actual problem. A more user friendly stats system is wanted for anyone else using this code base in the future anyway. In fact that was the only space leak encountered and would have been trivially fixed had fixing it been warranted.
* Using an embedded domain specific language to encode the stories. The stories came together at the very end and the eDSL made encoding them fairly fast and easy. Even an experienced occasional programmer was able to quickly make changes and additions. I believe that without this level of abstraction that would not have been possible and I do not believe that directly encoding it would have actually saved time. The eDSL is still far from optimal though. The Waldo.A1 module, which implements the Umwelt story script, still comes out to 969 lines of code.
* Performance of the Haskell code was very good in both terms of throughput and latency. No extensive tuning was required.
* chromakode doing the front end side. He’s amazing and reddit should give him back.

This that went wrong:

* There are very few comments - even where they would be fairly important. Time for typing was time lost in this project sadly. Not only comments suffered for this. 
* Waldo.BrowserCap uses a rather poor matcher. This requires that we try every possible browser separately and with crafted inputs some matchers can be sent down the garden path. For all the complexity of the API of the Haskell regex libraries, I was unable to use it ways I would have used regexps in other languages. Even this style matcher, encoding all of the browsers as a tree would be an improvement though (still suffering the efficiency problem though). Sadly, the timeline of this project did not allow much time for optimization and as such the simplest solution was used and a large LRU cache was placed in front of it.
* Possibly the eDSL should select the panel sizes also. A knapsack sizer may be a poor choice even in the current form and is pluggable. Time disallowed playing with other solutions.

Future plans:

* Split out Waldo.BrowserCap as it’s own module. This really isn’t something that is conceptually part of waldo and it would make sense to use it elsewhere.
* Instead of integrating the server, export an API that can be used as a component. This is how it was really designed to operate but this was more convenient at the time. The benefits of rolling it into dynamic.xkcd.com like I eventually plan would have actually detracted while we were so actively working on it.

Many parts of xkcd are implemented with Haskell. A short list includes:

* dynamic.xkcd.com (though it is unloved and in need of a rewrite, using an old, old version of happstack - a rewrite on WAI exists and will be deployed soonish)
* Umwelt, which will be merged with dynamic.xkcd.com soon; described above.
* pbfcomics.com which we host and somewhat maintain. Based on WAI, feed, and HStringTemplate (mistake due to the Haskell implementation of StringTemplate).
* holistic.xkcd.com a quick joke site using WAI, digestive-functors (plus internal digestive-functors-wai that needs to be open sourced), the leveldb bindings, and for spam checking http-conduit.
* Tools for interacting with our hosting provider [voxel.net](http://voxel.net/) (downloads logs, purges CDN, etc). (release need to release these)
* Some business admin tools.
* Two new sites that haven’t been released yet. One of which is written using [Hakyll](http://i.imgur.com/ACWKO.gif).

Haskell is used so much over here because of its safety and low surprise factor. The community is made up primarily of contributors who tend to care about the details of their respective problem domain and craft APIs to match. While libraries can be scarce the ones that are available are crafted with an attention to detail often lacking in other languages.

We have a decent amount of code, but we’re not actively maintaining all the pieces all of the time. When we aren’t working on our code, it needs to keep on working, and when we come back to it after a long absence we need to not have to remember that something in a far flung file interacts with it - there must be a clear way to determine the exact behavior. Pure functional programming provides us with very strong guarantees about isolation between the different parts of our code base, while strong types give us assurances about behavior and let us lean on the assumption that in Haskell, “if it compiles, it is probably (still) correct.”

1376406357.0,82,self.haskell,1ka4q6,A great series of posts on the power of monoids,87,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1ka4q6/a_great_series_of_posts_on_the_power_of_monoids/,"This series of posts by [Chung-chieh Shan](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/) considers the problem:

&gt; If the integers from 1 to 999,999,999 are written as words, sorted alphabetically, and concatenated, what is the 51 billionth letter?

1. [The first post, ""Billion approaches""](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers1/), defines the concepts of a `Monoid` and a `Seminearring`, and a `Character` class used abstract away the representation of the words:

  &gt; We can now concisely define the list of 109−1 strings at the core of the ITA problem, in a way that expresses its repetitive structure.
  &gt;
  &gt;     ten1, ten2, ten3, ten6, ten9 :: (Seminearring a, Character a) =&gt; a
  &gt;     ten1 = strings ""one two three four five six seven eight nine""
  &gt;     ten2 = ten1
  &gt;          + strings ""ten eleven twelve""
  &gt;          + (strings ""thir four"" + prefixes) * string ""teen""
  &gt;          + (strings ""twen thir for"" + prefixes) * string ""ty"" * (one + ten1)
  &gt;         where prefixes = strings ""fif six seven eigh nine""
  &gt;     ten3 = ten2 + ten1 * string ""hundred"" * (one + ten2)
  &gt;     ten6 = ten3 + ten3 * string ""thousand"" * (one + ten3)
  &gt;     ten9 = ten6 + ten3 * string ""million"" * (one + ten6)

  It also demonstrates how the straightforward approach (just generating the strings) is too slow for the author's patience.

  &gt;     *WordNumbers1&gt; length (concat (ten9 :: [String]))
  &gt;     Interrupted.

2. [The second post](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers2/) introduces the concept of generating the solution directly from the problem statement, rather than stepping into string-land. The author demonstrates one monoid that can count the words directly, and another (actually a module) that counts the characters (using automatic differentiation).

  &gt; Now we can quickly count the total number of characters in the English words from one to a billion.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers2&gt; ten9 :: Deriv Count Volume
  &gt;     Deriv 999999999 70305000000
  &gt;
  &gt; For a sanity check, we check the count to a million…
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers2&gt; ten6 :: Deriv Count Volume
  &gt;     Deriv 999999 44872000
  &gt;
  &gt; … which agrees with our previous result, but completes much more quickly.

3. [The third post, ""Binary search""](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers3/), considers a simplification of the problem, where the words are concatenated in numeric order (rather than sorted into alphabetic order). The author uses a binary tree monoid to maintain the order of the generated words.

  &gt; The binary search is now straightforward to write.
  &gt; We can now quickly solve the problem…
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers3&gt; answer 51000000000
  &gt;     (""sevenhundredthirtytwomil"",'l',""ionsevenhundredninetysixthousandthreehundredsixtysix"")
  &gt;
  &gt; …and check a few small values to be sure there are no off by one errors.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers3&gt; answer 3
  &gt;     (""on"",'e',"""")
  &gt;     *WordNumbers3&gt; answer 4
  &gt;     ("""",'t',""wo"")


4. [The final post, ""Sort the words, sum the numbers""](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers4/), returns to the original problem statement and uses a trie to implement radix sort of the words.

  &gt; Using this binary search, we can find the first string in the sorted list…
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search (&gt;= Nat 1) ten9
  &gt;     (""eight"",1)
  &gt;
  &gt; … as easily as the last string or the middle one.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search (&gt;= Nat 999999999) ten9
  &gt;     (""twothousandtwohundredtwo"",999999999)
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search (&gt;= Nat 500000000) ten9
  &gt;     (""onehundredonemilliononehundredseventhousandtwohundredtwentyone"",500000000)
  &gt;
  &gt; In these searches, ten9 takes the type Trie Char Count. To query the trie by counting strings rather than characters, we use ten9 at the type Trie Char (Deriv Count Volume).
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; search ((&gt;= 51000000000) . volume) ten9
  &gt;     (""sixhundredseventysixmillionsevenhundredfortysixthousandfivehundredseventyfive"",Deriv 723302492 51000000000)

  Now that the original problem has been solved, the author considers the question ""what is the sum of all the integers to that point?"" and solves it using
  another derivative-based monoid:



  &gt;     answer | target == volume m = (string, mass m)
  &gt;            | otherwise = error ""The target letter does not end a string""
  &gt;       where target = 51000000000
  &gt;             Numbered grammar = one + ten9
  &gt;             (string, m) = search stop grammar
  &gt;             stop m = volume m &gt;= target
  &gt;             volume (Deriv _ (Wrap (Nat n), _)) = n
  &gt;             mass   (Deriv _ (_, Wrap (Nat n))) = n
  &gt;
  &gt; The answer to the puzzle is an ordered pair.
  &gt;
  &gt;     *WordNumbers4&gt; answer
  &gt;     (""sixhundredseventysixmillionsevenhundredfortysixthousandfivehundredseventyfive"",413540008163475743)

I've only touched on the results of each post - the real meat is in the process of how these results are produced. My next step, now that I've read it, is to load the code and play with it to make sure I understand
how everything is being accomplished.

It has also been pointed out there that it might be wise to start a new thread with the reaction I posted there, since it might otherwise go unnoticed, so I am repeating it here:

Let me start by thanking everyone for spelling my name correctly. Usually it is causing great problems. Let me try to summarize my opinion and give some background information.

1) We just had elections in the Netherlands and being a member of a political party I was bombarded by messages like: if every member finds another member we have twice as many members

2) The speaker wanted to double the number of Haskell programmers in a year

3) As a community, and looking at the gender distribution at the ICFP , I see half of the world population being severely being underrepresented

4) I my FP classes I notice that the course is taken by many math students too, and the female part of my audience does not come from our own CS students (which has an ICFP like male/female ration). But they come to this course and tend to like it.

5) My conclusion is that if we want to get a more balanced representation Haskell offers a great opportunities.

6) Now the crucial remark, which was garbled on the video, but which definitely ended with ""FOR BOTH"", meaning: - I would feel less weird in more a balanced audience (i.e. going to a more balanced meeting would be more attractive to me) - I think women would feel less weird in a more balanced audience (i.e. would be more attracted to a more balanced audience)

7) Let me explain my opinion about the latter observation. I do not think that there is any reason why there should not be more women in CS. I have been lecturing for many years in Bolivia, where over 50% of the audience was female, and they liked what they learned, they were good at it, and I see no way why this should not be the case in at least the place where I am coming from. But, I also see that I have a female colleague, and she is attracting significantly more female master and Ph.D. students than to be expected based on the composition of our student population. Apparently there is something attractive in doing a project with her, most likely because women feel less isolated there. So I firmly believe that we have a chicken/egg problem: we attract few women because we attract few women. I think the FP/Haskell community and the link to math, where they do not have this problem, provides a unique opportunity to start to get rid of this unbalance in CS.

The professor provided a scheme interpreter with built in functionality for working with images. In the hopes of improving my Haskell, I decided to do all of the homework in Haskell and build on functionality as needed. After the class, the professor asked me if I would give him the library I wrote so he could let other students taking the class do the homework in Haskell. Over the past week, I've been rewriting the library to be a little more general and easier to use. I feel that good progress has been made. There are definitely improvements I want to make such as reading / writing more formats and using repa for unboxed images. But, it currently has all of the functionality necessary to do all of the work asked in the course.

This is an exercise that highlights some problems with using monadic IO in a simple practical context.  The problem is a simplification of one I routinely encounter at a large scale in the course of the work I do.

My own ""solutions"" are:

- use unsafePerformIO
- use unsafeInterleaveIO
- use another language.

Every once in a while I like to ask Haskellers if they have a better idea.

**The Problem**

There is a standard Unix utility called ""du"", which counts the disk usage of a directory tree.  The natural way to do this is to use an unfold to generate a list or tree of all the files in the directory tree, map over them to get the sizes, and do a fold to get the total.

The unfold portion of this is the Unix ""find"" command, more or less.  Tom Moertel has a [short series of blog posts](http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2007/03/28/directory-tree-printing-in-haskell-part-three-lazy-i-o) in which he figures out how to implement ""find"", but he ends up resorting to unsafeInterleaveIO.

This problem is unlike the typical Haskell lazy I/O examples in that the I/O is nested:  you have to perform the previous step's I/O to get the data you need to define the next step's I/O.  While it's unlike typical examples, it's actually quite common in the real world:  if your data is too big to fit into memory, you need to perform I/O every time you need to get a chunk of it, and which chunk you need to get is quite likely to depend on what you found in the previous chunk.

As far as I can tell, it's impossible to simultaneously:

1. be space-efficient (i.e., not have to store the entire filesystem tree in memory at any point in the operation)
1. be functional in the Haskellish sense (i.e., use no ""unsafe"" operations)
1. use data structures that can be operated on with standard libraries that ship with Haskell or are in common usage, rather than creating our own replacements for those data structures (and all the standard library functions we might want to use).

Haskell true believers tell me to give up on (3), but that's silly:  it makes much more sense to use another language than to invest a large amount of time in reinventing the standard library every time I need a different I/O pattern.  I can do this just fine in C, Ruby, Perl, Python, bash, Java, Clojure, or Scheme;  the only reason to do it in Haskell is to make it short and elegant, and rewriting the core libraries defeats that purpose.

**Iteratees**

I've read the paper.  It didn't appear to resolve problem (3).  If I'm wrong, show me.

[EDIT around 7 PM Eastern:  I'm taking a break until at least later in the evening, or maybe tomorrow---this post ate most of my afternoon and some of deeper responses are going to require more brain-juice than I have left at the moment.]

Matt also [mentioned a transition plan](http://cogracenotes.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/hackage-at-baltimore/) made with Duncan Coutts but this was also back in October of 2010.

But this was 18 *months* ago. Surely these things weren't actually what held back Hackage 2.0? Also, it looks like not only [the Hackage Trac is down](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/) (spam apparently), but the [2.0 installation on sparky is also down](http://sparky.haskell.org:8080/). 

Then there's [this Well Typed blog entry](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/57) from mid 2011 that mentions some work, and it still sounds almost ready for action.

What is needed here? I'd like to pitch in but its tough to say what needs to be done with the Trac down. I see [the darcs repo](http://code.haskell.org/hackage-server/) is still up though.",,False,,t5_2qh36,False,,,True,t3_pn2oh,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pn2oh/where_is_hackage_20/,

It's a way to check what values are being passed into a function every time it's called. This is only really useful for big pattern matching functions like so:

    foo (Con1 ...) = ...
    foo (Con2 ...) = ...
    foo (Con3 ...) = ...
    ...

My trick is to add this at the beginning:

    foo arg | trace (show arg) False = undefined

Now every time *foo* is called this first pattern is checked (and always fails) and the trace will give me the argument that foo was called with, or any similar information.

Hope it helps.",,False,,t5_2qh36,False,,,True,t3_gbd7w,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/gbd7w/debugging_trick/,

1362686748.0,55,self.haskell,19v4l1,I can't shake the impression that FRP code is just awful to read. Thoughts?,67,12,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/19v4l1/i_cant_shake_the_impression_that_frp_code_is_just/,"I'm a self-described intermediate Haskeller, who has keen interests both in this language and in writing a game/simulation I've had in my mind for ages. I started it in C++, but I'm looking hard for excuses to switch to Haskell, even if it's a learning curve to do so.

I'm really interested in the concept of functional reactive programming, but my impression so far is... well, that it's incredibly obtuse. For example, [Main.hs from the breakout example using reactive-banana](https://github.com/bernstein/breakout/blob/master/src/Main.hs) is just full of cryptic operators like &lt;&gt;, &lt;$&gt;, &lt;$, #, and &lt;*&gt; (among others), and functions strung together in what to me looks like totally unintuitive ways.

Now, to qualify that sentiment considerably:

* Yes, I know that &lt;$&gt; is infix fmap, that &lt;*&gt; is from Control.Applicative, and I was easily able to look up Semigroup to figure out that &lt;&gt; is a group operation. I don't expect to be able to understand reactive-banana code without reading documentation, but at least in an OOP context I would have descriptive function names to guide me.

* I also know that a significant part of Haskell's expressivity comes from the programmer understanding more abstract, often initially unintuitive concepts.

* I realize this particular package is not necessary exemplary of good coding or commenting style; however I found the same thing looking at the Frag source (which uses Yampa for FRP).

Given all of that though, the reality is that future me is going to come back to my code, maybe a year or more in the future, and future me is not going to remember the meaning of all these seemingly arbitrary sequences of special characters. Future me is not going to be able to make sense of something like this (again from the breakout code):

    paddleHit :: Behavior t P2 -&gt; Behavior t P2 -&gt; Event t ()
              -&gt; Event t (Velocity -&gt; Velocity)
    paddleHit paddlePos ballPos frame =
      let c = colliding paddlePic &lt;$&gt; paddlePos &lt;*&gt; pure ballPic &lt;*&gt; ballPos
          response v@(unr2 -&gt; (vx,vy)) = if vy &lt; 0 then r2 (vx,-vy) else v
      in response &lt;$ whenE c frame

Good comments will remind me *what* that does, but it will take future me an hour to decipher something like that because it isn't particularly intuitive.

I'm not sure if this is a problem with me, with FRP, with current implementations of FRP, or with Haskell itself; probably a little bit of everything. The bottom line is I'm just really discouraged right now about the practicality of Haskell+FRP for such a project, and I was wondering what more experienced users have to say on the subject.",,False,,t5_2qh36,1362690870.0,,,True,t3_19v4l1,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/19v4l1/i_cant_shake_the_impression_that_frp_code_is_just/,

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who made comments, suggestions, and pull requests. Special thanks to Michael Snoyman for providing a whole new Yesod implementation that's much faster. It's been a great learning experience for me, and I hope that if nothing else I can use this post to document some of the things I've learned in hopes that others find it useful.

[Round 3 benchmarking results](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r3)

The short of it is that Yesod has seen some good improvements, but there's still a lot catching up to do. The most glaring problem seems to be that neither of the Haskell builds can fully saturate all of the CPU cores on the dedicated hardware (edit: I'm wrong about this, the current Yesod build hits 100%). The number I was told was about 60% CPU utilization, but without proper profiling I can't find out what the cause is. [A new parallel IO manager](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2013-February/000414.html) was recently merged into GHC that scales better with the number of available cores, so a possible explanation is the current parallel IO manager is simply failing to scale up to 8 cores.

One of the first batches of improvements made was to the RTS options. I was really excited about these changes because on my test box I saw reqs/sec increase by a factor of 4-5, but sadly that improvement didn't manifest itself at all on their hardware. Unfortunately, adjusting the RTS options seems to be a matter of twiddling knobs to hit the best numbers, but without access to the hardware used for the tests my capacity is very limited in that regard. I'd love it if someone could give me some good heuristics for what `-A` should be set to, though, since I have no idea.

Next up were changing the libraries used. `json` was replaced with `aeson`, `HDBC-mysql` was replaced with `mysql-simple`, and `random` was replaced with `mwc-random`. When I first wrote the Snap build I couldn't find much information about which libraries I should use, but I've since come up with a good rule of thumb: if you're trying to decide between two or more libraries for a given task and Bryan O'Sullivan is listed as the author of one, use that one.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get a Snap build with `mwc-random` in, owing to the fact that my naive implementation that uses Snap's wrapper resulted in a single `MVar` with the RNG's state shared across all cores, causing lock contention to do terrible things to throughput. I'm hoping to get some time to deal with that this week, although I'm not expecting much of an improvement over the current version.

Probably the most interesting change is found in Mr. Snoyman's Yesod build. Specifically, the fact that it manually forked processes instead of relying on the web server and the parallel IO manager to take care of it. He also mentioned that running without any `-N` options actually resulted in better results (something that is not reflected in the Yesod build currently because I am bad at git), which seems to suggest problems with the current parallel IO manager. I'd be interested in seeing if something similar could be done for the Snap build.

So that's the current status of the Yesod and Snap benchmarks. The guys behind the benchmarks will continue running them so long as they continue getting pull requests, so feedback is still appreciated. If you can't/don't want to install the whole test suite, changes can be sent to me and I can benchmark, do any configuration fix-ups, and issue pull requests on your behalf.

I'm writing my first greenfield project in Haskell having been tinkering for quite a while. It's become apparent that I don't have a good intuition for ""haskell in the large"" (and this is a feeling I've seen expressed before by people new to the language). If it's OK I'd like to ask some general big picture haskell application design questions here in the hope that they will help myself and others.

Here's what I'm writing for some context:

I want to write a client library for my excellent online small business accounting package, freeagent (which is an oauth2 web service). Eventually I'd like to make it into a bridging library between freeagent and hledger. I'll need the following:

* Oauth2 library and http client. I've gone for hoauth2 and http-streams. I'm not set in stone here; any pointers?

* A library to manage a ~/.hfreeagent config file. The config file will need to manage and store the oauth credentials (id, secret, hostname etc), the location of ledger files, and token management (oauth2 tokens need to be periodically refreshed). ConfigFile or bos' library look like good options here.

* A rest client which marshals json objects to haskell and thence to however hledger represents things. Aeson looks good for this one.

So far so good!

So the questions then:

* What should my monad stack look like? The presence of the config suggests a ReaderT somewhere. But I'll also need to write to the config file when I refresh a token, so do I need StateT? Or do I need two separate interfaces? I understand monads and transformers, but I now realise that I have no idea how to design them.

* Any pointers on structuring the library (directory structure, module naming etc).

* Is there anything that could generate my types from json for me? Something like F#'s type providers, template haskell or some clever lensing. Or do I have to go and manually define all of the types in the API that I want to use: https://dev.freeagent.com/docs?

* How would you model the workflow of looking up the token, checking if it's still valid, refreshing it if not and then making it available to the rest client? (this goes back to the monad question I guess).

I think that will do for now. The library will be open source https://github.com/perurbis/hfreeagent, and I'd like for it to serve as a roadmap if possible for folks moving from playing with and liking Haskell to actually thinking about and building real world stuff with it. This is the reason I'm asking here, rather than SO so people can follow along - and it doesn't get closed as too general :-). I will attempt to roll all of the good stuff from the conversation here - if any into the documentation.

You can find the library at:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes

The package description really says it all.  I wanted to add that it's a more functional and elegant approach to resource-management, stream-processing, and stream embedding because it's grounded entirely in terms of Categories and Monads (really, that's almost the entire implementation: a Monad instance, a MonadTrans instance, and a Category instance).  90% of the work was manually verifying the Category laws were correct by hand.

I included a long tutorial in the main module but if you are still not sure how to use it to solve your existing enumerator/iteratee/enumeratee/conduit problems, then ask me and I can give some code examples to demonstrate how easy it is to use and possibly incorporate them into a better tutorial.

My library currently has two very obvious deficiencies compared to other iteratee libraries, namely exception handling and actual driver routines for common applications (like IO, HTTP).  I omit built-in exception handling because it's orthogonal to the library implementation and requires no special accomodation to work seamlessly with the library.  If there is enough interest in my library I will implement driver routines.

    (f . g) x == f (g x)
    f (a+b) == f $ a+b

Couldn't they also be written as:

    f $ g x
    f . (+) a b

But that doesn't really seem to help, and I can't figure out what cases in which ($) couldn't replace (.). I tried to google, but googling for ($) and (.) isn't too helpful, and I can't find any good descriptions of comparisons of when to use which.

This is the second round of benchmarks, after taking contributions from the community. Someone contributed a Yesod build, and the numbers are not good, posting around 1/10 the requests/second of the #1 spot in the various tests. I also made a Snap build that didn't make it into this round of testing, but they tell me the initial test performed roughly the same.

So the numbers aren't especially encouraging. Everything's on a public Github account, so I was hoping to shine some light on this and see if we couldn't get Haskell posting some better numbers.

today is a great day for me. After almost a year of playing/struggling with Haskell, I've finally managed to complete my first non-trivial program. It's a translation/porting of the Orc Battle game, originally written in Common Lisp:

[Original Game, from the book Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/orc-battle.lisp)

I've tried to not simply mechanically translate the original version, and I've made some choice that for me were closer to the Haskell spirit. The win was finally grasp transformers and being able to use StateT to manage game state. Here is the code:

[Orc Battle in Haskell](http://hpaste.org/75174)

Obviously I spot several points that could be optimized/improved, but for me today was a great step towards intermediate/advanced Haskell, and I would like to share this moment with you.

However, all of my friends who program in Haskell said that I need to learn it, and after flipping through the O'Reilly and A Great Good texts, I decided that I'm going to give it a shot. 

I have heard reasons from many people why they love Haskell - strong typing, limited emergent behaviors, and ""smarter"" programming in general. However, can anyone give a reason why they dislike Haskell or a scenario where they would use something else instead? My personal axiom is ""different tools for different fools,"" but as an example, I asked my friend what language he wrote his webserver in, and if he considered doing it in C++. He said, ""I mean, I could - but I wouldn't want to clean a basketball court with a toothbrush."" Similarly, I don't think it would be smart to write embedded software in Java (though I don't doubt that you could - but I've never written embedded software before).

So, do you think Haskell has any drawbacks?",,False,,t5_2qh36,False,,,True,t3_15h6tz,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/15h6tz/what_isnt_haskell_good_for/,

Do you find a lot of your modules start like this:

    import qualified Yesod
    import Data.Text (Text, unpack)
    import Control.Applicative ((&lt;$&gt;), (&lt;*&gt;))
    import Database.Persist.Sqlite
    import Database.Persist.Query.GenericSql (selectSourceConn)
    import Database.Persist.Store (PersistValue (PersistInt64))
    import qualified Text.Search.Sphinx as S
    import qualified Text.Search.Sphinx.Types as ST
    import qualified Text.Search.Sphinx.ExcerptConfiguration as E
    import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as L
    import Data.Text.Lazy.Encoding (decodeUtf8With)
    import Data.Text.Encoding.Error (ignore)
    import Data.Maybe (catMaybes)
    import Control.Monad (forM)
    import qualified Data.Text as T
    import Text.Blaze (preEscapedLazyText)
    import qualified Data.Conduit as C
    import qualified Data.Conduit.List as CL
    import qualified Data.XML.Types as X
    import Network.Wai (Response (ResponseSource))
    import Network.HTTP.Types (status200)
    import Text.XML.Stream.Render (renderBuilder, def)
    import Data.Monoid (mconcat)
    import Data.Conduit.Pool (takeResource, mrValue, mrReuse)

Does it bother you that you're writing those prefixes over and over again, and that they add visual redundancy to your code?

Common prefixes call for a radix tree.  Specifically, I'd love something that let me use indentation to re-write the above as something like:

    import
      Yesod qualified
      Data.
        Text as T 
        Text (Text, unpack)
        Text.
          Lazy.Encoding (decodeUtf8With)
          Encoding.Error (ignore)
        ByteString.Lazy as L
        Maybe (catMaybes)
        Conduit as C 
        Conduit.
          List as CL 
          Pool (takeResource, mrValue, mrReuse)
        XML.Types as X 
        Monoid (mconcat)
      Control.
        Applicative ((&lt;$&gt;), (&lt;*&gt;))
        Monad (forM)
      Database.Persist.
        Sqlite
        Query.GenericSql (selectSourceConn)
        Store (PersistValue (PersistInt64))
      Text.Search.
        Sphinx as S 
        Sphinx.
          Types as ST 
          ExcerptConfiguration as E 
      Network.
        Wai (Response (ResponseSource))
        HTTP.Types (status200)
      Text.
        Blaze (preEscapedLazyText)
        XML.Stream.Render (renderBuilder, def)

----

The rules here are pretty simple.  The radix tree syntax is signalled by an empty `import` line, and is followed by an indented block, in which a line is either

* a prefix, identified by ending with a period, in which case an indented block follows, or
* an import, which inherits the prefixes leading to its indentation.  After the module name we have

  * module namespace: one of

     * `qualified`
     * `as X`
     * nothing (inject into module namespace)

  * a list of module contents to import: one of

     * `(...)`
     * nothing (take all contents)

----

Conclusions: this reduces the number of non-whitespace characters in this example from 902 to 543: a 42% reduction.

----

Edit 1: and if this is useful, what's the best way of implementing it?  A GHC extension?

Edit 2: the quick and dirty solution is a preprocessor.  [GHC lets you preprocess](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.4.1/html/users_guide/flag-reference.html) with the `-pgmF &lt;cmd&gt;` flag.  Any takers?

Edit 3: replaced `qualified as X` with simply `as X`.

Hackage2 very much alive, under (slow) development, and up an running in a _test_ instance at http://new-hackage.haskell.org/

That page contains much info. Hackage and Cabal are coupled, so many resources overlap with cabal resources. I.e. the appropriate place to discuss hackage2 and see commits is the cabal-devel mailing list: http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/cabal-devel

Hackage 2 info pages live on the cabal wiki: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/HackageDB/2.0

Note, however, that the trac is _just_ for the wiki and legacy!

The issue tracker is on github (with the cabal repo): https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues?labels=hackage2&amp;state=open

Note, however, that the _hackage2_ repo itself is not on github, but in darcs: darcs get http://code.haskell.org/hackage-server

If you're interested in our package repositories and architecture, take note of all this. There's a _whole lot_ done, and a few more contributors can really get us into gear.

Also, if you have some ideas for new features, etc, the new architecture is much more modular. Helping out with issues, core features, patches etc at the moment will get you in good familiarity with the codebase, so tossing on social plugins, etc. in the future will be a more straightforward task.

There is also a #hackage channel on freenode that you can hang out on. It seems relatively quiet, but it would be a good place to ask questions, look for tips on getting started.",,False,,t5_2qh36,1374179270.0,,,True,t3_1iki8p,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1iki8p/how_to_help_develop_hackage2/,

In Python I kept my data in an object. Then when I wanted to change the state of the object, I could just change the variable. Probably the biggest hurdle initially in Haskell was that everything was immutable. I couldn't understand how you could even think about designing some of the most basic things without being able to change the state of something. It was difficult to think about iterations and loops without the standard imperative controls. 

Then I got mental image that really helped me out:

In Python, You build stuff like a factory. You create objects. Change them. read them. Combine them. and ship it out. 

In Haskell, You build stuff like a plumber, you are connecting inputs and outputs of different attachments (Functions) to the pipes (typeclasses). 


In python if you receive a part at your factory station, you aren't really sure what it is. your object arrives without any connections to the outside you have to make the decision of whether to inspect it to see if it is good or just do the transformation anyways. In Haskell you dont really care about the data because functions job is to just duplicate then transform it not destroy the original data. 


With Haskell it is blatantly evident to see that you have a bad connection (e.g. compiler error), just as a plumber would see water spilling out of an open pipe.

This allowed me to get a grip on Haskell. Instead of asking myself how do I change the data, I ask myself how do I  manipulate the flow of this data to what I want; an input somewhere else.

Very visible, high-end hackers are using OS X, yet the state of the infrastructure lags sadly behind:

 * MacPorts lacks coherence, and *conflicts* with the binary HP installers
 * Platform-specific libraries are few (no native UI library, for example)

Other platforms have formed teams with the goal to provide easy, coherent Haskell packages. For example,

 * [Debian/Haskell](http://wiki.debian.org/Haskell)
 * [Arch/Haskell](http://archhaskell.wordpress.com/), [mission statement](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Arch_Linux/Policy)
 * Fedora/Haskell, [mission statement](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Haskell#Mission)
 * Gentoo/Haskell, [mission statement](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Gentoo#Packages)

A small dedicated team of 3 or so should be able to ensure the Mac is up to date. This would benefit thousands. All it needs is a bit of leadership, a wiki page to document the effort, and a small amount of tool support.

This is open source, you can make the change you want to see.

-------

A good starting point would be:

 * a wiki page for the project;
 * documentation for the current resources (MacPorts, HP installer, ...)
 * a discussion page where people can add technical issues they're concerned about, and
 * an ""interested parties"" list, where you can register what you're able to contribute.

From there, perhaps leadership will emerge to drive this project.",,False,,t5_2qh36,True,,,True,t3_d9wm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/d9wm2/is_it_time_for_a_strike_team_to_form_dedicated_to/,

[According to igouy](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e6o24/ghc_701_the_fastest_release_yet_of_the_optimising/c15svo4) the [x64 haskell results on Shootout are now using 7.0.1.](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/haskell.php) 

[Looking at the diff of the raw data](http://alioth.debian.org/scm/viewvc.php/shootout/website/websites/u64q/data/ndata.csv?root=shootout&amp;r1=1.540&amp;r2=1.541) (see below for the header for that diff) it looks like the [regexdna program fails to compile](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=regexdna&amp;lang=ghc&amp;id=2#log) due to the lack of `Text.Regex.PCRE.ByteString' and there is a significant performance regression in knucleotide (it seems to be using only one core now).

OTOH, It looks like threadring shows a significant performance boost (almost twice as fast) and GHC [now takes the crown for all languages](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/performance.php?test=threadring), but all the other benchmarks are about the same or slightly slower.

Haskell](http://tryhaskell.org/). **Please** don't post
this proggit; it's still WIP.

If you've got 10 minutes and you don't mind reviewing it that'd be
really helpful. Newbies very welcome but keep in mind this is **alpha**.

Here's what I've done since last time:

* Fixed some priority bugs (works well in Chrome/Safari now), 
* adjusted the sizes of some stuff, 
* added some links to the Haskell site and Real World Haskell,
* added :t and :modules commands,
* up/down history (though this is a wee bit buggy, but only behaves unexpectedly, isn't completely useless)
* a cheeky and secret hook-up to the Raphael JavaScript library. See
  the `:t circle` and `mapM_ (\\x -&gt; circle (10*x) (sin x*10+20) 10) [1..10]`.
* an incomplete, but not a bad size, tutorial (11 ""pages"" / 3 chapters
  so far): (1) Expressions and types (2) Functions on lists and
  tuples, (3) Syntactic sugar. It tries to fit types into your head without being too explicit about it or trying to explain early on what `[Char]` or `Num t =&gt; t` means. I've saved that for later. I think a newbie can read that and read me saying ""a list of characters and a number"" and be happy to proceed. I'm going to do things like ""try giving me an expression of this type"", etc.

If you want to write a transcript, awesome! Please try to keep it simple enough to fit in the functionality laid out so far. Each ""page"" has a trigger (a predicate on the (expression,type,result), if that trigger is true then the page is displayed, otherwise it will wait till they get it right. This goes in linear order only.

**Future plans**

* :let is planned, and a CodeMirror view similar to DrScheme (thanks
  to Cale and others for this idea) -- basically these two are ""having
  a definitions file per user session on the web server"".

* QuickCheck? Could be used as a teaching aid. E.g ""define a function that
  doubles all the numbers in a list"" -- use QuickCheck in the
  background to determine the accuracy of the implementation
  (actually someone just suggested
  [smallcheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck), which
  sounds good because turnaround time is important) -- this would make
  TryHaskell seem intelligent and possibly freak newbies out. Splendid.

* A more full implementation of Raphael and other libraries.

**EDIT** Extra plans I forgot:

* Get a VPS on Linode.

* Hayoo/Hoogle integrated documentation/lookup.

* Real-time syntax checking (e.g., illegal expressions are flagged right away).

* Multiline input?

* Pretty printing output and errors.

* Make expressions clickable a la SLIME.

* How to deal with teaching IO, implementation-wise? I could do putChar, but not getLine, I don't think. I think it would be easier to use things like readFile, Raphael, downloading RSS feeds, stuff like that. Or maybe IO is just too advanced for a tutorial like this.

Over the past several years, I've developed a handful of tools for reasoning about the execution of a (e.g.) C program. If you asked me to, I could draw out the state of the runtime stack with frames for each function call, space for local variables, parameters, saved registers, etc. Moreover, I can pictorially represent the action of each fundamental operation afforded by the language (arithmetic operations, pointer dereferencing, function calls, and control flow to name the most important) as a modification of the runtime memory diagram.

The problem is, I have no comparable intuition for reasoning about Haskell runtime behaviour. All I need is an animation or set of slides or something depicting the state of memory throughout the execution of a simple Haskell program.  Can someone point me to such a resource? If not, how can I learn about the state of memory and registers during the execution of a Haskell program?",,False,,t5_2qh36,False,,,True,t3_1f48dc,http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1f48dc/what_does_the_haskell_runtime_look_like/,

design and implementation of ultra-sensitive trace gas
detectors. These instruments belong to the most sensitive in the
world.  

You will work closely with physicists, electronic – and
mechanical engineers to design new detectors and improve existing
detectors. As a software developer you will be responsible for
the complete design and implementation of the software required
to operate these instruments. This includes embedded software for
data-acquisition, measuring algorithms, data analysis and user
interface design.  

For the next generation of detectors we are developing, we have
chosen Haskell to write the control software. Except for some
low-level embedded C code, Haskell is used for everything else:
interfacing with custom hardware, data analysis and handling the
web-based user interface.  

The ideal candidate has experience with C and Python and is
familiar with functional programming. Experience with Haskell is
certainly a plus. But rather than developers with experience in
specific languages we are looking for fast learners with a
flexible mindset.

So I really love how flexible Snap is without the use of much template haskell. One of the disadvantages when compared to Yesod is that a lot of Yesod stuff just works and there is plenty of documentation of how to use the different parts together. However with Snap, looking around on the internet I could find a bunch of fragments of how to do certain things in certain environments but not too much in the way of how to use it all together. 

So I put this together for anybody who wants to jump in and get a (semi) complicated snap project running using only Haskell (I hope to include Fay soon). 

I haven't had a lot of time to clean it up, but if it helps even one person, then my time was well spent. 

Also, I know that the project's name describes itself as a boilerplate, but it is more of an example application. I am leaving on a trip soon so I didn't have enough time to include all the boilerplate code I wanted so I just included random stuff to help people see how to use stuff together. I will clean it up once I get settled.

Obviously, looking at the huge list of packages on hackage won't help me find all those small and simple utility packages that could assist in every-day Haskell programming.

My question: Is there a actively managed list of small packages of such usefulness, maintained by a long-time haskeller who I can trust not to insert duplicates, and to list mostly the 'quality grade' and interface-stable ones?

Or, maybe such list can be generated from hackage? Maybe we should have an ability to 'vote' on packages, keeping score of a 'usefulness' factor for each package?

  Quickly sketching out some  levels:

* Level 1: [*Learn You a Haskell For Great Good*](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) / [*A Gentle Introduction to Haskell*](http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/)
* Level 2: [*Real World Haskell*](http://realworldhaskell.org/)
* Level 3: Chase down all the classic papers ([Awkward Squad](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/), ByteString, etc), methodically read Haddock for everything in Prelude and Platform.

I am missing a book/compendium/tour-guide/directory of Level 3.   A ""RWH Part II"", or ""Advanced RWH"". The content may exist around the web, but it's not indexed in one place.

For example, I noticed that  ""[text](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-0.11.1.9)"" is replacing ByteString when the actual use case is really text. I sort of picked it up from bos's Reddit comments on the Platform ""consensus"", getting curious about Unicode, and checking out [his blog](http://www.serpentine.com/blog/). There I discovered [aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-0.5.0.0) (for JSON) and a bunch of *practical* stuff he made as part of MailRank.  (Including [mysql-simple](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mysql-simple). But not postgresql. But I did catch [postgresql-simple](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple) on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/nw5dn/announcing_postgresqlsimple/) recently....) 

And then there are [enumerators](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Enumerator_and_iteratee) and [conduits](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit) (a successor?), which I heard nothing about last time I played with Haskell (it's been a while), and now I may have skipped over the whole enumerator generation (or maybe not, I don't know)

&gt; There’s definitely some truth to Haskell’s reputation as a language that’s hard to learn. Fortunately it’s less about Haskell and more about us. As imperative programmers we bring a lot of baggage to Haskell. We expect to mutate variables, do I/O at will, and work with very simplistic type systems.

To me, readability is the most important [attribute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes) in software. As an outside observer I've found Haskell's naming practices to be opaque. Instead of using [intention revealing names](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Naming.pdf), there almost seems to be a contest for how many abstract mathematical concepts you can discuss (monad, functor, category theory, comonad, isomorphism, applicative, existentially quantified type, etc.). There also seems to be a lot of variable names that are too short (one or two letter). Also there seems to be a more operators (non textual verbs/annotations) than is optimal for human reading.

Is this just me?

Edit: I guess I should have left Monad off the list, I knew it would be a sticking point. I agree that some concepts are too abstract to have an intention revealing name. However I believe most things can (and should be) be named in a way that helps communicate what they are used for or what they do.

Edit 2: Well I had been hoping for a person or two to point out if I was missing something, and instead got a ton of helpful feedback, so thanks everyone! Here are my personal notes derived from the threads (some was new to me, some I have experienced myself):

* It is unclear whether it is a desirable goal to use a vocabulary other than Math for some/many of these concepts. Maybe it would make Haskell more accessible, but maybe it would just create confusion. 
* Regardless of whether this is a desirable goal, it seems likely that it isn't possible due to the highly abstract nature of the concepts.
* 1 letter variable names make sense in several situations: small scope (x:xs), for conventions (i/j/k, f/g/h), and when there is literally no meaningful label possible.
* Short variable names help you see the structure of a computation. I have noticed this in Pyton/Java, but I expect this to be more important in the context of algebraic data types &amp; pattern matching. (However, short doesn't mean it must be 1 letter.)
* This community seems ok with forcing the reader to figure out what a, b, c mean from context, rather than labeling those roles in the computation so the reader doesn't have to figure it out from scratch and then remember the mapping between arbitrary symbols and their semantics. (I generally disagree with this judgement.)
* The term ""intention revealing names"" makes some members of this community think of crazy long names like AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean, rather than reasonable 3-8 character names.

Features:

* 32-bit and 64-bit versions (but you can only install one at a time)
* Runs on 10.6 and 10.7.
* Based on GHC 7.0.4.

Also in that directory is the new Mac uninstaller, in source and compiled
(and compiled and tar'd) formats. The compiled version is 32-bit and should
run on any 10.6 or later system.

**WARNING:** This is a release candidate - and as you can see from the number, I've already had to bump the revision once. I've installed this one (rc2) on four different machines and several different OS/Xcode setups, and all worked... but *you could be the one* to find a situation the installer doesn't handle well!

Yes, the above is valid code which does exactly what you'd think, as long as you have the following definitions:

    import Control.Monad.Cont -- mtl
    
    data Void = Void !Void
    
    absurd :: Void -&gt; a
    absurd (Void v) = absurd v

    vacuous = fmap absurd
    
    data LabelT r m = LabelT (ContT r m Void)
    
    label :: ContT r m (LabelT r m)
    label = callCC $ \k -&gt;
      let
         l = LabelT $ k l
      in return l

    goto (LabelT l) = vacuous l
    
    usesGoto :: (Monad m) =&gt; ContT r m r -&gt; m r
    usesGoto = flip runContT return

Similar things can be done in any language that has monad syntax (Idris, Scala), call/cc (Scheme, Scala), generators (Python), forks or ~~longjmp and setjmp~~ direct stack access.

[GLFW-b](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b) is Haskell bindings to the C library.

The GLFW C library guys recently released version 3, a new major version, so I revisited everything about GLFW-b. Everything is now up to date, and we believe it builds on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

An easy way to see what this is all about is to install [GLFW-b-demo](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b-demo) and run its executable of the same name. You should see the famous gears from glxgears(1) and be able to control rotation with keyboard, mouse, or joystick, and can watch GLFW events firing.

Anyways, set up: Windows 7, GHC 7.6.1, latest version of MinGW. I used the directions from the Haskell wiki page.

First step, compile wxwidgets with MinGW. This went seamlessly. I compiled a sample in the wxwidgets source and it worked. Good start.

Next, wxdirect. I don't remember if this error happened first here or later, but I got ""Lexical error: UTF-8 decoding error"" from GHC. Googled this and found the workaround of setting the environment variable LANG=C. Installation went through after this.

Then, installation of wxc is fine. Still not bad up to here.

Next, wxcore. cabal install fails, and the error appears to be in the configure step. I noticed some paths that's being printed out are odd, and it became apparent that my username (and subsequently, path to wxc) has a space in it, and Setup.hs just calls `system` with a bunch of strings concatenated, without quoting paths. So I went and edited Setup.hs to quote the paths and `cabal configure` went through.

So next I run `cabal build`. An endless stream of errors are spewed out when compiling WxcClassesAL.hs, complaining about ""unacceptable argument type CInt in foreign declaration"". Apparently this is a change in GHC 7.6, and by adding `import Foreign.C.Types` to a few files this was solved. This is annoying.

Finally, `cabal install wx` was fine. But when I try to compile a ""hello world"" application, the linker took forever to finish, and the resulting executable crashes on startup.
