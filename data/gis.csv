I'm heading to bed before an early flight. I may check in and reply to a few more questions when I get back, but I can't promise I'll remember to log back into this account.

We all know the demographics of reddit and this sub pretty well. There are a lot of students and young professionals here. With the summer approaching, field work starting, and school ending, there are also a lot of people that are looking for employment. I thought I'd take a few minutes to try and help. Below you will find a few of my major tips for junior or mid positions (senior positions are harder to generalize). I am also committing to answer any question submitted in the next 24 hours (AMAA). Some of the tips may seem a little obvious but I promise you these are all very common mistakes I see during the application/interview process.

About me:

I've been in the industry over 10 years. Prior to that I was in IT for another 10. I wont give too much away about my company, but I probably look through a few thousand GIS resumes a year and would be willing to bet that I've looked at more then a handful of yours. I receive on average 100 applicants per job posting. We've been growing pretty quickly over the last few years and I've hired a large sum of people. I'm not looking to fill positions through this post and wont even respond to PM's about them. I know of at least two employes that post in the sub (they don't know I know :P).

Tips:

* If you REALLY want a job, literally rewrite your resume each time using the job description as a template. I want to know how you fit my current opening. (If you want clarification, ask and I'll give it)
* The online application is extremely important. When I have to go through 100 applicants for one job, I use the online application as my pre screener because it's quicker to go through than 100 resumes. If you leave information out (for instance titles, responsibilities, previous salary, etc) I may never make it to your resume.
* If you're out of state, and I didn't explicitly state I am offering relocation, get a P.O. Box in the area or use a family member's address. This is my first disqualifier. Unless you're a personal reference or grab my attention in the first few lines of your application I won't look any further if you're not in the area of the listed position or I have stated I'll relocate. Relocating an employee costs 10's of thousands of dollars and is hard to justify in most cases (usually a senior position).
* Be honest about your expected salary or don't put anything at all. This is my second disqualifier. Most people are humbled when they first enter the job market thanks to universities inflating their salary expectation. Don't let your inflated expectations cost you the job interview.
* Don't give me your GPA unless it's 3.75+ or it's 100 percent required on the application (which I doubt). We have an optional text field for GPA on our application and most people will write down there 2.X GPA.
* Try to fit in! If you make it to the interview stage, realize that I will ask ANYONE that interacted with you what they thought. This can really work in your favor. I'm looking to see if you'll fit in with the office culture. I know it's nerve racking, but those that do something as simple as chat up (not flirt with…) the receptionist while they wait have a leg up.
* If you haven't touched ArcMap in a while, open it up and do some of the exercises before you come in. It's not unheard of to have a quick hands on test (I give one for junior positions) or to be quizzed on recent work. We know using ArcMap is like riding a bike, but if you seem out of practice, I have to question if it's because you haven't been on the bike in a while or if you simply don't know how.
* If something is important enough for me to list in the job description as a ""desired"", it's important enough for you to read up on it as much as you can before an interview. For instance, if I list a specific database schema, you should at least figure out what it is and why my company might be using it.
* When i asked why you left your previous position, don't tell me if was because of management. It's probably the number two answer I receive, next to laid off. There are bad managers/jerks everywhere, including my company. Don't tell me you can't work with them. I good general answer is ""I couldn't see a future there"", unless you're a habitual job hopper because then I know you're BS'ing anyways.
* I'm sure I'll think of a few more tips and I'll add them as I think of them.

Now it's your turn. Ask away. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can through Tuesday evening.

We've all been there, working with data and ESRI doesn't have a tool that does quite what you need it to do. What do you do? Google the question and find out someone else has solved the problem, and lo and behold, has provided a toolbox ready for download!

Please be careful with these tools. They contain Python scripts that can silently wreak havoc on your system. Allowing a tool to run in the ArcGIS environment gives the script the green light to your system files, documents, and anything else Python can grab. Treat every harmless-looking toolbox like any other .exe file you find online.

Stats:  6"", 100 scale accuracy, 3-band, leaf-off, ~4,500 square miles, extra flight lines for building lean correction

Funding:  $600,000+ from DHS UASI grant for regional E-911 and $50,000+ from USGS on behalf of NGA

The files will be shared freely as soon as I can get them distributed.  (Sorry I don't have a good way to show them off yet). 911 agencies get them first, then county GIS departments (who are expected to share them with all their cities), then data clearinghouse sites and anybody else.

There will be no licensing paperwork or fees.  I'm so thrilled that I was able to get this done without asking for local funding sources!  Everyone gets it for free!

How does the purchase of orthos work in your part of the world? Does some regional agency coordinate the purchase?  How much does your place of work have to pay to get them?

I'm a 3rd year university student at SFU and I have only taken two GIS courses so far so I am far from well versed in the material, but for an assignment last semester I used a combination of ArcGIS datasets, ArcScene/ArcMap, and Unity 3D to recreate a local ski mountain.

This is the little intro video I put together for my presentation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3eNpoqe94Y

It seems to be a pretty interesting and powerful concept, as most ArcMap analysis can be projected onto the unity terrain and powerful new tools such as real time physics simulations can be implemented onto the terrain as well. On top of this, Unity3D projects can be easily exported for unity webplayer, andriod, Iphone/Ipad, and other platforms.

I spend a lot of time in the help document, as do others who are *far* more experienced than I (including the people at my university who are the GIS experts), to figure out just how to manipulate ArcGIS into doing what I need. I've been disappointed with the pre-coded tools in ArcGIS and the way they sometimes change how things are calculated in the background between versions, with this sometimes happening mid-project for me, thereby making me redo everything so my work is scientifically responsible.

So, I'm looking for something different. Something that's free. Other archaeologists (especially academics) have become pretty devoted to GRASS as an alternative. Some use it, along with R, because they can work with collaborators without having to worry about licensing issues. Others seem to believe it is more capable of accurately modeling human behavior than the built-in stuff going on in ArcGIS. 

What do you guys think? Also, does anyone experienced in GRASS have some tips for me? I'm having a hard time with even the initial tinkering stage (getting already-made maps loaded, etc).

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the great tips, everyone! I'm in a bit of a work lull right now, so I'm going to look into everything y'all mentioned over the next few weeks.

Valued Esri Customer,

This email provides the information necessary to download, install, and authorize the ArcGIS 10.2 software. You will need the information below during the software installation.

New at ArcGIS 10.2:

The ArcGIS 10.2 setup package is designed to detect and upgrade an existing installation of the same ArcGIS 10.1 product (including SP1).
The settings for the installation location, license manager (for Concurrent Use), or authorization information (for Single Use or ArcGIS Server products) are retained in the upgrade. See the installation guide for more information on installation upgrades, new installations, or installations over versions previous to 10.1. Note: If a previous version of ArcGIS VBA Compatibility is installed, it must be uninstalled prior to installing the version available at the 10.2 release.


ArcGIS 10.2 for Single Use users:

If ArcGIS 10.2 will be installed on a different machine than where ArcGIS 10.1 is currently installed, and you wish to use the existing ArcGIS 10.1 authorization for ArcGIS 10.2, the ArcGIS 10.1 product must first be authorized before authorizing the ArcGIS 10.2 installation.


Obtaining Software Authorization Numbers:

If needed, the account's primary maintenance contact can obtain available authorization numbers from the Customer Care site; click 'Authorization &amp; Provisioning', then click a product name to obtain its authorization number. For those outside the U.S., please contact your local distributor about your authorization numbers.


Customer Care Site Changes at 10.2:

- When 10.2 is released to the general public next week, the License version on the Authorizations and Provisioning tab will display as 10.1-10.2. For this early release for distributors and partners, the version will remain at 10.1. You will be able to view the 10.1-10.2 version change when 10.2 is released to the general public.
- Also for the early release, the download portlet will display version
10.1 and 10.2 as ""latest release"" when available for distributors and partners. Once the update is available to all eligible users, the ""latest release"" will display as 10.2 only.

Your Esri Software can be downloaded or requested directly through the Esri Customer Care Portal.

  1. Log in to http://customers.esri.com with your Esri Global Account.
  2. Select “Software Download”.
  3. Download your Esri Software or request media to be shipped.
*NOTE - Media must be requested; it will not be automatically shipped to you.

I've always been fascinated by maps, and have a somewhat underdeveloped love--I know my way around a computer well, but I only have very, very cursory knowledge of programming languages like Java and Flash--of computers, and a friend recently suggested I look into GIS.  Naturally, the first place I looked was Wikipedia, followed by checking to see if a sub-reddit for GIS existed.  Lucky for me, it does.  I was hoping to find some basic information about what exactly GIS is, but I found nothing in the sidebar but related sub-reddits.

So, as someone with an unrelated BA that may potentially be considering the training necessary for a career in GIS, what exactly do you do?  Fieldwork?  Data entry?  Programming?  All of the above?  I've checked out the online certification program offered by Penn State, but I'm not even clear on what the applied difference is in those certifications--basically, what is the difference between regular GIS and geospatial intelligence?

Essentially, what I am looking to know is: 

- What do you wish someone had told you about GIS before you embarked in a career in the field? 
- How would you explain your job to an elementary school student?  

Also, if you don't feel like explaining but know of a good place (online or a book) that does, I'd just as warmly welcome that information.

I very much appreciate any information you guys can share!

**Edit:** THANK YOU for all of the incredible insight.  I really didn't expect to get so much quality, thorough information, and you've all helped push me in the right direction of getting even more information.  I went from knowing absolutely nothing about GIS, to now having a fairly good understanding of what it is, and where to start looking to learn even more--exactly what I was looking for.  I still don't know if GIS is a career path I would want to embark on, but I'm on the right track of being able to make an informed decision.

Bing Maps
Complimentary use of Bing Maps is being phased out for Esri products. With ArcGIS 10.2, you need to obtain a license key directly from Microsoft to use any of the basemaps in the Bing Maps collection. If an administrator registers a Bing Maps key with an ArcGIS Online for organizations account, any user in the organization can access Bing Maps when signed in.

I have to do a Masters Thesis in GIS and I thought I'd pick your brains. My thesis has to make a hypothesis or ask a question in a spatial context.

As an example, one of the top theses last year was a study of “bluetongue”, a disease that affects sheep and cattle in Europe. The author created a website using Open Source software to “identify, predict, and explain observed spatial patterns of Culicoides species at the national scale”. He spent a good deal of his thesis explaining such background technologies as the Internet, PostGreSQL, Mapfish, etc, and another good deal of his thesis explaining bluetongue. Only part of it was actual GIS.

Any suggestions?

Maxed out the processor at the time (AMD Phenom II quad core, 3.0ghz, so it's still pretty reasonable even a few years later).  As such, it still handles GIS ops fairly well, but my laptop is another matter.  Given that I probably do more actual processing on the laptop, thanks to the portability and its tendency to occupy both my office and home, I'm looking to maybe replace it with something a little more capable.

It really groans when processing large rasters particularly, not to mention more computationally-intense things.

Anyone want to comment on what they're using, and what (in your opinion) the criteria are that make a good GIS machine?

I have no idea if ArcGIS is capable of making use of multi-threading or multi-core processors, but I would assume so.


**EDIT:**
So it looks like there are three main areas that I'm seeing as important to most of y'all:

1) CPU speed: Given the fact that ArcGIS is apparently not coded to take advantage of multi-core processors or multi-threading, a relatively high-speed processor seems advisable.

*Corollary*: A really high-end GPU may not make much difference at all.  I had considered the possibility that a machine marketed as a ""gaming computer"" might be a nice off-the-shelf option, but those tend to focus heavily on the graphics card.  Could be spending that extra cash on an SSD (see below) might be a better idea.

2) Memory: Obvious, but I'm seeing higher numbers here than I expected.  I would have thought 8GB would have been sufficient, but many of you (I'd be willing to bet the folks who work with the largest datasets) are using up to 32GB.

3) SSD: This is something I had not anticipated, but it makes sense.  A standard HDD for large file processing would, I imagine, end up being the real bottleneck.

I'm a little afraid of how much some of the machines you guys are using cost, but this is an example of ""the right tools for the right job,"" I think.  If I regularly find myself processing these huge files, it may be that I have no choice.

I have a very small company that sells city maps of my city; Lyon, France. 
These maps are sold in print and pdf versions, but not in interactive web/app form (yet).
I have questions about the utility of using a gis Software to make these from now on.

I am referring mainly to the blue side, and specifically to the fact that it only shows buildings surrounding certain points of interest.  
For the moment, I do this by hand, but if I ever want to take this to the next level I would have to be able to automatize much of this work.  


So I was wondering how useful it would be for me to learn GIS (I already have VERY basic understanding of it). Or maybe with a project like this its better to continue to develop manually?

I graduated from the University of Chicago with an M.A. in Middle Eastern Studies last June.  My studies focused on GIS as applied to the historical Middle East, and ended with me conducting a viewshed analysis of a medieval Syrian fortress for my thesis.  During my time on campus, I worked in a GIS lab (mainly rectifying Corona imagery to Landast footprints and writing meta-data) and then as a research assistant to a professor in the geography department (mapping the development of urban fringe belts); both jobs roughly equating to 2.5 years of professional experience.  I've kept up with my GIS skills since graduating with the ArcGIS home-use license.  I feel I am quite familiar with the software as a result.

For over a year, I've applied to GIS jobs regularly, and have not received more than a cursory interview from three potential employers.  The companies and agencies I hear back from say I either lack the necessary qualifications for the position (entry level jobs mind you) or I don't seem to be a ""good fit"" for their company.  I realize that my M.A. in Middle Eastern Studies may cause a bit of consternation, but I have always taken great care to emphasize my extensive training and experience in GIS.

At soon-to-be 29, and with slightly over six-figures in student loan debt, I'm not about to go back to school to get another degree simply so the letters ""GIS"" can appear at the top of my resume.  I became quite passionate about the field in grad school and simply want to find a job doing what I've come to enjoy.  I'd like to think that I'm a decent to above-average candidate for employment, but I'm routinely left wondering if I've missed something along the way or am truly not as qualified as I feel myself to be

I recently graduated with a degree in Environmental Science, which included a GIS certificate.  I managed to land an internship with a state agency doing GIS work, but unfortunately it hasn't presented many learning opportunities to this point (most of my tasks involve digitizing data; really simple stuff that anyone could be shown how to do in a few minutes).  I've realized I need to take it upon myself to learn some new skills if I want to turn this into a career, but I have no idea where to begin.

One of my biggest questions is (and this may be a dumb one) - what can I actually DO with GIS?  My college coursework was pretty much limited to making maps, and all my work experience has basically just been digitizing data for the use of others.  To make this question simpler, say I want to work with GIS but I also want to stay in the environmental field.  What kind of job could I get, and what kind of projects might I work on?

My other problem, somewhat tied with the first, comes from my observation that every GIS job seems to have different requirements beyond simple knowledge of GIS.  Going back to my previous question, in such a position as what I'm looking for, what kind of skills might be necessary for me to be a valuable member of a company?  To make answering this a bit easier, here's a general list of what I know and don't know:

* Basic knowledge of ArcGIS, including: digitizing files, editing data, very limited experience working with spatial, network, and 3d analyst, preparation of maps, some familiarity with some of the data management tools, and probably a few other things I can't think of off the top of my head.

* I don't know Python.  How important is it to learn this?

* I have no database management skills.  I've started poking around with Access just to develop some kind of experience, but nothing beyond that.

* I don't know any programming languages, although I'm not at all afraid to learn some (as a kid I taught myself basic HTML for fun; I'm sure if it were necessary I could learn VBA or C).



I've poked around ESRI's site and looked at some of their training resources, but I wasn't sure which would be useful to me (plus I'm certainly not going to pay for any unless I'm sure I'll get something valuable from it).  I feel if I had a better understanding of what I should know, it would make learning those skills a lot easier for me.

- [GeoCalc](http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/products/gcalc.php)
- [Manifold GIS](http://www.manifold.net/index.shtml)
- [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/), [PROJ.4](http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/), etc.

The most important features for this application are:

- C++ interface.
- Comprehensive coordinate system database. The software will be used worldwide, so this is a big one.
- 2D coordinate conversion. Vertical datums are largely optional for our application.
- Mature API.

We don't really need or want a full mapping library, as we'll be trying to do some ""interesting"" things using modern graphics. Mainly, at this point, we're looking for a library which can be used to specify an input and output coordinate system and perform conversion between the two.

While I like the data analysis and MapBasic tools that come with MapInfo, I feel like the output maps are just sort of ugly.  If you save to BMP or JPG the anti-aliasing of the vector data is just garbage, and the PDF output is ok, particularly when printed, but falls apart if you're looking to do any fills other than a solid color (and don't even get me started about the ugly heatmaps).

That being said, does anyone have any recommendations for GIS Software that produces pretty maps, preferably with output to PDF and JPG/BMP/PNG/etc.?  I've looked around a little but there are so many options (it seems), that I don't know where to actually start.

I think this would be a little long post, also sorry for grammar mistakes.   
I graduated from university in January 2013 from the department of mining engineering, I hated mining engineering for a long time (I studied for 5.5 years) then I took a technical elective course called Mine Closure and Reclamation. In this course, our instructor gave us a project. In this project, we had an abandoned coal mine and this coal mine did not shot down properly. We took its landsat images and done basic operations such as extracting vegetated area with combining different bands on top of each other, calculating the urban areas, etc and we have used TNTMips and Quantum GIS for this project. I loved every minute of it and then I took another technical elective course which is called ""Introduction to Remote Sensing"", loved the subject more.    

I was not a bright student because of my lack of interest, I was much more interested in the courses which we took together with other engineering students such as fluid mech, differential eqns, thermodynamics etc., so the instructors in my department did not know me well.    

I have applied master's program in our department and got accepted. This was a shock for me, because my grades were not that high, then I decided to talk to the instructor whom I have taken the reclamation and mine closure course. I had a talk with her and told my interest in GIS and asked her if we could write a project together. She told me that she would think about it.    

And she called me yesterday and told me that she had a project which will begin in September and she choose me as her assistant, she also told me that I need to leave my job and will get a scholarship, I needed to know how to use QGIS, ArcGIS and Matlab really well. (I don't know anything about Matlab, but I have an intermediate knowledge about C..) Because during the project (the project is for 2 years) I will handle the GIS related workload of other assistant, who is a doctorate student. She told me that there were many candidates for this position that she gave me, who are much more informed and experienced about GIS but she choose me for my ambition and told me that she trusted me in this project. That's why I am so excited and don't know what to do.
 
Finally, I have one month to prepare. I looked for tutorials and online courses. Could you guys help me to find more resources? Or what should I do now? I have a full time job (need to pay my rent and feed the cat), so I only have the evenings to study.

I figure I'd introduce myself before jumping in and asking a few questions, which was the intent of this post. My name is Austin and I am a junior at a school in Kentucky. I was originally a Meteorology Major / GIS Minor, but I saw very bleak career hopes in the Meteorology field, so I decided just a week ago to switch my Major to GIS. I've had a few lower level GIS courses, mainly in cartographic map design and some vector and raster based analysis. I'm still expected to graduate on time, even with my late major change.

A couple questions I have for those in the field:

1) How are career prospects looking in the field right now? How likely is it that a new college graduate with no employment experience in the field can pick up a job relatively quickly?

2) Is there any advice that I can get for what to do while I am still in college to help boost my knowledge of the field and possibly elevate myself above the rest of the people in this school's GIS program?

3) Is there anything I can do to help my chances of getting a job in the field immediately after graduation?

Flash forward 2 days; after uninstalling arcgis, cleaning out the registry, and re-installing the software the same bug reappears. So we go to our last resort which is to rebuild my machine (restore the system to its factory settings and start from scratch). If you have never had to do this before, it sucks fat sweaty hairy balls and lets leave it at that. First thing I do once restored is install Arcgis with the latest service pack and patches... at this point my IT guy and I have spent a full 8hr workday rebuilding my system so before I leave I want full confirmation, some kind of affirmation that it has not all been in vain. I open ArcMap, link to the appropriate online server that hosts the address locator, add my csv document that hosts the data, reference the correct address locator, run geocode process, aaaaannnnddd same EXACT error as before.

TL;DR- I will be drinking heavily tonight

*note this is just bitching, GIS gore I guess, but if you want to take a shot at solving it, be my guest, environment settings and system variables available upon request.

**EDIT:** Problem solved: The account I was using for ArcGIS Online had no credits left, if you use this service it will **not** notify you when you are out of credits and when you go to sign in to your account in AGOL it will give you a ""This Account has been Suspended"" message, there is no mention of credits anywhere... why esri would not set up a warning or message regarding the account being out of credits is beyond me.  The workaround I found is to use [Google Fusion Tables](http://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en) to geocode the points (up to 2,500 a day for free), the downloaded kml cannot be directly converted do to some weird conflict with arcgis so you have to open the kml in google earth and save as to a different location, once you have done this you can use the KML to Layer gp tool in ArcMap to import the data.  It takes a little while longer but it beats having to pay for esri's ridiculous services.

I graduated college about 5 years ago with a BS in Urban Planning, with a minor in GIS. As I was going through school, I realized that I was more interested in a career in GIS rather than planning, but I was almost finished with my degree in planning, and couldn't afford to stay in school any longer. Plus, my university didn't offer a degree specifically in GIS- only the minor. Anyway, long story short, I was a terrible student; I skipped class, gave zero shits and *barely* graduated. I made no professional connections, and, as a result had no one to turn to after graduation. I did complete an internship, but it was less than a year and, like I said, I put in no extra effort to get hired on afterward. Fast forward four or five years, and I've done a few seasonal internships and jobs, and one unpaid, independant internship. I'm now working a dead end job that I get absolutely nothing out of. 


So. Here I am. I want to get back into GIS, but I don't know what to do. I know my education and work experience are pretty much outdated (the last ArcGIS I actively used was 9.3). I've grown up a lot since I graduated with my BS, and I know I could do much, much better a second time around. 


I know I'm not qualified to go for a Master's, but I could definitely do a certificate program. Are these programs worth it? Or do I need to look at going back and getting a second Bachelor's? Or are there another options I don't know about?

I need an accurate GPS device to catalog roughly 500 – 1500 waypoints showing me the latitude, longitude (and preferably elevation). I don’t care if it just shows it on a screen and I have to write them all down by hand, or if it can give me a .gpx file or something like that. Obviously a file of the waypoint information would be preferable. Accuracy is another key; most GPS devices are accurate within 30 feet! I don’t need it within inches, but the more accurate the better (approx 1-8 feet would be nice). Trimble (Geo XH 6000) sets the standard in this, but the devices are complicated to use and highly expensive, while phone apps and other devices are too inaccurate. My question **what are my options for a reasonable device that will tell me the lat/long/elev, with a good accuracy?** Are my only two options between a costly professional Trimble, or a Garmin that’s 30 feet off? I don’t need a nuke, I can’t use a match, is there a firecracker option? Please help. I’m hoping I overlooked some simple solution or device.

While a lot of their courses are cheap (quite a few seem to be only $32, if not free), for those of us who aren't employed full time, we might like to be a bit more selective in which classes we take.

I guess the simplest way to answer this is: of the classes you've taken, which were the most beneficial, and which did you feel were really underwhelming?  Were there any resources that provided better instruction on certain topics than ESRI's training?

I'll start off with the only two classes I've taken:

* [Basics of Python for ArcGIS 10](http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.webCourseDetail&amp;courseid=2114): It's a cheap class ($32), but I don't feel it was very useful.  It taught me the very basics of Python, but I probably could have learned most of that with a simple Google search.  It also failed to demonstrate to me how Python can be more useful than simply using the toolbox in ArcCatalog.  It was especially disappointing when considering the second class I took, which was free:
* [Using Python in ArcGIS Desktop 10](http://training.esri.com/gateway/index.cfm?fa=catalog.webCourseDetail&amp;courseid=1868): A free class; I took this on the recommendation of someone here.  It went over essentially the same material as the previous class, though in a slightly more rushed fashion.  It also explained to a limited extent some of the reasons Python can be useful in ArcGIS, which the other class didn't.  To those of you like me who are completely new to Python, this course seems like a good starting point; I would completely avoid the other class I mentioned.

I don't know the general demographics of the people who browse this subreddit - as in, how many are experienced professionals versus those relatively inexperienced with GIS (like me) - so perhaps this might not be a very useful post to many of you.  But if there are a bunch of GIS newbies around here, I feel like this could be really helpful to anyone looking to expand upon their existing GIS education.",,False,self,t5_2qmpb,False,,,True,t3_pb4h4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/pb4h4/esris_online_training_what_are_your_thoughts/,

Thanks in advance for helping a noob understand a fundamental problem. I appreciate your patience.

So here's the deal: I have two sets of feature classes from my local municipal GIS department, one set is in the local county coordinate system, and the other set is in WGS 84. I want to duplicate all of my feature classes that are in county coordinates to WGS 84 coordinates. No problem, I assume: I just add one set of features from the WGS 84 set to an empty map, which defines the projection. Then I add a feature class from the county coordinate set to the map, projecting it on the fly. The features do not line up, but I figured that is because they are using different coordinates. I assumed that I could do data&gt;export on the county set, using the same coordinate system as the data frame, and bam! I have duplicated the feature class in WGS 84. 

So here's my question. When I add the data that I just exported to the map, it still does not line up with the other data in WGS 84. It displays in the same location as when it was first placed in the map. I would like some help in understanding why this is so. The coordinate systems are the same, and the features should occupy the same location. I thought that I understood projections and datums, but now I am stumped.

I didn't ask in askgis because I thought this group might even be too small to have someone who knows the answer.

",15,7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/10rkwr/gis_for_anything_other_than_oil_gas_energy/,"so i was exposed to GIS as an environmental tool mainly for forecasting the future and spatial analysis.  I have always thought that this limited the scope of where GIS could be useful.  I know some businesses use it for planning and obviously the real estate industry relies heavily on GIS, but I'm wondering if there is demand out there for small, private or public, ad-hoc sort of GIS work.  I have been out of college for less than a year now, and am only really finding GIS jobs in those specific industries, but as I'm sure you guys know, GIS can be useful in any industry, given the infrastructure and access to make it cost effective. imagine building a site suitability map for anything. That person needs to find a doctor? what about a map, organized by custom attributes. i.e. types of practice, size of practice, costs, patient health, etc.? or how about a site suitability map of best colleges to attend when planning in high school, guidance counselors could give out custom college maps with easy to interpret visual display of information. 
So, everybody, where the hell do you practice GIS if not employed by the transportation, defense, or energy industry?
Have you seen demand for GIS anywhere else? or do you see any place currently without demand where GIS could be useful? 

EDIT: i should clarify...i guess what I'm wondering is if there are just straight up GIS professionals, outside of academia, with perhaps a hierarchical system of advancement or something, rather than the current state of GIS which i have found to just be a tool that is  useful in many industries rather than an industry all its own.
overall, I really love working with spatial data and GIS programs, and I'd like to continue to do it. In order to continue and pay the bills, I'd like to find a way to get paid while working with GIS, but i seem completely unappealing to most hiring companies. I have some experience, both academic and professional, but my degree is in environmental studies. any suggestions?

I recently discovered the GIS field after having landed a job several months ago with my city's GIS division. It's come pretty naturally to me so far and I can definitely see myself making a career out of it. I'm currently a technician and I anticipate staying with the division for the next 3 years until husband gets stationed somewhere else (he's military). I'm trying to figure out a solid career path. 

A little bit of background: I got my degree in Computer Science and really enjoyed programming. I'm a bit rusty now (currently refreshing myself on Python and Visual Basic), but I'd love to get into the development/programming side of GIS. I'm also interested in the analysis side of things, although I have no experience with it.

I'm dabbling with three potential Masters programs and I'm not sure which one would be best. Currently I'm exploring GIS, Geospatial Intelligence and software engineering. I've been doing my research on the rise/decline of each but I get a lot of mixed opinions which makes me nervous. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated!

I have a list of people who registered and attended one of their events. Many provided addresses to the organization and the organization is interested in understanding where these folks traveled from. I have already obtained the lat-long via geocoding the addresses provided.

I'm trying to create a heat map showing the density/clustering patterns of where the majority of people live based on their provided location data. [Something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/Xcybk.png) I've done this before using ArcGIS in school, but do not have access to the software currently. As a side note, I have very limited programming experience ,and I am trying to find something I can present the data with that is visually appealing. Many people are familiar with Google Maps and I have seen examples where heat maps can be overlaid as a separate layer on top of their map. I can import to Google Earth to turn layers on/off if that's the solution for display. Ideally, I would like to be able to scroll around the map while displaying the data as some of the people live outside the state and I would like to show where those locations are as well.

I've been playing around with Google Fusion Tables and [can produce a map with the points, but when I check the ""Display as heat map"" box I get very small clusters displayed.](http://imgur.com/a/vZBhJ) As you can see, I'm analyzing primarily one Metro area in North Texas.

To complicate things further, there are multiple people that live at some addresses and I would like those people to be counted as well. Should I just change either the lat or lon by 0.000001 value to create two different points??

Does anyone have a frugal solution that doesn't involve a lot of programming experience? I would think that Google or some other company would have an easy way to perform this task, perhaps in Fusion Tables or Earth, that doesn't involve custom APIs.

We are building a tunnel through the city for light rail. As the construction progresses, I need to produce a map of what has been done. I have been doing this very primitively, and would like some ideas or some help on providing a map that is accessible on the web. While the tunnel is being built (by a giant [tunnel boring machine](http://imgur.com/a/oYf6H#8)), data is being collected from the machine as well as hundreds of instruments that monitor movement in the ground and surrounding structures. I would like to put all of this information together on one easily accessible map. 

I have access to all the GIS software I would need, but I don't know how to use it, and have only limited knowledge of what it can do. I am hoping someone will share my vision and want to get involved. As an intern, I am in no position to hire anyone, but you will definitely get credit for any effort you put into it. If you want to just offer suggestions about how to figure it out on my own, that's great too. The only problem is that we only have a few months until the tunnel is complete. Sound Transit will continue to expand the light rail system for the next 20 years or so - both above and below ground, so it would be a great opportunity for anyone who might want to get involved.

TL;DR - I want to create a web-based application to track the progress of the light rail construction in Seattle.

There are a lot of directions this could take, and I could definitely see getting several people involved. I hope to one day be a GIS expert, but for now, I would love your help.

As well, I have several unprojected rasters (Lat/Long coordinate system with WGS84 datum) that hold information on different variables. I need to extract the information from each of those rasters (a previous post went into this, and I have this problem mostly solved), but before that, I need to project the rasters (and points?), as I will need to get distance information from the map for my analysis. I am having a lot of difficulty choosing a proper map projection. I know that different projections conserve different elements of the information, so I will need to choose one that best preserves distance information. I think that the projection I choose should be focused/centered on the points. Originally I thought I had to use a UTM projection (I was leaning towards WGS84 UTM Zone 10N), based on a comment from my supervisor, but I've looked into it a bit more, and it seems that UTM projections may not ideal for conserving distance information.

So that's where I am at. There are a lot of different projections to choose from, and I am fairly lost in all the details of them. How can I best choose a map projection, given the information I have provided above? 

As well, I am concerned about projecting this data, and how it may effect the quality of information held in the rasters. Does projecting unprojected data (or reprojecting for that matter) result in a loss of quality of information?

I'm interested in learning more about how the quality of information can be visualized on a map. Not the information in a GIS but the information about the information (metadata?). For example I'm interested in finding out good ways to represent how good (or bad) the information about location accuracy or area accuracy is. Sort of like: this information exist, but the it isn't necessarily reliable, so the user should get a heads up about the data quality. 

I haven't really got a grip about this subject and I don't know if this is something common (perhaps it got a name?). I have come across ideas about transperancy and clarity/sharpness, but I'd like to know more about those or maybe rather about other alternatives. Perhaps you people have some ideas on articles I should read or books to have a look at? Maybe you know a good system that does this that I could take a look at? Or perhaps you have other ideas?

* Network Analyst
* Spatial Analyst
* 3D Analyst
* Crime
* Emergency Response
* Pollution

I don't have much experience using the other two extensions unfortunately (other than labs I've done during my undergrad), but would really like to learn a bit more about them.

I have a little experience using Google Sketchup to create simple 3D models and import them into ArcScene...which I found quite enjoyable and interesting.

Anyways, I would really like to integrate most/all of my interests into a research project.  I've been flirting with a few ideas so far, but this one is probably my favorite:

* Create a 3D campus/sidewalk network to analyze/relate a variety of spatial issues, such as lighting, crime incidents, emergency phone locations, etc.

Hello all, so I have a bit of a conundrum.

I'm looking to merge two shapefiles, with overlapping geometries that needs to be removed and no common ID field to match up this overlap. The tricky part is, the features will overlap (but not completely) with the features from the other shapefile.

If needed, I could upload the file. But think of it simply as two pages of a map, which have an overlap so you can see the same road network on each, but it's cutoff.

Is there a nice way to dissolve/merge these two shapefile using FOSS and preferrentially, in a method that could be integrated into a script? I also need to keep the attributes I have after merging (but not necessarily the duplicate from the common area)

What I have so far in QGIS, is I make a new field using another field which I know stays consistent between overlapping features. I then dissolve by this feature. It works, but I don't like it for two reasons:

1) I need to muck about with the fields

2) I could lose information between two or more non-overlapping features which dissolve together but may have additional information in the other fields that aren't dissolved by. -&gt; I could get this information back by doing a spatial join back with the original data. I would need to break the multipart features back into singlepart ones however.

There ought to be a simpler, cleaner, more sensible way to do this! Help!

But incorporated places are in most of these cases not restricted to one county; i.e., a given city can span multiple counties. Although these are to some extent exceptional -- most cities are entirely contained within one county -- not all are of this type.

I know how to do an intersect, calculate area-weighted populations for the resulting segments of places within counties, etc. But I'm wondering if anyone could give me some feedback on how to take **an orderly approach** to deducting, from the county population numbers, the population of incorporated places lying within, either area-weighted (where the place spans more than one county), or entire: the result I'm looking for would be the population of the balance of the county (i.e., the population of unincorporated areas).

By orderly approach, I mean, how should I manage and reshape the data, use database operations, etc. The process of doing what I'm talking about is pretty straightforward when I'm looking at a small set of features and can analyze them piece-by-piece, but I'm looking at a huge set of features.

The workflow essentially looks like this ...

1. User adds article to [wheretogoscouting.org](http://wheretogoscouting.org/)
2. User adds one or more geotag (via the {{coord}} template, imported directly from Wikipedia) to said article.
3. Some piece of software (perhaps written by me) scrapes the databases for {{coord}}-tagged articles, builds a detailed KMZ file, and dumps the file to disk somewhere. This could happen on my local workstation (I can set a cron job to do it daily, for example) or on the server.
4. Users will then be able to use the KMZ file and Google Maps or Google Earth (or any other KMZ-aware application) to find locations in the wiki that are geographically near to them, then use the application to survey the area for geographical features, find driving directions, etc.

Some notes on the KMZ file:

* The wiki will make extensive use of categories, which will be used to create folders in the derived KML data. Many locations will be included in multiple directories, so I'll need to work out a good way to handle a single location being listed multiple times. I may just designate ""primary"" categories and use those to control the KML organization.
* Each point in the KMZ file would have, at the very least, a link and the article title.
* All objects will initially be point objects, but I'll eventually want to add data for trails and other geometric features. For example, I have a GPS track for the entire Appalachian Trail, which would exist alongside points marking trail shelters and parking areas.
* I will probably offer a NetworkLink implementation to ensure that users always have the latest data. I will also off a full ""static"" release.
* I will implement KML regions, especially in the NetworkLink version, to help control the number of items on-screen at any given time. Even with my limited current dataset, having all of the items on-screen at one time is visually cluttered and bogs down Google Earth on my 27"" iMac.
* I will want to be able to control which icons are used for which point objects. Examples include campgrounds, parking areas, hiking areas, etc.

This list sort of goes on and on, but you get the idea.

My professional background is in computer science and software engineering, so I'm comfortable with taking on a reasonably complicated programming task.

My current plan of attack is to write a stand-alone utility in Python or C++ using the libkml library from Google. It hasn't been updated in quite some time, but it appears to be the most complete and it has the weight of Google behind it, so I'm assuming that it is relatively stable/reliable.

I have investigated using something like KMLExport, a MediaWiki extension, to do this automatically.  I just don't see how that will scale well to large data sets, even if I adapt the source code to scale toward a larger data set (by removing the recursive find algorithm and replacing it with something else).

This is my first GIS project, so I'm asking you: **Am I on the right track with this?** Is there a tool or a process that I'm missing? Is there perhaps a better approach?

I know this sort of tool already exists (Google uses it to build the Wikipedia layer for Google Earth), but I can't find anything ready-built or publicly-available, so I'm gearing myself up to write and maintain (and perhaps distribute, via github or something similar) my own utility.

So, I was like, hey, you heard about PostgreSQL, PostGIS and pgRouting - let's give it a go.  
And it kind of worked, after all.

Unfortunately the [latest official pgRouting release](http://pgrouting.org/download.html) is from 2010/11/22;  
though there are community builds and of course the [Github repository](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting).

Over at Github, there are pull requests and issues from years and years back.  
I even had to manually patch pgRouting, in order to get it working with PostGIS 2.

The documentation is - if you're going beyond the basics - not the best if there's some at all;  
so you'll often find yourself reading the source code.

I could go on and on, about inconsistent APIs and other problems, but I think you get the point.

A bit of background about myself:

I'm currently enrolled in a small university in my home town (lucky, my home town has a school worth a damn with some fantastic departments).  I'm dual-majoring in Geology and GIS.  I'm finishing up my last few classes and will be graduating in August.  My university also has a ""GIS Department"" which is, essentially, an independently operated GIS firm that works under the university's name.  I've worked there full time as a GIS tech for about a year and a half - figured it wouldn't hurt to get my foot in the door with some applicable experience while I'm still in school.

As far as experience, I have done and am currently working on projects for clients ranging from local city/county government to professors in various departments on campus to private industry.  Since we work off of an education license, I have access to and experience with any extension I've ever needed to use.  I also worked along-side my boss to implement ArcSDE servers and we're currently working on developing QC/QA standards for versioning and editing out of these databases (which we could use a kick in the right direction with - hah - but that's another post).  I have some experience with VBA, am teaching myself Python and have fooled around a bit with Postgres to set up the SDE.  I've used open-source software like BASINS, CAMEO and MARPLOT, and have experience with hydro software like AquaChem and Modflow.

Now, to the point:

Eventually, I'd like to get my masters.  Before I pursue that, though, I definitely need a break from school.  My boss has promised me a temp position once I do have the degrees, but I don't think it would hurt to see what other opportunities are out there for me.

For the professionals that have been in the industry for a while, I need to start building my resume.  What all do you guys look for when hiring/what have you put on your resume that has been beneficial?  This is, really, my first ""big boy"" job out of school - I haven't ever had to make a resume before, I'm hoping for a little input so that I might have a bit of an edge.

Also, does anyone recommend putting together some kind of portfolio?  And if so, what are the best portfolios you've seen?  What about the projects should be included?

Thanks to anyone who decides to indulge me.

Right now, I am looking at something that would also be something I can use for the next 5+ years, like my current macbook pro(early 2008 model)

prefer solid state over 512gb
16gb or more ram(lenovo gives you option of 32gb, but I can install on my own)
2gb graphics memory

One machine that I like is the Thinkpad W530. I was thinking of upgrading the hard drive to a 128 gb ssd for casing purposes(lenovo uses different brackets for ssd), and not upgrading ram via lenovo. That would save me a ton of money because I plan to get the crucial m500 960gb ssd and 32 gb ram(crucial, kingston, or corsair)

If I got the retina display macbook pro, I'd dualboot with windows 8 pro and split it up 512(mac):256(windows) among the 768 gb ssd or whatever it would be post formatting.

I am a university student who will be starting my fourth year this upcoming Fall semester. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of what should be done after I have graduated with my BSc in Geography and a Certificate in GIS. I know I am interested in pursuing a career within this field, but am unsure what I should do post-graduation; I wish to further my knowledge and abilities for better job opportunities.

Up until now, I have considered 3 possibilities:
    1. Second bachelors degree in Computing
    2. Masters of GIS
    3. Masters of Urban Planning

I am leaning heavily towards the first option, because that not only enhances my abilities and applications to GIS, but also opens up job opportunities in the computing field. My reasons against a Masters of GIS is that it appears fairly unnecessary until I have actually settled into a GIS job. Additionally, I feel like planning is currently decreasing in popularity and demand. 

Each of the three options will require 2 years of my time (which I consider my maximum).

Are there any other suggestions or recommendations I should consider? All input is greatly appreciated.

Some google searches seems to indicate that such a GPS unit does not exist, and data dictionaries are exclusively found on trimble type units, which of course cost thousands of dollars.

I am going to ask the question: Where are the most favorable/ideal places to catch backwoods pond brook trout within the Adirondack state park?  Now our project requires a minimum of (3) variables and so far I think I'm going to use the following criteria (depending on the data I can find):  ponds &gt; 1.5 miles from any road, ponds &gt; 15 acres in surface area, ponds &gt;15 feet total depth, ponds with average pH &gt;5.0, and ponds that ARE stocked by NYSDEC.  That's more than three, but since I really am interested in the results (to find all of those sweet fishing spots), the more detailed I can make it the better!

I know already from my professor to check out Cornell CUGIR for data, and I know DEC has some stuff and same goes for NYS GIS Clearinghouse.  But what I'm wondering is: does anyone already have data I can grab from them for this project, and does anyone know where else (or where specifically) I can get some of these files to bring into Arc?  Also, what should I be looking for specifically?  There are so many files out there I don't know where to start.  Here's a [link](http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu/browse.jsp) to the CUGIR database for starters.  I'm looking forward to this project and any help will be greatly appreciated.

does anyone out there have any advice on finding entry level work without any background in the field? i've been looking online and just about all of the positions require 3-5 years professional experience. 

ideally, i would love to end up overseas working in environmental monitoring. the majority of my coursework and research projects have combined GIS with remote sensing to monitor things like vegetation, urban development, risk analysis (flooding/fire/etc) and i would love to do more in this area. any advice on how to go about finding work in other countries? particularly non-english speaking ones, as an english speaker? especially interested in south america and asia. 

and what about a CV? obviously i have nothing GIS related to put on there, my work prior to this has been mainly military/management, and ideas on how to sell myself on this, even with my lack of experience? is it normal to include examples of my work in a CV? i have quite a few projects i've done at uni that i'm quite pleased with and would be happy to include, if this is the way things are done. 

any help would be fantastic. i'm new to all this and a little bit lost. cheers!",,False,self,t5_2qmpb,False,,,True,t3_12rc29,http://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/12rc29/any_advice_for_a_new_gis_graduate_looking_for_work/,

I am currently doing a Undergraduate Honours degree in Anthropology with a focus in Archaeology. In the last two years I have become really interested in how GIS can be used within Archaeology. Since there are jobs in this field with CRM firms and I would like to work in the private sector I was wondering what ways it would be feasible to bridge the gap and get a job. 

From reading fourm posts in r/gis, I have decided to learn Java and Python and I am in the initially stages of learning Java. 

In my next (and final) year of my undergraduate I am planning to take Computer Mapping, Intro to GIS, and Intro to remote sensing. Other then these courses I will have no formal education in GIS or remote sensing. 

I want to do to a Master's degree in something, I assume a GIS based Masters would be ideal, (currently looking into Queens (Kingston, CAN) and Memorial (St. Johns, CAN)

I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant for a professor in our geography department, and we're working on a project that involves georeferencing large thematic maps of Africa. He said that he already did this, but when the data was moved somehow the rasters lost the reference system.

However, when we loaded the map yesterday, along with the lat/long reference feature class, the points that he had created were still there. For some reason though, the map wasn't referencing them correctly. Once I viewed the control points table, the map of Africa shrank to about the size of a building. We're pretty confused.

He basically told me to try and fix it by researching what went wrong. I've been looking everywhere online and can't find anything, so... I came here. My guess is that something got corrupted in the transfer process. Do any of you know how to fix this? Will we have to just delete the control points and start over?

I've been working full-time as a software developer for the past 5 years and I am also a university student studying German and Computer Engineering. I am almost finished with my German degree, I just need 18 advanced hours to complete it. I am very interested in maps, GPS, and the outdoors. I found that my university offers a GIS certificate for completing six classes that will also satisfy my advanced hours requirements. Here are the classes: [GIS certification](http://catalog.unt.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=3&amp;poid=532&amp;returnto=161).

I am really completely new to GIS and don't know too much about it, but from what I have read so far, it sounds like a good combination of my love for programming and maps (not so much the outdoors, but at least it is a little related?). I've been trying to think of a way to combine my passion for programming and the outdoors for a while, and haven't come up with much. This sounds like it is about as close as I can get. Also, many of my own ideas that I want to develop involve maps heavily or as the central feature.

So, a couple of questions. 1) Is going into GIS because I like maps kind of like someone going into Computer Science because they like computer games? Even though I am already a software developer, I want to be sure this is what I am imagining it to be like. 2) Do you think this certificate ([the same one I posted above](http://catalog.unt.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=3&amp;poid=532&amp;returnto=161)) is good enough to perform a GIS job, or is a degree required? I really enjoy programming, but I am a little tired of the boring programs I write daily. I'd really like to do something much more interesting such as what I think GIS is like.

I've got two layers, the state layer that has every county and a point layer that covers the whole state (no county specific information). I want to work with points that fall within specific counties. 

I have been approaching this by selecting (by attribute) the county of interest from the state layer, exporting that county to a new shape file, adding the layer to the map and then selecting (by location)the points that fall within that newly created polygon,  and then exporting those points.  I want to do this for all the counties in my state (i figure I can use model builder for this portion).  My question is, is there an easier way to do this?  It seems that I am taking a very simple process which I would think would only take one step, but am turning it into a five step process.  Is there an easy way to say if this point is overlaying county x, append county x to a new attribute field?  I don't see any common fields to relate/join and figure this is a pretty easy task that I am just not seeing the right tool.

The organisation I work for is responsible for identifying the local health gaps and needs in the community, and one way they will be doing this is to collect a substantial amount of health and clinical data from providers in the region.

In terms of patient privacy and consent, collecting the De-identified data from these clinical systems is pretty easy and simple.  However this would only give me patient postcode to work with in terms of analysis.  

Half of the national data sets used for comparison use something called SLA/LGA's to break down statistics, which doesn't mesh up too well with postcode either (making it more difficult to benchmark accurately against the national data).

The other option is to work out the legals around privacy and consent, and collect the patient address as well.  This would be a much bigger challenge.

The database will hold a summary of clinical records for about 500,000 patients.  

My question is, do I need the exact patient address to do detailed analysis (drive time, service clusters or gaps, population health planning or even tracking flu/disease outbreaks across the city), or is using post code/zip code going to give me reasonably accurate data?

The project is focused on their urban reforestation efforts, and our liaison requested LiDAR data that he could use to gather information on the urban vegetation canopy.

After a rather profuse amount of digging and asking, I was able to get a rather large amount of raw LiDAR for my county's GIS department. It's from 2007 and it's really the only data available for our area (Eastern Washington/Spokane area). 

So now my group and I are sitting on 78gb worth of unprocessed .las files. There are two files in the dataset, one for ground and the other for multipoint. From my limited knowledge of LIDAR, it seems that we can use the ground file to generate a bare earth layer and then use the multipoint data to generate the canopy layer(s). 

Today we tried a small test using the LAS to Multipoint tool, followed by creating a terrain feature in our geodatabase. This yielded something that looked decently like LIDAR for the bare earth layer, but the canopy layer came in looking incredibly angular, and, when compared with a basemap, kind of inaccurate (it was picking up houses and buildings in addition to trees).

So, several questions:

1) Are we going about this the right way? Should we even be using this slate of tools for what we're trying to do?

2) We found the point spacing with the point file information tool. For our test ground layer we entered the point spacing at 5.22, and for our canopy layer is was 3.04. These seem somewhat high. Maybe they're contributing to lack of fidelity?

3) There seems to be another program called Fusion that also processes raw LIDAR. Is this is a better route that just bringing it in with ArcMap?

4) In the LAS to Multipoint tool, we referred to a [guide](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/lidar-analysis-forestry-10.pdf) that gave us ""classification codes"" to return specific points. For example, a ground layer would use the code 2 and the output would be ""ANY_RETURNS"". However, for canopy data, we tried entering 3, 4, 5 for low, medium and high vegetation, but we were confused as to what output to select.

The project involves taking a number of aerial photographs - with minimal constraints on the camera - and composing them into a large orthographic stitch. Note that this isn't a panorama or I'd just use OpenCV's stitching module.

I found [this paper][1] about low-cost orthorectification and it almost makes sense. I understand the basic premise: use some feature-detection algorithm to generate feature matches among all the images. On some test images I think I've generated enough to not even require hand-designated feature matches, which is great.

Initially I was going to create a homography between each image pair-wise (since each image is processed in order and there is overlap) but I realize that this is known as ""rubber-sheeting"" and is an easy way to create awful discontinuities.

The paper recommends bundle adjustment for the camera parameters of each photo. In theory, I get what that means: from some baseline, determine the rotation and translation of the camera of each image so that you can reproject the images. You generate the homography from the feature matches found earlier. In practice, I just ... don't know what the algorithm for this would be. It may be that it's late, and it may be that I just need to let it stew for a little while, but I thought I'd ask this here anyway.

If anyone can point me somewhere, that'd be great. There are an awful lot of papers pre-supposing that you have your head out of your ass but I don't have that yet.

A bit of backstory, my first coop internship was with Environment Canada, working as a developer, coding applications (in C++) to process/convert/etc satellite imagery into formats that were more usable for the analyists/science people, following this I ended up creating/working on extensions (or add-ons as ESRI calls them now) for ArcGIS, along with other various tasks. I really had no understanding of what a “Spatial Reference” or what “Symbology” was and why it is so important, at the time.

Also for the last year I have been rewriting/porting (Ugh Avenue)/updating peoples Python Scripts/Geoprocessor tools, ArcObjects/ tools and extensions. I have been doing this for free, to try and get more experience.

I tried to get into and contribute to the Open Source GIS Community; however I never really was able to get into it. However I do love the open source community, libraries such as GDAL, Mapnik, and even applications such as Geoserver / Postgresql + PostGIS are invaluable, and I have used them a fair bit for my classes/thesis/personal projects.

Skillset wise however the majority of my experience is using ArcObjects / Python / GDAL (Since working raster’s in ArcObjects/arcpy + numpy is slow and horrifying). However I do have a fairly good grasp of the open source GIS tools, especially when it comes to a lot of the Web GIS stuff. 

I somewhat feel I over specialized with ESRI, and should have instead been more focusing on the general areas of GIS. What should I be focusing on? Furthermore where do GIS Programmers really fit in?

I'm a geography student currently studying abroad in Sweden in a geomatics program. It's a bit of a strange situation, because the program I'm in is a double-degree bachelor program. I've studied broad geography (primarily physical) topics for a few years, and I've only been studying GIS for about 6-7 months.

Basically, because of my lack of experience, I don't have much direction and am having a hard time figuring out where to start. For example, I don't know much about data availability (finding good satellite images and DEMs would be lovely).

If anyone has *any* sort of suggestion, I'd appreciate it a lot. I'm planning on doing a multicriteria analysis, because I've done a few of them here during my studies. One of my interests is hydrology, but I'm just drawing blanks when it comes to tying the two together. I'd also like to focus either on something in Sweden, or western Canada (I'm from BC), if that matters.

Most of my skills are in ArcMap 9.3, but I'm able to use ArcView 3, Erdas 9.3, and Surfer. I've also got a 1 year license for ArcMap 10 with all the fancy extensions.

Any sort of guidance at all would be a huge help.

In Germany there can be some local difference in the reference systems due to states chosing their own way to store the data. To overcome this, I always used the native system to reference the maps and then projected them into the preferred reference system to work in. In my case that is UTM32N.  Back then everything working perfectly. Corine Data, which I used as reference was perfectly overlayed and based on that I did the vectorization.

However, now I reopened the project file and suddenly nothing is in place anymore. The maps are either offset on the y-axis by roughly 2000 Meter, or the maps or not scaled correctly. The cause for the second problem is that the boundaries are set wrongly now and suddenly there is a pretty large negative value as the bottom coordinate, hence the wrong scaling of the map. 

Has anyone else experienced this type of problem? Could it be due to the version change in arcgis and that reference systems are stored differently? Is there some workaround for this? 

It is roughly 100 Maps, which i do not want to re-reference again..

EDIT: I have found the solution to the problem. Maybe if anyone else is confronted with this, this might help. As it seems, ArcGIS 9.3 and ArcGIS10 are using different definitions for the reference systems, at least for GeoTIFFs, which is the case for me. For example: In 9.3. the reference shows as expected and is set the UTM32N. In ArcGIS 10.1 however, the very same GeoTIFF and the very same projection is identified as WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System. Hence there is some sort of unexplainable offset and distortion. The same goes with any other projection I had (ETRS_1987, Germany_Zone_3 etc). All of them are falsely interpretated. Thus when opening these GeoTIFFs in ArcGIS10 alongside some Vectordata stored in Geodatabases, there can be huge offsets. 

As of now, I'm converting all the maps into Geodatabase-Rasters hoping that this will fix the problem. ",,False,self,t5_2qmpb,1373468644.0,,,True,t3_1i00mr,http://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1i00mr/referenced_topographic_maps_offset_in_arcgis10/,

In the past most of my projects are related to research and analysis so all team member, including myself, is equipped with GIS analysis skill, statistic, remote sensing, cartographic/ visualization. Our programming skill is very limited around some simple python script to speed up geoprocessing in  ArcGIS.

Recently we like to expand our service into web mapping and provide analytic service on the web, creating and serving integrated ecological database for government/ NGO client. Therefore I need to recruit a few programming GIS staff. There are some issues I would like to have people opinions:

1. Do you think this is OK for a non programming manager to manage programming staffs in such a context. I know there are CEO in large IT with no programming skill but they usually manage work through middle manager. In my case this is a very small team and I will have to work directly with programmers.

2. I'm thinking of having 2-3 young (1-2 year experiences) programmers This option have advantages that they can work in team and help/stimulate each other. On the other hand they might not have enough skill, both technical and IT project management skill, and there is no one in the company for them to learn from.

3. Is it better If I chose to have just one middle level programming staff (&gt;5 years experiences) who already mastered most of the GIS programming stack and other aspect of IT project development. This people in my location is rare and I don't find one suitable yet. That's why I'm planning to go for option (2).

4. Either for (2) for (3), what's your suggestion to develop skill for programming staffs in a GIS organization.

But one of my problems is that, despite my degree, I'm not very confident in my GIS skills.

I don't know if getting a Masters is right for me, as I said before I'm not a great student and probably wouldn't get in with my GPA anyway. But one of the options I'm looking at is to take more classes for non-degree, strictly experience-gaining purposes at another local college.

Another option is to consider secondary education, since most of my non-minor classes were based on human geography and I did well on the Praxis II for social studies (although this would not be nearly as rewarding financially as GIS).

Could I please get some opinions on those options and some ideas for more options? It would really be helpful. Thank you so much!

I earned my Bachelors of Science Degree in GIS, and I have gotten absolutely NOWHERE. I have had a few interviews here and there, but nothing has come up! If anybody out there knows anyone with GIS expertise, please respond. I am desperate. And before anyone BLOWS up this post with hateful messages and all that jazz, please hear my story: 

Almost 7 months ago, I was on track to become a U.S Naval Aviator. (For all you non-Navy savvy people out there, a pilot) That was my dream ever since I was a little boy. Then, that all came to a crashing halt as soon as I decided to play a game of flag football with my buddies from school, and instantly tore my acl and meniscus. At that moment, the entire world just felt as if it stopped rotating. My dreams, were shattered. Thats not the last of my bad luck so keep reading on...

Three weeks later, I was on my way BACK from physical therapy following major reconstructive surgery (in my knee), and some lady pulls out in front of me and nearly kills me. Needless to say I am extremely lucky to be alive. The paramedics told me that had I not swerved my car to the left, I would have been instantly killed... Read on.

A week later, I am on my way back from the chiropractors office due to the car accident, and a deer runs out in the middle of the road, in the rental car I was driving because my car was completely totaled. So, after ALL this happened, my grades dropped significantly, and for the first time in almost 4 years, I was instantly taken off the Deans List due to a failed CSCI class and a D in Discrete Math. 

So, since then, I have received absolutely nothing. Again, my parents are nagging me EVERY DAY about not finding a job, and I just cannot seem to catch a break. This is driving me absolutely crazy.  Now I'm not looking for any favors here, but I all I am trying to say is that I'm just a man who is determined to become somewhat successful in his life and provide for my family I wish to start with my college sweetheart I met and began to date a half a year ago.
