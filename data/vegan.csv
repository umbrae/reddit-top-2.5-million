At first I thought he was messing with me (because he always light heartedly bugs me about being vegan) but then he explained that he found a recipe online for tofu jerky and wanted to see if it would work. He also felt bad that I never got to partake in the non vegan snacks everyone always brings in. Turns out he spent 3 hours smoking it to perfection, trying different varieties of tofu.

For the record, it was damn delicious although my coworkers decided not to partake. I just wanted to share because I have had to deal with a lot of crap over being vegan and this thoughtful gift made up for it!

Hopefully, every time we think of eating meat, we'll think instead of cholesterol/cancer/stroke and how we DON'T want them. Thanks for all the advice everyone, I'll be browsing r/vegan a ton in the next few months!

EDIT: Watching Earthlings now. Holy crap I just wanna adopt every animal on this planet. Gonna go hug my cat now.

After I tell everyone where I get my protein, and what kind of foods I eat, and what I do when I go out to restaurants, and whether or not I support PETA's tactics, they then ask my favorite question:

What made you decide to become a vegan?

I wish I had a nice simple answer, such as: To be healthier. Or: Because I dislike animals being treated so cruelly. 

But it isn't a simple answer. It's a story that has changed in the 4 year span I've been doing this. So I always split the answer in two.

-----

Why did I become a vegan? 

I was 18. I was going through the most formative years of my life; I was actually paying attention to life for the first time. In these years I realized I was an atheist, realized my values were completely backwards, and realized I had been a useless and sometimes repulsive human being during high school. In fact, I used to make fun of vegans I knew, and loved to eat tasty meat in their faces.


A lot of this changed when I started working at a veterinary hospital. I spent every day around dogs and cats, and occasionally other critters, and really learned how to communicate with them (body language). I witnessed their fear, their excitement, and eventually I participated in their death.


I realized I was not the only living creature on this planet that had emotion, something I don't think I understood beforehand. And the purity of a dog's emotion affected me profoundly. When I say purity, I mean honesty. Dogs don't hide their emotion. I don't think they can. They are creatures that completely live in the moment. 


And every time I had to help put one ""to sleep"", I was having an intense inner struggle. Being a young male in a vet hospital of all women (I was literally the only guy), there was no way I was going to let anybody think I had any emotional reaction to this. I always blew this off as ""Ehh, that's life.""


Really I was thinking about it all day, every day. When we would put a dog to sleep, I would get to sit with it, and pet it while talking gently to it. I would make eye contact with them, and so many of them would still be wagging their tails with what little life they had left. I don't mean to sound melodramatic or anything, but I was connecting with these animals in their final moments. 


 It reached critical mass, and I decided I could no longer justify eating meat to myself. It was a purely internal decision. It had nothing to do with health. Nothing to do with animal cruelty. Nothing to do with my thoughts on factory farming. I just had no excuses, and it wasn't even a decision. Much like my being an atheist, it wasn't a decision. It was a realization.


--------

Why am I a vegan? 

Being a vegan has been one of the greatest adventures of my life. I've learned so much about food. My body is healthier than it has ever been. It's been a great challenge, and I've really had to work at it. But every time I meet an animal, I can interact with it without guilt, without repressing emotions and without subconsciously fighting with myself. It's a healthier existence.


Becoming a vegan put me in a massively minority population that I had never experienced before (being a straight white male, I'm never really a minority). It forced me to open my mind to things I used to dismiss. It changed my values. It still does.


It's still a challenge, and it's a great conversation starter (and women tend to find it interesting). It's often a source of annoyance (I get so tired of people pointing at my dinner of broccoli and saying ""Huehuehue, there's meat in that!""), but it's all in good fun.


The most important reason I remain a vegan though.. it's simple. I find the complete lack of respect for life displayed by my fellow humans highly alarming. I talk to so many people who say if they ever visited a slaughterhouse, they know they would have trouble eating meat again.  So many people are having an internal struggle about it, but are too afraid to face it because they KNOW they just might have to change. 


So, most people say ""I could never do it."" They're coping out. They're telling themselves they couldn't do it, so that they never will have to. It's the same reason so many people don't vote. They say they can't make a difference, so they don't have the responsibility to do so. I can't live like that. I have too much respect for myself, and too much respect for what I have. 


And I have immense respect for life as a whole.


------

This has been a long write up, but after a 2 hour conversation with coworkers I had to get some of these thoughts out. I couldn't really share my true thoughts with them.. which is an issue all in itself.. but I need to share these with some fellow vegans.

I've had people actually shout and be physically confrontational towards me for not eating meat - why? I know that some people think that it's because of 'preachy vegans' but in all honesty, I've never actually met a 'preachy vegan' in my life. Most have learned to not actually talk about their choice. Furthermore, what is wrong with being a 'preachy vegan'? It's perfectly normal in the eyes of the general public to boast about eating bacon and such, why is it such a crime to disagree with this?

1361738991.0,214,self.vegan,195e7q,Observations from a month of eating vegan,243,29,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/195e7q/observations_from_a_month_of_eating_vegan/,"I decided to try a month of eating vegan because I thought it would be a fun challenge, and I wanted to see for my self whether the claims I had heard about the health benefits were true. I also did it because I had noticed that I had a certain amount of derision aimed at vegans (sorry), and I wanted to challenge the ideas I had about a vegan diet. I decided from the get-go to not fall into the trap of eating vegan foods that were still super unhealthy (vegan cupcakes, anyone?), so I also cut out sugar, white flour and fake meats and cheeses.

Below are my observations and results.

1. A healthy vegan diet is way easier to attain than I had assumed. It took very little effort to figure out how I would get enough protein. Additionally, I tried foods I never would have considered working with (like chia seeds, flax seeds, tempeh, and quinoa) if I hadn't been vegan and thus going beyond my normal food boundaries.

2. I tried several new recipes, and a good proportion of them are now favorites. In fact, my husband won't stop making quinoa tabbouleh.

3. Health-wise, I felt much the same as I did on my normal diet, except my acne went away and I felt slightly more energetic. We were both feeling very, very energetic when we were eating loads my husband's homemade sugarless vegan chocolates. Doesn't sound like they'd taste good, but boy did they ever. They also gave me more energy than I knew what to do with. I also never over ate to the point of discomfort, which I do more often than I'd care to admit on my usual diet.

4. This really reveals how lazy I am, but it's really nice to not have to even think about cross contamination by meat juices. Chopping every thing on the same cutting board with the same knife without having to wash it off until I'm done? Awesome.

5. Most of the flavors I associate with meat aren't actually inherent to the meat. Rather, they are the result of combining various spices and herbs with fats and cooking them. So, Thai and Indian curries which I love are still very good if you substitute tofu for the meat.

6. Oddly, I stopped craving beef, eggs, and cheese, but I still crave fish. Perhaps it's because of the great amounts b12 and omega 3 fatty acids they contain. 

7. I faced some realities about myself. Namely, though I had long parroted the statement that if some one wants to eat meat, they should be willing to kill it themselves (I grew up on a sustenance farm, and this was often said about people who would only buy their meat from the store), I've never actually been able to bring myself to kill even chickens, except out of mercy.

1363277417.0,190,self.vegan,1aah51,"Scientists: ""Fish form relationships, use tools, feel pain in exactly the same way humans do. When they are pulled out of the water, their stress hormones are exactly the same as a person drowning, except that the fish experience this agony for 20 to 30 minutes.""",224,34,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1aah51/scientists_fish_form_relationships_use_tools_feel/,"http://www.farmsanctuary.org/learn/someone-not-something/fish/

Writing in New Scientist, Professor Culum Brown explains: “In many areas, such as memory, their cognitive powers match or exceed those of ‘higher’ vertebrates, including non-human primates. Best of all, given the central place memory plays in intelligence and social structures, fish not only recognize individuals but can also keep track of complex social relationships.”

Marine biologist Sylvia Earle sums up her thoughts on fish this way: “I never eat anyone I know personally. I wouldn’t deliberately eat a grouper any more than I’d eat a cocker spaniel. They’re so good-natured, so curious. You know, fish are sensitive, they have personalities, they hurt when they’re wounded.”

Fish are “now seen as highly intelligent creatures…steeped in social intelligence…exhibiting stable cultural traditions, and co-operating to inspect predators and catch food. Recent research had shown that fish recognised individual ‘shoal mates,’ social prestige, and even tracked relationships. Scientists had also observed them using tools, building complex nests, and exhibiting long-term memories.” Fish, say the scientists, “can even be favourably compared to non-human primates.”

“Fishes exhibit a rich array of sophisticated behavior with impressive learning capabilities entirely comparable with those of mammals and other terrestrial animals.”

Professor Brown explains one observational experiment in which fish learned how to escape a trawl net after just five exposures (15 minutes) and retained the knowledge for their entire lives. They also learn to avoid fishing vessels and hooked lines

He also discussed how fish “learn by observing or interacting with other fish,” which shows that fish have culture.

And, on the issue of fish feeling pain, Brown explains that fish “feel pain in ‘exactly the same way we do.’” When they’re pulled out of the water, they experience stress such that their stress hormones are “exactly the same as a person drowning,” except that the fish experience this agony for 20 to 30 minutes.

--------

Every year [1 - 2.7 trillions of wild fish](http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates#wildestimate) and [40 - 120 billions farmed fish](http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates#farmedestimate) are tortured to death.

He starts busting up laughing and tells me i'm not a true vegan because he put parmesan cheese and chicken stock in it. He tells me that since I liked the taste of it, I'm not really a vegan.

I just had to get that off my chest.

Becoming a vegan has saved my life. For years I have been battling eating disorders and my body was definitely starting to fail me. My throat would bleed every time I coughed, my hair had turned to straw, my skin was translucent,... you get the idea. I was so stressed out that the only thing I could do to handle life was to binge-eat and purge, it wasn't even about weight loss anymore. My parents didn't know what to do with me. The tried locking up food, sitting outside the bathroom when I showered, doctors, books, and nothing worked. 

Fast forward about 4 months.

I find out that I was accepted into a very exclusive pre-college program for the Humanities and Arts. At this point I had attempted to become a vegan once before and failed. My parents were scared to let me go, but I promised them I would try not to binge and purge. While I was there I jumped right into a 100% vegan diet. I know switching from one food fixation to another doesn't solve the problem, but it has been a good way of delaying it. I haven't purged in a month! My metabolism is working, my hair grew like an inch, I don't cough up blood! I have a doctors appointment soon and I am hoping that I'll be able to see on paper if my body is starting to heal. If my body is at an ""okay"" place, then I can start therapy to help learn a healthy relationship with food. 


So, here's to eating vegan.

I know this may seem petty and said as much in my email, but I still think there's value in expressing how this comes across to their vegan and vegetarian customers. I'd like to encourage others who shop there to take a moment to share your input (politely!) too. What I wrote is below.

------

Hello,

I've been a Whole Foods customer nearly as long as I can remember. Growing up in the Bay Area, my health conscious dad grew much of our own produce and shopped at what was then 'Bread of Life' before the store was bought by Whole Foods. He continues to shop exclusively at Whole Foods today. I have many fond memories of shopping with my dad and, now in my late twenties, still love to be his 'grocery buddy' when I visit my parents.

About two years ago I went vegan, influenced by a lot of reading about the food system, food-related ethics, and nutrition. As a vegan, I love the selection at Whole Foods. There's no where else I can find nutritional yeast, daiya and other vegan cheeses, plenty of well-labeled vegan selections in the freezer and hot foods area, and even the new Beyond Meat product, which I'm glad to have had a chance to try while in Portland (and hope to see succeed and become a regular product down in Southern California!).

I mention all this to emphasize how much I appreciate the vegan options and awareness I find at Whole Foods, because I was disappointed to see a recent in-store marketing choice.

There appear to be a number of posters or other printed images with folks holding live or recently dead (in the case of fish) animals, with the word 'Earthlings' printed underneath as a promotion of the meat products at Whole Foods.

I understand Whole Foods continues to sell a large number of animal products, and accept that. However, most vegans and many non-vegans have seen or heard of the infamous advocacy film, 'Earthlings,' which features covert footage showing some of the worst atrocities of the factory farming industry.

I'm surprised that Whole Foods marketing folks, who I assumed were pretty aware of food issues and would know about that film (the most easily accessible and well-known video of its kind that I'm aware of) would choose to use the term 'Earthlings' in that context.

The first thing that greeted me at the door on my most recent visit was one such poster. For a vegan like myself, that pairing of image/word was unsettling and sort of put a pall over an otherwise uneventful shopping trip.

I know this may seem like a rather petty complaint and I know vegans compose a very small part of society and Whole Foods customers (though probably a little higher share in the latter than in the former), but I'd like you to know why this may be a poor choice for a company that has generally done an excellent job of demonstrating concern for ethical practices and an awareness of animal welfare issues.

Step 1 - Get a can of beans and rinse off the outside, top and bottom.

Step 2 - Using the can opener, open two almost half circles on the top side. Leave about 1/2 inch connected on opposite sides.

Step 3 - In the sink, flip the can over and fully open the bottom. The juice will be pouring out of the half circles in the top.

Step 4 - Rinse the beans thoroughly using the can as the strainer.

I started off by doing the Master Cleanse / lemonade diet for 10 days. Obviously I lost some water weight but the real thing it did was help me overcome my food addiction. 

While doing the cleanse I did some looking around trying to figure out what I was going to eat once it was done. I watched Forks Over Knives and was inspired to adopt a whole food plant based diet. I threw away almost all the food in my house and started fresh.

Now I'm a runner (&amp;lt;24 minute 5k), cyclist (did a century in 7.5 hours), martial artist (just got my yellow belt from an awesome karate school), roller skater (30 laps in 5 minutes yo!), and rock climber (just started at an indoor climbing gym a few weeks ago). I'm a total dopamine junky!

I'm not all the way there yet, I've still got a higher BF% than I'd like but considering all the beer I drink... well... Anyway I'm pretty proud of myself. It feels fucking amazing to be a plant powered athlete. I think if people knew what it felt like to be athletic making these sorts of life changes would come easy.

Ok, pictures: http://imgur.com/a/CRspH

Edit: I dunno if it's even worth mentioning at this point, but having never really considered non-food animal products as something I should be avoiding I've taken a bit of an inventory. I've learned that I have almost nothing that isn't vegan. I'm sure I'm wrong about some things and I'm sure there are some hidden animal products that I'm not even aware I have/use. Either way, making the change and including everything - not just what I eat - into the ""don't be animals"" category. And since I don't have a lot of stuff, *this will be easy*. 

It's been mentioned several times that this post really belongs in a different subreddit (/r/loseit and /r/plantbaseddiet). That's true but you know what - I'm glad I posted it here.

We got to talking about food and the fact that I am a vegan. First of all he said that as long as I give him a 3 day warning, ideally, he'll whip me up a vegan special meal the day I come in. He did have some light to shed on the havoc we can cause when we do NOT give some warning.

Prep is a big thing. If you show up in the middle of a service and ask for something that is less than just a simple ""salad without cheese added"" the chef now has a huge problem. He has to halt service in order to prep food he didn't expect to use (and may not have for that day), then he has to order pots and pans cleaned, then he has to cook your food and it messes the rest of the service up for the entire day.

Most chefs don't want to put out bad, bland or boring food. The ones who don't care about that probably won't care about making you vegan food to begin with. So it will grate on them just to serve you some pasta with a side salad. 

My chef friend said that provided there is warning vegan food is fun to make because you can use ingredients not usually used in other dishes. You get to be creative with fresh and fun vegetables. BUT, prep and service needs to work like a well-oiled machine, and even when it works it is stressful. 

The next time you plan a restaurant visit with friends, call the restaurant a couple of days ahead and ask them if they can provide a vegan meal. That will mean that they can purchase and prep what is needed ahead of time so that the service does not turn to chaos. I will admit I didn't understand the hatred for vegans previously due to my inexperience in how a kitchen works, now I get it.

I do believe I'll contact my friend Tuesday next week to let him know I will be coming in on Friday. He's promised me a nice rice-noodle salad. 

Stay vegan, and stay cool my friends. Hopefully this can lead to some awesome birthday dinners out at restaurants where the chef has had a couple of days warning and has taken on the challenge of cooking something new with gusto!",,False,self,t5_2qhpm,False,,,True,t3_1evg74,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1evg74/made_friends_with_a_chef_these_past_weeks_he_gave/,

Let me explain.


I'm a BBQ and beer sort of guy. I drive a Mack truck for a living. I work with other BBQ and beer sorts of guys. This is the atmosphere I've chosen for myself. Among all these truckers and warehouse workers, however, I'm the only vegan.


I am by NO MEANS a militant vegan. I don't imagine many of you are, either (but who knows). So you probably know how it is. You quietly go about eating your [favorite vegan dish] on your lunch break, or you're filling out paperwork and you get invited to a BBQ, or someone hands you a coffee with cream in it. Eventually it's gonna come up, is all I'm saying. The discussion.


""Sorry, man, can't have it. Thanks, though.""

""Why?""

""It's got cream in it.""

""So?""

""I'm vegan.""

Cue the wide eyes, dropping the plate on the floor, the ""needle scraping off the record"" sound effect, etc etc etc.

""You're WHAT?""


And so it begins.


Listen, like I said above, I work with truckers and warehouse workers for a company that primarily services the oilfield. A real ""tough dude"" sort of environment, no joke. We all take the piss out of each other, so anyone who gets really bothered by that sort of thing ends up not fitting in too well. We don't have many guys who don't fit in and last very long, it's just the way the job goes. I'm okay with that. Beats the shit out of cubicle work and the pay keeps my wife and I very comfortable.


It all comes at once when they find out, though, doesn't it? The questions, the ""facts"", the assertions, as if my refusal to partake in animal products was somehow a threat to the lifestyle they choose to lead. 


""Oh, I could **NEVER** go without my pulled pork honey sauce barbecue beef dip cheese sausage mozzarella hot dog chicken strips!"" 

""How do you get protein without meat? That's ridiculous."" 

""Your bones need calcium from milk."" 

""It's not like the cow is killed inhumanely!""


Okay, so I get it, they've never felt as if they've had a reason to look into exactly where their food comes from. I didn't, either! A pulled pork sandwich with a big ol' side of ignorance is delicious, don't get me wrong. I just find it morally repugnant now, no biggie.


You can't say those things to them, though. In spite of the fact that it's THEY who challenge MY decision. Aw hell naw. I start dropping the facthammer all up in that conversation and all of a sudden **I'm** the one soapboxing! I'll counter every myth and mistake they make with cold, hard facts, and in the end they'll just laugh and shake their heads.


""Enjoy your salad, man. I need my meat. I'd go crazy without it.""


And then they complain that they can't lose weight, can't get their blood pressure down, can't keep a handle on their diabetes, or can't take a proper shit. I get that not all of these things are exclusively caused by meat and dairy, but statistics show they contribute a hell of a lot.


They don't need meat, I think to myself. They need help, but I'll be fucked if I'm going to be the one to do it. You wanna laugh in the face of facts and cling to your beliefs? Cool. I'd be an idiot if I thought that my decision was right for everyone, but you don't get it both ways. Call me out on my reasoning all you want, I love a good discussion and I won't get even the tiniest bit mad unless, when faced with the fact of the matter, you're just going to disregard it anyway. What's the point?


I do my work, I get paid, I go home, and I enjoy what I eat with a clean conscience and a clean bill of health. If you're not down with that, if that threatens you, maybe I'm not the one with the problem.

1. My region has been hit by a lot of snowstorms, and I've had intermittent power outages the past couple weeks. But I don't have any meat, cheese milk, or eggs in the refrigerator to spoil, when we don't have power. I just have veggies, almond milk, and stuff that won't be hurt too badly by a day without power. 

2. Pooping is so much better. I mean, like incredibly better. I'm coming directly from a high meat-eating diet, so maybe it's the drastic change that's doing it, but it's now so much more enjoyable to poop. Haha.

3. I've learned more about what is typically in food by reading tons of food labels. It seems important to know what I'm putting in my body, and now I have a much better grasp on that than I ever have.

1335644595.0,145,self.vegan,sx790,AskReddit hates vegans. ,201,56,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/sx790/askreddit_hates_vegans/,"I posted several links about how 60 percent of adults are lactose intolerant and links to meat consumption and colon cancer in an AskReddit post about veganism today. I got downvoted so much just for posting studies. One guy even took it so far that he felt the need to call me idiotic because i pointed out that humans are th only species that consumes other species milk, and needs to cook meat in order to digest it. Why do meat eaters become so offended when I reference studies done on consuming animal products and bad health? Also, why do people get offended when animal welfare is brought up at all?

Edit: Wow, thanks for the feedback y'all! Unexpected and much appreciated.

Edit 2: i deleted the original comments because i was sick of the nasty replies and getting downvoted. here is what was said.

""That is some pretty stupid logic, wow. We have no natural instincts to kill and eat meat? I don't think a kid would have the natural instinct of picking an apple, for that matter. We teach each other, not act solely on instinct.

Basically, saying it's ""not natural"" is extremely wrong. Humans didn't develop to what we are by being vegans. We ate meat. This meat helped our development into what we are.

(my comment) 'also, if we were naturally omniverous, our food wouldn't have to be cooked to 155 degrees before eating. what other natural omnivore cooks their food so they don't get sick?'

None. What other creatures are using a computer right now?

do your research before trying to argue. It just makes you sound idiotic.""

In which i replied with something along the lines of ""i don't know why you're insulting me, i didnt insult anybody. i think using a computer and digesting raw meat are two different things. i dont know why you're calling me an idiot based on research i'm presenting to you""

I promise I did not make it up. What the hell would be the point?

[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/swszu/vegans_if_you_found_out_plants_could_feel_pain/) was the askreddit post. 

**final** edit: thank you for all the feedback everybody. I knew we had the ability to digest raw meat, i meant we have to cook it to 155 to kill bacteria that grows on it to keep us safe from potential sickness. I definitely made a mistake there and that could explain some of the responses i got, but not all!

One of my coworkers has been selling Girl Scout Cookies all week. I had just assumed I wouldn't be able to buy any this year, now that I am vegan. But after a quick perusal of the ingredients lists and then the Girl Scouts website, I was shocked to find out that some of my favorite Girl Scout Cookies ARE vegan - sort of. 


Turns out, the following Girl Scout cookies are, in fact, vegan:



Thin Mints

Thanks-A-Lots

Lemonades

Peanut Butter Patties



As a formerly self-proclaimed Girl Scout Cookie junkie, you can imagine how thrilled I was at this news. However, there's a catch: those cookies are only vegan half the time.


Turns out that the cookies listen above are all vegan ONLY if they’re sold by a Scout who does not also sell Tagalong cookies. Each Girl Scout council chooses one of two commercial bakeries, and the bakery that makes Tagalongs (Little Brownie) uses milk in all of their cookies, while the other bakery (ABC Bakers) does not.


How can you be sure that yours are vegan? Just check the box! If the cookies are vegan, they will say ""ABC BAKERS/INTERBAKE FOODS LLC"" under the ingredients list, accompanied with the blue ABC logo.


I wasn't sure if this was common knowledge or not, but thought I would share anyway since it's Girl Scout season again. If you want to check for yourself, the ABC Bakers website clearly notes which cookies are vegan and includes a full ingredient list of each cookie:

Background: As a child my parents did not monitor my diet, and I was obese all the way up to graduating from college at 280 lbs 5'9"" tall. I then got healthier with absurd degrees of exercise and a high protein, animal based diet. I'm afraid that my absurdly unhealthy past is putting me at a high risk for an early demise, or minimum live in a constant state of exhaustion and setting a poor example of healthy living for my children.

Problem: I don't eat vegetables, and I can almost say that I don't even know what most of them taste like. It is almost a mental phobia for me, and I'm afraid I won't be able to eat these foods (like a gag reflex problem).

Granted, my fear of death is pushing me to challenge this fear and conquer it. But any advice or encouragement from anyone (especially those who can relate), would be greatly appreciated.

I love books, and I'm reading ""The Engine 2 Diet"" book right now, any other recommendation or related resources are welcomed.

Thanks!

For omnis to have meat, they need to ask for it and pay extra (like +$2.00 for chicken or whatever). 

People are just more likely to choose the default, especially when it's cheaper. It makes the ""default"" seem more normal, and out of laziness, more likely to be chosen.

One of which consumes the traditional 'vegan' lifestyle. We're all familiar with the hippie, the skinny white girl, the baggy-clothed probably-not-having-a-job douche that cannot wait to tell you about how you're fucking up in your own life. It's simple, clear, and understood. This first group is the poster girl-boy-man-woman whatever of the vegan culture; it's all the same. Make no mistake though- these people are passionate, powerful, meaningful, cute, deliberate, and quite intentional in their intent which is admirable at the very least. I envy all of these people at their very core.


There's a reason I'm going on about this, I promise.


The other camp is me and others like myself. I work to be those in which I have previously mentioned, although I fall short in my own mind. -- Vegans hated me growing up; through high school and through college. And I hated vegans. We did not agree, we were not the same, they were stupid and needing something to care about. I was smart and necessary in my actions. I knew what it was to be a human and they were pretending to be something else. I knew how to kill. I knew how to skin, and I knew how to provide when needed. I was a man then, and I thought I knew what that meant.


Two hunts in my life changed how I viewed life. At the time I had no idea, but they would prove to be the most opposite possible. The first of these hunts was a crisp morning with fog-laden tree lines, sharp dew on the leaves, cold, firm logs, and an icy-pure air you could only breathe in short puffs. This was heaven. I hiked in many miles in near silence, my rifle packed in, to find my morning spot. And I did. I found a large log among an isolated field, and in that field, at least 100 elk waiting, eating, and living together. Such an incredible sight.


I watched, sighted my rifle, and scoped out many elk. I watched their faces through my scope, their eating, their emotions; and I waited. I saw dirt on their fur, I saw how they looked at each other. I could see them blink, their body language even. -- I decided to eat my breakfast with them, by my log, in peace and without a single shot. And then I went home. It was peaceful.


The other hunting trip is quite different. I wanted a rabbit for dinner. And I found one.


I shot him as he ran from his ground hole. This was his home. It was not a good shot- he was alive as I walked up on him. Trying to kick he just flustered himself on the dirt. I had hit his back leg. He just kicked dirt and grass around; he tried to get away as hard as he could, I could see he wanted nothing else more. Picking him up in my left hand, laying there in the palm of my hand, he looked right at me. He knew what I was, he knew what my eyes were, he communicated with me visually. He knew I could breathe, he knew I was an animal just like him, and he knew I bested him. He stared right at me- he asked for mercy. I covered his face with my right hand and twisted his neck, ringing him lifeless.


Since then I've viewed all other animals as equals and have been completely vegan. I don't have to preach to the choir here, you all know what I'm talking about. I've been vegan since and have no intentions of going back. I've seen the factory farm footage and it blows my mind, all these things we do and it's encapsulated under a roof of nutrition, ease, right, taste, or privilege. It's garbage and we know it. I was preached it just like many of you in this subreddit; and I made poor decisions, just like many of you in this subreddit.


If you see a poor redneck bastard like myself, try not to assume I'm a meat-eater -- the sooner we assume vegan culture as a norm, the sooner others will accept it as a norm.

How many pounds of each you can you get from 1 acre of farmland.,148,25,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1jidb3/tofu_vs_beef_quantified_how_many_pounds_of_each/,"I did some googling &amp; math and this is what I found (with citations).  I'd appreciate your thoughts, corrections, or comments.

Let's assume the protein in 1 pound of tofu is roughly equivalent to the protein in 1 pound of beef (I know they're not exactly equal, but close enough for this exercise)

Organic tofu takes the *most* land to produce and [one pound of organic tofu requires .00017 of an acre to produce](http://tofuscarbonfootprint.weebly.com/carbon-calculations.html), meaning that you can get ~5800lbs of tofu out of 1 acre of soybeans.

Wiki Answers says that you can get [30-50 bushels of wheat (@ 60lbs per bushel)](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_average_yield_of_wheat_per_acre#page3)  out 1 acre.  If we assume it's good year and we produced 50 bushels, that's 3000lbs of wheat per acre.  Divide by 13lbs ([it takes ~13lbs of wheat to get 1 pound of beef](http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/meat-wastes-natural-resources.aspx)) to get 230lbs of beef per acre of wheat (in a good year).

In summary:

* You can get over 5000lbs of tofu from one acre of soy

* Or you can get ~230lbs of beef out of one acre of wheat

This is why people say we can put a dent in world hunger by going vegan.... each acre of farmland would produce almost 20x more protein than it currently is.",,False,self,t5_2qhpm,False,,,True,t3_1jidb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1jidb3/tofu_vs_beef_quantified_how_many_pounds_of_each/,

I know veganism is a lifestyle choice but most omnivores like me often look at the diet aspect of it first. I'm a very curious person who likes to try things just to see what it's like. So I just went vegan for a month. I had no intentions to stay vegan (I'm honest with you, I probably don't care that much and have respect for your lifestyle choices), but I wanted to cut down my meat and dairy consumption for health reasons. 

In this month I discovered a lot of products and recipes I've never tried before that are awesome. Of course not everything is healthy, but at least healthier because of mostly unsaturated fats and mostly no cholesterol. I really like seitan - textured soy proteins aren't bad too. I tried almost every plant based milk on the market but they aren't an alternative for milk imho. Some are tasty (rice-coconut milk, chocolate oat milk) but doesn't work that well with coffee and cornflakes. Plain plant-based milks aren't for me I guess...

The reason I write this post is that every omnivore that checks this subreddit (like me) should try it for a month just to question their eating habits. I bought way more fruits &amp; veggies than any other month, I now read labels more carefully (why the hell is there lactose and cheese powder in chili crisps?) and I now know a lot of products that I would've never tried before that I really enjoy even instead of meat. 

I was lucky to get sponsored a bit by my local vegan supermarket because I make YouTube videos and made some videos about this experiment (in german though) so I could try a lot of products but even without it it isn't that much more expensive than an omni diet - at least when you do most of it yourself. Some products are incredibly expensive, but that's understandable. 

The hardest thing about this experiment was finding vegan groceries in ""normal"" stores (besides vegetables of course). My regular supermarket doesn't even had one spread to put on bread that was vegan. Milk, cheese and meat everywhere. 

It was a very interesting experience and I'm pretty sure my meat/dairy consumption is a lot smaller now. Vegan is probably not for everybody but if more people would just try this it would make a impact. I'm sure. Vegan products should be easier available for everybody to enjoy. 

Thanks for reading.

I used to pronounce it like this as well and then one day started pronouncing it ""day-yuh.""  I'm not sure why I altered my pronunciation but for a while I've been wondering who is right and who is wrong or if we're all wrong.  

I sent an email to the company and got this reply, which I now pass onto you guys and I hope you'll continue to spread the knowledge:

The name is pronounced “day – ah”, and arose from both a play on the word dairy and the Sanskirt definition for the word Dayaa meaning “loving, kindness, and compassion”.

Warm Regards,

Today, the counter is 15,584.

That's about 30 subscribers per day.  If we assume an exponential growth model, that's a 1.02% daily growth, i.e. the number of readers should double in one year.
If we assume a linear model, the number of readers will ""only"" increase by 70%.

Of course these are very very coarse statistics, so if anyone has other datapoints (such as old screenshots) I'd be interested.

EDIT: Ergoim kindly provided [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/GCGPn.jpg) of the available statistics.  Thanks!

Got this response today. 

Just wanted to share that writing to companies does make a difference. Don't just sit on your hands waiting for someone else to do what should be done. Get out there and fucking do something!


****Dear thegratefulshred,

We, at Volcom, are extremely sorry to have offended anyone with the “EAT VEGANS” t-shirt. The graphic was meant to be a joke but we fully understand how it could be taken and want to be clear in saying that we support all lifestyle choices. We have a diverse team of designers working in the artloft (some vegan) and in no way meant any harm or detriment to anyone. We realize we have a responsibility to uphold integrity with our messages and apologize deeply for any offense taken in this case. We have since taken down this t shirt from our website. We will be much more conscientious with our graphics in the future.

Thanks,
VOLCOM****

I have been vegan for 3 years (woot) and can honestly tell you that I have never once tried to guilt trip anybody into doing anything other than eating the way they want. None of my friends do either! The only time I talk about being vegan is when I'm asked about it specifically. If someone offers me meat, I just say ""no thank you"" and move on. There's no need to expound my views on veganism. I feel that many people see it as a critique of their diet even when you aren't actively engaging them or doing anything other than eating what you please.

Here's a story that happened to me.

I was checking out at the grocery store last Sunday and I hadn't been there in a while, so I bought a lot. I had tons of veggies, tons of tofu, and a few things of tofurky, veganaise, etc. etc. As the woman is ringing me up, she makes the comment ""wow, you must not eat meat, huh?"" I said, ""no, I do not."" She then says, ""I could never do that. I love my steak too much. I love animals, but I need my meat. I couldn't eat like a rabbit."" I said, ""well, whatever makes you happy."" I feel that these are the stories behind the ""arrogant"" vegan myth, because she's the type of person who will go tell someone I was arrogant for *not* buying any meat. It's happened so many times before.

It's strange, because a lot of claims about vegans being hostile are the exact opposite. People ask us about it, then claim we are radically obnoxious for engaging and answering their questions. I can't tell you many times people ask if I am vegetarian, I say yes, and they come back with ""NO WAY I AM NOT GIVING UP MEAT."" Great, I didn't ask you to do that.

Deontological veganism: eating animal products is wrong, full stop, so I don't do it.

Consequentialist veganism: I abstain from animal products to generate (insert outcome: sustainability/health/less suffering/other).

""Eating healthy"", for example, is consequentialist. As long as you meet a strong pattern of acceptable nutrition, occasional anomalies are OK. Someone who cycles regularly for 340/365 days of the year and eats a nutritionally immaculate diet would be unaffected by, say, thanksgiving binges.

I get the impression that for a lot of people, veganism is black and white. That is, you either use animal products or you don't. If you're given meat/eggs/dairy, you decline it, and if you use anything animal you're ""not vegan.""

This seems too religious and absolutist to me. If someone eats the standard vegan diet (quinoa, tempeh, etc.) for 345 out of the 365 days of the year (or a little under 95% of the year), are they ""vegan""? Are they ""vegetarian""? They've eaten vegan more than someone who started at 100% and remained that way for 100 days. They are ""more"" vegan, by absolute # of days eating vegan, than someone who is 100% vegan for 100 days.

Even though he's a ""troll"", Maddox's hypothetical about a stray piece of chicken in your salad poses an interesting scenario: you were given an accidental piece of chicken. Assume your body can handle it. Do you throw the piece of chicken away? If you believe that even one piece of meat makes you not-vegan, then you might. But if you take a consequentialist stance, one piece of chicken won't matter in the scheme of things. 99.99% of your diet is vegan. You're eating that way to live a general independence from animal products, not an absolute independence.

Anthony Bourdain poses a similar scenario with the ""Grandma Rule"":

&gt; The notion that before you even set out to go to Thailand, you say, 'I'm not interested,' or you're unwilling to try things that people take so personally and are so proud of and so generous with, I don't understand that, and I think it's rude. You're at Grandma's house, you eat what Grandma serves you.""

Not that anyone is likely to be in this scenario, but ""I won't ever have to deal with that problem"" doesn't mean the problem ceases to be a problem. If you're in a foreign country and are served meat by, say, a tribal leader, what do you do?

The ""grandma rule"" basically says that any benefit in adhering to a black-and-white principle of eat/not-eat is outweighed by the downsides of declining food in such a gracious and welcoming scenario. Not only do you look like an asshole, you tar the image of whatever diet you're advocating in the first place. You could obey the ""grandma rule"" for those few days where you're in someone's good company, and eat vegan for 95% of the year. Your total contribution would still be good.

I think everyone is consequentialist when it comes down to it, because if you were in a situation of starvation you'd eat whatever you could. It would be absurd to think of this as a violation of principles because you have those principles to work toward a general goal of independence from animal products, among other things, and some situations exist where your dietary practices won't influence that independence. In the tribal leader scenario that Bourdain mentions for his Grandma Rule, they couldn't possibly be thinking about sustainability. They don't have anything to sustain.

Word classifications tend to be black-and-white though, so it's natural to feel like anything you do to move you out of that definition is something you shouldn't be doing.

1362440065.0,98,self.vegan,19o4hg,"Instead of meatless mondays... Why not meat mondays? (Not trolling, I promise!) ",121,23,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/19o4hg/instead_of_meatless_mondays_why_not_meat_mondays/,"SO, I keep hearing about meatless mondays. People tend to talk about it pretty positively, it's a feel-good environmentally friendly thing to do. And I'm all for that, better some effort than none at all.

But how many times have you met people genuinely interested in veganism who say they can't make the change because they're so terrified of losing that one token beloved food that happens to be from animal products?

Meatless monday is a nice idea, but it's kind of half-hearted and to me feels a little bit like ""too little, too late."" But if you were encouraging a questioning potential new vegan to make the change, what about suggesting something like ""go vegan every day except monday!"" (or whatever day of the week) Not eating meat 6/7 days is way better than 1/7, and it gives people with cold feet an opportunity to have a ""cheat"" day without having to say goodbye to their favorite foods right away. Plus, when they're already eating vegan 6/7 days, it will help build the habit of avoiding animal products and be way easier to make the full change when they feel ready.

I feel like the ""all or nothing"" mentality can often push people away who might sooner come around with a little more wiggle room as they make their transition, and the sooner they start, the sooner they're minimizing and reducing their use of animal products. I think the majority of us here agree that completely eliminating animal products from our consumption is the way to go, but isn't something like this much better than someone continuing to live as a questioning omni for a few more months, or years, while they try to make a final switch?

I've had a few coworkers express real interest in my lifestyle choice, but when I suggest they give it a try, there's that instant balk. ""Oh, I could never stop eating x"" or ""But how do you live without y? I'm addicted!"" But they seemed way more receptive when I suggested they try not to eat x or y except on one day, once a week.

Downvotes are for comments that add nothing to the conversation, or are spam. They are not for people who disagree with you or are who not vegan. 

Consider an omnivore who shows up at r/vegan looking for a rational and open-minded discussion of vegan ideas. He doesn't want to troll and he's not being offensive, he simply disagrees and wants to debate. This person should be upvoted for encouraging a good discussion. Instead, like [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/eop91/isnt_it_best_to_eat_a_moderate_amount_of_meat_and/), he will be downvoted to hell.

We make ourselves seem inaccessible and cult-like when we do not welcome rational debate of vegan ideas. Veganism usually makes sense, it can stand against strong opposition and hold its own. Downvoting people who disagree just makes us seem weak and unable to articulate ourselves.

Please, reconsider your use of downvotes. If someone posts a thread or a comment that you disagree with, carefully read their arguments. If they aren't trolling or spamming, let them be.

BUT BE HEALTHY!,108,20,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/v5gpm/my_lazy_raw_diet_a_must_for_guys_who_just_want_to/,"I just thought I would share my approach. I am a guy. I am lazy. I hate cleaning dishes, clothes, house, yard work....all are big NOPES. I am lucky i have a wife who tolerates me. Oh did I mention I didn't exercise as well.

I have always been a lazy eater as well. I just eat what is fast and there. At one point I was 250.... 

I have like all of you had an awakening to the things I eat. But had a hard time eating the healthy stuff...vegetables.....or taking the time to prepare the dishes. I tried...but would fudge. I figured out a lazy way for me to exist and thought I would share it. Maybe it would work for you guys

Keep a strainer in the sink. Pile in fruits and vegtables. Carrots, peaches, oranges, apples, kale, celery, cherries...basically anything you can eat raw from a tree or a garden. Also keep some jars of raw seeds and nuts close by. I have raw almonds, walnuts, chashews, pita, chia..etc

Then start washing. As you wash....eat a bite of peach. Then a bit of horrible tasting crap....like kale. Then throw some nuts in your mouth. Then eat some blueberries....and then eat some carrot. Then throw nuts in your mouth. 

Before you know it you are full...and you didn't spend anytime cooking or making dirty dishes. I have been eating my breakfast, lunch, and dinner this way for a year and I am a greek god. 

I also started exercising.  I put on shoes and just run out the front door. When I get tired I stop running and come back home. 

Hopefully this helps the lazy like me. 
Edit: 2

To answer a private message. I am 165 and pure lazy rock. 

Edit 3

It takes me about 3 min to 5 min I guess to prep and finish eating. I stand at sink while i do it. I do not sit. And as I wash I eat. Keeping the food wet really helps it taste fresh and allows me to eat faster. I am free to move on with my life. I do this about 5 times a day. 

I also shop once a week at Sprouts and don't buy any premade food or anything that I can't just eat raw. I have cut my bills for food by 75%.

A few days ago I decided to finally give up one of the stupidest habits a person could have. I also decided (I was in a quitting mood, I guess) to give up animal food products, as I've never been very comfortable with eating meat or dairy for a number of reasons.

Things are going well so far: no nicotine and no animal stuff. I've realized, though, that these foods *are* addictive. I've found that the cravings I have for milk and chicken are the *exact* same as my cravings for a cigarette.

I've also realized that support is really, really helpful. Practically everyone I know supports my quitting smoking, but hardly anybody supports my dietary choice. The most supportive responses I get are ""But why don't you just do vegetarian instead of vegan?"" I do not have a single vegan in my social circles (at least not that I know of).

The best support for my smoking has come from [r/stopsmoking](http://reddit.com/r/stopsmoking). It's a fantastic community, and it's nice to see all the other people that are quitting tobacco at the same time I am. It's such a relief to see that others are struggling with the same urges and inner conflict that I am.

My suggestion is this: add badges similar to the badges in [r/stopsmoking](http://reddit.com/r/stopsmoking). Becoming vegan is *not* easy for many, many people, just as quitting smoking is not easy. In fact, most people don't even *try* to quit because they admit that they could ""never"" do it. To a person who has eaten meat his/her whole life, going vegan seems impossible--even crazy--even though it extends your life span, gives you more energy, etc etc.

So, anyway. People *can* do it, but most people need help. They need a little nudge, a little accountability, and a little support.

What do you guys think? It may be a terrible idea, but I thought it might be a great way for new folks to reach out to more experienced members of the community.

EDIT: Awesome! It sounds like we may be on to something. I guess I'll wait til tomorrow and message some of the mods then. Or if you're a mod and you're reading this, could you let me know in the comments if this will be possible?

Note that this list is not comprehensive, although I tried my best with limited time. I made it by hand and skipped some foods using my own discretion, so your favorite protein food may be missing. 

All data is from [the USDA's food database](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/). You may see some inconsistencies in it; I don't think it's something I can fix.

Disclaimer - this list was made using an app that I built, the one linked above, because I couldn't find a decent food comparison tool.

**Edit:** as /u/naturalveg pointed out, this post could perpetuate our uninformed obsession with protein. The USDA recommends 10% of your calories come from protein, and all 75 of these foods are above this threshold. **When looking at the data, it's important to see how plentiful protein is in a plant-based diet, and also how most plants are a ""complete protein"".** Protein maximization should not be a dietary goal unless you have a very specific and scientifically sound reason to do so.

**TL;DR: For every one person a cow feeds, you could feed 64 people!**

0. Topic
0. Reason for topic
0. Results
0. Method: Assumptions, Sources, and Sources of Error

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Topic:**

How accurate is the Vegetarian claim that eating meat makes poor use of land in terms of the amount of food livestock provide to humans?

Cattle will be used to examine this question.

------------------------------------------------------

**Reason for topic:**

People eat meat because meat is tasty and nutritious. However, vegetarians feel that the disadvantages of eating meat outweigh the benefits. One reason given is that raising billions of cows every year is an inefficient use of farmland, fuel, and other resources.

How accurate is this argument, at least in terms of farmland?

--------------------------------------------------

**Results:**

For every one person that is fed on beef, **64** people could have been fed.

This result seems reasonable: Every pound of feed eaten by a cow is used to fuel the billions of biological functions of the animal, only some of which involve putting meat on the body. Thus, most of the calories consumed by the cow (about 98%) never make it to our mouths.

(Edit: Read [comment about milk production] (http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/16b76u/if_a_slaughter_cow_was_never_raised_how_many_more/c7uidxm), which, if correct, gives a better ratio of about 1/7 for dairy cows instead of the 1/64 for slaughter cows.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Method: Assumptions, Sources, and Sources of Error:**

**Assumptions:**

* The sources are accurate enough to give a ballpark estimate.
* Land used to grow cattle-feed can be repurposed to grow food for humans that is of a similar caloric density.
    * In the US, I have heard that cattle-feed is often low-quality food, such as corn that cannot be eaten by humans. However, rice, lentils, beans, wheat, and other staples are more calorie-dense than corn. It may be safe to assume that land yields more calories when used to grow these human staples, rather than when used to grow cattle-feed.
    * If it is true that land could yield more calories when growing human staples, the result of ""9 times more people"" may be much higher in reality. However, this assumption would require much more research, so it will be ignored it for the sake of simplicity.

**Sources:**

You can see my calculations and sources in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AiHTUI0FErsndGlsSGl2MEdaU2hHQndGcC15ejhid2c&amp;output=html).

The websites where I got my sources are listed in the ""Sources"" column.

**Sources of Error:**

* My sources come from Google searches, so the data is more than likely not the most accurate. However, my analysis is only a rough estimation, so I feel safe in assuming the data is ""accurate enough"".
* My methods of analysis may be incorrect.
* As mentioned earlier, it might be true that farmland could be used to grow more calorie-dense food is grown in lieu of cattle-feed. If true, the result of ""64 times more people"" may be much higher in reality.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you found this post as interesting to read as I did to research. Thank you. :)

Also, forgive me for not citing sources throughout this post. :p

---------------------------------------------------------------
(Edit: Formatting and wording.)

(Edit: Changed calories cows eat to about 90,000 per day. This seriously influenced the results, but it makes the discussion about milk make more sense. If you find an error, please point it out.)

So, out of 7 moderators there are 3 who could be considered active in this Subreddit (I might call that stretching it even, as the recent comments seemed to be very rare) and 4 who haven't been active in months. I would really like to see /r/vegan become more of a community, and maybe get a makeover. However, when I messaged the mods previously I've gotten no responses.

They have become a destructive enterprise that murders dogs and cats, praises animal killers like slaughterhouse designer Temple Grandin, exploits and degrades women in disgraceful (and ineffective) naked campaigns, and believes that revolutions can be won in the boardroom instead of realising that revolutions are only won in the classroom, on the street corner or in the jailhouse!

From an interview with [The Abolitionist](http://www.care2.com/c2c/share/detail/227470).

I've been absolutely disgusted by how people look at, for example, a heart-wrenching, tear-jerking, sob story article about a dog who was abused then take to social media networks to preach about how terrible it is that any human would do such a thing to an animal.

These posts are inevitably followed by comments fueled by anger, written by those who wish the worst-of-the-worst punishment for that wretched human who would DARE lay a hurtful hand on the body of an innocent dog.

And if there's a picture of the poor thing? Hold your fire, you won't need it- the gates of hell are breaking loose with flames of their own.


All that is fine to me- I'll admit I'm one of those people who loathes seeing animal abuse. The problem? Those self righteous people fighting for doggy rights [on Facebook statuses] will sit down to a cheeseburger for dinner, and perhaps some scrambled eggs and a glass of milk for breakfast the next morning.

Is it still animal abuse if you never saw its face? Is it your fault an animal was abused if you never witnessed the abuse?

1371855446.0,78,self.vegan,1gtpmw,In vitro meat (synthetic meat) is the most important goal for the vegan/animal rights movement.,127,49,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1gtpmw/in_vitro_meat_synthetic_meat_is_the_most/,"I think we should take it upon ourselves to 1) raise awareness about this,  and 2) **donate to its development ourselves** / **lobby for it to be funded**.

 * Fact: Not everyone is going to give up meat by appealing to their morality. Lots of people are too interested in the taste of meat. **Period**.

*We need to make the farming of animals obsolete*. 

 The lobbying could emphasise the environmental benefits of reducing animal farming, and the freeing-up of farm land (among other things).  It appeals to capitalists because eventually it will be possible to produce in vitro meat at a lower cost than murdered animal meat.

 I think this is our top priority, and the best chance we have of saving as many animals as possible from suffering.

 P.S.

 It would be nice if we could eradicate the very idea of eating someone's body from society, but that's very far away, and not supporting this is pure self-indulgence.

I'm a health and wellness manager at a small Co-op on the west coast, and had been approached by this company (Simply Slick) about bringing in their line of personal lubricant (lube).  It seemed great, cruelty free, certified vegan, no animal testing, and certified by vegan.org! I was concerned because it was advertised as anti-microbial, which I thought might disturb the natural flora of a woman's downstairs area.

I ask a few questions and they send me... wait for it... 
...a 25 page report of rabbit testing of their product.

Long story short, I told them they needed to change their packaging ASAP.  They didn't and made some lame excuses about how animal testing is required by the FDA for lube, and dodged the questions.

So now the report is in the hands of PETA, and vegan.org (the certifying company) has their lawyers sending cease and desist letters their way. 

Does anyone know any other outlets for this information?  I know the lube is stocked in several dozen health store around the country and I just really want to get this information out there.

I can post the pdf of the report if anyone can let me know a good site to do so on.

Regardless of whether or not you care about animal testing the fact that this company was using those key terms simply to vie for a demographic of the health food market is fucking despicable.
