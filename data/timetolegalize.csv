1333454791.0,178,self.timetolegalize,rr26p,I think the movement needs a new direction,190,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/rr26p/i_think_the_movement_needs_a_new_direction/,"Take a good long look at the average voter in America. They're probably 40 something, blue collar, experiencing the hardships of the financial crisis, too involved in family and work to be concerned with legalizing cannabis. The extremists (on both sides) dilute the conversation to the point that the average Joe stops caring. Even I, a proud cannabis activist, get burned out by hearing the world revolving around cannabis and the long laundry list of pro/con arguments. 

The point I'm trying to get here is that people vote on emotion. People walk into the voting booth based on what they know, but probably do not understand. I think one of the best things to do as far as gaining notoriety and gaining support for the legalization of cannabis is that our message needs to speak to this person, the blue-collared average Joe from Anywhere, USA. 

My proposal is simple, but I believe it's effective for several reasons (which I will divulge later.)

My proposal is to link the average person to the War on Drugs. Show them how they are directly being affected by the prohibition of cannabis, and show them a scenario in which a person can become victims or can benefit from the repeal of prohibition. Spouting off facts, numbers, dollar signs, images of crime and violence, peaceful hippies or the dreadlocked college student is not going to help the cause and the reason is because most people can't relate to that.

So, on to the proposal. Three separate videos which target various age groups, ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic status.

1. A visibly ill woman, maybe mid 30's, lays in a hospital bed, surrounded by family, and writhing in pain. She's hooked to IV's and she is coughing and crying. The doctor and nurse in the hallway have a small dialogue to the effect of ""I've given her the maximum dosage of pain medication, but the chemotherapy is making her so nauseous that she can't keep anything down."" 

The commercial ends with a fade out to one small, but striking factoid. Cannabis has been shown to decrease the negative side effects of chemotherapy.

2. A group of college students are partying excessively, drinking and peer pressuring each other to drink more. One young man says that he can't drink anymore, but is handed more drinks and is getting visibly ill from the alcohol. The young man gets sick and goes to lay down on a couch that isn't being occupied. Fade to morning, paramedics surround the young man, trying to wake him up by pushing drugs, but he has died from alcohol intoxication.

Fade out fact: Alcohol consumption leads to 80,000 deaths per year, but cannabis use has zero recorded deaths.

3. *This idea came to me after learning that a friend of my family was implicated in a sting operation. The man, mayor of a small town, and his wife receive a package in the mail with unknown contents. Seconds later, cops and FBI rush their door pointing guns at their head, and fire two shots to silence the family dogs by killing them.* 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Com08ILgQ for reference.

Basically a simulation of this exact scenario. A small family living a quaint happy life are suddenly thrown into the midst of a drug scandal which destroys their family life, their home, and their family pets. 

Fade out fact: Innocent people become victims of the War on Drugs. This could be your house, your family.

It's late and I've been thinking about this post for several days now...and I know it's far from perfect, but the reason I've seen some commercials work and other commercials fail is because they do not appeal to the emotions of the everyday person. There's a reason why I can't relate with a commercial for diamond wedding rings or designer suits or anything that is advertised for $19.95 after midnight on television. Striking the emotional core of a person opens the mind to reconsider or ponder about the message. This is why people who don't give two shits about animals donate to the ASPCA, or people who don't really feel like being global activists, donate to the christian childrens fund. These people have mastered the manipulation of human emotion and directly funnel it to get across a message. I think we can use this same tactic to promote our cause.",,False,self,t5_2tr4p,False,,,True,t3_rr26p,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/rr26p/i_think_the_movement_needs_a_new_direction/,

---

Dear TroutM4n,

For the first time in five years, the U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on an amendment to prevent the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. [We need you to call your member of Congress and tell him or her to support this amendment.](http://control.mpp.org/site/R?i=-I_BNHJBztVchS4i9j6RJg)

At the start of the Obama administration, it appeared as if there would be a new approach to medical marijuana by the federal government. Unfortunately, that new approach was short-lived, and it can now be said that Pres. Obama is even worse than Pres. George W. Bush on this issue. Obama’s Department of Justice is relentlessly attacking state-approved medical marijuana providers.

Medical marijuana champions in Congress have decided it is time to send the president a message. The Rohrabacher-Hinchey-Farr amendment will be proposed during the debate on the FY2013 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill on the floor of the House. The vote could happen as early as today!

[Please visit our action page to look up your member of Congress and use the short script we have provided to send a message encouraging a “yes” vote on this amendment.](http://control.mpp.org/site/R?i=s5L0429oyxwopjrs7OuVFw) These calls really do help.

Thank you for taking action!

So, if you wanted to make it legal, during your campaign, would you refer to it as ""booze""?

""Booze"" conjures up images of wife beaters, and drunk college frat kids. This is exactly what ""marijuana"" conjures up in the minds of those who don't partake, that is, stoner stereotypes, drug wars, etc.

1333065711.0,139,self.timetolegalize,rk3ih,Let's turn 20 days of tolerance to 20 days of activism.,149,10,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/rk3ih/lets_turn_20_days_of_tolerance_to_20_days_of/,"Recently I've heard of an idea on here about starting a 20 day tolerance break on March 31 (as to avoid the confusion of April fools and to actually make it 20 day tolerance). While I have subscribed to this idea, I am afraid that such a long tolerance break will bore me to tears. Hopefully I'm not the only one facing this issue otherwise my proposal will not likely be heard or responded to.

Now, like many ents, I deeply desire the legalization of marijuana for recreational use but lack the time, diligence, and motivation to actually do anything about it. Luckily, this 20 days of tolerance would give me exactly enough time to initiate at least some level of interest in the issue in my local community.

So here is my plan:

* Ask the [/r/trees](/r/trees)  community for brain storming help.

We could put our heads together to compile a list of reasons marijuana should be legalized. I know 420 reasons is unrealistic, but setting that goal will hopefully spark good conversation and good reasons for legalization. And who knows? Maybe we can come up with 420 unique reasons to legalize.

* List the reasons from most convincing to least convincing.

To be fair, some reasons are better than others. Simply putting ""because it is freaking awesome"" will not likely convince the dean of my university, a judge, or a police officer. The ultimate goal is to prove that it should be legal not to shoot the cause in the foot. Therefore only the most convincing reasons will be used for the protest.

* Finally, I will write these reasons (in chalk) in public areas where people will see on April 19.

""No man is worth his salt who is not ready at all times to risk his well-being, to risk his body, to risk his life, in a great cause.""
--Theodore Roosevelt

I don't know if writing in chalk in public areas is vandalism or not (though I highly doubt that it is) but that is not something that concerns me. What does concern me is that the government can tell us what we can and cannot put into our bodies and then has the audacity to put us in prison if we don't agree. This is why on April 19 (in the dead of night) hours before 4/20, I will go around my university writing the reasons that we come up with around the most frequented areas.

No longer will I stay silent. I hope that you ents feel the same way too. If all goes well, I will take a picture of every reason I post around my campus and post it on [/r/trees](/r/trees)  for you all. Feel free to do something similar (or the exact same, I don't care). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading

News is based on it, politics thrives on it, and corporations sell it. So lets use a bit of 'fear' to instill a greater understanding of what's actually happening.

For instance, why not start a video like this:

&gt;What if there was a single way for police to make money off of sending people to jail. For firms to make money denying people medicine. For government officials to pocket millions of dollars just to keep quiet.  For prisons to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on housing non-violent offenders for years because they posed a threat to big business. For violent gangs to prosper and grow underground empires. For government to impede on the rights of the populous. A way to dramatically increase the deficit and ruin millions of lives.

&gt;There is. It's called prohibition.

.

.

EDIT: I just had another idea. How about a viral campaign in an 'alternate universe' where marijuana is currently LEGAL, and there are forces out there trying to make it ILLEGAL. We could have testimonials (real or fake, this is of course, an alternate universe) where people are being devastated by police cracking down on a widely used and appreciated substance. Old people being arrested for using marijuana to alleviate them from pain. Farmers being bullied by government agents trying to get them to stop growing their CASH crop. And lobbyists are hiring 'hitmen' to go around and ruin peoples' gardens for growing marijuana. All because big mega-corps cant make money off of something that grows freely and naturally in the ground.

I am not affiliated with the MPP, but I've been a modest recurring contributor and will gladly answer any question about them within my capacity as someone who is not affiliated with them.

If you honestly want to make a difference and have a few dollars to spare I think this is a great venue. 

If not there are many other ways to contribute to the legalization efforts, either with financial or time contribution. If anything please post your question and I'll do what I can to answer after class.

Thank you.

Let me explain...",124,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3vdc/idea_for_mission_statement_emphasis_placed_on/,"I feel that if we go at this with our strongest argument being of a pro-health benefits stance, we'll lose before we've started. Americans aren't worried about someone with MS smoking weed to battle chronic pain. They don't care that a chemo patient could smoke weed to help with nausea. While these are both examples of the MANY health/medical benefits to marijuana, these benefits do not help the country as a whole. Being the self-involved, isolationist creatures that we are, we want to know how this can serve everyone. Old people, young people, rich, poor, dumb, smart, white, black...

What helps everyone?

Taxing it.

The statistics are out there. I can't copy them onto here because I'm posting via phone. You've all seen the statistics, the numbers, the monetary benefits to this. 

THIS needs to be the primary focus of this battle.

We aren't doing this so everyone has the right to toke up whenever they want. We aren't doing this so it will be easier to find weed. We are doing this because we are patriots who care about our country and we see this as a viable, realistic option to helping this great nation return to it's position as front runner of the modern world.

We also owe it to our North American neighbors, Mexico, to aid them in combating the greatest war on narcotics currently being fought in the world. By decriminalizing and regulating marijuana within our own country, the war on narcotics would be virtually ended in Mexico. The violence and warfare in their country does not affect just them. As North Americans, it affects us all.

EDIT: I have really enjoyed reading these responses. Although many of you do not agree on my position here (and vice-versa), I think we can all agree that creating a dialogue about the main mission of this effort and creating cohesion within the movement is a great way to legitimize our effort.

Unfortunately, the two main presidential candidates' platforms regarding drugs AS OF RIGHT NOW are essentially the same, and during the upcoming presidential debates we will likely not see any serious debate about U.S. drug laws or reform. Especially with 3 states (Oregon, Washington, and Colorado) with cannabis legalization amendments on the ballot in November, the more public dialogue we can get around cannabis law reform the better.

There is one candidate (currently [polling at 5.3% nationally](http://garyjohnsongrassrootsblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/new-jz-analytics-poll-gary-johnson-at.html)) that is a staunch proponent for cannabis law reform. His name is Gary Johnson.

* Here's Gary Johnson's ad on ending the drug war:

* Gary Johnson's spot for an A64 ad: [http://youtu.be/fxvWEbhsZNI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxvWEbhsZNI)

If you want to help out his campaign, [here's the link](http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/) to his campaign website, where he is currently raising money to promote his platform and advance in the polls. As he will be on the ballot in all 50 states thanks to the diligent work of the Libertarian party, one can say he is as serious as a 3rd party candidate can get.

Even if you don't intend on voting for him in the general, your [donation](http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/), like on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/govgaryjohnson?ref=ts) and/or follow on [twitter](https://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson) can do a lot to help him get his message out there and advance in the polls.

**INB4 he will never win the general election**. This isn't about him winning, it's about getting his message out.

You guys may or may not know me as a regular poster here on r/timetolegalize (with such posts as the QR code thingymabob), and so I thought I'd introduce myself.

About a week or so ago, I was offered a position for being a mod of this community. I took the position because I thought it would allow me to do more to help out, not because I want to be able to silence anyone's ideas, and not because I want to profit from the wonderful movement we're trying to build here. I just want to be and do the most that I can.

Unfortunately - I'm in my own sort of pickle. I've got finals for school now through the 4th, and I'm leaving for training in the Atlantic from May 4th to July 2nd. I can't avoid it, and it has to be done. BUT, when I get back, I've got a few months off from school and can really kick things into full gear. Which I plan on doing.

Now, I've been gone for the past 2-3 days preparing myself for being gone for two months, saying goodbye to family, and tying off my own loose ends. Since I've come back, I've noticed that there has been a sort of uproar about the mods in this community, and certain other members of this community. The fact that people have quit/left and that things have somewhat slowed down has been sinking in as I read more and more about it, and I'm pretty sure I understand the dilemma of there being no formal plan constructed *and* enforced by the mods (including me). 

*So what do* ***I*** *plan to do?* I plan on listening to this community, nurturing her, adding my own input - but never putting it above the input of others, giving ideas that the community largely supports the recognition that they deserve, implementing and enforcing the best plan and call to action that we (as a community) can devise, and to be a fair, just, and trustworthy moderator. I am transparent and more than willing to prove myself to this community. 

But alas - I am in a pickle. Chances are, for the next two months (especially from May 8th through July 2nd) you wont hear too much from me. I will ~~try to~~ be active until then, and especially after that time. Just give me a chance, if I should fail then by all means I do not deserve to be a moderator helping to guide this community towards the legalization of Marijuana. 

Now, from what I've seen so far, the mods before me have collected quite a bit of data on videos, contacts, ideas, organizations, politicians, etc. - your posts aren't being wasted and thrown out. Material is being collected, and I suppose we've just got to find out what to do with it all. (the other mod's might have a better idea when it comes to that - I've only been exposed to the documents for a short while) Also, in my time as mod I've made a few suggestions as to how we can get the ball rolling again - one of which is to start some sort of non-profit in order to actually fund our **projects and videos**. *Note: spending project money on packing bowls is not on the agenda.* Also, personally I'd like to see us spice up the subreddit a little bit, but I'll have to figure out how to do that (or find someone who knows how) first. 

Now, if any of you have any questions for me (anything at all!) then feel free to ask. ",,False,self,t5_2tr4p,False,,,True,t3_t06qy,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/t06qy/hello_rtimetolegalize_im_the_newly_appointed_mod/,moderator

We need to set up a strong effort in this state to influence public opinion.  

The bill is fairly well supported and some numbers are showing 48% favored 45% opposed, so we only have to capture 3% of the voter and swing them to allow a majority, and pass the law.  I will be working this fall campaigning through QR codes on a few college campuses, and I strongly recommend the same.


I'm happy some people latched onto this.
I found this QR code on this subreddit in the comments a while back and posted around my campus, which got a lot of buzz.  It's not a perfect infographic but I agree with 90% of it and it works to at least raise awareness in a state where people are more open to the idea.

1332541395.0,92,self.timetolegalize,ramlq,[OFFICIAL] Things confirmed for the video (3/23),94,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/ramlq/official_things_confirmed_for_the_video_323/,"The following is what will definitely be in the video. Some can be up for minor change, but for the most part these things are confirmed parts of the video.

**INTRODUCTION**

The introduction will have an interview with [KingNick](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/r3i7k/lets_do_something_about_this/c42no3x). Nick will tell his story (at least a portion of it) without addressing the term cannabis (or it's synonyms). 

He will explain his plight in losing access to the one medication that worked. Then a reveal will be made, telling the viewer that the medication is cannabis.

Currently we are working with someone in Florida who has volunteered to help us film. More updates to come on that front later.

**ENDING SUGGESTIONS**

At the end of the video, the viewer will be wondering how to help. This is where we tell them the four things they can currently do:

* **Share the video.** The more people that can see what is going on, the more likely discussion will happen about ending prohibition.
* **Vote.** Available on the website will be a list of all the current state measures. We will show what each measure will do so that viewers can make an informed decision.
* **Contact representatives.** If the representatives are all contacted about this video, discussion will begin in our government. We have to demand that ending prohibition is a topic to be discussed (at minimum). Another page on our website will be dedicated to showing how to contact your representative in all forms. 
* **Make a personal video.** Viewers will also be encouraged to make a personal video detailing how prohibition has affected them. This video won't be nearly long enough for all the stories I'm hearing, so in order to get these stories out there we will be selecting a video a day to publish on our website. (We may have a tagline for people to use similar to the ""It gets better"" campaign).

These things are only specifics though. There are other things we plan on having in the video, but they have not been solidified enough to include here yet. 

More updates to come! Keep up the great work everyone!",,False,self,t5_2tr4p,False,,,True,t3_ramlq,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/ramlq/official_things_confirmed_for_the_video_323/,moderator

Please try to keep questions short-n-sweet! 

**Mission statement:** 50% of the US population wants to legalize the use of cannabis. Using video and social media we aim to inform the other 50%, who have been misinformed for near 80 years. We want them to no longer endorse the actions of prohibition.

**Vision statement:** End Prohibition.

**Next steps:**

* Find a solid [theme and format](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3tji/editing_central_theme_and_format/). One that will bring the entire video together: colors, fonts, video formats, etc.
* Get an [outline](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3u6h/editing_the_outline/) together that shows every part of the video.
* Write a script.
* Record voice-over
* Set aside different sections for different [video editors](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3nt9/video_editors_report_here/) to splice together using the original theme/format.
* Cut these together and send to someone to [score](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3qog/editing_musicscore/).
* Finally, a review of the final cut and we publish the video to share.

**Date of publishing:** State elections happen in November. If we publish, around October we can get discussion flowing for voting season.

**Goals:**

* Share the video everywhere. Share on twitter, facebook, etc. Our goal is to have 50 million views in one week.
* Have each US representative contacted by viewers.
* Make a personal video about how prohibition affects you.

**Guiding principles:**

* We will not advocate the current illegal use of any prohibited substance.
* Presidential candidates are not to be endorsed or opposed.
* Fundraising is not for us. This is 100% volunteer driven.
* Limit the use of the color green.
* We will not be represented by the stereotypes of ""dirty hippies"" (dreads, tie-dye, etc.)
* Cannabis-leaves cannot be present in the video.
* Any music that evokes feelings of rebellion (rock, punk, metal, etc.) will not be used.
* Celebrities categorized with “stoners” cannot be shown.
* Smoke or references to smoke will not be made.

(Some of these are difficult, but it's necessary to reach our target audience. Be creative!)

**What can I do in the meantime?**

* Continue posting relevant videos to the subreddit
* Discuss all aspects of the project in relevant posts (linked in the sidebar)
* Specifically, discuss how the video will look in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3tji/editing_central_theme_and_format/) and how it will be organized in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r3u6h/editing_the_outline/).

**Most important**:

* Always remember who the target audience tends to be. Hint: they aren't tree-loving liberals.

1333813974.0,89,self.timetolegalize,rxy3w,Medical Marijuana - My concerns,98,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/rxy3w/medical_marijuana_my_concerns/,"As the medical marijuana movement moves across the US, I am starting to be a bit concerned. Why? Not because I have continued to buy into the misinformation and outright lies that influenced my decisions over a decade ago, but because I believe the efforts are missing the mark and could be ill advised.

When the talk of medical marijuana first started, or at least when it first came to my attention, I kind of rolled my eyes and thought to myself, ""yeah, right."" That is the very first problem this movement has to overcome. Although the misinformation on the prohibition side is evident to anyone willing to research the topic in the slightest, the uninformed masses still believe what they learned in DARE classes or heard on the news. I personally found it interesting when the false stories of marijuana causing men's breasts to enlarge and their testicles to shrink hit the news. If we can't scare them away with false medical concerns, let's go after their sexuality. Priceless, humorous, and unfortunately effective in many cases. Sheople aren't led by the nose like common farm animals... however, they are easily led by their genitalia.

With the ever increasing number of medical conditions that are aided by medical marijuana, which again could be completely accurate, the general public might lose interest in supporting the issue if they think it is all a ruse to get high. This is the same problem that occurs if doctors, as we've heard stories about in California, will just prescribe medical marijuana for any condition. Cancer... prescription. AIDS... prescription. Anxiety... prescription. Depression... prescription. Sleeplessness... prescription. Rash... prescription. Hangnail... prescription. Perception is truth. If it is perceived that it is all a ruse, we're done. If medical marijuana is passed, then those who get it passed and benefit from it's use had damn well better police their own. If not, the backlash will be severe and we can forget about ever seeing it changed again in our lifetime.

Instead of incrementalization and the perception of being deceptive to gain what we ultimately want... you know... politics as usual... why don't we take the high road (pun intended) and actually go for what we seek. Outright legalization. Seriously. What is the problem? 

From the justice departments website, ""Marijuana is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Schedule I drugs are classified as having a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision."" This statement, and the resulting classification of marijuana, is an outright lie. Fourteen states have approved MEDICAL marijuana... the substance the US government is claiming has NO currently accepted medical use. Anyone who is capable of reading, and has done so at all, KNOWS it has medical benefits. The argument, if any, is how many ailments can it be used to treat. That is what the pharmaceutical companies fear the most... they spend millions of dollars to buy our politicians to make sure marijuana remains illegal... to protect their bottom line. It is not physically addictive, as are caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. It does have medical uses... many and studies have indicated it might even show some cancer fighting properties. AND it is non-lethal ... physically impossible to consume a lethal dose. You can't even say that about aspirin.

So... what is the problem? You have a naturally occuring plant that has a vast number of industrial uses from paper, to textiles, to biofuels... which might have even reduced our dependency on oil and prevented the current gulf coast problem had our government not decided to ban all uses of the dreaded evil plant in the 1930's with the Marijuana Tax Act. It is non-lethal. The misinformation that has inundated our culture for the past 70 years has slowly been chipped away and proven false time and time again, but yet the sheople do not demand a change. Seems ""feeling good"" is bad.

Can that be possible? Feeling good is bad? I don't know... you tell me. What do we think of someone who goes out drinking, or smoking weed, and having a good time? They could be the most repsonsible person on the planet, but we don't want them enjoying themselves. Sex? BAD! Sex is only for married folk and only to propogate the species... yeah, right. These taboos have so much influence over our lives that if we have a presidential candidate that admits to smoking pot, he has to minimalize it by lying... ""I didn't inhale."" Yeah right, next you'll tell us you didn't have sex with that woman. Because we all know sex is bad... abstinence first, right?

Please excuse my language for a moment... I really wanted to write a piece without foul language... GROW THE FUCK UP! The people who tell you drinking is bad... sex is bad... guns are bad... they are the ones getting drunk, banging someone half their age, and would put a cap in your ass for exposing them, if they could get away with it. Newsflash sheople... feeling good is not bad. The peasantry is allowed to feel good just like the ruling class. Is it sinking in yet? YOU ARE BEING CONTROLLED.

It is time to take a stand and stop the bullshit. Join NORML. If you don't want your name on any list for fear of repercussions, send them a contribution. Write letters to your elected officials. Don't sit on your hands as the SWAT team storms another house and shoots a household pet in our area. Raise holy hell the next time a school in your district is locked down so local law enforcement can strike fear into our children by running a drug dog through their school. Demand reform of asset forfeiture laws to prevent an economic benefit to law enforcement... they are in the business of protecting the public, not seizing assets from private citizens.

and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.

THEN THEY CAME for the trade unionists,

THEN THEY CAME for me

Many would agree that prohibition isn't working. There are several arguments in favor of legalization. So how do we make this happen? Considering the percentage of people in favor of legalization, why are we, the people, not given an opportunity to vote on the issue? Perhaps it's just my lack of understanding of the Federal Government of the US, but this opportunity must be difficult to have considering that even though such a high percentage of views on cannabis legality differs from current legal status in the United States, the issue continues to be brushed off.

Voting on the issue would be a fairly simple solution to decide on whether or not cannabis should be legal.

It's clear that we all want to make it legal. It's clear that it's logical to make it legal; the facts are clearly on our side. What's harder to communicate to those who still haven't decided if they're pro or anti legalisation (the real audience here) is why. In order to convince our audience, we need to tell them why.

So for me, why do I support legalisation? In a word, compassion. I believe in making the word a better place. I believe in taking action to reduce the suffering of all people. Cannabis legalisation is one of the easiest ways to do this. It is a safe, naturally available medicine that treats a variety of medical issues. I also believe in a system of justice that is fair, and the [legal consequences](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/szrdv/i_watched_a_man_get_four_years_in_jail_for_a/) of the use of cannabis is completely outrageous. 

[I saw this TED talk the other day, and it really got me thinking.](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html) Good leaders motivate their audience from a core emotional level, and that's what we need to not forget about.

We cannot forget why, and we need to make our ""why"" well known. We're not just armed with facts, we're armed with motivation. We are compassionate. We extend our compassion to the millions of patients who could benefit from the use of medical cannabis. We extend our compassion to those imprisoned for committing a non-violent crime with no victim. When people see our desire to help others is real, they will take us seriously, instead of dismissing us as stoners looking for an excuse to make it legal. 

Always let them know why!

Things need to be discussed as a group before any action can be taken, and we have a good group of knowledgeable people working on this cause. If your idea isn't recognised as a good one, then you just have to accept it and move on. We do need everyone to be involved at some level, but there is a need for professionalism and tact behaviour at the top level.

The logo situation has also fallen folly to the ""I don't like your idea so i think i should make my own"" mentality. [This](http://i.imgur.com/6R6kv.png) is a great design that was immediately recognised as powerful and effective, but recent attempts such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/r7f6h/official_logo/c43ki8g) have garnered support from others.

Obviously, design choices are going to polarise the community somewhat, but from a marketing standpoint, the first one is so much more flexible and applicable to our target audience **(This is the really important part guys. We aren't advertising to ourselves, we need to put ourselves in the mindset of the average citizen who still believes that cannabis is a harmful substance)**.

Finally, i'd like to return to YouDontKnowZebra's post about 420 being a 'day of action', or the idea of ""Legalise 2012"". Regardless of a associations either to stoner culture with 420, or parallels drawn to kony 2012, we should not be focusing on a day or a year because this campaign is not date specific. Whilst we all want an end to prohibition, we don't want or campaign to seem like a 'flash in the pan' gimmick. We are not in a life or death rush, and realisticly, this campaign will take longer than to the end of the year to make a difference. 

Don't get me wrong though, it's amazing how many people are getting behind this, but please do keep in mind that this will require lots of commitment and dedication to get the end result we want.

So it's time to settle and clear some things about it.

We were originally completely opposed to the use of the color green. And there is a good reason for it. When green is seen in connection to a pro-legalization argument, it is stereotyped as ""stoner-culture"" by our target audience.

However, green in the logo would be ok if it is minimal. [This version](http://i.imgur.com/6R6kv.png) of LesterLomax's design would be just ok, but [this design](http://i.imgur.com/Qrf5s.jpg) takes it too far.

The green/leaf driven logos CAN be used, but not in the video. Let me explain how:

After the video is created, it will be posted to our own website. This website will have four tabs:

* Video (where the video will be shown; the main page)
* Contact your rep (info on how to contact your rep)
* Voting (a list of current measures)
* **Spread the word** (a page filled with official logos, slogans, and posters)

The Spread the Word page will have logos, images, slogans, twitter hashtags, posters, and more that viewers can use to spread the word. This is where we can use more green and leaves.

But we cannot use it in the majority of the video. The leaves will not be shown and green must be limited in use. A logo (with green) in the video would be ok as long as it is subtle.

My name is Tom Angell, and I'm the co-founder of a new project called Marijuana Majority. Today, I'm proud to announce the launch of our website -- and I hope you'll take a look.

http://www.MarijuanaMajority.com

For the past 12 years, I've worked with organizations like Students for Sensible Drug Policy and Law Enforcement Against Prohibition to bring attention to the drug war's astounding failure and bring about changes to our policies. This is my greatest passion, and I have to tell you: **we've never been closer to winning.**

When I began work on this issue as a college student 12 years ago, support was scarce. Although I met many individuals who recognized that our policies were broken, the topic was treated as some sort of third-rail by politicians, and members of the media scarcely discussed it. Even good friends of mine would be reluctant to talk about the issue, for fear of being marginalized and laughed at as some kind of ""stoner.""

Today, **so much has changed**, due in large part to the democratization of information online. This is especially true when it comes to marijuana reform. In a Gallup poll from last October, a **majority of Americans** said that they support legalizing marijuana -- the first time this has ever happened. And two weeks from now three states -- Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- have initiatives on the ballot to regulate and tax marijuana. Polls show we have an excellent chance of winning in at least one of these states, **making history by legalizing marijuana** for the first time ever.

I believe we're approaching a **tipping point**, where more and more prominent voices are speaking out -- and are universally receiving praise for doing so. What was once taboo is now a **mainstream, majority position**.

This is the reason we created Marijuana Majority. On http://www.MarijuanaMajority.com, we’ve collected in one place quotes and videos from politicians, religious leaders, celebrities, medical professionals, business leaders and members of law enforcement who think it’s time to end the war on marijuana.

More than just merely tracking the large number of prominent people and organizations that are already a part of the Marijuana Majority, though, we’re going to be regularly **asking for your help** to grow the majority and make this movement even more powerful.

By making the content easily sharable on Facebook and Twitter, we’ve made it possible for you to help spread the word that **most sensible people agree it is time to change the marijuana laws**. Just think about how much more likely your dad or your aunt would be to tell their co-workers that they support legalizing marijuana if only they knew that they could say, “It's probably the only thing that *Glenn Beck* and *Jon Stewart* agree on, and even *Morgan Freeman* is speaking out!”

We’ve also built the site in a way that makes it more likely that even more influential celebrities and opinion leaders will add their voices to the marijuana debate. Whenever you visit the site, you’ll see we’ve selected a handful of prominent people who we believe are likely to support changing marijuana laws but just haven’t been given the opportunity to say so publicly yet. We’ve made it incredibly easy for you to tweet pre-written messages to these people with just a couple of clicks. When you and enough other supporters take action and inundate these celebrities and elected officials with tweet after tweet about marijuana policy, they are sure to take note.

These are just a few of the ways that Marijuana Majority intends to influence the emerging debate about our failed marijuana laws and how to fix them.

Please take some time to read quotes and watch videos. But don’t stop there. Make sure to share the content with your social networks and tweet to some celebrities. And if you can afford it, please **show your support by making a financial contribution** to help us spread this winning message as far and wide as possible.

With your help, we can ensure more people understand that ending our ineffective and harmful marijuana prohibition laws not only makes perfect policy sense, but is a **completely mainstream** position that enjoys broad support.

1365593784.0,64,self.timetolegalize,1c220a,The IL legislature will be voting on MMJ this week. So I sent this to 89 members of the IL house and senate (all the email addresses I could find for them published on the web). Feel free to use it in your letter campaigns.,79,15,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/1c220a/the_il_legislature_will_be_voting_on_mmj_this/,"The full letter was too long to post here (15,000 character limit). So here's the part of the letter where I summarize and conclude, I think it's quite powerful. If you like it, feel free to use this list. 

Let’s review the facts:

1.    Cannabis contains many cannabinoids; THC is only one of these. THC is already FDA approved as a schedule III medication. Ironically the only cannabinoid people fear is this legal one. The other cannabinoids have medical benefits far beyond the scope of mere THC, and people deserve access to them.

2.    The FDA cannot regulate cannabis. It does not review unpatentable plants, as per their guidelines. Cannabis is an herb and therefore considered a “dietary supplement” by the FDA.

3.    Smoking is not required. Vaporization, eating, and tinctures are preferred methods of consumption. Smoking marijuana, however, does not cause lung cancer. And as shown by UCLA’s Dr. Donald Tashkin in 2006, it may actually offer a slight protective effect against lung cancer compared to non-smokers.

4.    The body produces endocannabinoids, the “brains own marijuana” as Scientific American referred to them. Cannabinoids tap into this important homeostatic regulation system in the human body, and this explains why cannabinoids work so well in treating so many conditions that non-cannabinoid medicines cannot.

5.    The word “marijuana” was a Mexican slang word adopted to make cannabis and hemp sound foreign. Marijuana was first outlawed on the Mexican border and in the South. Even though racism is unacceptable today, we still use the word officially today and it should be a reminder. Cannabis wasn’t banned for scientific reasons, but rather for racist reasons. The word “marijuana” is even revealing of drug war racism today – a new Jim Crow.

6.    Cannabis is objectively, scientifically safer than alcohol, tobacco, and most pharmaceutical drugs. In 1988, the DEA’s administrative law judge Francis Young called cannabis “the safest therapeutically active substance known to man.” However, we know the DEA ignores all contrary evidence. With a clear financial incentive to maintain the status quo, the DEA continues to claim cannabis isn't medicine because there isn’t enough science, while simultaneously restricting research to the NIDA supply. Police are not doctors or scientists, and should not be making medical decisions.

7.    Alcohol prohibition was a failure, and marijuana prohibition has failed similarly. States are beginning the inevitable process of legalization, one by one. With $16.5 trillion in national debt, and with yearly budget deficits, this change cannot come soon enough. Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron estimates that marijuana legalization is worth $85.6 billion per year in savings and new tax revenue.

8.    Legalizing marijuana does not increase use according to the data in MMJ states and in other countries where it is legal for recreational purposes. This is because a legal market gets rid of the forbidden-fruit effect. MMJ states have also seen decreases, not increases, in traffic fatalities, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, as well as a lower suicide rate.

9.    Medical cannabis improves quality of life for terminally ill and seriously ill patients for which conventional medicines offer little or mediocre relief. Cannabinoids kill cancer cells, and medical cannabis can save lives.


In Illinois, HB1 will be the strictest MMJ law in the United States. National support for the MMJ issue is at over 81%. On Monday, Maryland passed their medical cannabis bill 42-4 in the Senate and will become the 19th state to legalize MMJ. The first medical marijuana dispensary is opening its doors in Washington D.C. this month. There is no reason to let Illinois fall behind on this important issue.

Perhaps one day you, a colleague, a friend or family member may benefit from this legislation. Terminal illness can befall anyone at any time, and nobody wants to imagine the government making life even harder when on the brink of death. Just ask L.A. City Councilman Bill Rosendahl. After a cancer diagnosis he began using medical cannabis. He recently said “life is now worth living” thanks to his medical cannabis regimen.

Our laws should be based on science, reason, and compassion. Please support HB1, the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act.

Thank you, and I look forward to reading your response.

Sincerely,

(Hillzone)

It's incredibly important to make sure that when the bill to legalize marijuana finally comes up on the federal level (and state levels as well), that it is **NOT allowing corporations to exclusively grow and distribute cannabis.** We need to make sure that the right to grow and share cannabis is granted to citizens of legal age.

Allow me to explain my reasoning.  If large corporate agricultural industries are growing and distributing marijuana on a large-scale level, it's obvious that local growers will have no chance at competing with the low prices that the corporations will be able to sell at.  Local medicinal growers will no longer be able to sell to dispensaries for medicinal patients like myself, and before we know it, the only marijuana we have access to is cheap, pesticide-ridden, and low quality.  I wouldn't be surprised if eventually this led to nicotine or some other addictive chemicals being added to the genetics of the plants.

We must make sure that even if the ""exclusive"" right to grow marijuana isn't given to large businesses, that the every-day citizen still reserves the right to grow and share his/her own product.  We can not get ahead of ourselves and let marijuana fall victim to corporate greed.  People like myself are still going to need quality medicine to relieve our symptoms.

Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR: We need to make sure that when legislation appears to legalize cannabis, that it grants the right to citizens of legal age to grow and distribute their own cannabis.**

GLOBAL CANNABIS MARCH Focus on Failed ‘Drug War’

The rally in Union Square starts at 2 PM with acclaimed artists DJ Logic and Immortal Thechnique from Occupy the Album. The event begins in Washington Square at noon on Saturday; participants will leave at 1:30 to walk to Union Square.
Speakers include Joanne Naughton of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), ‘Ganja Granny’ Arlene Williams, a cancer survivor and medical-marijuana advocate, and Harlem community activist Jazz Hayden whose “Copwatch” videos document ‘stop and frisk’ incidents in his neighborhood. It is also sponsored by WBAI 99.5 FM and emceed by hosts of WBAI’s Occupational Hazards, Joey Gay and John Murdock.
Although New York City was the epicenter of the ‘Global Cannibis March’ decades ago, more recently other cities – such as Toronto and London – have seen tens of thousands in the streets. This year 158 cities worldwide are planning marches.
The Yippie Museum Café at 9 Bleecker St. in the East Village has a long history as a counterculture headquarters and has recently been renovated and re-energized.

This demographic of people have the most to gain from cannabis from a medical standpoint.  They are also the largest sufferers of depression and could greatly benefit from the uplifting aspect of cannabis.  Furthermore, they vote in every election and are generally taken very seriously by politicians and the media alike.  

They are already very organized and have a large amount of disposable income.  They have lobbyists and they have organizations (like the AARP) that already fight on their behalf.  

And finally, these people have proven themselves as a generation that gets things done.  They fought in Korea and in Vietnam.  The economy ran on their backs for 40 years.  From my own experience, I can see that it pains them to see our country lose it's liberty.  The people I have spoken to see how corporations (many of which they worked for for their whole careers) have become abusive and corrupt.  They themselves are being abused by pharmaceutical companies.  

I truly believe that a large percentage of this demographic would actually be very sympathetic to ending cannabis prohibition if they were approached with respect and taught the truth about cannabis in a non-threatening way.

* ""Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man."" - DEA Administrative Law Judge, Francis Young

* Hemp produces more biomass per acre than any plant on Earth, making it the perfect energy crop.

* Non-violent drug offenders make up roughly 25% of America's prisons. Cost to state/local governments - $15,000,000,000/year.

* According to the ONDCP, 60% of drug cartel's money comes from the sale of cannabis.

* The War on Drugs is 40+ years old, we've spent $1,000,000,000,000+, and usage rates remain the same.

So here's my idea for how we kick this reform cause into overdrive: start a twitter campaign to pummel these groups and individuals with the facts with the hashtag: [#themoreyouknow](http://againstlineofdance.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/themoreyouknow.jpg) (pic is just for funsies).

We've got a pretty good aggregation of materials here on timetolegalize, so now it's about getting them out there and people reading them. Generating site traffic for publications writing pro-cannabis reform pieces also creates a positive feedback loop whereby they want to write more pieces about this issue, so it's a win/win.

Here are some people and groups that could use some facts:

* **Both US presidential candidates** ([@MittRomney](https://twitter.com/MittRomney/) and [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/))
* **The White House** [[@whitehouse](https://twitter.com/whitehouse/)]
* **The ""No on 64"" campaign** [[@VoteNoOn64](https://twitter.com/VoteNoOn64)] (""We are coalition [sic] working together to defeat the legalization of marijuana in Colorado"")
* **Laura Chapin** [[@LauraChapin](https://twitter.com/laurachapin)] (spokesperson for the ""No on 64"" campaign. Fun fact: her twitter avatar is a woman smoking a cigarette)
* **Office of National Drug Control Policy** [[@ONDCP](https://twitter.com/ONDCP)] (""ONDCP advises the President on drug-control issues, coordinates drug-control activities and related funding across the Federal government"")
* **National Institute on Drug Abuse** [[@NIDAnews](https://twitter.com/NIDAnews)] (This government group has severely politicized the cannabis research process)
* **NJ Governor Chris Christie** [[@GovChristie](https://twitter.com/GovChristie)] (vetoed marijuana decriminalization legislation)
* **Conservative Party of New York** [[@cpnys](https://twitter.com/cpnys))] (responsible for derailing the cannabis decriminalization bill in the New York house that Andrew Cuomo wanted)

We are not going to resign over banning him under previous accounts, the bans were justified. 

To clarify, the role of the mods is to co-ordinate the filming, and to stop spam or off topic posts, nothing more. We are not trying to force ideals down your throat, but there are limitations to what is possible. do not take ""we cant do that"" to mean, ""your idea was terrible and you are an awful person"", it just means that your idea is just not gonna be able to be used, and we are sorry.

I admit that we have not been finding this easy, with the loss of one moderator and the stagnation the cameraman, we have stalled.

This is where you come in. 

We need to find:

1. A person with camera equipment willing to film

2. Someone with video editing skills

3. Website designers

4. Graphics designers for flyers and logos etc.

The following things I will be giving deadlines for the community to design and submit, the list is in no way exhaustive.

1. Storyboards

2. Flyers

3. QR codes, stickers etc

4. any sort of inventive advertsising you can think of

Another thing we will find ourselves needing is funding. Now most of this will have to come from donations, at least initialy. After which we will have to go for merch selling etc. The accounts will be fully transparent.

**All of the above is ideas**, if anyone has better ideas how to raise funding or even kill two birds with one stone, then please please comment and share those ideas.

Also, if you feel any other aspects of the film/flyers/website/other advertising can be left to the community to decide then please mention that and we will (more than likely) do so.

Whilst we cant make you a mod because you had a good idea, I understand people want recognition for the efforts they have made, and to that end we will be putting the usernames of contributors on the sidebar, along with a link to their input. The designs/ideas that we will use for the final products will be put in bold, and if you wish, we can put either your username or real name in the credits of the film and or on the website.

Contact your governor today as part of the /r/timetolegalize lobby!,52,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/1i2x39/governor_thursday_contact_your_governor_today_as/,"A few weeks ago I floated the idea of /r/timetolegalize coordinating efforts to contact representatives at all levels of your government about cannabis legalization. This is my first attempt. I will consider it a success if I get 10 reports in this thread.

With that in mind **please respond to this post with your results, if any.** That will help inspire others to also take part in direct action. Did you talk to someone on the phone? What was their name? Did they take your message, and so on.

**How to find your governor's office**
The easiest way to do this is to go to your favorite search engine and type your state's name and ""governor"" or ""governor's office"". Contact information should be readily available.

**Call or email?** 
Calling is more effective, for a couple of reasons. 

* First, phone calls put a human voice to the issue. Keyboard activism does not even remotely do that. You can include your own perspectives and deliver them directly to someone's ear. Emails can be deleted or filtered, but phone calls cannot. 

* Second, remember that government is always a couple of decades in the past. Phone banks are still the way that they take input. 

* THIRD, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, *you are absolutely permitted to ask for your representative on the phone.* Ask where they are and whether they can take your call. Chances are that it won't happen, but it's worth a try. Of course that will be much more likely to happen with your state representatives, rather than the governors.

**What to do on the phone/email**
Make it personal. Tell the office that you have a personal stake in cannabis legalization, and then tell them why that is. Do you have a story? Was a family member affected? Tell them about it! 

Here are talking points. /r/timetolegalize has some of the best minds in the legalization movement, so I feel like this should be something fairly obvious.

* Cannabis has medical applications, is not toxic, and has less potential to be abused than alcohol, or even caffeine. 

* Legalization would lead to a new cottage industry that would help your state in this fragile economy.

* Incarceration rates in this country are second only to the worst times in the Soviet Union. Save money and lives by legalizing today.

**CURRENT LEGISLATION**

Keep in mind that your state may have a bill circulating. If so, for god's sake mention it! NORML has a state by state rundown of this kind of thing:

http://norml.org/act

Look up your state, you may be surprised by what you find!

**Remember, 5 calls to an office in a single day creates some buzz. 50 calls creates a crisis and meetings.** There are 7,292 readers on here, and if we all were calling, legalization would be that much closer.",,False,self,t5_2tr4p,1373552456.0,,,True,t3_1i2x39,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/1i2x39/governor_thursday_contact_your_governor_today_as/,

How to share the videos: Either PM a dropbox (or similar) link to me or post it here. 720p proffered, all accepted. Note: submitting a video does not necessarily mean it will be in the video I am making, but I will try my best to include all submissions! (if you want to remain anonymous/blurred our/etc just let me know!)

I will post the links to the videos on this thread unless otherwise noted.


So, /timetolegalize, what do you think? Do you challenge me?

How Drugs Have Effected My Life
Anonymous


	I have been told, as a punishment from my community review board, to write a seven to ten page paper on how drugs have effected my life.  How I'm supposed to opine on a topic that would take any sane person about a single paragraph to properly express for seven pages is a mystery to me, so most of this essay is going to be filler. 
	Drugs, how have they effected my life? Hm, well I suppose they have made me a more relaxed person.  When I got to Hampshire I had quite a bit of social anxiety, a little bit of a worry-wart streak, and a lot of insomnia.  Now, I have none of those three.  I blame drugs. 
	Let's start with my insomnia.  It used to be that I simply could not get more than five hours of sleep in a night.  This led to me doing poorly in school, and in one case going so long without sleep (about three days) that I began hallucinating vividly.  Once, I was in my school's wrestling room and I thought they were all in there with me practicing. . .  they weren't.  My lack of sleep made me irritable and paranoid.  In my own desperation simply to fall asleep, I once took an entire bottle of over the counter sleeping pills.  How I did not die, I do not know, but thank god I wasn't smoking marijuana.  They did give me one pill that actually worked, but I was told I could not take it for longer than a two week period because it would 'destroy my liver'.  It was just supposed to get me back into a regular sleep cycle, never mind the fact that I hadn't had one of those for about three years. 
	My insomnia would later play a key role in getting me kicked out of high school and made my subsequent trip to Wilderness a hellish nightmare.  Now, I simply smoke a bit of marijuana before bed (always outside) and I find that I can usually fall asleep within the hour.  Clearly, this selfish habit of mine is a detriment to both myself and society and must cease immediately.  Did you know that twelve thousand people a year die from marijuana overdose? Probably not, because that's not true.  If it were though, wouldn't you feel terrible lighting up that sweet sensamilliah?
	Every person I meet says, “Oh yeah I have insomnia, just not real insomnia. ” shut up, you don't have insomnia.  You don't know what it's like to go three days without sleeping a wink, to lay in bed for hours and hours on end every night, your mind racing and your body unable to relax.  I sometimes hear people saying jokingly, “Oh my god I'm so OCD haha!” and I imagine that people who actually have OCD must want to reach down your throat and pull your spine out of your mouth by the scapula just like I do. 
	Back to drugs. 
	Next, let's get to my worry-wart streek.  See, when I first got to Hampshire I could not understand how relaxed everyone was.  I wanted to get a party organized, that was all on me and I could not expect help.  At first I thought this was because everyone was lazy, but I later realized that it simply didn't matter that much to them.  If you're high you can be sitting in a room with your friends, watch The Mighty Boosh and eat popcorn, and have just as much fun as you would at any party.  When you're high you can be content, happy, and let your anxieties and insecurities just melt away from you for just a bit. . .   briefly grasping the serenity so many people spend their lives working to achieve. 
	Sickening. 
	When I let that dank, thick smoke enter my lungs suddenly I was relaxed.  My shoulders stopped hunching, my back unknotted, my eyes could linger on one thing for longer than two seconds without immediately shifting over to the nearest stimulus to acknowledge and examine it.  It was disgusting, and horrible, and awful.  Oh but the addiction.  Every pot smoker knows the symptoms of withdrawal, the shakes, the vomiting, the blood dripping from your eyes ears and nose like you were a holy statue with a rusty water pipe above it. . .  it's hell rolled in a zig-zag cone is what it is. 
	Lastly, of course, the social anxiety.  You see, that just disappears with pot.  Stoners are not exactly the most judgmental people, and a high person is going to have an awfully hard time focusing on what others think of them when there's a bag of cheetos on the floor and Howard Moon's gotten himself into some kind of crazy conundrum.  Oh Howard, will you ever get it right?
	Once I had a cat, it's name was Kitler, and it loved to get high.  We'd spend hours together, just relaxing, with me stroking its fur and it purring contentedly.  Whenever I'd smoke it would rest it's head on my knee and look up at me until I blew smoke into its face, then it would curl up on my chest an fall asleep.  What a worthless junkie. 
	There is, in fact, one way that drugs have negatively effected my life. . .  well. . .  it wasn't the drugs so much as it was the people enforcing the rules about drugs.  Kurt Cobain once said, “I don't have a drug problem, I have a police problem. ” such a statement could not be more relevant to today's society.  Consider this; currently there are more African-Americans in the American Prison System than there ever were slaves at one time (http://www. huffingtonpost. com/2011/10/12/michelle-alexander-more-black-men-in-prison-slaves-1850_n_1007368. html), the U. S.  will this year alone has already spent over thirty-seven billion dollars enforcing the drug war and with no noticable effect on the availability of drugs (http://www. drugsense. org/cms/wodclock), and as if that weren't enough this year alone over a million and a half people have already been arrested for violating drug laws (not violent behavior) (http://www. drugsense. org/cms/wodclock). 
	With such ridiculously high costs in terms of both dollars and people, is it any surprise that more and more states are turning towards legalization routes for marijuana? In Hampshire College's own state medical marijuana has just become available (but if you've got a condition you can go screw yourself so far as the school is concerned) making it the eighteenth state to do so! And just this year alone two states, Washington and Colorado, have voted to legalize posession and sale of recreational marijuana.  To everyone's surprise the two states somehow still exist, and there have not been any violent murders over munchies to date. 
	Once, my friend John went to pick up some paper towels at a store.  He walked in, bought his paper towels, and left.  In the parking lot though, there was a dirty pot needle.  He fell on it and got cancer, now he's dead. 
	Do you hate black people? Well boy howdy do I have good news for you.  I mentioned earlier that the drug war has put a significant portion of the African-American population into prison, but what I didn't mention is that it's also completely destroying pretty much every heavily African-American community across the nation! As supporters of the current drug laws, I imagine that Hampshire College could not be happier. 
	Now in all fairness to Hampshire College, they require federal funding to exist (I think?).  And said federal funding will not be given to them if they let their kids go around overdosing on the weed willy nilly now would it? So of course they have to keep their mouths shut so they can keep getting money, which is a pretty admirable trait if you ask me.  If only more revolutionary thinkers had known when to be quiet we might've avoided that whole civil rights/feminism nonsense in the first place. 
	Sometimes dogs have four legs, but sometimes they don't, and that's sad. 
	So. . .  what else. . .  I guess hallucinogens have given me some bad times.  I had to go to the hospital once, but that wasn't the fault of the hallucinogens it was mine for taking too much.  If you take the right amount it can be a fun, eye-opening experience that you should absolutely never try because its immoral and illegal you inadequate remnant of a person.  If you're thinking about trying it I hope you die, you frothing collection of anal particles, you creamy stream of pus and semen, you disgust me you drug-addled lunatic! 
	Other than that though, I've never really taken any drugs that weren't perscription.  So how have drugs effected my life?
	Well, there's a lot less black people around. . .  I invested in a privatized prison once and made a ton of money on what's basically amounting to slave labor, so they got me richer. . .  a few of my friends have been arrested and had their lives ruined, so there's that. . .  oh, now I can't go to some parts of Mexico. . .  but wait, these are all effects of drugs being legal, so how have drugs actually negatively effected my life?
	Oh wait, they haven't.  I'm not a heroin addict, I've not yet assaulted, stolen from, or even really yelled at anyone this entire school year.  I'm doing pretty well in my classes and I have quite a few friends, I'm moving down to the mods soon (which should be fun) and hopefully I'll get a dog.  In fact, besides the fact that I got in trouble for using them I can't really think of a way that drugs have negatively effected my life at all. 
	So what am I to write about for another two pages? Here's a poem. 
Hibbledy-bibbledy-bop 
the young boy was caught with some pot
he had a good run, but it's over now son
the cop pulled his gun and he shot
Hibbledy-bibbledy-boo
he had a mother and a daughter too
they both were quite sad, the girl lost her dad
but it was something the cop had to do
because the drug war is totally worth it
all the lives and the innocent persons
the millions of taxpayer dollars
and the lack of freedom, and coercion
perhaps a lesson in history 
would make this topic less of a mystery
we tried this before, our hopes fell to the floor
prohibition was no victory
see, the damage done by drugs
only comes when in the hands of thugs
keeping it illegal is what's killing people
but onward we steadily lug

	Once there was a lumberjack.  As he was walking through the forest he came upon a deer with a broken leg. 
“Help me!” Said the deer. 
“Mmm. ” Said the lumberjack, a man of few words. 
	He scooped up the deer in his plaid-clad arms and carried it to his house, where he nursed it back to health.  When spring came the deer was running and bounding about as though it had never been hurt, and the lumberjack was happy. 
“For helping me, I will grant you two wishes. ” The deer said, “You cannot, however, wish for more wishes. ”
“I wish the rules were different so I could wish for more wishes, and I wish for a million wishes. ” Said the lumberjack. 
“Oh, screw you. ” Said the deer. 
	Wasn't that a nice story? I remember my mother used to tell me stories sometimes. She'd sit on the edge of my bed and read me redwall, or the wheel of time, and we'd laugh and then I'd go to sleep about five hours later. Other times, she wouldn't do that, and we wouldn't laugh, and I'd still go to sleep five hours later. And one time, she did do that, but I fell asleep before she was finished! Can you imagine?
	Oh, good times. Reminiscing sure does make me feel analgesic, or nostalgic, whichever word is appropriate I suppose. Suppose sure is an odd word, can you repose? Can you unpose? I suppose we'll never know, if you excuse the pun! 
	Do you know why election rhymes with erection? At the end of the day, no matter who wins, we're all boned.
	Some people think the alphabet goes, “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” and I am one of those people.
	Some street names for marijuana are; weed, pot, mary-jane, potweed, weedpot, mary-pot, mary-weed, dank, sensamilliah, budha, green, herb, bud, nuggets, nugs, nuggery, egg-nug, snug-as-a-nug-in-a-rug.

This means visitors without a CO-issued medical card will be unable to shop at dispensaries to procure their green until likely next year. Until recreational establishments for cannabis open, there will continue to be street demand, and that demand is currently extremely strong with all of the media buzz regarding the passage of Amendment 64- it's been on the news every other day or so since November. There are more medical dispensaries in Denver than liquor stores, and even more personal grows than that, which drops the prices per ounce to $150-$200 ish- taxation initiatives (possibly implementation of a 30% tax) will be voted on by citizens sometime soon in the future. Furthermore, it's currently literally being given away at places like /r/COTreeGifting/ (and likely events such as the Cannabis Cup in Denver this weekend). Smoking/vaping lounges already exist as well (Studio 64, Club 710, and The Lazy Lion are a few that I know offhand, though I haven't been to any of them)- they're membership-based for a small fee each month.

Colorado regulations on recreational cannabis have been created by a house/senate subcommittee, and are all but finalized:

* rejection of vertical integration (growers/sellers do not need to be one and the same- medical regulations currently require at least 70% of bud sold to be grown by the same business)
* purchase cap per transaction 1/4oz for residents, 1/8oz for visitors (this comes with some controversy, as it's legal to have up to one ounce in the state... some have inferred that this recommendation will not pass the full legislature)
* 100mg THC edible potency limit
* permit private cannabis clubs and smoking openly on a private porch or back deck, but not allow cafes or bars that are open to the public (see aforementioned private cannabis lounges)
* no medical/recreational sold in the same location (issue with minors and possible taxation differences between the two)
* potency/safety/indication labeling requirements (e.g. a green leaf on marijuana products)
* no radio/TV advertising (alt weekly ads are fine)
* drug felony = 10 year ban on working in the industry

The edibles market in Colorado is particularly prolific (some examples [here](http://www.twirlinghippy.com/confections/edibles/), [here](http://www.keefcola.com/products/keef-cola-extreme/), and [here](http://www.cheebachews.com/original.html)- all very good), and will likely be expanding to retail sales once the stores open.

Things are certainly looking bright. :)

I feel like the principles behind legalization carry over to so many problem areas where government and businesses are intruding and over-reaching at every corner. You ought to be able to own your own person, and property, and do basically whatever you want with yourself or your things, without it being the business of anyone else whatsoever. There are only very limited exceptions, when others can make it their business, and that's only when it's to ensure the safety and well-being of others. 

It's entirely inappropriate for police to even be concerned with what I'm doing in my own home, if I'm doing no one any harm. And the same goes for businesses that drug test, or try to force their way into seeing peoples' private accounts on websites like Facebook. That's none of their business. If regulations for safety exist, that's fine. i.e. people that operate heavy machinery or firearms obviously can't be drunk or high, duh. But what they do in their private time is theirs, and businesses act too much like they fully own people. And they're working *with* the government to *literally* own people, in some cases, when people are arrested and sent to privately owned prisons to do cheap labor there.

Just being able to get high without being hassled is all I started out wanting. But now I'm thinking entire popular outlooks on how our society interacts with itself have to change. It sounds simplistic but people really need to stop taking things so seriously and stop trying to control everything in their lives. Of course *some things* are very serious. And some things do need to be dealt with. But not *everything*. Some things can just be left alone, and be better off for it. Stay out of other peoples' lives. That sentiment just carries into so many areas: ending prohibition, this stupid contraception debate, and abortions and gay marriage and religion; all of it. Just leave other people to do their own thing with their own minds and bodies and mind your own business.

Here's what you should be thinking about:

1. Who is our target audience?
2. How do they currently feel about cannabis?
3. What beliefs do we want them to change?
4. What is the best *simple*  message for that to happen?

If you have too many ideas the audience won't know what to take away from it. I'd suggest going the medical route and focus on people who have truly awful diseases like [fibromyalgia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001463/) and how the only way they can lead bearable lives is through taking cannabis medically. Combine that with the guilt and fear they have about taking an illegal drug, or even worse that many people are afraid to try it because of it's stereotypes and illegality. Or talk about the med patients who have lost jobs or even have been arrested. 

Make clear that all these people are continuing to suffer unnecessarily every single day it remains illegal, and you might be able to pull on some heartstrings. As mentioned elsewhere, personal stories are the way to go.

*Dear Ms. Haag,*

*I wanted to write you today to express my extreme disapproval of your actions in raiding California dispensaries (most recently the property forfeiture proceedings for Harborside Health Center in Oakland, CA). Harborside was in compliance with state and local regulations and a shining beacon of how dispensaries should behave in the state of California.*

*Not only are your actions an incredible overstep of federal power (especially in the context of your complete failure to inform or seek the consent of local law enforcement), your actions represent a complete misallocation of resources. The dispensary issue is not a threat to public safety and your removal of sources of medicine for patients in Northern California is completely reprehensible.*

*You can be assured I will do everything in my power to make the citizens of Northern California aware of your complete disregard for local regulation and enforcement and misallocation of valuable federal prosecution resources.*

*Sincerely,*

1376101778.0,31,self.timetolegalize,1k2fvw,What to do After Your State Recognizes Medical Cannabis (Like my state of Illinois).,35,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/1k2fvw/what_to_do_after_your_state_recognizes_medical/,"My state, Illinois, just [legalized medical cannabis](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=098-0122).

While this is an important first step, more needs to be done. Unfortunately, the state of Illinois politics makes it difficult to press for full legalization of cannabis. But this does not mean that there is nothing to be done in the state (or other similar states). If you want to help fight the harm that cannabis overcriminalization is causing, then here are some action items and how to push for them.

1) Write the Department of Public Health and ask that more conditions be added to the list of Medical Conditions covered by the program.

According to Section 45 of the Illinois Act:

&gt;Section 45. Addition of debilitating medical conditions.
Any citizen may petition the Department of Public Health to add
debilitating conditions or treatments to the list of
debilitating medical conditions listed in subsection (h) of
Section 10. The Department of Public Health shall consider
petitions in the manner required by Department rule, including
public notice and hearing. The Department shall approve or deny
a petition within 180 days of its submission, and, upon
approval, shall proceed to add that condition by rule in
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The approval
or denial of any petition is a final decision of the
Department, subject to judicial review. Jurisdiction and venue
are vested in the Circuit Court. 

You can contact the Department of Public Health Administrative Division at the address at the bottom of [this page](
http://www.idph.state.il.us/rulesregs/rules-indexhome.htm).

2) Encourage your local government to make Cannabis Enforcement the [lowest possible priority for law enforcement] (http://www.mpp.org/reports/lowest-law-enforcement.html). A good argument now is that the state has recognized Cannabis as medicine and the unlicensed use of medicine should not be a priority for law enforcement.   

I will try to keep this post updated. If anyone else has ideas leave them in the comments and I will try to add them.

The federal government has been relatively quiet on how it will respond to Washington and Colorado.

Take a look at http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/11/07/u-s-justice-department-federal-marijuana-law-unchanged-by-legalization/

The comments only reiterate what we already know; that Marijuana is still a controlled substance. The good part, though, is that the decision on how to react will come from Washington DC. More specifically, from the Department of Justice rather than the CO and WA U.S. Attorneys who are normally pretty autonomous. This is what allowed Melinda Haag to go after MMJ so heavily in North California.

We have also heard from the DEA. http://reason.com/blog/2012/11/07/dea-responds-to-legal-weed-in-colorado-a

The DEA is under the Department of Justice, which is in the executive branch led by the President. Thanks to his power of appointment, he will get to pick new leadership for the DOJ, as well as a new administrator for the DEA. This is why the feds are being so vague, the onus is currently on Obama to choose how to proceed, and the decision is either not made or not public.

The present administrator is [Michele Leonhart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Leonhart)  who is notoriously dispensary-busting, anti-research, and refused to say whether Marijuana is less dangerous than Heroin and Meth when testifying for Congress. She is the person whom I really hope gets replaced.

Obama has not yet picked a new cabinet, and it may be that he will take a new stance on marijuana enforcement now that he does not need to worry about reelection. In particular, he may take a ""leave it to the states"" approach like he does with Gay marriage. This would manifest itself in the appointments he makes with the DOJ and the DEA.

On the legislative side, I think things will take more time. Ideally Marijuana would handed over to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Maybe in time the success of non-enforcement will convince Congress to reschedule, and maybe even deschedule, Marijuana.

1333907919.0,32,self.timetolegalize,rzgqo,What are the best types of activism to include in a legalization video/campaign?,34,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/rzgqo/what_are_the_best_types_of_activism_to_include_in/,"A legalization campaign/video should include several major opportunities for individual action that the viewers can pursue. These actions should not simply focus on spreading awareness (most people are already aware and decided), but rather they should also focus on applying collective pressure to affect politicians/businesses and change the political calculus that produces our terrible status quo. Here are my suggestions:


1) **Targeted election season demonstrations**. Democratic Party leaders understand the advantages of legalization but intentionally turn their backs on a majority of their supporters, knowing that this will maximize their votes based on our inability to find alternative legalization candidates on the ballots. These Democratic leaders KNOW that a majority of their supporters are pro-legalization. 

We should show up to Obama events (and Democratic leadership events) and face backwards during the speeches, in protest of Obama and the Democratic leaders turning their backs on supporters with oppressive, non-representative policies. Rather than being a “group stunt” performed by outcasts, the demonstration should be a broadly pre-advertised scheme aimed at eliciting participation from many audience members who *didn't* come specifically for the protest. We could popularize some signals and calls that are attached to this type of demonstration, and hope that non-activists at the events show solidarity with our cause. Something like, ""please take a moment to join us if you would also like a real answer to this issue"" or (yelled) ""can legalization supporters in the audience please join us in turning your back until the speaker explains why pot should not be regulated like alcohol"". Imagine Obama speaking around the country to crowds partially-filled with backward-facing people until he addresses our demands. This could be very possible at young venues such at colleges. The media coverage would be embarrassing and hard to ignore, but more importantly Obama would probably have to make some statements about legalization at each event to appease the skeptical crowds. This movement is possible because SO MANY people at Democratic party rallies are sidelined supporters of legalization.

2) **Economic support/opposition**. These measures should be more creative than simple boycotts of large multinationals, which have often been lackluster. We need to focus on the markets in which we have real power. Maybe one campaign should be to boycott medical marijuana dispensaries that do not give a certain percentage of profits in support of legalization. Conversely, we should specifically support the better dispensaries. A certification/marketing scheme to support participating dispensaries by driving traffic would be a huge incentive for these businesses. 

Negative publicity is enough to deter most companies from attacking our cause. Beer companies are particularly vulnerable because they cater to the demographic that supports legalization. Some of these companies donate to prohibition anyway. We should publicly out a limited selection of companies (maybe 5) that are the most powerful opponents of legalization and campaign to label them as ""public enemies"". Our public enemy campaign should repeat a clear narrative about each company and call on consumers to go beyond boycotting to fight the presence of these companies in their local neighborhoods. Americans hate corporate plutocracy interfering with our communities and this message should resonate with many who abhor the recent Citizens United ruling. Focusing attacks on a few companies will send a big message to other companies considering opposing us.

3) **Flood the courts**. We should encourage arrested users with court dates during a certain time frame to reject settlements and fight their marijuana charges. So many of these people have legitimate cases (based on searches, etc.) that they would otherwise not pursue because they fear the prohibition machinery and will be funneled into the extortionate plea process. We should also encourage jury members to openly proclaim their disavowal of prohibition enforcement. Both of these activities would clog the system and highlight the extortionate plea process that is currently in place. There is no way they could handle all of these cases through a legitimate judicial process. A creative campaign to link and unionize those currently in the justice system is essential because these are PEOPLE who are being held hostage over ""fishy smells that forced the police to break into their homes, cars, purses and backpacks"". Alone, each is too afraid to reject a plea deal. With a support network, many may decide to fight. As a start, we could find lawyers willing to represent groups of people who reject their charges.

4) **Prisoners' hunger strike**. We should find a few potentially high-profile ""unlucky marijuana user"" prisoners and encourage these inmates to begin concurrent hunger strikes in solidarity with our cause. This would become a media story and create immense pressure on federal officials as they scramble to rationalize the resources needed for these prisoners. Prisoners could end their hunger strikes after a set period or after we have accomplished certain goals. These are our compatriots but they have almost no hope, no networks and no power. Their strikes should be synchronized with the time-frame of our other efforts and have matching ending dates. 

5) **Foreign influence**. Recent news has pointed to increased support for reform from people and leaders in Latin America. Our lobbying may have special influence in these countries. These people cannot ignore how much they suffer from prohibition. Our campaign should send a clear signal to Mexicans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and others. Our message should be spread to these places and include special emphasis on their ability to lead the end of prohibition. Our message should be: ""America's people are ending prohibition, and Latin America should stop destroying itself to support our crumbling policy."" We may have outsized impact through this method simply because of the novelty of the idea. Are their any potential actions for utilizing this opportunity?


**Note**: Condensing all activism efforts into one set time-frame magnifies their impact by synchronizing events and activating sidelined supporters with a feeling of an imminent success. I think the time-frame of our entire campaign should be no longer than 1 year and have specific start/end dates. Preempting the election is obviously a smart idea. I would propose a time-frame of 5/1/12 to 11/6/12 (election day).

I plan on bringing up a number of things, ranging from college tuition costs, to increasing funding for solar energy research and plant construction. For the topic of the economy, one of the policy reforms I plan on bringing up is legalization of cannabis. In this topic, I plan on discussing:

* Increased Tax revenue
* It's heavy use in manufacturing would greatly increase our nation's factory production.
* Save billions of dollars in enforcement and incarceration
* Tourism would greatly increase

So, my fellow ents. I would greatly appreciate any and all help from all of you. New topics to discuss would be awesome, as would any facts/figures associated with aforementioned topics. I'm doing my own research as well, but want to be really thorough.

That's simply not true.

This gentleman has been posting on /r/timetolegalize for the past month stating that the project was already a failure and the mods are all, and I quote from multiple occasions, ""Fucking stupid"". We never discouraged or shunned this gent, for his ideas weren't bad and we were trying to work with him, until it became quite apparent that his ideas were always coupled with a complete overthrow of mods and reset the entire subreddit. He seems to have sought after leadership/moderator priveledges for *most* of the time we've been talking to him. 

His charges in his [latest post](http://www.reddit.com/r/timetolegalize/comments/szkyo/top_10_reasons_rtimetolegalize_is_a_failure/) either twist words &amp; lack substantial reasoning or are all-out false. He created his own subreddit (as we have encouraged multiple times) and actively began censoring it. He has enough free-time &amp; made enough accounts that all of the mods are having a fun time keeping up with him and his constant lying. It's not that unlikely that he's also promoting himself with all of them. To top it all off, he's not stopped posting threads since the creation of his subreddit in which he simply bashes /r/timetolegalize as a whole.

[If anyone wants to see his character and learn as to why we have not approved of his posts, here's an album.](http://imgur.com/a/MVu3j)

His account still have their history up for the most part, and you're welcome to view them. I'd like to remind you to click context if you wish to see what is meant by twisting words:

recount does not change after such recount, the canvass board shall include a statement of that fact in the
