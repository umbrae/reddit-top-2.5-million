People complaining about not getting pizza.  How they have 821 kids, 4 husbands, 7 dogs and no electricity.

People act as if this subreddit is here for the sole purpose of feeding the less fortunate.  While that does happen and I support it 100%, it's ultimately not why we're here.

This is RANDOM Acts of Pizza.  If I want to send someone on a scavenger hunt for the most random shit I can think of in exchange for a pizza, so be it.  If I want to give pizza to someone who drives a green Ford Taurus, so be it.  Give a pizza to the person who guesses closest to my number from 1 to 82,242,102.  It's my choice, I'm the person spending my hard earned money on you.

This subreddit isn't a food bank, soup kitchen, or pizza buffet.  We're here to randomly brighten someones day with some greasy goodness, regardless of the terms (within reason).

I'm not trying to be a dick, but this needed to be said.  I hate reading sob stories all day.  Let's see some fun posts.  If you're starving and need food, do what the giver asks of you.  You might...RANDOMLY...be gifted a pizza.  Crazy idea eh?

Let's try and lighten the mood here.  **It's supposed to be fun.**

Sorry the Ents are taking the brunt. This post is based on my experience (and a few others that have PM'd Me) Unfortunately 3 of the 5 people I tried to help were from trees. It was not a simple .. ""oh they are from trees, no pizza"" type decision, it was based on research about their spending habits.

Believe me when I say, my lack of gifting a pizza was not based on people who may have posted a few times in Trees, but people that are talking about their recent activities that include unwise spending of money that directly contradict their request for a pizza. I am not out to get random people that may have said something in their history. It has been based straight up recent evidence. This applies to people in any group weather it is games or guns.

The good folks at Austin’s Pizza learned that my wife and I were throwing a birthday party for our four-year-old but couldn’t afford to feed the guests, and out of the blue they contacted us and offered to set us up with pizza for the party as part of their participation in RAOP.

At 11:30 AM yesterday, a delivery car pulled up with *nine* pizzas of various kinds, a huge bag of cheese and pepper, paper plates and forks-- the works! I tried to tip the driver but he declined, saying that he had already been taken care of.

I’m flabbergasted and incredibly grateful. The pizza was delicious and kids and adults alike ate until they couldn’t take another bite.

For this contest, you’ll need fly acro-**Bitch**, I said *giveaway*; ain’t no silly contest rules to be had here.  Okay, this is how it’s going to work.  I’m going to be giving away pizzas.  Yes, that’s right, *pizzas*; as in multiple, more than one, numerous, several.  To acquire said pizza, you’ll need to:
 

**1.** Alert the world that you would like a pizza via comments.

**2.** After I’ve contacted you or something like that, send me your shit (email address and pizza preference) and verification code.

**3.** Wait in anticipation of a delicious piping hot pie.

**4.** Don a ridiculous holiday sweater so the delivery guy can have a good laugh.


 
At the moment, there is no limit on how many pizzas I plan on giving away.  Just ask and I’ll give.  I don’t need sob stories.  I don’t care if you’re a college student living off top ramen, a single mother living paycheck to paycheck with a dozen mouths to feed, a frequently masturbating goat herder, or just a lonely person needing some cheesy closure; whatever, I don’t care.  I’ll give you a goddamn pizza.  I am by no means wealthy, so this will go on as long as I don’t start fretting about my financial wellbeing, or my funds are depleted-whichever happens first.  I’ll give until my wife threatens to leave me, whatever; I’m giving away pizzas.  If this breaks my bank, I don’t care, because guess what?


I’m fresh out of fucks.


**Disclaimer:** I’m just going to ignore requests from accounts with a lifespan of under 24 hours because I don’t want people trying to get me to give to them twice.


**TL;DR** Read it if you want your pizza, you twit.

**Edit1** This is proving to be more difficult than I anticipated.  I have close to twenty some tabs opened just trying to sort out who's who in the zoo. Since I’m being swamped with requests, I’ve had to enlist the help of my hot secretary to sort through the details of the requests.  [Bear with me](http://i.imgur.com/6pAve.jpg), you’ll get your pizza.


**Edit2** Holy fucking cunt-licking shit, everybody calm the fuck down. I'm but a mortal man.

**Edit3**  My hot secretary has graciously offered to donate **2 $20** gift cards to this giveaway (they’ve been only $10 up till now, sorry trying to give as much as possible).  Unfortunately, she insisted on actually holding a little contest for these.  First to guess her bra size gets the first one; first to guess the color gets the second.  You only get one guess, and can’t guess for both (her words, not mine).  Also, read the fucking rules--waste of time when I have to reply to ""what info do you need?"" 

**Edit4** Sorry folks, as of 2:22 PM PDT, this is closed.  My wife’s really letting me have it.  Apparently if I keep this charade up, my unborn daughter won’t be able to attend college.  If your comment was posted before this I'll still get to you, anyone after that, I'm sorry if I wasn’t able to get to you. Sorry I had to close it so soon, I had not idea it would blow up in just one hour. I was literally receiving 10+ message notifications by the minute.  Hot secretary contest is still going.

**Edit5** Mommabear0816 finally got purple; size is still up.

**Edit6** Fun fact: I now have my credit card number committed to memory. Also, 10 bonus points are awarded to rwheeler720 and RyenDeckard for thoroughly mind fucking me.

**Edit7** Kudos to RobSpewack for finally guessing 34C. Also, those of you who I've pm'd but have not responded: anytime today would be fantastic. I have many things to do, which may or may not include filing for bankruptcy and/or divorce.  Also, you all owe me pics of you with your pizza and whatever it is you did with it; that is all I ask.

**Edit8** Logged on this morning to find a multitude of messages in my inbox and **reddit gold**. The hell people? It's just pizza. My unborn daughter needs to go to college, dammit, is reddit gold an acceptable currency? Those of you who I said I'd get before this tremendously stupid idea of mine ended yesterday, hang on, I'm still wading through my inbox.

Update: Overwhelming response. We're reading through submissions here and by PM. Apparently the US won't accept our €urodollars, but we're fixing it. Might be some delays because of it.

Update 2: When sending details please send name, email, phone # and address + any pizza type and/or store preference. If no pizza type given it will likely be hot and meaty.

Sorry I haven't gotten back to more of you but I have discovered ordering pizza internationally is quite time consuming (sorry rolmos, it seems impossible). I'll pick up the thread in the morning so vote up anyone you think needs pizza and I'll follow up later. Thanks.

Here's the part to do with Reddit:
&gt;Use Reddit to Get Free Pizza

&gt;Hungry? Grift grub from the denizens of Reddit. In their quest for “karma,” redditors engage in what they call “random acts of pizza”: Do-gooders will email gift cards for free pizza if they’re sufficiently moved by someone’s plight. Here are some helpful tips for turning a (fake) sob story into a pizza magnet. —James McGirk

&gt;Bill Hader’s Pro Tips: “DON’T bring a knife to a gunfight. DO bring a knife to a pillow fight. Or a pillow to a gunfight. Or whiskey to a cockfight. Or a cock to a whiskey fight.”

&gt;DO be an everyman. People help those who remind them of themselves, so it’s better to act temporarily embarrassed than com­pletely pathetic. So: You just put your cat to sleep; you’re sick of ramen. Professional beggars constantly vary their pitches—follow their lead and experiment.

&gt;DON’T use your real identity. You’ll need a variety of plausible sock puppets—an out-of-work hand model, a hungry gamer. To prevent abuse (ha!), Reddit requires accounts to be at least a month old before they can post on Random_Acts_of_Pizza. Be sure to create a few in advance.

&gt;DO be willing to barter. The original subreddit has a fairly strict moderation system, but on the seedier forks you can post come-ons like “Wife has the day off and is hungry. Pics for trade?” Don’t use your own pictures, and use Imgur to strip any pesky metadata that might out you as a cheat.

&gt;DON’T feel ashamed. Ask people why they send food to strangers and a common reply is “Feels good, man.” Get it? You’re making someone happy. As for whether it’s worth all the trouble, remember what Abbie Hoffman once said about shoplifting groceries: The food just tastes better.

That's right folks. Once again me and IdTugYourBoat, unconfusedsub have once again combined forces to combat the unrandomness going on around here.

I have created a GUI interface through VisualBasic to track the number of upclicks.

You must click the uparrow exactly three times.

Over the past couple days there have been some discussions over the direction of this subreddit and our laissez-faire approach to moderation of this subreddit.  We've taken an ""anything goes"" approach for awhile and let the givers decide, but there have been some concerns raises as to this becoming a race to the worst sob story.  So we've got a couple proposed changes and a survey to vote on them!

* First topic is posting a general location in your post titles!  This can either be city or state *and* country.  The question is whether or not to strictly enforce this rule, meaning that if your subject line doesn't have a location, we remove it as mods.

* Second topic is in relation to the subreddit becoming a sob story contest.  What we could to help with that is have a rule that **Request** post titles should *only* contain ""[Request] Location"" (e.g. [Request] Iowa, USA; [Request] Hull, UK)

This has been discussed as mods, but we also want to put this up as a community vote because it's you guys that make this place what it is.  We also want an open discussion on any other rules/suggestions you guys might have for making this a better community, so feel free to post them!

(x-post)",274,27,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/yylwh/so_i_got_scammed_by_a_redditor_on/,"***[UPDATE]***: Redditor bfeliciano was kind enough to buy a pizza for the true victim of the scam, the guy who asked for pizza in the first place! As long as he got his pie, I'm happy, and the world is good again. :)


I like to read /r/RandomActsofPizza and /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza because they provide evidence that people still do good things for other people. It's fun to read the stories and see people's reactions to having their request for pizza met, even though it's a small thing. Just some people giving what they can to help their fellow man.




Anyway, last night I was reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/yvk0b/broke_till_the_1st_feel_like_shit_after_quitting/) thread, and gave props to the OP after he was heavily criticized for quitting smoking because of his girlfriend's pregnancy scare, and then continued to quit after it turned out to be negative. Later, I asked him to PM me about pizza.




Afterwards, I went off Reddit for a couple of hours and then remembered my message, so I went back on and found several messages from whom I thought was one person. It turns out, the messages were from two people. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/9WcJY.png) is my inbox, which shows the messages. I was suspicious, because 999rafica responded twice, and then I had another message saying that he just got my message to PM me. I figured, hey, he probably saw my comment on the thread and then my PM so he sent me multiple replies. Or maybe he was excited about pizza and wondered why I didn't respond for a couple of hours.




I ended up replying to the most-recent message, which was from ***999raffca***. The legitimate user's name is 999raff***i***ca, but I didn't notice the spelling difference until it was too late. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/user/999raffca) is the scammer's user profile. It was made right before he messaged me, proving that the account was made specifically to fool me. I guess I wasn't too concerned about getting scammed on a subreddit that's supposed to be about giving out of the random kindness of your heart.




Anyway, I don't know what Reddit wants me to do about this, but because the purchase (which was an e-gift certificate to Domino's) was made by me, I can't file it as fraud with my bank, and because the code was already used, Domino's isn't going to refund me.

I come to you with an odd request. It is not to receive a pie, but for help.  

**By ordering your Papa John's Pizza from www.pizza.gg you can save 50% and support the growing industry of competitive gaming.**  

What is competitive Gaming? Competitive Gaming, or eSports, is a growing industry that has received a huge boom in viewership over the last few years with the advent of new Internet streaming services. Professionals on teams get paid to play games like /r/starcraft /r/leagueoflegends /r/DotA2 at the highest caliber. They battle it out in [tournaments](http://www.dota2.com/international/announcement/) for millions of dollars year round.  

Millions of people watch this content every week. However we do not have sponsorship money coming in from Coke, Honda, Mcdonalds, or other mainstream companies. Papa John's is a serious contender in an effort to get more lifestyle sponsors into our growing industry. This is their first major fore into our industry. They are dipping their toes in. We want to blow their expectations away.  

If even a few of you make your papa john's orders by going through www.pizza.gg this week it will mean a lot to me and a bunch of other redditors. Thank you

Someone trying to take advantage of northernInfinity's plight and snag their pizza signed up as a redditor called northemInfinity and it slipped past me.  I sent the scumbag a $25 gift certificate for papajohns.  Luckily it all happened after Dominos was closed and I got to them before the giftcode was used. 

So - now it won't work and there's another trick that I won't fall for again.  

Of course, shame on me for falling for the top most scam mentioned on the Don't Fall For Scams page.  But I win this round - in the end.

EDIT:  For fun, this is the email I sent to the giftcard people...

Hi,

I got scammed by someone and sent this giftcard to the wrong person.  Take a moment and see if you can appreciate how annoying this is and help me stop the thieving little bastard from getting away with it.  

I'm a part of the Reddit community called Random_acts_of_pizza.  You can find it here

www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza

It's a lovely little community that gives away pizzas to people.  Sometimes because they need them and sometimes just for fun.  I myself have purchased about 15 $25 gift certificates from you guys.  In fact, I only ever give away PapaJohns/Dominos/PizzaHut pizza because I can just give them your eGiftCard.  Check xxxxxxx@xxxxx.com as one of your regular customers.

So - this guy made a post and I offered him a pizza:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/leogq/request_havent_eaten_in_36_hours_got_six_bucks_in/

So (if you can go to the link) you'll see that I told him to send me a message with his email and preference of pizza and that I'd send him a gift card.  That's when the scammer stepped in.  He created a new account with a username Very Similar to the person making the post and he sent me a private message with that email address in the hope that I wouldn't notice the difference in the username and that I'd send Him the gift card instead of the needy person.  What an utter ass, eh?

Well, it worked! :(  

I Did send him the gift card.  THIS gift card.  And now I'm hoping that you'll rescind it and foil his evil plan.  Maybe give me a new gift card number as a replacement that I can donate to someone worthy.  If you do this then I'll be sure to mention how you helped foil this nasty little thief.

But here's the thing.  He may have already spent it (in which case I'm screwed).  But if he hasn't then he's likely to spend it very soon.  So - if he hasn't spent it yet, please cancel it so that I can give it to someone worthy.

Thank you!

I have emailed ALL of the rest of them as well. If we can get them on board it will reduce the amount of hassle that we have when trying to order pizza for people.

Here is one of the emails I sent:

**
I am part of a large, and growing community online that orders pizza for those in need. We have primarily been using Dominos due to the ease of the e-cards that can be emailed. 

 We run into problems due to the givers not being in the same location as the receiver. As you know a credit card has to be seen by the delivery person.

  What I was wondering is if we could set something up with you to help this situation, perhaps paypal, or some other means? Perhaps a special ordering code so that a credit card does not have to be seen? 
Sometimes people even try to order pizza from other countries to help out, this is the same issue. 

Some individual pizzerias are getting involved in this movement to help people. I think it would be good for you publicity wise, and us ease of sending wise to get together on this.

Just to keep this subreddit going strong :)

No, I won't need your address, name, faceboko, photo or whatever. If you want to eat a pizza but can't afford to buy it, or heck, you could just use the equivalent money of a pizza on bills or whatever, post here!

Unfortunately living in Australia I can't buy giftcards for anyone in the US. I've tried and tried and tried with different methods but the giftcard websites outright refuse to let an aussiebuy a Pizza for Americans.

If you live in the UK or Australia though I should be able to manage to giftcard you (but again, only if that is what you prefer!)

I might ask for some proof if your account is like 2 hours old or something (probably verification code), only to make sure you're not that particular unpleasant individual who ruined everyones day!

Another idea: If your'e having trouble transferring the money i sent you from yoru paypal to your bank account try and find someone (who is a registered giver preferably) to buy you the giftcard and accept payment via paypal!

edit: also how much would a large pizza cost with delivery and what you americans call a tip?

And there are a lot of trolls, too.  This is for them:

Guys, a lot of the people requesting Pizzas here are genuinely hungry.  Some of us are tight on money and can't afford it ourselves, or even to go to the grocery store.  You might think you're being funny or cute to offer pizzas and then reneg on your offer (or worse, send an eGift card and then cancel it. You'll be pleased to know that I was pretty embarassed on that one).  The thing is... when you offer a pizza, plans change. I've turned down offers of food from friends or family members because I thought a good samaritan was doing something nice for a stranger.  And when nothing happens... well, it's embarassing for me (especially when I tell my wife and toddler ""Can we wait a bit longer before giving up? We should be getting a code for pizza any minute now..."").  Anyway... the reason I'm writing this is because I think the trolling is getting out of hand here. Over the past few weeks I've had four offers for pizza, and of the four, **ONLY ONE** was genuine.

I just got trolled again tonight. This time, my 2 year old son wound up going to bed without supper.

Folks, it's just **not funny**.  And RAOP isn't fun anymore.

**EDIT:** Actually, my wife and son are with her folks now getting some food. So there's that, at least.

**EDIT 2:** I've had several very generous offers as a result of this thread. As I've said, I've made alternate plans for myself tonight (and I'm getting ready to head on out), but I also see a lot of other hungry folks out there.  Please consider extending your generosity out to them.

**FINAL EDIT:** Somehow, this thread has degenerated into a screed about my financial situation or parenting ability. That was not my intent -- nor is this post about karma or getting offers of pizza (every one of which, while GREATLY appreciated, has been declined).  My entire point is (and always has been) that if you make a **promise** to send a pizza, please do so. 

It's not about being upset that a [REQUEST] was ignored. That wouldn't have bothered me.

It's not about being upset that replies to [OFFER]s were ignored.  Again, that wouldn't have bothered me.

It's about promises being made (causing me to stop looking for other alternatives) and then *broken* after stringing me along for *hours.*  And that's not cool.",,False,,t5_2s7wq,True,,shroom,True,t3_ihoap,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ihoap/something_of_a_rant/,

Now when I open Reddit, I find myself not paying too much attention to the RAOP posts. I have a hard time seeing all of the post where people are so down on there luck that they cannot afford to eat or feed their families. This seems to be the story behind 95% of the requests. Its downright depressing.  I applaud every single one of you that are able to give and I know that you are receiving immense satisfaction by doing so but I unfortunately have to say farewell.

I leave you with this.

*You can add pepperonis to the italian cheese bread at Little Caesers and it is incredible.
*Same thing goes for the cheesesticks at Papa Johns.
*The italian seasoning packets that you get from Papa Johns and Little Caesers (spice packs) make the most incredible hamburgers. Load up on those whenever you can.
*The papa johns I go to will sell you dough for 2$. Sometimes when I cant afford a big pizza order I will make my own at home for alot cheaper.

Single mom yadda yadda yadda.

So anyway, I work at a motel, and every time there is a delivery to our motel from Papa John's, they will sign a little piece of paper with the pizza box sticker sticker and a signature on it - once we reach 10, we get a free pizza. Each desk clerk has their own signature sheet.

So anyway, I had been saving up for a few months, because I only work a few days every few weeks [my mom is the manager and I get called in when I am needed]. Honestly, I usually sit at the bottom of the stairs when I see the Papa John's guy on the camera with my paper and a pen because sometimes [ie. most of the time] they'll leave without signing/giving the sticker because then they get to save them and use them basically like cash around the motels. So anyway, dedication went into saving up for this free pizza. 

Finally, I got it. I had worked SO HARD for this and I finally got it. 

Until last night. Last night, at work, a woman had come in, she was adorable with an ADORABLE daughter, who decided to tell me about why she was at the motel. She had 80 dollars to her name and was trying to escape her abusive husband, and didn't have enough money to feed her child. A room at the motel is normally 59.95+ tax [67.75 all together] and I gave her the room for 35.95 all together.

I mentioned this in my last post, but I'm a single mom in college, and I'm pretty broke as well, but you know what? This lady needed a free fucking pizza. And some drinks. And breadsticks. And I do not think I've ever felt better in my life for doing something for another person.

I thought you guys would appreciate this story. :)

And it feels like the influx of visits and the potential for scammers has turned RAOP from a genuine ""make a stranger's day a little better"" gift into a ""fuck you, you don't deserve happiness"" bitchfest.

Yes, there are scammers here. We know that. In any system organized to help others, there will be people who try to cheat and abuse that system - it can't be helped. What you CAN do is calm down a bit and accept why RAOP was created in the first place.

Remember why redditors first started donating pizzas? It wasn't targeting people who had NOTHING. It was targeting people who had very little, who were down to their last few dollars and looking for ideas on how to spend them wisely until their next paycheck. The response was often a kind soul who just wanted to brighten a stranger's day.

Yes, some people have basic food, enough to barely get by. But RAOP was never supposed to be for people who have NOTHING left. (If you have NOTHING left, there are food assistance programs out there, and you should be going there, not Reddit.) It was supposed to give people a chance to enjoy some comfort food that they generally couldn't afford, to make someone smile when they were down and the world was kicking them in the nuts.

And now I get to see posts like ""Hey, if you have ramen, just shut up and eat it.""

Here's my suggestion: stop worrying about whether someone deserves a pizza. That's not to say you shouldn't take common sense steps to ensure someone isn't scamming mounds of free food from multiple suckers, but let's all stop judging whether any one person has suffered enough to deserve some comfort food. If they're not a scammer, then they summoned the courage and humility to ask strangers for help, and I think that should be enough to expect good people, the kind of people who frequent RAOP, to respond.

It's time to expect the best of people. After all, if people weren't good at their core, RAOP wouldn't exist.

As we’re finishing up the waitress comes over and says “Whenever you guys are ready to leave you can take off, someone covered your bill for you…” I was stunned and honestly a little confused. I asked her if she was serious and why they did it. Still in shock, I’ve never had that kind of upfront generosity from a total stranger. She said that they told her we looked like a nice family with very well mannered kids and that she wasn’t supposed to say anything until after they left. The GF and I were totally overjoyed and plan to pass the kindness onward soon. We used the money that I would of used on dinner for a nice tip for the waitress and some Halloween goodies for the girls. Thank you kind strangers, there still is random kindness out there… 

P.S. I know that this doesn’t involve sending pizza in any way but I think it totally keeps in the spirit of r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza

1308740289.0,127,self.Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,i63lw,How to be in need.,140,13,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/i63lw/how_to_be_in_need/,"After reading so many requests that don't get responded to, here's a tip on how to be in need (from somebody who's been there). Perhaps others have more tips, but I'll start.

**Read the sidebar** - Seriously. You wouldn't walk into a dry-cleaners and expect ice-cream. If you walked into someone's home or business and wanted something from them, you'd follow their rules and requests. Otherwise you could expect to be ignored or thrown out. Are you being ignored? ***READ THE SIDEBAR!***  It says to include your location. Hello? So include your location! How much tougher is it to say ""I need a pizza in Southern Oklahoma"" than to say ""I need a pizza."" ????  

Take a good look at the requests that don't get responded to. You'll see three things that commonly result in being ignored. 

1) **You will generally be ignored if you don't include your location.** This will get you ignored by about half the givers. They don't want to have a 5-part back-and-forth conversation just to find out you're in South Thunderpack Norway where they can't get you a friggin pizza.

2) **You will generally be ignored if you use a throwaway.** Pizza givers like to see that they have a good chance of actually helping someone in need, not just feeding some scammer who worked up a good story. They will read your history. If you've got no history, they move on.

3) **You will generally be ignored if you come across as just too lazy to go get your own damned pizza.** ""Hey, I'm on my way home from my $75k job, and I'm just too busy to pull my SUV off at the Domino's and get a pizza. I'd rather have somebody buy me one so I can eat as soon as I get home.""  -or- ""Duuuuuddddde -- I am SO STONED and I've got the munchies big time. How awesome would it be for some random dude to buy me a pizza so I can continue to sit here stoned all day without moving! Hey maybe one of you can come over and take a dump for me too, cuz I'm too toasted to go to the bathroom myself.""",,False,,t5_2s7wq,False,,,True,t3_i63lw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/i63lw/how_to_be_in_need/,

The one day out of the year florists and chocolatiers make over 40% of their annual gross income in a single 24-hour period. Unfortunately for the single population out there, this is the one day hand-crafted by fate’s ugly hands to simply remind them of their single status, and once again pierce their hearts with that infernal sword of loneliness. It sucks, I know – I’ve been there. Being single on Valentine’s Day is akin to spending Christmas or New Year’s alone; not fun. But don’t worry, my lonely friends. RAoP is here to help you. This Valentine’s Day won’t suck, at least, not *as* much.

To put it simply, this is a Valentine’s Day giveaway—one of colossal proportions. In fact, it’s so big, we had to stretch it out over the entire day. Ah, “we?” you might ask? Yes. WE–**WE.** As you read on, you’ll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentine’s Day less shitty. Before you continue on to the part where you read the guidelines (which, so help me, you *will* read) on how to acquire your pizza, please take the time to recognize this all-star squad of RAoPers who are taking the time to serve you.

The roster, in no particular order:

(Givers, *please* tell me if I missed your name.)

**Guidelines**

So, you want a pizza, yes? Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to **post a pic of yourself with a sign reading “RAOP, will you be my Valentine?”** Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor’s name, course number—whatever. Get creative; it’s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don’t lie, we know you have one). This is *not* a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.

One of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we’ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who’s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner—either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. **Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.**

**Protip:** If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you’ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I’m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we’re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.

 **Couples**

We haven’t forgotten about you; don’t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there’s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, *however*, since I don’t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., **your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other *physical* (operative word here) affection**. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won’t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want…*rubs hands together deviously*), whatever—just show us that you’re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.

As one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we’ve put together for this event, you’d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won’t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. 

As King Théoden, son of Thengel, said: *“Let them come.”*

Also, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we’re fresh out of fucks—we’re giving out pizza, bitches.

**TL;DR:** Start at the top.

**Special thanks**

I would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I’ve come across in real life.

My deepest thanks and gratitude to [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack) for coming up with the whole Valentine’s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guy—he deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadn’t done so, I would’ve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I can’t thank you enough.

I would also like to thank [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread) who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably would’ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole “how” aspect to this endeavor and I really don’t know how I would’ve figured this thing out without him.

[Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch). Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there’s a fair amount of magic involved.

Last but not least, let’s give it up for our fearless mods, [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [Rollout]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), and [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause. Pasta also deserves our thanks for his efforts in promoting this event and coordinating with mods from other subreddits to get the word out.

**TL;DR2:** No, you have to read this one too.

Edit: Props to snang for putting up the sweet layout.

Edit2: Work now, might try to squeeze one in at lunch. People I'm still waiting on to hear back on, I'll check in from time to time. Other givers, have at it.

Edit3: Just checking in on break, looking good so far. Keep up the good work givers. Also, all you foreveralone folks, after browsing all of your pics, how the hell are *any* of you single? You're all gorgeous!

Edit4: Quick check in on break. Good news for requestors, to be honest, I don't even think we've given away half of what we pooled together. Foreveralone crowd, you should take advantage of this opportunity and browse the other singles, there are some lookers out there. Pizza and internet dating: the best of both worlds!

It's important that people are getting fed and enjoying life. To the special person that got me pizza, the other day when I was so upset, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH! And Thank you to PastafarianTwit (he knows why)** 


**Edit #2- Please keep trying and if you can spare it, help someone else eat tonight. Oh yeah and if you select the Pizza Tracker, go with the Island theme. It was hilarious and relaxing when I used it!**

**Edit#3- If you're on the East Coast, most Domino's are probably either closed now or closing pretty soon. That doesn't mean if you live elsewhere you can't keep trying. Feed yourself, feed a friend, feed a stranger! Tonight is pretty cold here on the east coast. Just imagine being homeless AND being hungry on a night like this. Do what you can...

 So I sat my folder/book down and walked out of line, picked up the straws (individually wrapped), placed them back in the cup, then back on the counter. She said thanks, I smiled and returned to my place in line.

When I placed my regular order, they doubled the meat even tho I said no thanks, which annoyed me at first, but then at the checkout, she asked what I wanted to drink. I said no thanks, she asked again.

They ended up giving me a large drink and a double meat sandwich free! They wouldn't take my money, and when I thanked them and walked off, she said ""Don't forget your chips!""..

I've decided that tonight is the night that I will tell my parents that I am gay. My aunt knows and she will be coming over later today, because I'm so afraid things will get out of control. My mother and father have made it clear that homosexuality is a sin and that they would want nothing to do with me if I ever decided to be gay. My father has even gone through my room when I'm out of the house. I feel like I have no privacy and nothing left to lose if they find out. Hopefully someone out there has been in this position before. I'm nervous, scared, and feeling like this is going to be the last meal I have in the house. I know there are others out there who may have a real need for a meal tonight, but I'm simply here to request a pizza as comfort food. My name is Ben and I live in Bellevue, WA. I am proud of who I am and I am no longer going to continue hiding the truth. Thank you for reading my wall of text.

I didn't know where to post my update either in the comments or to edit this post. Well, my parents came home and my aunt came over. I told my parents that I had something important to share with them and that I wanted to be completely honest with them. After telling both of them I was gay, dad began screaming at me. Mom just sat there for a minute before she started crying. When I saw how upset she was, I started to cry too. Dad meanwhile was telling me how disgusting I am and that all gay people should burn in hell. I tried to calm him down, but at one point he raised his hand at me and my aunt told him not to hit me. My aunt got in between us and I really think he would have hit me. He took a deep breath and stormed out of the house. Mom got up and ran to her bedroom. My aunt said that I did the right thing and that she was going to speak with my mom. I'm sitting here now shaking, because I don't feel safe. I feel like I've done something horrible. I can still hear mom crying. I shouldn't have done this. I've destroyed my family tonight. 

I don't feel safe staying here, so I'll be staying at my aunts house tonight. I'm hoping mom and dad will at least talk to me tomorrow. Neither of my parents have ever lifted a hand to me and I'm worried that things got out of control so fast. I have my bag packed and I'm ready to leave. Thank you all for your support and kind words.

In order to win in the contest,  you have to go to Dominos FB page, 'Like' it, add their app, and then get the highscore in a pizza-arcade-shooting game with Noid. It's not too hard, while I was playing the highscore was usually around 300,000.

The trick is, shoot the pizzas/tomatoes as fast as possible, because they are worth more. Don't hit anything with the Noid face on it, or Noid himself, or not a tomato or pizza. I'm not sure if there was a bonus for hitting pizzas so many times in a row. You have a 'Bomb' meter in the upper right, fill and use it as much as possible. The games are short, the maximum amount of times you can use the Bomb meter is about 3. Hit all the tomatoes too, if you don't, you lose points. Practice makes perfect! Also, you may have to refresh the page after the first game, sometimes it had a game running behind the waiting screen, and it wouldn't count your score if that happened. You can tell by the music.

It took me about 5-10 minutes to finally win. I had to give them my email, and they sent the giftcard code and pin to my email within a few minutes. It's only $10, only works on their website for ordering. No expiration date. Also, only in the US, and you have to be 18 or older to play. We tried with my little brother (14) and no can do.

I see requests and posts deleted after they've been fulfilled (by me and by others), and the same people requesting again after a week.

But it got me thinking... why pizza? Why not gift cards for grocery stores or something? And I think I get it. And maybe if someone sees this who wonders the same thing, they'll get it, too.

At the times that I've been struggling financially (and it's pretty frequent at the end of a pay period), if I were to receive a gift card for a grocery store or find a $20 bill, I'd be spending it on ramen, day-old bread, and anything else cheap that can last. And that's cool, and I'd be grateful, but I'd still be kinda bummed about going through a rough spot.

But pizza is normal. Pizza is happy. Pizza is a tiny, relatively inexpensive luxury. You get a pizza delivered to your house, and you're still struggling, but you don't *feel* poor. You have **pizza**.

And then, a couple of weeks later, you're doing a little better financially, and you remember how happy that pizza made you, so you want to make someone else feel like that, so you pay it forward. And then someone else gets to feel a little better about life.

So why pizza? Because it's more than just feeding someone who's hungry. You get to give them a little slice of normal and happy along with filling their tummy with warm, cheesy goodness. I'm telling everyone I know about this subreddit, in the hopes that they will spread the happiness.

Read towards the bottom for the good news..... I always tend to give the bad first.

I would say that 99% of the folks here that post in need, are actually in need. However we all know that some are going to take advantage. 

I heard from two redditors that were buying giftcards via CashStar. It turns out that one redditor has been posting a lot here, and got $100 in cards in two days. 

I called CashStar, and while I knew they would not release the name, they did confirm the email, and that this person used different names during all the times involved.  To break it down, the same email address got 100 US dollars in gift cards from 4 different posts, yet used different ""real"" names to acquire a pizza.

I respect reddit rules, and will not post the email address, but his reddit name is AustinYQM . I have confirmed this information, and wanted to be sure before I posted this. Any questions about this please pm me.

CashStar even asked a few redditors if they were from Random Acts Of Pizza, and they support our cause!

This also tells us that CashStar has our back!!!! They noticed when someone was getting repeats, and said something!!! I told her to keep up the good work!!! She will be looking in here tonight, and loves what we have going on!!!


**On to good news:** The manager at CashStar said they have checked out our site, love it! They also said that a way to do international gift cards is in the works, and told me who to email to hopefully speed it along to help us help others..

After talking to them, and their cooperation, all I can say is CashStar Is awesome, and they will be here later tonight to look more into the site!!!!

Our hope is that this will discourage a lot of people from gaming the system. As snang put it, if someone goes through all the trouble to fool this for a 10 dollar pizza let em have it.....

The way it works is simple. If a giver wants a verification from a person who requests, the requester goes to the site, enters their email, and gets a code. They then give this code to the giver. 

The only info the giver sees is the email address, and how many times a person is suspected of getting a pizza. The info is based upon many factors, ip address, cookies, browser type, OS, and more. Givers can see if the person just got the code, as it will say requests in the hour, and the day, and so on, and have a history of other requests if applicable....

**This is not mandatory use ** it is just an optional system for people to use to help circumvent abuse. 


I hope by saying we know this is not fool proof, but is an improvement, will keep the griping to a minimum.

Your incredible acts of generosity have kept us growing at an incredible pace. In the short time I've been here, the subreddit has nearly doubled in subscribers. We have been featured in several media outlets, numerous /r/bestof threads, and countless person to person referrals of the ""magic"" that goes on here. All this attention has brought it's share of more incredible givers, new requesters, and just like anything else, dishonest people that are looking for ways to game and scam the system. 



**The only real way to combat these lowlifes is with an increased awareness in verifying who you are giving to.**

List of things to look for and best practices:

* **Account Name** - Verify that the person you are intending to give to is the person you are corresponding with. **The easiest way to do this is to PM them first!!!** I personally will not reply to any request related PMs unless I first initiated it. Use the [messages view in your inbox](http://i.imgur.com/mFOTk7Z.png) to help with this. It puts a conversation in a thread, with your portion in green text. The nature of way Reddit is setup allows for easy anonymity among its users. One of the things that makes Reddit great for some subs but troubling for ours is that throwaway accounts are so easy to create. People who are scamming generally create accounts similar to the ones intended to be given to by givers (for instance I am /u/OliverTw1st, a scammer might make an account called /u/0liverTw1st in an attempt to trick the giver.) The vast majority of transactions that occur are by sending e-gift cards directly to the recipient's email address and once they have gotten the e-gift card, it is used almost immediately. **The moderators and admins can't help once the order has been placed, and usually the companies that the GC are ordered through won't offer refunds or reversals onces the GC has been redeemed. If you feel you have been scammed, contact the GC company immediately!**

* **Account History** - Specifically AGE. **Scammers accounts are typically less than a day old, because they were created to look similar to the recipient that they just found out about.** We enforce 
a one month old account age minimum for posts and encourage gifters to use one when choosing a recipient as well. It takes less than 10 seconds to click on someone's account name and [verify their age in the top right of their profile screen](http://i.imgur.com/UONGNa7.png). If you use something like[ RES \(Reddit Enhancement Suite\)](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/), you can just[ mouse hover over their name](http://i.imgur.com/oHJtMt4.png) and it will tell you the account age as well. 

* **Contests/Offers** - When you choose a recipient for your contest/offer, don't announce it publicly until you have made contact (by PM'ing them first) with the intended recipient. You can edit your post to add something like ""Winner chosen, PM'ing them now"" and go back and fill in the winner or comment on their comment in the thread once you have made the transaction. **It's a lot harder for scammers to impersonate someone if they don't know who to impersonate.**

* **When Responding on a thread** - Use the receiver's account name somewhere in your public response to the thread. If it's someone's request, say ""PMing you now (account name)"". If it's a contest/offer you are doing, you can also do that or edit your post to reflect you you gave to. **This helps us track the people who delete their posts to try to hide history of receiving.** They cannot remove your comments or posts that have their account name listed in them.

* **When you've completed a transaction** - Message the mods. Please include a link to the thread. We can then assign you and the receiver the appropriate flair. It also helps us establish a record when investigating deleted posts. 
 
* **When in doubt** - Message the mods **BEFORE making a transaction** if you have any questions. We are here to help make the RAoP experience a good one. [Message us from the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) or stop in to the [IRC Channel](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com/chat). There is usually someone around that can help. We do volunteer our time between work, sleeping and life in general, but we are pretty good at getting back to you within a reasonable amount of time. We will do what we can to help but as stated earlier, once the transaction has been completed, we can't really do anything about it. 

[**Random Acts of Pizza**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza/) is an amazing community made up of Redditors from all over the globe and all walks of life, brought together by the simple fact that **MOAR pizza makes the world a better place**. RAoP has the most subscriptions of any Random Acts subreddit and is in my opinion one of the top (and easily the most thoughtful) reasons why Reddit is such an awesome social experiment in the digital age. **Our success can be solely pointed to our givers that make our subreddit such an amazing place and their generosity is responsible for helping to restore people's faith in humanity on a daily basis.** 

In the year or so that I have been involved with RAoP, I have seen unbelievable acts of kindness on behalf of you all. From the truly random (and sometimes bizarre) request for pizza fulfilled, helping a fellow Redditor who is down on their luck, contests that spark the creatively genius and hilarious entries from participants, and most recently the tremendous out pour of relief during tragedies. We may only make the news from time to time, but I have the privilege of witnessing it every day. I am honored and grateful to be a part of RAoP and **it's people like yourselves that I have to thank for showing me just how amazing humans can be to eachother.**

Since folks have referenced the meta posts as saving them from a scammer, I thought I'd do another one.

The biggest scam we have is when we have a transaction and someone uses a similar username to PM the gifter and try to intercept the pizza giftcard transaction.

Example:  

[REQUEST] by derpkins

Nice redditor offering to fulfill request gets a PM from a user with the name of ""derpkns.""  See how those usernames don't match up?

Scammers transpose letters or use another method to make their username closely reflect the original requester's username.  

The best way to combat this is to PM the user yourself after you post in the comments that you want to help.  

**TL;DR:  ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK THE USERNAME OF THE PERSON YOU ARE GIFTING TO MAKE SURE IT MATCHES UP TO THE PERSON YOU INTENDED TO GIVE TO**

Contests are great fun, and it's enjoyable to see someone's delight at their request being fulfilled.

Even without giving or receiving any pies, RAoP makes me smile and brightens my day. That's why I lurk here!

But… (And this has come up before) most of the requests on RAoP are people pulling for sympathy to get their slices. As of this posting, there are **38** requests on the front page of RAoP. **1** of those requests is a service being offered in exchange for a pie. Cool, that's like a reverse contest! **5** of those requests are truly random with neutral^\* titles. An overwhelming **32** of those requests have titles that are written in a way that begs sympathy on behalf of a viewer.

^\* (Note: If it wasn't clear to me if a title was neutral or seemed written to elicit sympathy, I categorized it based on the text within. If a request appeared random, I didn't look closer.)

Is everybody okay with this?

RAoP is not /r/foodpantry or /r/assistance, the purpose for RAoP is **Random** giving. Personally, I'd like to see that. Random.

Instead, I experience a numbing effect as my eyes glaze over constant pleas for Pizza, advertising the sort of dire need that neither I, nor a Pizza, can begin to address.

So I ask again, **32** of **38** current requests are not, in the spirit of this subreddit, Random.

Poor dude looked so sad, kinda touched me a little. I felt like I should do something for this poor man. Obviously approaching middle age, and for reasons unknown stuck working this crappy job. Or maybe it's a second job that he has to work at night to pay for medcine for a sick child... who knows. The look on this face shows it could be many things, nothing or that he was simply having a bad, bad day. 

A few meters down the road I saw his car and realise he'd delivered to our house many times (it's the best pizza place in town). Tipping in my country just doesn't happen. It's not protocol, so on my way out of the store I remembered this thread and thought: ""Why not an act of kindness for the one who brings us such nice, soothing treats"". So, as I walk past his car, I glance around to make sure he's not around and slip a $10 in the windshield wiper (all the cash I had). Then, like a creature of the night, I slink back into the shadows. 

I walk up the street a little, to the corner of my road and stand in the shadow of a large house where I can see his car clearly, but cannot be seen. There are other people walking around and I want to make sure he gets the money, not some passer by. 

After a while I see him emerge from the house he was in. Slouching along slowly, cap brim bent down, almost vertical. His tall frame hunched and a red pizza carrier limply dangling from his right hand. He approaches the car from the front. I'd put the money on the drivers side to make sure he sees it, at least when he's in the car it would be obvious, but from his angle of approach, and the fact that the car is directly under a street light, I can tell that he will spot it as soon as he's within 4 or 5 feet of the car. 

As he gets closer I tense up. What if he spots me? What will his reaction to finding free money be? Will I make someones day just that little bit more bearable?  All of these things flash though my mind and suddenly I feel that this gesture has become all about me and making myself feel good! I'm conflicted. My conscience pulled this way and that. Did I do this for the pizza guy, for myself, or both? 

The last things I remember are a thundering of deep horns and flashing lights. Have I been spotted, or is it my confuddled mind playing tricks on me? I stare into the lights and see teeth. Familiar teeth. They boom at me ""Hey, Detrituss! What are you doing in the shadows! you look like big scary man yes!! HaHaHa!!"". It's my flatmate in his car. He spotted me as he rounded the corner and began tooting and shouting. I glance down the road and see the Pizza man, obviously shocked at the commotion, quickly get in his car and drive away swiftly. As he goes past I can make out through the glare of high-beams the flimsy blue ten dollar note pressed against the glass. 

I hope he sees it before it blows away. ",,False,,t5_2s7wq,1345939951.0,,,True,t3_y961t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/y961t/inverse_acts_of_pizza/,

(Details inside),87,6,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pn63t/announcing_the_first_annual_raop_vday_giveaway/,"So today we're announcing the great [RAoP](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza) Valentine's giveaway.  On Valentine's Day, 2/14, we're planning a massive gift card giveaway.  We know that some redditors are foreveralone, so we'd like to try and brighten up your otherwise depressing Valentine's holiday.  I don't have the exact numbers, but we've definitely got over $1000 lined up for sure.  This is going to be MASSIVE, friends.

**The Details:**

If you are interested in throwing some money into the pot for donations, please PM me (PastafarianTwit) and I can fill you in the details and put you through to the official coordinator, should that be necessary. Keep in mind I'm employed full-time and a full-time grad student, I might be slow to respond, but I WILL respond. Should you wish to sign up for a pizza, we plan on putting up the post for entry on Valentine's morning.  This post is NOT the post to reply to if you want a pizza, this is just to give people ample notification because it's going to be HUGE and we want as many people involved as possible, givers and receivers alike.  Also, I'm hoping that a few more redditors get inspired by what we're doing and decide to pitch in. =)

Unfortunately, this rules out all of you non-US individuals, as these gift cards are US only (sorry, but when you're sending out this many gift cards, you want to make it as easy as possible.)  International people are always welcome on RAoP, however.  These gift cards will be in amounts of $10 for singles and $20 for couples. (If you're a couple requesting $20, we ask that you post a picture of both of you holding a sign with the date and time [Hell, maybe this is a good way to find a Valentine, eh?])

**Testimonials**

""Due to a garbled interstellar space transmission we have a surplus of pizza gift cards. They're absolutely no use to use in the space future! So, we're just giving them away!""  -DownSouthDread (he's high right now)

""Valentine's Day is one of those days where life is either great or crappy.  It's either a reminder of what love you do have, or the love you don't.  After having donated my first few pizzas on RAoP, I realized how much doing one little thing can make such an impact on someone who feels like life isn't going their way.  It wasn't hard to think of a day where more people might feel that way than any other. After seeing all of the other great people on RAoP who donate when they can, I realized that Valentine's Day was the perfect time to get all of the donators together for a huge event the likes of which RAoP hadn't seen.""  -RobSpewack

""It's all good""  -chupanibre25

""Valentine's Day is supposed to be a day of love and friendship, but for many it can royally suck.  It's my hope that some of the pizzas I gift today will help ease some of that...well...suckiness!""  -tanyagal2

""pizza is awesome.""  -snang

""You don't need a reason to help someone""  -moshimoochi

""Shut up and eat some pizza.""  -PastafarianTwit

""To donate makes for a great feeling of peace and having that knowledge you've brightened someone's day up. For Valentine's Day, this is one of the greatest days where one can feel better with a gift, for those who're alone or are couples. This day's also a day of remembering those you love that have passed on. Keep the flame burning, everyone. May the Gods and Goddesses keep you safe on your Path.""  -KeiroD

Not long thereafter, Jetboyterp gave me ANOTHER one, just for being *close* in a random competition he held - so this is the** thank you** part! Thanks to those three, and to everyone who makes RAoP possible, you're all amazing.

The **apology** comes because, a month down the line, I'm still unemployed, and still haven't been able to return the favor; I'll be moving soon because I can't afford rent, and bringing my job hunt to a city with better prospects (I love my town, but if I'm going to be effectively homeless and unemployed, I figure it's smarter to do it somewhere with a better chance of changing that; besides, there is no chance for advancement in my field (culinary) in a town this size, whereas in the city I'll be able to work in a 'real' kitchen). What this ads up to is that not only have I not given pizza yet, but I don't see it happening anywhere near as soon as I'd like, and that's the apology.

The **promise** part is that I do stand by my word, eventually, and as I see it, I owe this community 4 pizzas - one for each of the people who helped me (or gifted in their name, if they prefer, I'll figure that out when I get there ;) and one just cause I really want to give pizza (If delivery places took foodstamps man... ;). 

Anyhow, just felt like putting that out there. No more requests, because I've already received a ton (though I'll probably keep entering on random offers, or non-need based competitions, because hey, pizza is awesome...), and it looks like I won't be able to Offer for a while, but I wanted to make a post to all of you saying: Stay Awesome (you're pretty good at it).

I went in to the closest Pizza Hut, pulled out my laptop and asked how exactly I could use it - dude behind the counter said just to pull it up &amp; he'd take care of it.

He comes out 20 minutes later with my order, tells his coworkers I'm covered after taking down the number, hands me the pie &amp; I leave.

As I piled into my car, I took a look at the receipt, I realize he entered it as some sort of coupon and didn't charge me at all. I'm convinced he knew what he was doing, because it came out in conversation when he asked me why I didn't have a printer that I'd been on the streets for over a month. 

So I get a bright idea, I'm going to pay everyone's kindness forward. I drive to another pizza hut location, this time with just the number in hand, not wanting someone else to take pity, but to actually pay. I get another pie, go to find the nearest homeless, not hard in Austin unfortunately, and give it to the two fellas who look like they were starved. I explained where it came from, they thanked me, &amp; we all went out separate ways.

***The Needs***

Please PM me with the basic requisites; verification code, email address. I wouldn't mind hearing about what is happening in your world either, proof of which is entirely up to you. I give when I can to food banks and shelters but it's rare to hear back.

I'd prefer new pizza-needs but won't necessarily ignore pizza-hads. Since these are email cards location doesn't matter but to make it easy, considering the number being offered here, please keep this inside the three biggies (Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns). It's your choice but make sure who is nearby.


***The If***

If you do end up with a pizza please consider posting a picture or something here to make this a proper party. :)

If this goes well I plan to do it again, though I can't say when (my own funds come in irregular lump sums). So if you don't hear back

Tonight I went in as I do everynight, put $10 my tank, grab two gatorades an a pack of newport shorts.  This cashier is my age and I can tell he's a stand up guy so we're always shooting the shit about pretty much anything.  He was telling me about how he was bummed that he was working all Christmas Eve and Christmas day.  I felt bad so when I got to work I placed and order for closing time (Major chain, It's not free :/), once the time came I hooked his taco pizza up with extras of all the fixings and hid a gift card under the pizza.  Paid for it, punched out and took off to the gas station.  Man, I could tell by the look on his face how much it meant to him that someone out there did this for him, I just wish I could see the reaction on his face when he finds the gift card.  I'm not here for any kind of applaud or hoorahs, just wanted to share that giving feels great and much respect and kudos to those that do RAoP.

Hope you are all doing well this fine day/night.  I wanted to ask for a minute of your time to help keep RAoP the happy, upbeat and random place that is should be.

Most regulars are aware of the recent coverage done for RAoP.  Those who aren't, our very own Gadianton (creator of the sub along with other mods assistance) Anyhow, Gadianton was just interviewed about RAoP.  The story will soon hit the waves worldwide bringing a mass amount of both new requestors and givers.

Lately, a lot of questioning/name calling has been tossed out at new members.  We all at one point were new to reddit overall.  Granted *you* may not have signed up for a free pizza but, someone else may have because this is the place they heard about and wanted to try out.  Maybe they join, post a request 5 minutes later and then they explore and learn more about reddit..good for them.  Maybe they will only join for pizza, again..good for them.  

This story no doubt will bring a growing crowd to our group.  I'd like to ask you all to embrace and make these new members feel welcome.  At the very least, don't make them feel like they are on trail in court.

The story they will see is about an amazing group of people reaching out and giving to others.  We don't want to give off the impression that we don't like/appreciate/accept newbies.  We want everyone to feel welcome to post here as often as their heart desires.  Thats the cool thing, you can post for whatever reason, how ever many times.  Only ask that you be honest and don't delete posts that have been answered.  

I understand and respect the *reasoning* for the doubts, questions and concerns.  Believe me I do.  However, not every new member is set out to rip you off for a pizza.  We may get some that aren't on the up and up but, don't allow this to allow you to take it out on or assume this about all members.

I am posting this after speaking with Gadianton about the happenings of late.  This community is a wonderfully awesome place.  I'd hate to see it become a place where everyone and everything is questioned or second guessed.

Sure, you may find reason or suspect something about a member.  Should this happen, please privately take your concerns to our wonderful mods.  Copy the link and send it to them with a quick ""hey I think they are ripping people off and *insert proof* *this* is why and allow them to handle it.

We are lucky in the fact that not only our members are awesome, so are our moderators.  This is the type thing they are here for, please bring it to them, allow them to look into it/discuss amongst themselves and do as they see fit on a one by one basis.  

If you are a giver who wants to see proof, by all means ask for it.  You want a picture, say so.  Also realize not everyone has the ability to provide pictures and their lack of ability to do so, doesn't make them someone not on the up and up.  Be reasonable, remember there is another human with feelings on the other side of the screen.  Think of how you'd feel if someone said/did something the way you are about to, would you like it? If not, chances are the newbie won't either.  

Nobody forces anyones hand in giving.  You give to who you choose for whatever reason you choose.  At the end of the day, if you don't like a repeat requestor, a new member just don't give to those people.  Find someone you *do* want to give to.  No need to call people out or make a person feel uncomfortable about doing just what we as a sub say they can do.  Ask whenever/for whatever.

Not even solid hypotheses, or firm opinions, or unbreakable laws. Further, they're just MY thoughts and shouldn't be taken to represent anyone else here, although I'd appreciate other people's thoughts too.

RAoP is awesome. I'm sure you knew that already. Requesters have the chance to be gifted with tasty pizza, and givers get the chance to help someone out and feel warm and fuzzy about it.

Sometimes I see a lot of unanswered requests and it makes me wonder why some requests get offers but not others. 

Here are my thoughts: 

* The people who give pizza, on the most part, aren’t spectacularly rich or anything. They’re people who are doing ok, or who have an extra bit of money this week, or have a bit of discretionary income. They’re people who are not buying that new pair of shoes/new game/cup of coffee/magazine/expensive food because it’s more fun and rewarding to give pizza. Givers can’t afford to give to everyone, so every giver has their own criteria (and WHATEVER that criteria is, it’s a perfectly fine criteria).

* Posts with only one line requesting a pizza may be more likely to be overlooked because perhaps it’s easy to draw a line between how much effort someone puts into requesting a pizza to how much they want it.

* Similarly, people with accounts which are hours or days old, or only post on RAoP may be overlooked because they may be creating the impression that all the requester is interested in is pizza.

* People are empathetic – they like to hear stories and feel connected and involved. Perhaps telling a bit about yourself and your situation may help people connect with you. If your account is a new account, this may be particularly important, as there’s not even a reddit history to look at. Let people know what a pizza would mean to you. Perhaps you could describe your job, or your family, or the things that you like to do/watch/play. Maybe your burning passion for alpacas is shared by another alpaca enthusiast who happens to have some extra money from an alpaca sale. Make the reader feel as though you’re not just a screen-name looking for a quick feed, but a real, live, feeling person whose day would be brightened by a pizza or two.

* Speaking as someone who’s given a couple of pizzas away, there’s nothing more I like than seeing a photo afterwards! (It can be via PM, and it doesn’t even need to show you in it.) I like to know that the pizza got there safely and that you’re enjoying it. Your joy is my reward. Also, *please* and *thank you* are wonderful words – free to use and they make the world a nicer place. Please, use them liberally.

**TL;DR** – nothing, these are just some idle thoughts. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT take them as RAoP gospel or apply them as though they were! Oh, and don’t be mean to each other. That’s not nice. :P

So far there has been only a little response, and looking like it will happen, but not going really fast. We hoping this is about to change......read on....

In the past couple days we have done a few interviews with larger news networks. We will reveal the links when the articles are published (should be this coming week).

This will increase our numbers for sure, and could encourage CashStar, and some of the pizza chains, to get on board with us.


So far in this community everyone has done great in sorting the needs, from the ones that don't need. We know it will continue like that.




** Regarding New accounts**: A new account can be a person in need just as much as an account that has been around for 5 years. If you feel more comfortable in asking the person to provide proof of some kind do so, preferably in private. Please always suggest that they pizza it forward when they can.

While we know a few may try to abuse this system, not many will. We already know that CashStar will let you know if you are trying to give to someone who has received a couple pizza gift cards already.


**---------**

There has been some suggestion lately to bring back the down arrow. I removed it originally due to seeing every post downvoted, sometimes multiple times. The community knows how to downvote if needed, and thus far it seems to have been working great. In my opinion it would be a bad idea to bring it back, but if enough of the community disagrees with me the arrow will reappear. 


It has been suggested that we possibly do a pool of pizza cards to be given away when our subscribers hit 5000. Thoughts on this? 

Thoughts, and suggestions, as we are about to grow even more in numbers?

Today, my professor offered my class a chance for a pizza party.

If we can get at least 1,000 likes for his non-profit's Facebook page, he'll buy us all pizza.

If we can get 2,000, he'll throw in cupcakes.

If we can get 3,000, he'll throw in cold soda.

This is the Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Big-Sell/130452977004303

It's a cool event he holds once a year where entrepreneurs have an opportunity to pitch their idea and win a chance to see that idea realized.

At the time he offered this, the number of likes was roughly 415.

Here's what I'm going to do for you guys:

Automatically, I'm going to give away a $10 gift card to whoever comes closest to the number I've assigned to that amount by 7PM EST tonight.

Then, I'll give away a $25 gift card for every 1,000 increase in likes from 415 up to 3,415.

So, at 1,415 I'll give away the first $25 gift card to who ever is closest to the number I've assigned to that gift card.

The best part for you is we have a couple of weeks to get those 1,000-3,000 likes. So that part of the contest will stay open as long as it can.

One number per person, please. I wanted to come up with a way to give those who actually ""Like"" the page a chance to pick two numbers, but I couldn't come up with a decent way of determining that. If you have a suggestion, I'll take it.

EDIT: The $10 gift card has been won by *drumroll* rebelfeather12 with a guess of 2424. The number was 2415. Congrats, rebelfeather12! Remember, everyone else, that the remaining gift cards are still in play!

Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.  
  
Shortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's ""friend"" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the ""friend"" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.

Naturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's ""friends"" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is ""still on tag"" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also ""on tag"". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.

By this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, ""thanks anyway""s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.

Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!

While we still have far more being helped than the amount of scammers, it is getting annoying (understatement of the year) getting pm's, and mod messages constantly with suspected scammers (most are not). 

My idea (in case you didn't want to click the favors link) is this: 

 verify ip's. We have a site we can host this on.

The idea is to have the requester of the pizza go to the site, enter their email address, the site auto grabs the ip, and gives the person a code. The person gives the code to the person who offers the pizza, and they can see the history of that ip address...

I think it should be simple, but I am not sure how to do it.

While we KNOW this will not deter all, it should take care of most....

If anyone here knows, please let me know, and write it up.


As always we welcome ideas, and feedback from the community.

That's right, not a pizza, a pizza party. As in $100 worth of pizza from the big three (Papa John's, Domino's, Pizza Hut) of your choice. 

Up front I'll give you the terms if you win. You have to be willing to give me your address, (or at least the address where you want your pizza delivered to), and a name to give the driver. Why? Because I'm not going to give you $100 gift card. I'm going to have $100 worth of pizza (&amp; breadsticks, sodas, whatever) delivered to you. If I give you a $100 gift card you'll either sell that badboy for like $60 thinking you'd rather buy the latest p.o.s. video game or whatever than enjoy my pizza party. Or you'll have one pizza a week for like the next two months. Well that's not how this works. If you win, you're having a damn pizza party. And I expect you to post pictures of what a good damn time you and your friends, or you &amp; the hobos on the street if your're friendless, or just you if you're super fat and glutonous, had at the pizza party.

Now how does one win said pizza party? Well like I said this is in celebration of my divorce. Am I am happy to be divorced? No. Divorce is a sad thing. Am I happy the times of constant argument and tension are coming to an end? Absolutely. Do you care about my thoughts on divorce? Look, do you want a freaking free pizza party or not? Anyways, being newly divorced I am now looking forward to meeting new and interesting women. So the winner will be the person who posts a link to a picture or video of an attractive woman doing something interesting. See the FAQ for further details /  requirements. BLUF is it has to be your pic/video that you took of you or someone you know.

Since this will require some coordination / effort the length of the contest will be longer than the usual here. The contest will run until 1PM/1300 Hawaiian Standard Time (where I live) on the 31st of the month (AUG). I will select the winner later that day and PM them. Once the winner has acknowledged the PM I will announce the winner publicly.

EDIT*** Since it's come up a couple times..I'll work with outside the U.S. I'll work with outside the ""big three."" We'll just have to figure out how to do that. Everyone may play.

Also Since people are asking about how they'll get enough people for $100 of pies...I mean that's sort of the point. I could give you two pizzas  or whatever but I want you to have an epic time. Invite everyone you know.

Well, it's true, I AM terribly hungry, but I've got a ""hot"" date with the Tin Man later who has promised to treat me to a lovely dinner tonight.

But now that I've got your attention, I TRULY am in need, and figured this is as good as time as any to call in any favors I'm owed!! I am calling on all you good people out there who have offered many a time in the past to send me a pizza (and whom I have turned down) to use those monies INSTEAD towards helping send a Mod on RAOP, namely, CAYUCOSKID, to South America this summer where he is volunteering for Habitat for Humanity.
And, lol, I have ""conveniently"" copied and pasted his donation page in the body of this text:  http://share.habitat.org/argentinaongteam20122 

So, kindly, I ask you fellow RAOPians, please, please, if you have a few extra dollars this week, please, please, donate to CayucosKid so he can volunteer and help out some needy families and make this world a better place.

And for all those who do NOT have credit cards, please, please, PM me and I will give you my Paypal addy or home address.

Let's all back this worthwhile cause and come together as a group.


Oh, and if you want, I can and will provide a verification code.

And for our dear, Ms. AlliOops, please and thank you :)

It was a great moment and I'm sure it'll become an annual thing.  But let's get down to [business](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGOohBytKTU).

Lately there's been a lot of scamming going on.  We at Random_Acts_Of_Pizza are not responsible with how you spend your money (because it's random!), however, we also are not responsible if you get scammed from lack of caution.  I've decided to type up a bitchin' list for you guys- just some things to keep in the back of your mind.


Here's a list of things you can do to avoid this:

1. **Look at the username's post history.**  We cannot stress this enough.  Click on the username you're curious about and it will bring up their history.  Feel free to read into it.  If they don't seem like a person you like- don't give to em.  Just because you said, ""PM Me"" does not mean, ""I'm now responsible to buy you a pizza.""  Do your research.

2.  **Message the moderators.**  If you have a question about anything at all; hit up the mod mail or message anyone of us.  We'll be more than happy to assist you in the giving process.

3.  **Flair.**  The flair we give out on each username is in direct correlation with how many pizzas they receive or give.  If someone is requesting a pizza- and they have customized flair, it's probably safe to give it to them.  However, don't be afraid to again- (Number 2) Message the moderators.

4.  **Sob stories.**  This is not **Charitable**_acts_of_pizza.  But that does not mean we don't appreciate giving to those in need.  If you really want to be sure that you don't get swayed in the wrong direction- don't let people influence you with sob stories.  Give out the pizza randomly- then you know it was random.  TL;DR: [**No sob story, no cry~**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYoLGiW7muc&amp;feature=related)

5.  **Username games.**  My name is moshimoochi.  Some people might make an account ""rnoshimoochi"" but if you capitalize letters- RNOSHIMOOCHI.  This is the internet people.  Take everything with a grain of salt.  If someone posts a request- click on **THEIR** username and message them.  Demand they reply to the PM you sent them.  Then you have a paper trail and know the username is the one you have been corresponding with.

Feel free to post more tips and hints in this thread and I'll add them to the top accordingly.",,False,,t5_2s7wq,False,,Moshi,True,t3_pst64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pst64/announcement_lately_theres_been_a_lot_of_scamming/,moderator

Though we have yet to decide where any money we win will be going but its definitely going towards something good(*its up to you where it goes. Why not a share of $50k worth of pizzas/pizzae/pizzaz?*)

Okay so lets get down to it. You can read up about the [scavenger hunt here](http://scavenger.freelancer.com/)  and as you may notice they have been kind enough as to put up a Reddit FAQ for us. Our team is called **Reddit** so if you are interested register and search for the team.

Now you might be wondering what are we supposed to do in the competition? Well there is a huge task list, *141 task to be precise*, and completing tasks score us points. There are a wide range of tasks here is a quick example:

* 4chan steals all the good memes from Reddit. Go on /b/ and get an apology. Wear underpants.

* Bring me Jackie Chan

* Raise money for your team charity in a creative way 
[1 point per $10, max 100 points. Must provide a receipt so we can verify the donation and photos of your event]

* We’d like to know a little more about you. Particularly, we want to know what makes your team tick. Create a page on tumblr.com about your team ethos and history. Get it ranked in google for 'marshmallow'. 
[100/n points, where n is the page in google.com where your blog is found at the time of judging]

**Phew that was quite a few** So as you see most of these questions are well possible to achieve by Reddit and most likely impossible to achieve by another team. There are **141** tasks and I hope more of Reddit will want to help out and cross them off the list.

So how much money are we competing for? We are competing for a share of $50,000 and daily $1,000 prizes and we will use this money to do some good. It is up to you what we do with it. Everyone will get to vote on what to do with it as long as it is for a good cause.

I'm a regular denizen over at /r/Assistance, and signed on to RAOP when they started it up some 6 or 7 months ago as I recall. I have been a regular contributor of pizzas here (about $1,140 worth, according to my receipts), which I try to give anonymously when possible. Recently, I've hit some financial snags which have forced me to back off (for just a while, hopefully), but I expect to return to pizza-donating when my life gets regularized again. I say all this (on my throwaway account) just to give some background so that people can evaluate my comments and accept or toss them as they wish.

1) RAOP has: some people who give regularly; some people who give occasionally; some people who have given once or twice, as they have been able to afford it; and some people who would like to give, but cannot afford it.

2) RAOP has: some people who are in need and are asking for help, even though it hurts their pride; some people who aren't in desperate straits but are hoping for some comfort food instead of their regular boring necessarily restricted menu; some people who think ""what the heck"" and give it a try and are just amazed that there are people out there still who give a hoot enough about strangers to buy them a pizza.

3) RAOP has: some trolls who are bored and like to cause problems, the Internet equivalent of taggers and vandals; some poseur-vigilantes who get their kicks by imposing their judgments in a public forum.

The publicity we got here most definitely caused an increase in #3, but also in #'s 1 and 2. So be it. (Though in the future, my personal preference would be to politely decline any interviews/offers for more publicity by the mainstream media).

The removal of the downvote was a classically liberal attempt to soften the pride-injury of having to ask for help. (I say ""liberal"" in the academic sociological sense, and am not making a value-judgment about it. Recent conservative thought has usurped the word ""liberal"" and turned it into a dirty word in popular discourse, but among classic academics it retains its original meaning). The unintended consequence of this removal has been to short-circuit the usual process by which Reddit assigns value to posts. As a result, instead of the ""folks"" doing the self-moderation through voting, the moderators have had their job responsibilities increased.

Each pizza-giver has a set of criteria by which he/she decides to give or not give, and those criteria are all different. In my opinion, THEY SHOULD BE different, that's what makes a wonderfully diverse world. I have certain categories of askers that automatically get me to pay more attention, and other categories which cause me to skip reading their posts entirely. I do not publicize my categories because it invites trolls and scammers. I do not require that everybody else agree with my categories/criteria. My set of criteria are right FOR ME. 

You have the right to question my criteria. I have the right to ignore you. 

You have the right to choose different criteria. That's fine. That's why Baskin Robbins makes 31 flavors, baby. God Bless America.

**WAY tl;dr** -- Give if you want to give, for whatever reasons you bloody well feel like. Ignore if you want to ignore. Be public about it, be private about it, do it for karma, do it for kicks, it doesn't matter. Not even a little.

On the day we were supposed to leave though my wife was experiencing horrible cramps so we went to the er. after doing a ultrasound they found out the pregnancy was ectopic and she had to have one of her tubes removed.

Lots of new people were having trouble learning the Reddit site, so now [www.randomactsofpizza.com](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com) is geared as an entry point into Reddit.  It has links to all the important stuff for all of us old hands (like verification) and instructions for all the newbs.

The site is still beta and we'd appreciate it if people would look it over and suggest any wording changes or point out grammar and spelling errors.  All of the mods have gone over it and we will be tweaking it some more over the next couple of days.  We'd also like some community suggestions.  

We will be getting some more media attention soon and we'd like to emphasize the community nature of RAOP and the ethos of giving and ""Pizza It Forward"" that we've all developed.  Any ideas on how to best educate new members is especially appreciated.  Please feel free to include text suggestions that we can add to the site.

As part of the new web design we have a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/random_pizza) account and a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/randomactsofpizza) page.  New Reddit threads are auto-posted to both. 

Thanks to [Craig Morrison](http://www.craigmorrison.ca/) aka [seamore555](http://www.reddit.com/user/seamore555) for the webpage design and twitter and Facebook integration.

Thanks to Andrew (whose Reddit name I don't have) who created the Facebook page and graciously turned it over to the moderators when asked.

You can also find help by going to your nearest church and asking the pastor there (but remember that you don't have to have God in order to be Good).

There was a lady there who got $50.00 in gas whose credit card was being denied. I could tell by her expression that she knew the card was busted, but she was desperate. After waiting in line behind her about ten minutes, she decided to try the in-store ATM. I made my transaction and left. 
When leaving the parking lot I couldn't help but notice a van with a bunch of dogs inside. The sticker on the door identified it as belonging to the One At A Time Pet Rescue. The gas pump it was beside read $50.00. I put two and two together and turned around. The lady was still at the ATM and was talking to her husband on the phone trying to figure out what to do. So I bought the gas and a coffee for her. Or rather for the animals. She had 24 dogs in the van. I work in a disaster related field in a devastated area and it was apparent that she had picked up dogs from an overrun shelter and was taking them elsewhere to be adopted out.

No, this is a tale of one mans stupidity and another mans willingness to forgo that and offer a helping pizza. Did I really ""need"" this pizza in the sense of would I be able to survive without it? Perhaps not, but it probably did save me a few years on my life. Interested? Well, here's the story:

A week and a half ago on Friday I got paid (yes I have a job, no it's not a very good one) and as I normally do when I get paid, I restock. On this particular day I still had some food at home so instead of restocking on that I did the smart thing and bought a bunch of [beer!](http://i.imgur.com/7bco3.jpg) Now, I'm not a heavy drinker, so a bunch of beer to me is a case worth that would probably last me a month or more usually.

I still haven't paid my rent at this point, but I still have plenty to cover it and get by until next paycheck. On Tuesday I pay my rent and everything is good until I remember that this is the month that I need to renew my plates and drivers license! Stupid me, how could I forget, and now I really need to start worrying.

I get my [plates](http://i.imgur.com/MC5UK.jpg) and my license renewed and it ends up costing more than I expected. Not only that but I still need to put gas in my car and pay for the internets. I did what I could to make what little food I had stretch but by the weekend I was pretty much down to nothing but potatoes and beer. For the last 3 days or so that's [all I've been eating.](http://i.imgur.com/d7P8u.jpg)

Then I came across this subreddit in a post that made it to the front page. As I read the posts I realized people had much worse tales than me. I started to feel bad about even thinking of posting a request at all. Then I stumbled across a post made by someone coat tailing an offer thread. His post almost [seemed to be speaking to me directly](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/hth7t/offerpizza_pizza/c1y8r9s) so I took a chance and pmed him the tl;dr of what was going on with me. He must have found it to be a worthy cause because he went ahead and sent me one of the gift cards.

So big thanks go out to [flamingcow](http://www.reddit.com/user/flamingcow) and reddit for saving my liver from further unnecessary stress. My stomach also thanks them because eating potatoes for 3 straight days really does a number on your inner workings. I will definitely be paying it forward very soon. Many upboats will be sailing your way soon Mr. Cow. You definitely went above and beyond.

Great to see all of the new and old users here. To get the best experience and make it easier for everyone, there are a list of rules to the right. That will explain what tags ([Request], [Offer], [Contest], etc) to use and the do's and don'ts. If you have a question feel free to ask in this thread, many helpful users in here.  
  
Rules:

* Keep posts Safe for Work. Be civilized.  
* We encourage you to use our Verification System for offers or requests.  
* **Do not delete your posts from this subreddit.** Being less than honest is a ban-able offense (like using multiple accounts within RAOP).  
* If requesting, do not request more than once every few days.  
* If giving, post everything (except private information) publicly. Private messages are exactly that, private.  
* If you have information on a potential scammer, report it to the moderators. No random witch hunts.  
* **Have an account age over one month old.**  

  
Anyone is welcome to request for whatever reason. We keep everything transparent here. If your pizza request gets fulfilled or you give a pizza, message the mods and we will update you to some cool flair. Again, please keep images and what not SFW!

I just got a new job last week and while I haven't made any money yet I would like to pay a pizza forward.

Up for grabs is a $10 E-Gift card to your choice of Dominoes, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.

Whoever can introduce me to an enjoyable new song/band I **haven't** heard of before will win! I will select the winner in 24 hours from when this was posted.

I enjoy a broad spectrum of music such as: Girl Talk, Daft Punk, The Bird and the Bee, Pretty lights, Caravan Palace, Parov Stelar, Mumford &amp; Sons, and [jazz like this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HMnrl0tmd3k).

**EDIT 1**: I will make a strong effort to reply to posts that I **Have** already heard.  
**EDIT 2**: links appreciated.  
~~**EDIT 3**: Currently a more than 80  participants who want pizza, but only a few upvotes - that's a weird ratio...~~  

**EDIT 4**: There were a lot of great entries and I am very pleased with the results. Because of the diversity of the music, it is difficult to declare a clear winner. As such, I have compiled a list of the best entries and then used [Random.org]( http://www.random.org/) (a random number generator) to select the winner. If the winner doesn’t reply to my PM within 5 hours (enough time to check the contest) then I will use Random.org again and select another winner from the **Runners up** list. Thank you everyone for your participation. It was a blast for me, and hopefully other participants learned of some new music too.  

The Winner is: theriddler41!!! Congratulations! I have sent you a PM. You have 5 hours to reply.

The amount of people giving is not much smaller than the number getting. I know you all can't see that, but the mods can, and it is unreal. It gives me great joy to add to either list. We keep those lists as part of our icons, which tell you if the people asking have already gotten a pie, or gave one (or more than ).

I want to remind you all that if you feel like giving you can do a [offer] posting. We had a great ratio of [request], and [offer] until today, and given the spirit of the community, I doubt that is much to worry about, and will start again. There is some local pizza places getting involved as well!!!! As for the chains, I am still waiting on news, but anyone who wishes to help make this happen please PM me for details, email addresses to write to, and I will respond within a few days with a detailed list of how you can help.

We seem to have some newbie accounts requesting somewhat often, while I understand how some people might want to hide their real account name, we really need to encourage the use of real reddit names. This cuts down on repeat requests by the same person, although we have already noticed that the main gift card company (CashStar) will let you know if someone gets too much before approving the card for the order (they did this a few days ago with someone who got $100 in pizza). 

We do not want to have to limit requests to people with a minimum of x days and x karma, but it has been mentioned as a possibility if it gets out of hand. I think that you the community should give your input on how this should go before a decision is reached.

I have asked a few people to see if they can come up with a few icons for us. As you know we have a pizza slice icon, and mushroom. We were thinking about having one for people who pay forward a pizza, and one for frequent givers, perhaps another one for some special something. They would have to be about the same size, look good small, and have transparent background.... I made these two, but frankly I suck at graphics in general.... Any volunteers??

First go at this, but after reading through a few pages, I think I know how it goes.

Up for grabs is a single $50 pizza party.

Rules:  

You have to agree to spend the entire $50 in one order.  Invite some friends or family over, really ENJOY it.

I want someone who will agree to post several pics of this pizza party.  I'm having a pretty quiet couple of weeks, let me live vicariously through you and make me laugh.

* 2 lbs of stuffing
* 1 qt turkey gravy
* 2 lbs mashed potatoes
* 1 qt cranberry sauce

http://www.amazon.com/AviGlatt-Thanksgiving-Dinner-Package-People/dp/B0064QU1CG/

Your choice of Honey Glazed, BBQ Glazed, or Hawaiian Marinade (I'd go with Honey Glazed personally).

This is really only for families that are truly in need of this (as this subreddit goes). Share your favorite Thanksgiving memory and I'll choose the winner from there, followed by a PM to get shipping information. All costs are covered by me (a **$94.44** value).

Please make sure [you're verified](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/) as well.

Since this isn't done via Amazon Prime, and I'm guessing it's probably 1-2 day because of the raw turkey, I can only ship this to the continental 48 states. We can figure out what would be the best day to have this sent as well once a winner is chosen.

**Edit #1**

If you'd prefer a $100 gift card or pre-paid Visa to your local grocery store I can do that instead.

By the way, here is the company website where the food is coming from:

http://www.aviglatt.com

**Edit #2**

I've picked someone who I (and others) feel deserve this. I wish I could give to more of you, but thankfully someone PMed me and offered to buy this for someone else too. I'm going to send PMs to both people shortly.

**Edit #4**

By the way, [goudie](http://www.reddit.com/user/goudie) has offered to give the same dinner package out. I had 5 choices, and since I picked mine, here are 2 other people who I felt could use this:

1. MeechPeach
2. taransean

I'm awaiting **goudie's** reply on who he/she wants to send this to, but if anyone else would like to offer this dinner package to one of the above (or anyone you feel could benefit greatly from this), that would be awesome.

I hope everyone has an amazing Thanksgiving, and I really wish I could give more of these out to everyone who responded that's going through a difficult time, whether financially, due to illness, or the loss of a loved one.

Have a safe and happy holiday season everyone!

As an Aussie who has had success arranging deliveries for many other countries I have put together the following guide.

Happy for anyone to ask questions for clarification or for anyone else that had had success to add to the info I have put together :)

Perhaps the mods can link to this in the sidebar if appropriate?


**International Random Acts of Pizza**


*The Aim*

To order pizza from one country for delivery in another.


*The Problem*

The only way to achieve this is to pay via credit card. Online credit card transactions often verify your identity by matching your card number with your name and address. If you don't have an address in the country you are ordering for, things fall apart.

Some of you are probably thinking about the vendors that offer PayPal as a payment method. Unfortunately you can't pay for something that is being delivered to a country other than your own when paying with PayPal, rendering it useless for international pizza giving.


*Things to consider*

The key to beating the system is figuring out exactly what the online pizza vendor in question uses to verify that you are the cardholder. Two things are universal - the cardholder name and the security code on the back of the card. Other than these two, vendors use some or all of the following:

Street address
City/Suburb/Town etc
Zip or postal code

The first two are easy to work with. The last can be problematic as different countries format their zip/postal codes in different ways. Some have four digits, some have five, some have six, some use letters - crazy!

Other vendors use credit card company specific verification - such as ""Verified by VISA"" - to verify ownership. Put simply, this would be simpler if everybody used this method as it asks you for information specific to your local bank.

Even if you can get past all these issues there are a few more important things to consider. All vendors, for example, say that they require the cardholder present at the delivery site. In my experience the only vendor that seems to follow through with this requirement is Pizza Hut in the United States. Others don't seem to. Arranging an order for pickup on the other hand has an increased risk that they will ask for the credit card used to pay for the order.

Another and perhaps more important issues is that these days your card issuer will actively try to prevent fraudulent use of your card. You can bet your bottom dollar that if they see one or two pizza transactions in countries other than your own on your card they will suspend it until they speak with you. It may be wise to notify them before you start ordering. My card issuer has been put on notice... Ignore international transactions at pizza stores! :)

Another issue you might face is the language barrier! More on this below.


**Beating the system**

I'm in Australia and have managed to successfully order pizzas for redditors in the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark. Here are some of the challenges I faced and the methods I used to get around them.


*Ordering for the USA*

The two easiest vendors are Dominos and Papa Johns. Though both say they require the cardholder to be present for the delivery, neither have ever done it for one of my deliveries. Dominos simply require a zip code when ordering. If you don't have a five digit code, add a zero to the front of yours to make five, or subtract some digits from the front or back of your cod to make five. This has worked for my 4 digit Australian zip code multiple times.

Papa Johns require a zip code and an address. I use my actual street address but use the town and state for the actual recipient. Again, I modify my own Australian postal code with a zero to make it fit. Again, multiple successes using this method.

Pizza Hut works using the above methods as well, but you have to get lucky to get a delivery driver who won't ask for the card when making the delivery.

Cashstar.com, which powers gift cards for many vendors, will not accept international credit cards period. Bummer.


*Ordering for Canada*

Problem! The online vendors in Canada all accept credit card, but don't transact over the Internet (Canadians, what is with this?) they take payment when they deliver the pizza. Despite this I've managed to arrange orders through some local vendors (not major chains) and Papa Johns by ordering online and then phoning through my credit card details. Unfortunately this means you need to make an international phone call to help out your Canadian friends.


*Ordering for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*

Dominos in the UK are easy, they use Verified by VISA (and presumably the comparable MasterCard system) that finds your actual card issuer based on your number and asks for localised information. You can enter your own geographical info as if you were ordering in your own country.


*Ordering for Germany/Denmark and other non-English speaking countries*

Luckily as far as the credit card transaction thing goes I've never had to enter anything other than the security code on the back of my card when transacting here. The problem has been with the language barrier.

I've managed to successfully deliver pizza thanks to the assistance of Google translate and the recipient guiding me through the order process using screenshots and in some cases even setting up an order and saving it, leaving me to simply add payment information.


*Ordering for Australia*

Being from Australia I can't speak to the challenges of ordering for here from elsewhere. I would love for someone from across the seas to look after an Aussie using the methods from above so we can verify that it works!

Having ordered pizza locally myself via the Dominos online system I'm almost certain that there is no verification against an address or zip/postal code at all. This, in theory, means that anyone should be able to order for Australia.


**Other things to consider**

Unlike gift certificates, paying via a credit card means you will need your recipients address so you can arrange a delivery on their behalf. I usually put the order in my name to avoid the recipient having to give out that information, but obviously their address is a must. I do, however, ask for the phone number of my recipient. This allows me to add it to the order in the event the driver needs to call them if they can't find the place.

If your recipient does give you their name, use it on the order but be sure to use your own name as the billing contact or cardholder.

In some cases you might attempt to arrange a carry out order for your recipient. This can be complicated as it is more likely than not that the vendor will require the credit card that paid for the order for verification. I have, as a result, avoided carry out orders.

In some countries tipping is customary. Papa Johns in the USA allow you to specify your tip when completing the order. Dominos on the other hand require the recipient to add it at the door (in this case I tell my recipient to add a reasonable amount when receiving the pizza). Please don't disregard this aspect when ordering a RAoP.

I've decided to make a down payment on the 10 pizzas I'm promising, and [sent a pie to chloe-bell and her 2 little girls](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nkgge/yay_for_elgreco927_and_pizza_thank_you/).

**GOAL MET!!!!** Thank you to everyone who made donations and spread the word, it truly is appreciated!  


As promised, [I donated $200 more](http://imgur.com/a/IX1fu), and now I'll get started on giving away some pizzas!  

And now, down to the important business of donating some pizzas to some hungry Redditors! I've already [given 1 pizza away](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nkgge/yay_for_elgreco927_and_pizza_thank_you/).  So that leaves 9 more.  

**See my [new RAOP post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/npehz/offer_march_of_babies_fundraising_goal_met_im/) about giving away the first 3 of those 9 pizzas today!**

Thanks again, Reddit.  You guys are awesome. :-D

I know I've requested a few times recently, and even though I didn't receive a pizza, I'd love to give someone one now that I've gotten paid.

Since I love my two guinea pigs, and their cage is right next to my computer, I might as well use them as inspiration for this contest.

Please tell me a little about your pet/s, and post a picture of the both of you, with your username somewhere in the pic.  This contest is open until 5 pm eastern tomorrow.

Good luck!

I just got my deposit back from my evil ex-landlord so I think I'll be choosing multiple winners.

Many people have complained about some things here. The RAOPBOT inaccuracy for one, removal of posts, and more.

While we all really applaud the work of the bot creator, the bot is gone. It was more annoyance than it was good to many. Perhaps in the near future we can come up with a way to duplicate a way to keep track. The flair system being updated with multiple mushrooms for receivers is one idea that I was thinking of.

Going forward, posts that are not formatted correctly will not be removed, instead (see the sidebar), they will be slightly smaller, and light grey. This makes them still clickable, readable, but should encourage people to format posts correctly without the need for moderator policing. Since this is an automated process it will be completely the responsibility of the poster to get it right.

In the start of this we did some things very differently. We let the community police itself up to a point. The community would downvote, or ignore users that they felt were taking advantage, or being dishonest. I would like to see that again.

The overriding rules here are to be nice, and remember that we are just talking about a pizza, it is most likely going to someone who needs/wants it. If someone does take advantage, oh well it is what 10 bucks or so?.

If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it. If you do not want to buy someone a pizza, then don't do it, don't even comment in the post. If you have some proof of a scammer, or a otherwise dishonest person, let the mods know. We are here to keep the peace, which includes removing the people starting witch hunts, and those taking serious advantage... Keep in mind that we do allow people to ask every couple days, as long as they are up front and honest about how many times they have gotten before (this in no way makes it so that you have to buy them a pie...)

Please remember that ultimately the gift of a pie is up to the giver, so is any research. If a giver does not look through a users history, see if they have been a redditor for a while, see that they post in just assistance type sites, use of the verification system, etc... It is all on them... It is up to them if they just want to give, or be cautious..

This is supposed to be a positive community, let's all do our part to make it that way.

More changes to come... Some quite big, like a community donation pool, with giveaways and such....

We always welcome suggestions, but keep in mind that the focus here is to not be a police state, and just keep us mods as peacekeepers. We tend to push people away when we go too far, thus the current changes we are making.


Edit: Also, as I noted in a comment below... Why is it that we give so much attention to these scammers? It seems that is one of the number one words around here. The majority of the people here are honest, and we should remember that. Do not let a few bad apples spoil the batch...

(Thank you for all the pizzas, they really have helped so incredibly much... I can't think you enough... though hopefully soon I'll have you all paid up!)  So I got my income tax returns, and now it's pizza-giving time! For my last contest thingy I had you all write superb sentences staring s-worded sentences... and today is just random! You comment, you qualify. Though I will use verification too.

How is this ""truly random?"" You ask.  Good question! 

This is how it's going to work- You comment, you get an entree and I write your name down. Each comment (yes, you can have multiple entries) gets one ""entree"" to a maximum of 10 entries per person. Also- this is supposed to be a fun thread so if I can tell you are just submitting a bunch of times, all of your entries are disqualified. I will count ""Re:"" comments, but I won't count replies of yourself to your own comment if that makes sense:

     Ex: Person 1: I'd love a pizza please!
     person 2: You just got a pizza yesterday! 
     person 1: but my dog ate it- here's a pic!
     person 3: That sucks! Hope you win
     person 2: Haha! That's amazing. Sure hope you win!
     person 1:Thanks... best of luck to you too!
  
     for the example Person 1, 2, and 3 would each receive 1 entree. If they comment on OTHER people's comments and such, then they would earn a second entree- got it?

So This all starts now and will end at exactly  4:56 central time. At which point I will write your names down in the order that they posted, and group you into groups of 6. Then, I shall roll a die. That number will get crossed off, and written down on a new list, and I will go to the next group of 6.... and I'll repeat this until 1 group of 6 remains. The person that wins that die-roll- gets the pizza!

The OTHER pizza is for one of the poor souls who got kicked out in the first round- hence the writing down on another list who that was. Again, I'll eliminate these down to final 6, and that die roll will win as well. If it's the same person, than I'll roll again and that person will win.

So.. You have about 5 hours give-or-take. Let's chat! Random topic of discussion to start- What is something you should probably get rid of but haven't yet? Why haven't you? 

See ya around/at 4:56!


Edit: ok, so I was going to write you guys down as we go.... but I think after it closes tonight I'll just go through, print out the thread, and group by intravals of 5-minutes the best I can. It'll take me a while to do the work, but I'm so freaking excited about this giveaway and I gonnna do it the right! 

Edit: ATTENTION REDDIT: Hangovers are avoidable- and not just by not-drinking! When you drink be sure to include a NON-ALCOHOLIC drink and FOOD. The more alcohol- the more food/water. If you do this- then you should not get any hangover at all! It works for me :-)

Edit: Also, I can't believe that I didn't mention this before... but I'd appreciate pics for the lucky two that win!


Closed! Feel free to keep chatting- I've got a few dice to roll one at a time! Be back... later :-)


It's 7:53 here and I'm starting to roll the die... winners soon! 


Wow! That took a while! First there was the writing down the entrants - [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/85UJs.jpg)  and can I just say the people who collaboratively ""acted"" out my sample scenario are AWESOME!

Then I Had to roll the die- introducing your Pizza-giving-dice of 2012: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lRqN5.jpg)

Which started the elimination that ended like this-  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ChCX2.jpg) 

Then there was the 2nd pizza loser-gratfication contestants:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/9fimV.jpg)

So, as some will see, my family and I are definitely not in the best of financial circumstances at the moment. However, we do have all the fixings for a decent Thanksgiving dinner (turkey, pumpkin pie, stuffing, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, etc).

There are only three of us (me, my husband, and our almost 14 month old daughter), but we have enough food to feed us and probably another 3 people. So, I thought, why not have someone over for Thanksgiving dinner?

Here's how this would work:

-It's going to be held at our apartment in Vancouver, WA.

-This offer is for up to a maximum of 3 people (so we're talking a single person, couple, or a couple with 1 child, possibly 2 if they're littler.....or some combination). We'd take more if we could but then I'd be afraid we wouldn't be able to feed all of you properly, lol.

-You have to be able to find your own way here. If you're super close and have no transportation I could probably come get you, but I have limited gas monies for the rest of the month so I'm limited in that department unfortunately.

-I would prefer this offer goes to someone who really needs it, but if you just don't want to be alone for Thanksgiving that's ok too. We've all been there, and it sucks to be alone on the holidays.

-Finally, and most importantly, you have to be able to give me verification that what you're telling me is true. I give people the benefit of the doubt most often but because you'd be coming into our home and would be around our young daughter.....I have to know that you're not a crazy serial killer or something. Hope that doesn't offend anybody.

If I get multiple requestors...I'll have a decision by Monday of next week so we have ample time to get things squared away

(Don't know if you can tell, but I've donated to four different--and very appreciative-- families already.) My point is that no one seems to mind that I'm new here since I'm a ""giver.""  But why be so harsh on others who also are new, just because they've come to ""receive?"" I'm sure folks like me who saw the news report, etc., would quite possibly mention this site to follks who could use the help. Why do so many insist that recipients be previous Reddit members? A hungry soul is a hungry soul, and folks like me who want to help out the best we can are really turned off by the negativity (and sometimes downright hostility, rudeness and mean-spirited words) of those who seem to have made it their business to inspect every post for possible ""unfairness,"" ""cheating,"" or whatever. Just because someone's been a long-time member of Reddit is no guarantee of their need being legit. And, conversely, just because someone is new to this site doesn't by rights make them a scammer. (I'm not a fake giver just because I'm new here.) I expect we all take a small risk that we're not helping out the neediest when we respond with a pizza, but that's a risk most givers here seem willing to take.  It's a pizza, not the Hope diamond.

You need to **pm me your guess, and post in this thread that you have entered** ...something like ""I'm playing"" or ""I guessed"" or ""The towels were so thick at that hotel I could hardly close my suitcase."". Anyone who fails to both pm and post here is disqualified. One entry per person please :) Don't post your guess in this thread tho. Any questions, feel free to ask.

This is for a **$30 gift card** to your choice of Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns. **Entries accepted until 6:00pm Eastern** . Winner announced shortly after.

As a flat we agreed to pay 1/4 the bills ea, the power bill came to 400 and net bill was 100, so 500 total, 125 ea, i payed the 100 dollar net bill (that is in my name) and the guy that pays the power owed me 20 dollars so that's 120 payed out of my 125 due.
i had talked to the guy paying the power before hand, but his girlfriend, one of the flatmates made a complaint to the landlord saying i have never payed any of the power bill, which technically is correct, anyway i have 1 week to get a house with no money...

Until last month there was only 3 of us living in my house , me the guy and his gf, only me and the guy pay rent, going halves in it then no problems here they payed the power which was 300 a month and i payed the net bill which was 200 a month, so i was doing them a favor by not making them pay for any of the extra.
last month i managed to haggle the net company down to 100 dollars a month as i was offered a far better offer by a competing ISP, so this month i had to only pay 100 (not counting the 30 dollar ph bill the chick racked up).

so now we are back to the start, i had to pay 100 for my net last week, 85 for for net, out of 220, i borrowed 20 to a friend for food which he said he could pay back the next day, but he said he didn't get paid, so i got 40 dollars food this week, and have eaten it all already, down to 1 cup, maybe 2 cup of noodles
ALSO flatmates broke all the elements doing illicit activities which involve knifes... so i cannot cook anything either, otherwise i would have been ok on 40 dollars eating pasta

me and the other flatmate have decided to find a house together and leave the guy and his gf alone in the house to fend for themselves since they cannot appreciate when i am kind to them

i am willing to prove anything that i can, just ask for what you want to see, also i apologize for any errors in grammar

We're given ample opportunity to thrive here, and we even have safety nets that others just aren't ever afforded, but we are given more than plenty of chances to sink or swim. 

And now, I enter the unemployed population more scared than I'd like to admit. Scared of failure, scared that I won't be able to provide for my family, scared I'll drown in a pool of my own debt and scared I'll become a number that we consider the ""greedy lazy looking for handouts.""

My fears are comforted though. Comforted by those who have been where I am and now have success stories. I also find comfort in knowing my fate if I give in to feeling sorry for myself and my situation. The comfort I found most recently was those so readily willing, for whatever their reason, to help complete strangers. There are a thousand adjectives that don't do this kind acts justice. It leaves me speechless and brings tears to a grown man's eyes.

There's really no point to this post other than it being another ""thank you"" to everyone that contributes here. Not just the givers, but those that offer sympathetic words of support and encouragement and those that ""pay it forward"" be it in pizza or some other random act.

Matt_and_Chelle reached out yesterday offering to help us with ""staples"" next week and are even making room for us at their upcoming yard sale. iRedditAlot provided us with a very generous gift card to a local pizza shop. Not in a million years would I have ever expected this. The gestures themselves, getting pantry items and food, are things we don't think much about at the time. The fact that others think to do things like that is the true ""act of kindness"" that ""restores one's faith in humanity.""

Thank you to every single one of you.

So I went out today before work and went to the pizza hut in my town and bought some couples lunch. I am going to do it again tomorrow but this time I want to just offer some random person I meet in town out to lunch for a pizza. Or just leave a card. I am creating one as I type, just trying to think of what to put on here. I am hoping more people see this and want to do the same, its the random acts of pizza in me and I want to make a difference. 

A couple things to people that want to do this. If you feel shy about any of this just do what I did at first just hold out a 20 and tell them to pay for a ticket around that amount or something to that extent or if you want to help but feel even more shy about it pm me and we can talk further. 

I want this to extend to everyone having a shitty day that helping out someone who doesn't expect this and leaving a card that shows that some kindness is left in the world is all some people need to keep trudging their day. So lets get Random!

Here is the rough draft for the card I will leave.

I requested a pizza once last year and I cant tell you how grateful I was for it. I was working for the fire department and I was broke and homeless, and I gotta tell you- it made my day.

But these days, things are possibly worse. Back then I had the love of my Fire Department and my chief, housing me in the empty fire station while I worked. But now, I live in Georgia and I'm looking for work and I lost my roommate so I lost the apartment. That truck I've been sleeping in is going to get repossessed next week if I don't come up with something fast. I've applied for every job under the sun and I'm just waiting to hear back from them now. 

I feel like a schmuck asking again... but if anyone could help me out. I will no doubt, when I get a job, spend twice what you spend on a pizza to help someone else. I meant to do it in the past, but never got around to it. Life got hectic... 

But I have sunk every bit of cash I had into gasoline for my truck, cause I have to have it running in order to keep looking for jobs. I havent eaten since thursday night, and it's beginning to hurt. I figured I could tough it out but I was wrong.

So, thats my plight. I would be forever grateful for a pizza if someone would be willing to contribute.

I know things are going to get better for me... cause my god they can't get any worse!!

Thanks a million, everyone.

Many of you have cited federal and state minimum wage laws, but in reality there is no ""pizza guy union"" or anybody that is going to fight for the pizza guy. Some of you went on to say then fight for yourself, hire a lawyer, call the irs, etc. Spend thousands to get minimum wage? No thanks. Do you know how difficult it is for class action lawsuits to be organized?

It seems to be a decent split with the members here. If you people feel it is moral to give charitably in such a way that hurts someone else, even just a little bit, than it's not something I'm going to be involved in. It is hurting someone else too, it's not just not getting a tip, but you're wasting their time and costing them the opportunity to be delivering to somebody that does tip.

It's ridiculous. Giving a free pizza to somebody, but not tipping the pizza guy because he/she's doesn't deserve anything. Isn't this sub-reddit supposed to be about paying it forward?

* Thank you to all the amazing redditors who have been a part of our past contests, and thank you for participating today!

I am from [Eat24.com](http://Eat24hours.com), a website where you can order food online from restaurants that deliver in the United States.  You probably get hungry (if not you may be a robot) and we are here with delicious noms when you do (we are here for hungry robots too 10101011000).  Reddit, you are awesome and we are excited to come back every Tuesday and do our contest here at RAoP.

(All your recommendations are forwarded to our restaurant team.  Please be patient with us, as our fingers are made of tamales.)

* We love food (I know it’s not very obvious) and we are excited about the olympics, so we brought these passions together into a delicious and glorious combo.  What happens when you change the olympic games so they involve food?

**Examples:**

* We will be choosing a winner today at 4:00 PM PST.  Please help us choose by upvoting your favorites.

* Comment as many times as you want.

* Please upvote this post.  This is not a requirement, it is a request.  We love giving away free pizza, and we also love getting attention.   Please upvote this post so we can gain as much visibility as possible on reddit.

Please read her story.,62,15,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/kv660/request_today_is_a_very_special_day_for_a_little/,"I know that I have come before you guys for pizza to benefit myself.  But today, the story is different.

For the last two weeks, I have had the joy of watching two incredible girls.  Bre &amp; Skylee, ages 12 and 5..no, 6 as of today.

Skylee's father is currently in El Paso, Texas.  He is a soldier and he had to send his little girl to live with his mother for reasons I cannot explain.

So Skylee is here in Kentucky, away from her father, and it's her birthday.

Her grandmother is an EMT, who works 3 days in a row and isn't here for her birthday today.  But I am, and I'm doing my best to give her an incredible birthday.

She's at school right now, and I promised her I'd try to have a surprise for her when she got home.  She asked me before she got on the bus if she was going to Chucke-E-Cheese's.  That was what she did with her father on every birthday.  Being in a small town, we don't have anything like that.  And her grandmother won't be home until Saturday, so I won't have any money until then.

So what I'd like to ask, is if anyone would like to make a little girl's birthday even more bright despite the fact her father isn't here to be with her.

A couple of nights ago I created [a post asking for some pizza for the night](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/i0iv6/request_feed_my_family_for_a_night/). Our benefactor asked that I post pics of us enjoying the pizza, and that I pay it forward.

Well, I found out today that a check I've been waiting on FOR TWO MONTHS will FINALLY arrive in a few days - so paying it forward will happen ASAP. 

And here are [pictures of happy babies with pizza](http://imgur.com/a/YTpMm#RUlIQ)! We were even able to share a little with our in-laws, who threw in a few dollars for pop.

As an aside, I was surprised how much pizza we could get with a $30 gift card at Papa John's. We used a coupon for two pizzas for $21, and added cheese bread and a dessert. We covered the extra $1.80 with pocket change. 

My oldest son literally threw himself into bed with the announcement ""I'm stuffed! I don't even want to LOOK at pizza, or I'm going to blow up!""

A boatload of entries this week :D  I appreciate all the ego-inflating words in the comments and messages :) I ain't going anywhere...For cripes sake, I'm a Jets fan.  Where can I possibly go?  Maybe a rubber room...

Still hanging out around the reddits and will be throwing out some pies here and there.  I've enjoyed doing this this thang for the past year and happy I was able to to it.  

As I said previously, I'm simply diverting some extra $$ to /r/RandomActsOfChristmas to help out parents without the financial means to provide their kids a decent Christmas day.  /u/pookie85 helped start the sub just last season...and was a complete success.  The Christmas day pics users sent in...the looks on those kids faces made it all worth while.  

So if you're able to be a ""Santa"" or need one, or just curious... check it out :)  Should be going within the next few weeks.

---------


Last Saturday night, I had a pretty shitty night.  I won't go into details, but at about 5am after a long night and long drive home, I decided to stop at IHOP and drown my sorrows in pancakes and maple syrup. 

The lone waitress there was visibly stressed, and looked like she had a hell of a night herself.  I found out later that a table had just dined and ditched on her.  

Despite her bad luck, she was very pleasant when talking to me and was really hustling to clear tables and serve her customers.  I've worked at a restaurant before, and could appreciate how tough a job it can be, even without asshole customers.

Anyways, when I left, I walked up to the cash register where she was to pay my bill.  I asked her if she always worked overnights, and she nodded yes.  My bill was only $10.  I pulled out my wallet, and handed her my last $40, and told her to keep the change.  She paused for a few seconds with a look of incredulity, started to tear up a little bit, and then thanked me.  I wanted to brighten her night up a bit, and being able to help someone else improved my mood as well.  

I'm not trying to toot my own horn.  I just wanted to tell this story, and in honor of all hard-working 3rd shifters out there, give away a pizza.  

So if you work overnights, tell me about it.  What do you do, how did you get the job, do you like working nights, post some pics, etc.  I'll pick someone in the next day or 2 and send a $15 gift card to one of the big 3 chains.  

Oh, and if you've ever dined and ditched, go fuck yourself.",,False,,t5_2s7wq,1340856526.0,,dragon,True,t3_vnz6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/vnz6l/offer_do_you_work_overnights_id_like_to_buy_you_a/,

The reason I'd like to buy someone a pizza and why I have a preference about who it goes to (not that I mean to judge about who is ""deserving"") is that I'd like to help someone do what my parents do for me. I've tried to pay them back for things but they just insist I use it to treat myself to things, to enjoy school. So instead, I'd like to spend a bit of my paycheck on someone else's parents. 

That failing, I'd be really happy to give it to a young couple who is struggling maybe. Here I have to admit that I have a bit of a different motive. The other reason I have a bit of money to spend on someone else's food is that I had some plans for it. I had been saving a bit of cash to do something nice for a certain someone but she's gone now so I figure, buying dinner for another young couple...to the universe at least, it's all the same no?


And yes, I did create a reddit account just for this purpose. I've never had one before, always just lurked (yes I'm a bit anti-social even on the internet), but this seemed as good a reason as I'll get to make one.

Recently I have been struggling to get by, I had about £20 to my name. I decided to sell a ton of my stuff on Amazon to raise money for Christmas presents. So I managed to sell £350 worth of stuff (pretty much everything I had of value), but now Amazon says I have to wait til the 29th to cash out. So, I have no stuff, no money to buy Christmas presents, and I've used the £20 I had to my name for postage. My friend told me about this site and how there are some wonderful people out there who will buy pizza for needy people. I have never really thought of myself as needy, but at this time, I am ashamed to say I am. I hardly slept last night as I was so hungry, I have been relying on a packet of lollipops that I bought for 4p, which I actually picked up as I was walking through the town centre - oh the shame! :( I have a very small family, and they all live 2 1/2 hours away on the train, so it looks like I'm stuck til I get paid on the 6th January. If I have any spare money after I get paid, I'll certainly buy another person a pizza.

I am from the UK, but I'm sure if you're not from the UK it would be possible to get a pizza to me. I know this may seem like a lie because I have just registered, but really, I have never been on this site before, and I can provide proof of my bank balance, my packet of lollipops, etc if needed. Hopefully it won't come to that.

I'd like to give my sincere thanks in advance to anyone who comes forward and fulfills my request. ",,False,,t5_2s7wq,False,,shroom,True,t3_nf344,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nf344/request_bank_balance_of_091_not_eaten_properly_in/,

So, I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a long time... as in I was one of the first 100-300 people or so.  I have remained largely a lurker here, seeing as I have very little money to give pizzas, and never the type to ask for things, I just enjoy watching the amazing acts on this subreddit.

I do however participate in little contests held for pizza as the prize when I can.  I LOVE the idea of a little contest, and I think it's really just all in good fun, but for some reason, I've begun to notice a large number of very rude comments made when someone submits something.  I assume this is an attempt to make up for the inability to down vote someone here (a feature I appreciate), but still... there is no need for this.

Now, this has happened to me 3 times now over the few months or so, but I've seen it MANY times done to others.  I also see a huge lack of compliments, as if giving someone a compliment would lower your chances in winning?  

This isn't cool guys.  If someone submits a picture, or a story, or whatever it is in these contests, DON'T say things like ""OMG, this person shouldn't win"" for whatever reason.... that is up to the giver, not you.  

Personally, I don't even play to win, I play for fun, but to have someone sit there and down my work because I have more upvotes then them is just juvenile and should be discouraged here.  We need to all play with good sportsmanship here.

**The trick is to guess the lowest number from 1 to 100, that no one else guessed** . Yes, whole numbers. Say you pick 9...two people pick 3, four people pick 7, and the next highest number picked is 9 and you are the only one who picked it, you win.

You need to **pm me your guess, and post in this thread that you have entered** ...something like ""I'm playing"" or ""I guessed"" or ""I don’t suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it"".   Anyone who fails to both pm and post here is disqualified. One entry per person please :) Don't post your guess in this thread tho. Any questions, feel free to ask.

This is for a **$30 gift card**  to your choice of Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns. **Entries accepted until 6:00pm Eastern** . Winner announced shortly after.  

**GOOD LUCK!**

**The winner is CharlieSaylor!!!** For using my favorite character from my favorite show, incorporating my name disgustingly well into his drawing, and because he looks like he had a great time creating this masterpiece!


**CONTEST CLOSED** Be back soon with the results! Man it's hard to choose, I wish I could feed the world :-( 



US ONLY!!!!!!

First of all, relax!  I've been in your shoes so I know how it feels to read about a new pizza contest, you just want to hurry up to be the first to comment. Well calm down because this pizza will not be given to you because you were the first to comment, It will also not be given to the highest upvoted comment. I will be personally choosing the winner this time :-)

I received a pizza hut gift card yesterday from the lovely Mcakez and It's for $20, I will use some of that gift card to buy the winner a cheesy yummy pizza. (So I have enough to buy my family a pizza with the rest.) 

Contest will be closed tomorrow at 7pm eastern time and the winner will be announced shortly after. 


THE CONTEST!- 

Draw me a cartoon character from Nickelodeon in the 90's. Also I want you to write ""I love you poo_smudge"" somewhere on the drawing. You can draw it on the computer or by hand, don't care. You can even take a picture of your hand drawing to upload it, I won't penalize you if you have a sh*tty camera. I just want to see you have fun with this! Make it colorful and make it awesome. My favorite will win the pizza. Good luck!


**EDIT**- One entry per person please! You can edit it as much as you want until 7pm tomorrow, but at 7pm tomorrow I'm looking at everyone's final entries and choosing a winner

Sooo...

Now that I have some cash money in the bank (not really), I am going to have a little contest of my own.

As a marketing major, one of my idols has always been BILLY MAYS. I've actually pitched a few products myself and let me tell you I am far from Mr. Mays, but I digress...

I'm not asking anyone to pitch a product like BILLY MAYS (although that would be awesome), I'm just asking you to post 2 things:

* A picture of yourself if you think you look like my idol BILLY MAYS
* A note card of some sort with the date and your username to prove it's you

It's that simple.

My roommate and I will judge the quality and authenticity of your submissions. Hopefully we will have a Domino's Pizza out by tonight!

Good luck!

*Edit (8:33pm EST): We're going to give this contest another hour or two and then we are heading to the bars. Last minute entries are welcome!

I've never got a Pizza off of here, but I figure, you have to give to get. So I think a contest is in order.

But first lemme just lay down the rules.

1) Be creative, don't steal other peoples work. it's not nice. 2) The winner will be determined 4 CST, enough time for a back up, the pizza will be ordered when you want. Also, it won't be decided today (1/8/13) or tomorrow (1/9/13) but it will be on Friday (1/11/13) so don't get your panties in a bunch if you don't have your Pizza yet. 3)Be nice. 4) Please keep everything PG

What you get with your win: 2 Pizzas, any toppings any size from either Dominos, Papa Johns or Pizza Hut. Your choice. Two sides and two 2 liters. I'm feeling like a two mood today

Alright, the contest: it has three parts.

A writing portion, a drawing portion, and a video portion.

The writing portion: Come up with an ORGINAL superhero. Give me a back story, a weakness, a nemesis ect. make it funny, serious, or stupid. Whatever.

The drawing portion:Draw me your best picture of you eating pizza. could be funny, could be amazing. Could be the art of a two year old. Draw for me. Imgur or Flickr please.

Last, the video portion: Let's see you acting skills. Give me your best fake sob story. Can be obviously fake, can be pretty serious. I don't want any true story's only made up ones. Please keep it PG. and if it's not on youtube I won't open the link

Let's see who really wants Pizza.

Post everything here, story first, then the pic link, then the video link.

Have a good day everyone. :) and best of luck

(bonus points to those who tell me what they want if they win, extra bonus points if one of the 2 liters are Dr. pepper.)

Edit: Oh, and I forgot, I have a code for The dark Knight Rises here for UV. If you win, you also get the code. So, make it a dinner and a movie night! It's one of my favorites, I've bought it several time so I have several UV codes for it. i want to pass it along to someone who can use it.

Edit 2: Whoops, accidentally messed up the finish date, it's 1/11/13, Friday :p

Edit 3: WOW! You guys are awesome! I didn't know so many people we interested! Can't wait to see who the winner is!

It's a special day, and it deserves a little contest.  Unless you just now crawled out from under a rock, the Super Bowl is played tonight.  All you have to do is post in this thread what you guess the **final score** will be, and **which team wins**.  

Get both correctly, you win a **$40 gift card** to Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns!  If ten people guess both correctly, those ten people win a $40 gift card each...and my wallet will be severely dented :p

If you guess the correct score, but have the other team winning, you'll win a **$25 gift card**.  Simply getting the winner correctly and not the score, you get a ""purple nurple"" from Chuck Norris :P

Any questions, ask me.  One entry per person please :) and no editing your post.  If it looks like an edit was done...for any reason... you get nuttin'.   Good luck!  And as a Jets fan, I wish the Giants a prosperous and winning game.  Anybody but the Pats.  Cheers!

I'll need your email account to email the gift card too, so PM me. My Reddit name is my real-name and is unique so you can do your own research and see I'm not a creeper.

I have no idea how I will decide, but at the moment it'll probably be random. I'd like to give it away in the next couple of hours so the kid(s) can have pizza in their belly tonight, it is Friday after all!

I will then have this printed onto a shirt to surprise (dismay?) him on his birthday. The best part is that he swore that, if he ever got such a shirt, he would wear it to work. Knowing that we don't have Photoshop nor do I know how to use it, he probably figured he was safe.

It's a lot to ask, so I'm offering pizza for your help. The person who makes the 'shop that makes me laugh the most will get a digital giftcard to one of the top 3 (Domino's, PJ's, or PH) of their choice. 

PS: You can get creative with the shop, too. It doesn't have to be that specific moon background. 

It's about 3:30 EST where I'm at, so I'll let this run until tomorrow morning (July 3), at which point I'll contact the winner and hook them up with pizza by 3 p.m. Thanks RAoP!

**EDIT: I just realized a more appropriate tag would have been [CONTEST]. Whoops! Sorry mods!**

**EDIT2: WE HAVE A WINNER!!!! I wish I could give a pizza to every single one of you that contributed a photoshop of our dog. I have been laughing non-stop since I started this thread, but ultimately, the cheesey prize goes to u/Incoherentrant, [whose rendition of Three Eskie Moon](http://i.imgur.com/0HGbVEh.jpg) has kept me laughing for hours now.

See you all next time!

----------------

It is time for the next installment of **Pizza Across America,** where I give away a pizza in each of the 50 states!

This is pizza giveaway # **14** of **50**.  The state randomly chosen for this giveaway is **INDIANA**, my next door neighbor to the east.  The winner will be awarded a **$15 gift card** to one of the Big 3 chains.  If this is not an option for them for whatever reasons, we'll work something else out.


**Rules:** You must be able to **provide photographic proof** that you live or are currently in **INDIANA**.  The photo **MUST** incorporate **your username** and **the date**.  Some photo ideas include:

* A famous landmark
* A GPS showing your location
* A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the state
* A post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark
* ... or come up with another idea!  I should be able to look at the pic and say ""Yep, he/she is in **INDIANA.**""

**This contest will close Thursday, November 29th, at 11pm CST**.  At that point, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment.  **Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win!**

We strive to help people in legitimate need and we have helped tons of people all across the world. We are a hidden gem on the internet where we restore faith in humanity and fellow human beings on a daily basis.

However, with popularity comes a flood of new people. For the past few days there has been an onslaught of requests, mostly coming from new people to Reddit. I'm not talking being a Redditor for a few weeks, I'm talking hours old and the first thing they did was ask for pizza. 

First and foremost I am in no position to challenge the legitimacy of any of the stories. But I have come across users hours old copying and pasting the exact same story to quite a few offers. Not to mention, the stories seem really exaggerated... but I am not one to determine if they are real or not. Chances are, not every single offer is legit. Considering it's the internet where anonymity rules and people get free pizza, I'd say the chances are it's a fake. 

As awesome as this community is, it's downfall is the lack of ability to verify anything the person is saying... especially when they have zero posting history. While I am not saying we need to put in place a verification system, we need to be smarter about who we choose. 

For the people who create an account just to post here and really need help, the only thing I can say is you have to understand where we are coming from when we instantly view you as a fake. Build some posting history and it will tremendously help anyone deciding to help you out.

I moved to Minnesota from Texas back in October, and realized things would not be what I was hoping. My best friend actually ended up catching my ride back to Texas, I was originally going to be moving in with him, and left me up here almost on my own. We had a mutual close friend that was up here as well and things were great for a while, but we'll get to that. Had an apartment for a bit, but my dog was back in Texas at the time. My arrangements to have here brought up here finally went through, but the apartment I was in didn't allow dogs. I ended up having to move to keep her, (worth it). Found a place with a guy from Craigslist, and rent was cheap. YAY! I stayed with him for a bit at his house, but in the time I was there, he ended up getting engaged. During this time, the mutual friend of my best friend and I, told you I'd come back to him, moved back to Texas as well, :'( My job, which I love, started giving me less hours at the time, and my funds started getting cut because of it. Rent was harder to come by, and my dog got sick. The roommate ended up buying a new house in another state, and was going to be moving soon. Lack of funds, sick dog, new state, no friends, few opportunities forced me to make a decision on my current residence. I had to choose the only option available, that of a 21 year old woman who cared more about owning animals than cleaning up after them. I couldn't live like that, so I've been cleaning up since I moved in at the beginning of June. Thankfully rent is even cheaper at the new place, and my dog has been recovering nicely. I however was extremely sick this past week. High fever, incontinence, pounding headache, achey body, and more. (Don't worry I've since recovered, except for the swollen glands in my throat, but those are almost gone now. I'm away from family, friends, and funds. I've been struggling to make sure my dog has a nice life, without need for anything. I've also been pushing myself to take the steps necessary for a better life. Example... In Texas, I lived in and around Dallas, so no need for a vehicle, I rode the bus everywhere. Since I've been out here, I've gotten my Permit, and take my test in August for my license. Joining a gym at the next paycheck to better my physical health. And am still working in a field I love. I've had my ups and downs, and am actually smiling today. 

Some Interesting facts about me.

*My name is Sam

*I'm an uncle many times over

*Today is my birthday

*I'm Native American

*Pizza is my favorite food.


I'd love a Pizza today, but understand if others are more deserving. Part of me just wanted to tell my story.

With all that said, I just want to wish everyone a joyous, and safe New Years Eve, and hope that not only is everyone here able to get a pie, they pay it forward by giving a pie if/when they can.

I was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.

Anyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.

Basically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep. 
That happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed. Spoke with the family I _just_ came from about this and I'm invited back over for dinner on Friday, the day prior to my payday. Still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. I already said that. Um.

I've no idea of etiquette here, I've no idea if I said too little or not enough, but hey there's my request. I will say though that I'm probably gonna stick around here, and will definitely pass on the favour to somebody elses request once I'm paid.

You don't need to do this, but I'd appreciate it. (Plus, I can surprise the fianceé with her half to lessen the blow.  She knows, incidentally.)

Sorry to bother.

**Edit** ... Sorry again. I'm in Ontario, Canada. I'm new to this. Sorry.

**UPDATE**  I didn't get pizza last night. User ""shockey"" helped out (I believe, because my faith in humanity can't let me think that this was a prank) to the point of taking my personal info, but no pizza came.  Around 11pm last night, I noticed that they deleted their user info from Reddit, but tried to ignore the warning flags that come with that.

[Conversation, part 1](http://imgur.com/QkDp5.jpg) and [part 2.](http://imgur.com/ktmYJ.jpg)

Sorry, everyone, for getting your hopes up. I don't know what my fianceé ate last night. It's nearly 5am for me now, so I'll go eat some cereal and make a coffee, and start the day. ~~I'll message the mods here about this~~ (Nope, I have no info and it was only my trust), but only time will tell if we were scammed or not. I hope not.  I sincerely think that it was a first-time gesture that didn't go through.

I really don't mean to bother anyone, and thanks for the words and support you gave. 

**UPDATE 2** Hello, again. Thanks to everyone who messaged their support and well-wishes.

Although we never received pizza from *Random Acts of Pizza*, which has an obstacle regarding cross-border exchanges it seems, it should be noted that *we did have pizza* last night from some old friends of ours who invited us back to our hometown.  It was a great night out and all of us got some great laughs and good social vibes.

*(The first* ""boy pizza"" *had pepperoni, bacon, tomato, and red pepper; the second* ""girl pizza"" *was feta cheese, sundried tomato, red onion, and green olives.  There was also 20 deep-fried wings, ordered with BBQ sauce but supplemented with the home's own Frank Sauce. A jug of Nestle Ice Tea Zero was offered and shared all around.)*

I just want to thank everyone who has offered to assist my fianceé and I in the last few days. She's as astounded and overjoyed at this post as I am, and we thank you all sincerely.  She also keeps nudging me to start accepting some of the gratuity, Since I was fence-sitting because of my morality, ethics, and humility, I've decided to graciously accept a few offers (if still available) via private message. If declined, I fully understand with no ill will.

Once again, thank you, everyone.  You are an awesome community, and we love you.

**TL;DR** Laid off, pizza offer fell through in possible scam (though hopefully not), Reddit comes through with offers and consolation, we get pizza from friends back home.

Your name must be submitted by today (Friday) at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings time), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern.


1) You must be a college student.

2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.

3) You must have seen a meme picture somewhere, at some time.

4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. **You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's**. Those are the eGift certificates I have.


At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).

-------------------------------------
OK, I pulled two names: one for Domino's and one for Papa Johns.

**The Domino's winner was: bdh008**

**The Papa John's winner was: -Juju-**

I'll be sending them PM's with the certificate info. Merry Christmas everybody!

I just got home from my university in Copenhagen, and wanted to give thanks to this subreddit. 

Lately I wanted to send a pizza over reddit to someone in need, but it's hard to find who REALLY needs it.

I rarely see homeless people in Denmark, due to government financial support and government shelters, etc. But sometimes I do see some unlucky people - some enters the trains at busy hours asking for money, others sits quietly and embarrassed waiting for people to notice them. I've never given money to homeless who enters trains - it feels forced and back in my head I still have the voice saying ""Who knows what they really use the money for?"" - I think a lot of us have that voice in our head, to make sure we aren't being taken advantage of.

But! Since I started reading this subreddit I thought it might be a good idea to buy some food instead and find someone who I can see needs it. I left the train in Nørreport and sure enough there were a man of age 60(?) sitting on a small chair, selling a monthly ""homeless magazine"" (Don't ask me what the name of it is, but it does exist!). I walked 300 meters to the nearest Subway and got us both a subway menu (ice cold water, sandwich and an apple), got back, sat down and asked him if he was hungry - he nodded yes and I handed him his menu and wished him a great day. 

Never have I seen a person's eyes light up that much. And I've never felt so good, walking away from there.

What's up next? Next time I go to my university again, I'll see if there's anyone in the area who needs a ""random act of pizza"" (or subway, sorry for breaking the rules!), and this time I'll stay and eat with the person. Who wouldn't want company?

Now, this isn't a ""you should do this to feel good about yourself""-thread, or ""do this, or you are a bad person!""... What I hope you get from this is simply do it - buy a 10$ pizza, or subway, and make someones day so much better.

I'm 24 and the youngest is 7, and I love them very much especially doing things with them. For Independence Day I cooked tamales and the youngest wanted to help so I let her mix the dough. Then when it came time to assemble them I set her up a station next to me on the table, and taught her how to roll them up. The whole day after that she went around to everybody saying she got to make tamales with her favourite big brother. That is just one of the latest stories. Last halloween I made a Princess Mononoke costume that looked like San for another one of my little sisters. It was made with her red mask, white fur, and spear. I used a white ghost mask painted red and brown then attached it to a fake fur bathroom mat that you can find at walmart. For the spear I shaped the blade from foam, and wraped quater inch dowels with black ribbon. I could go on but that will take forever.



What you have to do for the pizza is tell your favourite story about what you have done for a sibling, cousin, or good friend that you think of as a sibling. Pictures would help but are not required. Tomorrow I'll choose somebody about 6pm est.

**UPDATE:** Gave the pizza to **Aesirr** because his story had 2 things i love Surprising sisters, and metal. He will be getting it at the store around 8pm. I couldn't afford delivery.

I wish i could give more but i'm unemployed so i cant afford it. Remember to love family and teach the younger generations to not cross family.

**TL;DR - If you want a pizza, just comment, the winner will be picked by a random number generator. Winner announced at 8:00PM CST tonight.**

Hey, remember me? Well since it's Independence day, and I have some extra money on my hands, I'll offer up some pie. Good luck to all.

###Time &amp; Verification:

The winner will be announced and PM'd at 8:00PM CST (hope that's not too late for some of you), if not, it will be earlier.
 If the winner cannot provide verification and/or do not respond within 12 hours, I will draw another number.

###How It Works:

Just comment! Yes, it's that simple.  *If you have something interesting, like a picture or a story that would you think might entertain/interest me, by all means, post it with your comment.*
The winner will be picked by a [random number generator](http://www.random.org), as I will assign everyone a number (that commented). 
Anyone can enter, the account just can't be 1-4 days old.
If you comment twice, unless it's a reply (which I will not count toward the numbers), you will be disqualified.

I heard about this subreddit on the news a few months ago and it just came to me to post this request on here. I've been a redditor since Februrary, but I've lurked since before the Digg exodus. My wife and I have fallen on hard times. (Who hasn't?) I've made a penniless job out of searching for employment but the KC area is a difficult market for jobs. All that I can get are temp jobs. The Mrs. is on short-term disability from her job and the insurance has been hesitant to pay. We finally got the payment, but it's only enough to reactivate our phone. Luckily our neighbor lent us his wifi password until our lease is up on the 31st, so we're not totally isolated from the outside world.

My wife has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome this year ([Wikipedia linkage](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome)), which is a developmental disorder in the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum that seriously hinders her comprehension of social rules most people naturally catch on to.

I've been out of steady work for close to two years now. I have my GED but no college education and constantly keep my ear to the ground for new businesses opening or odd jobs that need to be done in my area. I've had some experience with renovating homes, but most of my job history resides in fast food and retail.

So now it comes to our lease ending this month. We're living in a studio apartment under 250 square feet for about $235/month, water included. We've no food and our belongings fit in three clothes baskets.

And to top it all off, my wife's paternal grandmother passed away last week after a short but fierce battle with lung cancer. She was the only one in my wife's family that my wife could go to if she needed to vent about absolutely anything without feeling judged or ridiculed. I've known her grandmother for three years and I sorely miss her as well, but my wife is having more trouble dealing with her passing. 

I'm sorry if this post is fragmented or unreadable, and it's probably riddled with errors, but asking for help isn't something I'm very good at. Honestly, I'd be happy just for my bride to get a good meal.

On June 1st I was putting on a car show event at a place in Dallas called Autosource. We asked the secretary to order 8 pizzas for everyone, and she ordered 80. No lie.

It was our fault, so we paid for the pizzas... fed them to everyone... but still had 50 or so left over. What to do? No-one was sure what we could do, but I had an idea.

I asked the owner of the place, Al, if we could borrow one of his cars to fill to the top with pizza, and deliver them to the homeless on the street. He agreed! We choose a Fisker Karama because it was charged, available, and could hold nearly 50 pizzas. What we could not fit in the car was given away via craigslist in the free ad's.

I took a camera with us to film the delivery, and when I got back and actually got to see the footage I found it very uplifting. I realized that I am a selfish person and I need to do stuff like this far, far more often.

This was a Random Act of Kindness, and it was very rewarding for me emotionally. My friends who have seen the video agreed, and I figured maybe you guys on Reddit would too.

Thanks for the Pizzas Autosource. :)

My brother tried to commit suicide last Tuesday by ODing on the antidepressants he was just given by his psychologist.

I live about 300 miles away from home with my girlfriend currently. I only have intermittent part time work and just visited last weekend, so I'm too broke to go home again right away.

It hurts so bad thinking of him locked up in the facility, though my family can visit him 1 hour a day, and I call every day right after they're through to check up on him. Sounds like they've got him diagnosed but we have no idea when he's getting out.

This is half just to vent, I guess. Nothing is fun right now. I'm completely disinterested in my hobbies.

I know it's unreasonable, but I feel guilty when I'm having fun because I know he can't.

I wish someone could send him a pizza.

EDIT: If anyone's been in a facility for this before and wouldn't mind telling me what it was like, feel free to PM me.Thanks

EDIT2: I wasn't quite clear, I wanted to give him the pizza when he gets out. I'm happy to provide verification as well (I assume he'll work with me a bit in giving you guys like a hospital slip of some sort).

**NOTE**: * Number range increased this week*


The trick is to **guess the lowest number from 1 to 250, that no one else guessed**. Yes, whole numbers. Say you pick 9...two people pick 3, four people pick 7, and the next highest number picked is 9 and you are the only one who picked it, you win.

**You need to pm me your guess, and post in this thread that you have entered**...something like ""I'm playing"" or ""I guessed"" or ""Jetboy smells like feet so I sent a guess"". Anyone who fails to both pm and post here is disqualified. One entry per person please :) Don't post your guess in this thread tho. Any questions, feel free to ask.

This is for a **$40 gift card** to your choice of Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns. Entries accepted until 6:00pm Eastern. Winner announced shortly after. ***Good luck!***

Note: If someone outside the US wins, I'll try as hard as I can to get you a card or pizza or something. I can't guarantee I'll be able to tho. But I'll try.

I was hesitant and wasn't sure how reliable anyone is on the internet, so I replied and asked, maybe begged, for just a pizza. Just one pizza maybe, you know? Remind me what it's like to eat a fatty meal, but a filling one at that. Then a response by  [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne) offering pizza. I should have said no. But it sounded like I might get two pizzas. Shame on me, I guess. Then another person [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay) sent a pizza. 3 whole pizzas!

I did in many of these cases try to let them know that someone else already helped, but they seemed insistent. I told them to send pizzas in the evening.

Me and the wife and our daughter left to go see [muppets](http://i.imgur.com/Oh5zOUa.jpg) and watch a free show work comped me. [It was crazy and my daughter loved it.](http://i.imgur.com/VEfmQB2.jpg) I had barely enough gas to get there and back before the gas light came on, which just meant I would be walking to work the next week. But it's worth it, you know? [It's worth it to see her eyes light up.](http://i.imgur.com/NrKAqLxh.jpg)

So I return home to find pizzas. Pizzas everywhere. They came while we were at the show, and our roommate had received them. My memory is hazy who got what, and I didn't take many pictures, but I'll try and make the correct associations there.  donny_pots and mm_kay both sent me pizzas, I think three total between them. But it was dehOne who made me cry.

dehOne first sent me [this amazing spread of food.](http://i.imgur.com/xzFnycJh.jpg) which was a weekend meal enough as is, not to mentiuon mm_kay and donny_pot's gifts above. But then dehOne went one step further. I got $25 in Paypal which was the reason I could get to work on gas the next week. And then my email got this amazing thing: [this gift card](http://i.imgur.com/NW0lK8j.jpg). What do you do for that? My wife and I were stunned with tears. [This picture doesn't account for the fifth pizza we ate and the side items.](http://i.imgur.com/R0P6ZMS.jpg) but I can tell you that the following week we were fed. Lastly, at the end of that day, I found someone had gifted me a month of Reddit Gold.

So there you go Reddit. I asked for maybe a pizza or two. My pessimism told me no one would really help, it was wrong. With negative money, next to empty gas, an empty fridge, and a lot of stress I asked you guys for help. And you helped. About ten pizzas, $25 in my gas tank, a Sesame Street show (not you guys technically but I still thank you), and enough food to get us to a paycheck where we can eat real food finally.

Thank you. I love you all. Thank you so much. I feel terrible still, as the situation is barely improving. Random Acts is not for long term. I don't really want to ask for help again, I need to just get a second job. But thank you for this brief relief from the stress. Thank you [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots), thank you [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay), and thank you a big bunch [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne).

Thank you all.

It was a hot humid day, and thats when it hit us. We needed to get them a pizza. We found a pizza place near by (it was a Little Caesars) and we then proceeded to buy 2 large pizzas, one pepperoni and one cheese. As we drove back to the Home Depot we weren't quite sure what reaction we were going to get. Upon reaching the parking lot we hopped out of the car and carried the pizzas over towards the 10 men standing around. It was the most awesome moment ever!!! Their faces lit up and they thanked us over and over again. It was a great feeling knowing that you made someone else happy. Because of this me and a few friends one of them is a fellow redditor Kdude900, are going to start giving out as many free pizzas as we can to people less fortunate then ourselves or just people who are using all their strength to provide for there families. Maybe it doesn't seem like much, but it is. Giving them a pizza shows them that people care about them and also keeps there spirits high. I wish I had pictures to show but I didn't have my camera with me. So I will link a pictures in the comments below when we do it again. 

I hope you enjoyed this story and if you want to do this too just start buying and handing out pizzas in your city. :D

Other ideas?,41,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/zptug/metabrainstormingthe_state_of_raop_donation_links/,"I know I have been low key for a while (I mostly like giving anonymously).   But RAOP is never far from my thoughts.  I have been thinking about a couple of ideas for RAOP for a while.  I have discussed this a bit a couple of times in the IRC channel.  (Everyone really should come hang out there... I'm on that chat channel all day during the work week along with lots of other awesome RAOP folks).

Anyway,

1) What do you guys think about adding some sort of Donation link to accept donations that we could then use for giveaways?  The reddit admins have added a couple of solutions that would let us do this.  

Some of the ideas we've had is we could hold weekly/monthly giveaways, or use the donations to find un-filled requestors.

2) I have also thought about forming a 501(c)(3) charity that would allow donations to RAOP to be tax deductible at least in the US.  

So let's use this thread to discuss these ideas and any other ones.  

EDIT:

Ok after some discussion, what I am leaning towards is a 501c3 to bring in some tax benefits to givers along with personal liability protections for the people running it.  A donation link to the 501c3.  And a open accounting method with 100% going to the charitable purpose (admin costs donated so they will be 0).  Then we'd take those funds, as they allow, have a big giveaway thread to bring in more of the Reddit community, where the receivers are chosen randomly.  ... perhaps with some eligibility going to those that have given before... or some other combination.",,False,,t5_2s7wq,1347411918.0,,Kermit2,True,t3_zptug,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/zptug/metabrainstormingthe_state_of_raop_donation_links/,moderator

for almost a year without going out or getting take out. Just an afterthought since someone asked me.

Hi everyone My name is Haleigh and I work as a volunteer at a girls group home in Coral Springs, Florida. We have 8 girls here ranging in age from 12-17. They are here for a variety of different reasons ranging from being taking away from their families because of abuse and are currently in the court system to being homeless. Today was their first day back to school after the summer. Some girls have been here for a while and some are new and not quite use to the routine. It is their responsibilty to make dinner for themselves on a rotating basis and clean the kitchen afterwards. Our home relies on donations so what they have for dinner varies. I thought it would be a nice idea to ask if someone would like to treat these girls to dinner tonight and be a shining star for them as you could imagine they have been through a lot. I see the emotional rollercoaster ride they are on and it would mean a lot to them to be able to take a break and relax for the evening.

She's helped in a lot of ways.  I'd like for her to feel as loved and appreciated as she really is :)


You know what makes her so damn deserving beside the aweomeness I shared above???  Simple, Glinda is so humble and down to Earth.  She gives from the depths of her soul and a lot of times on the quiet tip in the backgrounds.  She does what she does, gives all she gives and could careless about the recognition.

Its been awhile since I have done a contest on here. Hadn't really had any good ideas for any until late last night. So with that here are the rules fo the contest and how you win.

1. Make a comment to this post.
2. Have no one else comment after you for ~~2 hours~~. 1 hours
3. Every time someone comments, the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour timer restarts. 
4. There is an end time I am not announcing to this contest and person closest to that wins if no one hits the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour time limit.
5. You can post as many times as you see fit. 

This is going to be some what hard to track, so if you manage to beat the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour time limit, send me a message and tell me and I will go back through and verify. I do make mistakes, as does everyone so please bear with me as I try to verify winners.
Depending how things go, the time limit may change to a lower amount, I will not raise the amount ever.

Usual crap I put in here, Read the right side, important that you read it because I will be following that. 
Account MUST be over 30 days old, I don't want people making accounts just to get free pizza, contribute to the community and in short time you can participate too!
U.S. Only. (Sorry people outside the U.S. here is a &lt;3 to compensate!)

Let the contest begin.

Edit: Adding on, any comments i make don't count toward reseting the timer.

Edit2: Since I see some confusion, the timer resets on overall posts, not if someone replies to your post.
Also, Time has been lowered to 90 minutes!

Edit3: So someone gave me an idea for another contest, which is going to make this one more interesting. Second contest it going to be the person that gets the most upvotes (RES is tracking them) from me (and specifically me) on the posts that they have on here. Going to make this a $10 gift card to dominoes. Since I can only give one upvote per post, post something interesting for me to watch or read and u get an upvote, want a second upvote? post something else interesting.

Edit4: To those sending me message, they are sometimes getting lost in all the comments.. So I apologize if I miss em.

Edit5: Since some people keep asking, the End time I have set is not going to be tonight. I wanna see if someone can accomplish this. I will end it some time tomorrow. I will also be lowering the time as it goes on. I will lower it once more tonight before I go to bed and have a time tomorrow it will lower again. No matter what though, please b patient as this has almost 350 comments already and its going to take a bit to find a winner. =P

Edit6: replies to posts do reset your count and since I put it up above, you cannot reset ur own timer. 

Edit7: As I said in a post below, net went down last night so couldn't update time on here... But time is going down again to 1 hour. Currently the highest I am seeing is 53 minutes on time. Also, I am not trolling as my pizza at the top shows, I have given in the past (over 10 pizzas) and plan to do so in the future, I just like to make interesting contests.

Edit8: Back to work I go, time is still 60 minutes, I have decided to end it shortly after I get off work, Which could be sometime in the next 1-4 hours. So good luck! I will also give a 15 minute warning up here at the top. =P

Edit9: So I think at 650+ comments its time to end this... 50 minutes from whenever this edit was done, the contest will end. =P To clarify, its no longer who gets in and no one post after an hour, it is now who is closest to the end time that has been set.

Edit10: Contest over Winners are Mamayoda with the $15 gift card. and Reingding13 for the $10 gift card. - Taking a nap, both winners please contact me with a validation as listed on the right hand side.

Unfortunately you can't order gift cards, so you need a physical address for delivery. In most cases I got away with listing my name and my Australian mobile (cell) number. When it came time to provide credit card details the only information they required for verification was a zip code. I simply put a zero in front of my four digit Australian post code and voila, pizza on its way.

Policy for all three of those pizza chains is to collect a signature and view the card on delivery, but that was no obstacle for any of my recipients. Where necessary they could simply flash any old card and scrawl any old signature.

So Aussie redditors, get on board and get some pizzas out there to our American friends. I will soon attempt to see if we can also help out other countries as well.

And YSalsoK that this likely works in reverse as well. Dominos Australia (dominos.com.au) only requires a credit card with no verification address, so our American and other international redditors can also send pizza to us over here in Australia! Don't be shy guys, share the pizza goodness!

Doing this a few hours in advance so there's time to accumulate requests.  I'll probably make a decision around 7pm Eastern.

Tell me why you deserve pizza.  DO provide detail and supporting evidence, in the form of photos, clever storytelling, rage comics, cool links, or whatever you've got.  Sob stories are okay but not the only way to get pizza.  Humor is good.  Serious randomness is better.  Describe your request with a haiku or limerick or rage comic.  Or something amazing I haven't even anticipated.  I intend to reward effort and creativity.

Don't PM me, respond here.  I'll PM you if I want any PM details from you.

I might do two if I can't decide on just one.

Please be ready to verify (http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/).  If I like your request I'll PM you requesting you do so.

(Oh, and be sure to upvote any responses you find entertaining - the goal is the provide cool random stuff for everyone to enjoy)

Update - I was late getting home from work so I am overdue picking a winner.  I have narrowed it down to a handful and will be randomly determining from those.  

WINNER IS: ~~mattmagician!~~  (EDIT - ~~IF he responds soon, otherwise I roll again~~ He did not.  Winner is Blaurum, for Moe the Camel!)

--------------

It is time for the next installment of **Pizza Across America,** where I give away a pizza in each of the 50 states!

This is pizza giveaway # **18** of **50**.  The state randomly chosen for this giveaway is **CONNECTICUT**.  The winner will be awarded a **$15 gift card** to one of the Big 3 chains.  If this is not an option for them for whatever reasons, we'll work something else out.


**Rules:** You must be able to **provide photographic proof** that you live or are currently in **CONNECTICUT**.  The photo **MUST** incorporate **your username** and **today's date**.  Some photo ideas include:

* A famous landmark
* A GPS showing your location
* A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the state
* A post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark
* ... or come up with another idea!  I should be able to look at the pic and say ""Yep, he/she is in **CONNECTICUT.**""

**This contest will close Friday, May 10th, at 11pm CDT**.  After the contest closes, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment.  **Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win!**

I would like to reiterate that our subreddit does not stand for witch hunts.  Should you have substantial proof of a scammer (multi account user, similar nick trick, etc.) **MESSAGE THE MODS WITH YOUR PROOF.**  If you come across a post that is vague or confusing, ask the OP *tactfully* to clear up the discrepancy.  Should you desire MORE personal information on the OP, please be conscientious enough to know when to move your questioning to PM.  If you weren't going to gift the requester in the first place, please don't waste your time, the OPs time, and the moderators' time by turning the OPs thread into a flame war.  

Our community is amazing.  Recently, you all have done wonderful things for Boston and Waco in their time of tragedy.  Let's keep this generosity and kindhearted spirit going.  If you see abusive comments report them.  If you see scammers report them.  Speculating and assuming is not enough proof to tear someone's thread apart and personally attack an individual.  You will be banned for doing so as we do not tolerate harassment.

**What up Friday pizza people!...It's a bit sad for me to say, but I may have to wind down this weekly contest at the approaching 52nd week.  Never thought I'd be here almost a year later still going strong, and have absolutely loved being able to do it...it's just that with Christmas rolling nearer, I like to help out families with small kids that can't afford much in gifts for their children.  Unfortunately, I can't do both this year.**  

**Pookie85 et al made a great success out of /r/randomactsofchristmas when she started it last year, and I was proud to be a small part of it.   If you can help, or just send out some encouraging words, stop by...things won't be rolling there until after Halloween.**  

**I'm not disappearing, and will still be sending out random pizza goodness now and then.  And the final ""Singularity!"" three weeks from now will have some kind of *grand finale* uber-prize of some sort.** 

**But this ain't the final week yet...so...**

___________
___________


**WEEK 49**
___________

**SINGULARITY!**
___________

The trick is to **guess the lowest number from 1 to 100, that no one else guessed** . Yes, whole numbers. Say you pick 9...two people pick 3, four people pick 7, and the next highest number picked is 9 and you are the only one who picked it, you win.

You need to **pm me your guess, and post in this thread that you have entered** ...something like ""I'm playing"" or ""I guessed"" or ""If you choke a smurf, what color does it turn?""  Anyone who fails to both pm and post here is disqualified. One entry per person please :) Don't post your guess in this thread tho. Any questions, feel free to ask.

This is for a **$30 gift card** to your choice of Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns. **Entries accepted until 6:00pm Eastern** . Winner announced shortly after.

**GOOD LUCK!**

1) A redditor must post ""I'm playing"" or ""I'm in"" something to that effect.

2) A different redditor must respond to that post and say ""I'm drawing"" right away in order to avoid the mistake of two people drawing the same username, and of course, the apocalypse.  

Here's what I'm looking for....

**Draw the the first poster's username interacting with your own username.  (No X-rated drawrings, por favor.)**

It doesn't have to be glamorous or fantastic, just amuse me.

The artist will get a *$20 GC* to one of the big 3.

One of his favorite things in life is trains (the locomotive kind, get your mind out of the gutter).  I can spare 3 -$20 gift cards to papa johns or pizza hut.  If either of these don't work for you, we might be able to work something else out, and if the winner is international, I'll try and get you some pizza, but I can't guarantee having much luck.

Anyway... ONE (1) gift card goes to someone with the best train drawing.  ONE (1) gift card goes to someone with the best train related story.  ONE (1) gift card goes to the an honorable mention out of either category.

Let's see some cool pictures and hear some interesting train stories. =)

There was a lot of controversy. I feel bad. So, I'm buying someone else a pizza. I guess it's just my way of giving back! :) My old thread is here (in case you were wondering): http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/rg1qn/request_from_md_my_birthday_is_coming_up_sadly/

Anyway, so here it goes. Free pizza. I will pick one winner. This is my first time doing it, so I don't know if I will do it properly. Pretty simple terms... just make a post stating why you would like pizza. And then, I will pick someone for free pizza. 

I can either call in for delivery or order you a gift card. I'm not rich... actually just a student. So, let's keep it $15 and under, please. So, I decided. I'm going to give the actual pizza away on my Birthday. That's on the 29th. 4PM you must have your entries in by then.  

Goodluck everyone. And if anyone decides they want to surprise me with a Cake Day pizza... haha well I would be speechless. Either way, somebody who enters my contest will win a free pizza. 

EDIT: I was asked if I will accept Canadian entries. Unfortunately, I can not. US only.

EDIT2:

Hello Everyone. Entries are now officially closed. Within the hour, I hope to have determined the winner. Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes. Thanks to everyone who entered. This has been very fun!

And to all the haters: HatersGonnaHate.

EDIT3: 

So I have now tallied it up and we have 30 eligible contestants. That's amazing!!! I will be selecting the winner through the generation of random numbers. I will select the 8th random number, randomly selected. Best of luck everyone!

EDIT4:

Wow! I hit cancel instead of save :( No wonder I haven't heard back from the winner yet!!! Anyway, this has been a blast. Through random number generation a winner has been contacted. RERE9090 is the winner of my contest. A link to the contestants and random numbers used is included below as an imgur link. Thank you to everyone who played. And most importantly, thanks for the happy birthday wishes. It's been fun. Thanks and good day everyone!

The packing was absolutely awesome!!
The front of the package (around the mailing address) says:

Dear Postal Worker: This is a username from reddit.com and definitely not a threat! Have a great day and thanks for all you do!

Inside, I found a card! The card stated this:

Dear icankilluwithmybrain,
Your Random Act of Pizza package has arrived! I hope you enjoy it. I was a student at UW in the 1980's (so long ago) and I stayed there when I was 19 also. I was much further from home..
Cheers, AnarchyReigns.

Your Care Package Contains:
1 pkg of 3 blank cards (photos by me)
1 pkg Homemade Almond &amp; Rosemary Soap
1 Small Container of Pur Hand cleanser
1 Body Shop delipscious tinted lip balm
1 pr Original Design Homemade RAoP Earrings
4 Homemade oatmeal-blueberry cookies
1 Giftcard for Second Cup (Now you can live off pistachios, water &amp; coffee!)

I can not express my gratitude to Anarchyreigns for this package. Not only did it brighten my day, It has brightened every day! I can wear my RAoP earrings with pride, and every time I need a little more faith in humanity, I can just look at them and smile. 
I took some pictures once I stopped being all sappy and crying from how happy I was (I know right?) 
I have paid it forward by sending a care package to a mother and her children in the USA!

THANK YOU SO MUCH, I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW MUCH THIS MEANT!

I'm a guy who has shoulder length hair and a long goatee. Whilst I was out celebrating my friend's engagement, he told me that his sister-in-law has a *thing* about guys with long hair and beards. For some reason, she gets freaked out by them, thinks they're freaks and all the rest of it. This is seriously not cool. So seriously not cool that I'm spreading some long-hair beard love to you guys. 

All you have to do is post a picture of your long-haired bearded self holding a sign with your reddit username and the date in the format DD/MM/YY(YY) and then I'll get things underway to get you your pizza. The gentlemen with the most epic hair/beard combo wins it (basically if you have extremely long hair and a Pai Mei beard then you definitely win).

**IMPORTANT:** I live in England so if you're American, you **MUST** tell me what pizza place you want a coupon for out of Domino's, Papa John's and Pizza Hut. If you happen to live in England, I'll be using the Domino's site as the default for ordering online which requires you to give me some more personal info but I won't be holding onto it or anything. If you happen to have a different/better pizza place near you with an online pay/delivery thing with deals then I'll look into that too but please only online secure stuff.


**EDIT:** Ok, it looks like I can't use my card for American ordering. This leaves me with only being able to give to English recipients at the moment until someone can give me a work around or can check if one of the listed chains will take payment from PayPal or something.

Was waiting for a couple more people to enter, but I guess they were busy.  Will have my daughter choose her favorite tomorrow evening (2/12 in the pm).  Thanks for all of those who put forth the effort to create something special for my daughter; I'm excited to show her.*********


I know, I know.... I just gave away 3 pizzas the other day, and back for more.  The ridiculous amount of offer threads are making me so happy that I decided to continue the pizza giving goodness (and hopefully inspire even more giving threads).

BUT... I want something in return.  Art, of any form.  But it needs to be Original Content, and something that you've done specifically for this offer.

Requirements:  

1) No limit on the reddit account -- I don't care if you're brand new, or 4 years old.  Everyone can play!!

2) Art of any form -- singing, drawing, interpretive dance, a dessert, etc etc.  Let your artistic talent flow!

3) I don't care if you're the worst artist in the world, can't sing a lick, or don't know how to dance.  Just participate and have fun with it!!  Really, I don't even care if you let your toddler do the art for you.  So long as you have fun doing it, that is all that matters to me.

4) I am going to let my daughter choose her favorite.  So, you'll probably want to butter her up.  Her favorite things are: ladybugs, giraffes, pizza, my little pony, littlest pet shop, princesses, dora and dinosaurs.  You'd probably have a better chance if your art included something with these.

5) If you want to personalize it any further, here is some pictures of her for reference: http://imgur.com/a/i8Tqu#pWnkXFE

6) Please include your redditor name on/in the art somewhere, as well as the date.  Thank you!

7) I will let kiddo choose the winner.  Contest will close tomorrow when I get home from work, in order to give a lot of people the chance to play!  Not sure how many I'll be giving away.  It's kind of a go-with-the-flow type situation.  Might be 1 might be 10.  Who knows.  INSPIRE ME!  Also, include with the submission your e-mail and choice of Big 3. 

****Edit:  You can submit earlier works of art, if you'd like.  I want to see all the creativity you have!  BUT, preference will go to those who make something specifically for this offer, as well as those who include their username/date.

It is time for the next installment of **Pizza Across America,** where I give away a pizza in each of the 50 states!

This is pizza giveaway # **9** of **50**.  The state randomly chosen for this giveaway is **COLORADO**.  The winner will be awarded a **$15 gift card** to one of the Big 3 chains.  If this is not an option for them for whatever reasons, we'll work something else out.

**Rules:** You must be able to **provide photographic proof** that you live or are currently in **COLORADO**.  The photo **MUST** incorporate **your username** and **the date**.  Some photo ideas include:

* A famous landmark
* A GPS showing your location
* A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the state
* A post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark
* ... or come up with another idea!  I should be able to look at the pic and say ""Yep, he/she is in **COLORADO.**""

**This contest will close Thursday night, July 26th, at 11pm CDT**.  At that point, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment.  **Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win!**

Any suggestions you have please comment, and we can talk about them.

A while back a redditor in the UK sent my wife and I a pizza. We could use it at the time, and it was a good test for him, he wanted to see how hard it was. We ran into a few issues. To avoid those here are a few suggestions. 

I personally would recommend smaller pizzerias, helping out the small business is a good idea, plus generally you get better quality.
Most smaller pizzerias will not have a problem in taking your credit card payment, and delivering it to a local.


Large chains, such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa Murphy's, etc, require seeing the card holder with the card at the place of delivery. This is one of the issues that we ran into. The easiest way (and in my finding the only way) to avoid this issue is not to mention anything about it. Order the pizza online, or as if you were the one at the delivery site. Most delivery people (although required to) do not ask to see the card. If by chance they do require it you may have an issue.


Some further suggestions:

Feel free to post if you have need, or want to buy a pizza for someone. Please use [REQUEST] or [OFFER] in your title, this makes it much easier.

If you receive a pizza please take a moment from your enjoyment to share with the rest of us, and thank the person who bought it for you.


Please do not be a frequent need poster, while we do know that some people have situations where they need months of help there are a lot of people who could use the up once in a while. Lets spread the help, and love. 

We would rather see this community thrive, and sorta police itself as to scams and such, if we need to we will go with a redditgifts type website, but would rather not have to.


Lets spread word of this community on Reddit!!!!


Lets all have fun, and possibly some global pizza party days ?


As I said this will be edited with more suggestions as they arise.
 
Edit : It has been suggested that people who requested pizza post a general geographic location. I will update the sidebar with this.

I only have 1 tattoo myself, but I really dig good tattoos and piercings.

**Rules:** 

I will pick a favorite based on my own liking. I will most likely not pick your submission if its not original content (i.e. some random pic off the internet), for the best chance post a pic of your own tattoo/piercing. I may take other posters comments into consideration, but the final decision will be my own.

I will accept PM submissions, but please post in the thread that you are submitting PM, so I can reply to something publicly should I choose you as a winner.

**Timeframe:** 
I plan to pick a winner sometime Thursday (5/16) late afternoon-ish, and send the gift card out Thursday evening as soon as proper communication can be made.

Good Luck!

**Edit 1:** keep them coming, im really enjoying the sumbissions do far! A winner won't be picked until Thursday afternoon US time. Also, I've decided to add a 2nd prize also in the $10-$25 range. One prize will go to my favorite tattoo, one to my favorite piercing, with the overall favorite taking 1st prize. Yes, it may be possible for one submission to win both, but that might be a hard feat to accomplish!

**Edit 2:** It's afternoon where I am, and I've chosen the winners! I decided to award my favorite tattoo with a $25 gift card, and my favorite piercing also with a $25 gift card. And I will be awarding 2nd place in each category with $10 gifts. Winners to be contact soon to arrange award. I will update later with names of winners! Thank you all so much for participating and your submissions, they were all enjoyable and made it a hard decision (hence the extra awards!)

**Edit 3:** Winners are below. $95+ in pizza given out... I say + because one winner is in another country and I don't know how much the transaction is going to cost me yet :) Oh well, enjoy the pizza guys and gals!

Plus, it's just a lot of fun to do these.

The prize will be a $25 giftcard to the chain of your choice (Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns).

So, what is this contest? Well, let me explain that.

To enter, you must take a picture of the coolest thing in your house/apartment/dorm room/etc. No, there's no specific definition for ""cool"", but you all know the general idea of what I mean. Just something that you're proud of, or think is really awesome.

Then explain a bit about *why* that thing is so cool. I may not personally find it that cool, but if you explain it well, I may still like your entry best. 

Want some hints about what I might find cool? Well, I like nerdy things...I love D&amp;D, Futurama, and I'm getting into Naruto. I love funny things. But that's not everything, so you'll have to guess (if you want to appeal to my interests).

Now for a few rules:

* Accounts older than a month
* US only
* You must have done stuff other than ask for things on subreddits like RAOP.
* This one's harder for me to enforce, but please, if you've received a lot recently, let others have a chance. It's just nice.
* If you want to whine about how you're dying of six different diseases and your 58 children are crying every night for pizza, it won't really help you. If you rant about it enough, I might forget you entered the contest.
* VERIFY YOUR PICTURE. For those that don't know what it means, you need to somehow include your username to prove it's your picture. Date is nice, too. If it's easier, you can take two pictures, one with the username paper blocking part of the object and one with the whole thing. It would be far too easy to steal an awesome picture off of the internet, and that's not fair to everyone else.

I think that's all the info we need for the contest itself...oh, and it's going to end on Friday night, at 8 pm CST. At that point, I will pick my favorite entry and give them the prize!

Edit: Wow, everyone has so much cool stuff! I guess I just wanted to update this to say this is going to be a really tough choice.

I'd like to say that this isn't a request for myself but rather for the community I call home. There was a fire this morning in Madison, WI that left a large group of college students and plain normal residents without a home, without clothes, without personal possessions, but most importantly here, no food (as of 5am CST 6/30 the fire was first noticed and by 11am CST when my newspaper reported it, it was still in flames). You can see the Facebook group for aide here: http://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/event.php?eid=213573798684996

and an article about the fire here: 
http://www.dailycardinal.com/news/apartment-fire-forces-evacuations-near-capitol-square-1.2486354

Please, vote this up and together we can figure out a way to help them out. I don't know how to get in touch with people, but there are already folks out there trying, so they'll find a way. The best option is to call:

Ian's Pizza on State: http://www.ianspizza.com/

I saw the post about the ABC coverage of this subreddit, and I came poking around. Saw someone offering to buy pizza for a college kid taking summer classes and I thought...wait a second...that's me!

Basically I'm taking summer classes to graduate in four years with a double major. Just got home from my hour long commute from the big city back to the middle of nowhere tiny town, and found out that since all of my siblings except for me are gone for the summer, my parents decided that meant they didn't need to cook or buy food anymore (they went out to eat before I got home and didn't bring back leftovers).

Fridge is empty, and I still haven't had dinner cause I'm too poor with commuting and gas money. :(

But then I realized something. I didn't want to ask, because there were already two people on there who were in worse situations than me. And it made me happier to know that one of them was getting the warm gooey deliciousness that is pizza than to ask for myself. I'll go eat some back of the cupboard stragglers, and I'll survive.

As soon as I get my next paycheck, I am definitely going to buy someone a random pizza. 

Anyway, I think the point I'm trying to make is: thank you guys for existing, and don't freak out about all the new people coming! This is an awesome idea and I think the media coverage will be a blessing in the long run. 

Enjoy your pizza goodness, and I'll see you in a few weeks when I get to be the benevolent Pizza God! :)

Please read the entire post.  I'm not going to feel bad about disqualifying invalid entries.

I'm asking people to draw celebratory pictures, involving cake in some (SFW) way.  Here's how prizes will work:

- prize is a $10 US egift card to pizza hut, domino's, or papa john's, your choice.

- the first 3 acceptable (by my judgement... basically look like you spent more than 2 minutes of effort on it.  crappy art is ok [seriously, i'm bad at drawing too] but a simple circle labeled ""cake"" is not) drawings get a $10 card

- the 2 best drawings (as judged by me) by midnight EST tonight (~2.5 hours from now) get a $10 card.

- people are allowed to win in both categories

- one entry per person.  no editing your post to update your drawing (or as a placeholder).  any posts with the edit mark (or that I happen to catch being ninja edited) are disqualified.  that means don't edit for stupid things like spelling, etc. too, because i have no way to distinguish.

- BONUS: each entrant can PM me one guess (only one) as to why I rarely eat cake.  if you are correct AND you otherwise won a prize in one of the categories above, you get $2 extra on your card.

- must have had reddit account for at least 2 months with some minimal level of activity (my discretion), or for 1 month with a significant level of activity (again my discretion).  really good art may get an exception, but don't count on it.

**CLOSED**  Thanks everyone!  I hope nobody minds, but I decided to just give a $10 card each to all the entries (except the nsfw one, sorry :-/, and $12 to the one that guessed right that I don't eat eggs) instead of trying to judge them because I like them all and this way more people get pizza!  If anyone feels strongly offended/bothered that I changed it up like that, talk to me and we'll figure something out :)

**UPDATE** oops, didn't notice that the person who guessed correctly didn't actually submit an entry, so it'll just be 5 $10 cards",,False,,t5_2s7wq,1374726579.0,,psm321,True,t3_1izxkz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1izxkz/offer_its_my_cake_day_lets_celebrate/,

Thanks for playing, everyone!

------------

It is time for the next installment of **Pizza Across America,** where I give away a pizza in each of the 50 states!

This is pizza giveaway # **13** of **50**.  The state randomly chosen for this giveaway is **NEW MEXICO**, home of my favorite fictional crystal meth druglord.  The winner will be awarded a **$15 gift card** to one of the Big 3 chains.  If this is not an option for them for whatever reasons, we'll work something else out.


**Rules:** You must be able to **provide photographic proof** that you live or are currently in **NEW MEXICO**.  The photo **MUST** incorporate **your username** and **the date**.  Some photo ideas include:

* A famous landmark
* A GPS showing your location
* A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the state
* A post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark
* ... or come up with another idea!  I should be able to look at the pic and say ""Yep, he/she is in **NEW MEXICO.**""

**This contest will close Thursday, November 1st, at 11pm CDT**.  At that point, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment.  **Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win!**

I will PM the winner and ask for his/her mailing address.  Then I put the gift card in the mail and off it goes.  Continental United States only.  And please only participate if you have a Papa John's in your neighborhood.

I wasn't sure how well this would work, but apparently it worked better than I anticipated.  I appreciated everybody's comments, they turned my blah day into a great day.  I enjoyed the jokes, the videos and the kind words.

So here's the deal.  The winner of the Papa John's $15 card is:

However, since I had such a great time with the contest, I am purchasing four more $15 Papa John's cards, which will go to:

**bilbo_swaggins**
**Pyrofusion**
**SpecialKayla**

I'm just waiting for their mailing addresses to come back to my PM.  Then it's five envelopes, five stamps, and off they go.

They have camp this week and next from 12-9 M-F. These kids have been and will continue to work their butts off. They have spent these hours outside in the heat and in periods of rain in order to get their show ready. They will perform at our football games and compete in competitions. I can't stress how hard these kids work. 

Running these shows takes not only work from the kids but a lot of of money, we are estimating this year to spend over $10,000 on equipment, supplies and show fees, etc. 

Now to my request, I would like to reward the hard working kids to a pizza dinner next Friday (8/26). We have over 60 kids and 10 staff members who really deserve a reward. If anyone would be willing to donate Pizza Huts gift cards to help make this happen, I would really appreciate it. 

I am off to help with camp and will not be back online until about 10.00 PM EST so I will check back than. 

Thanks in advance. :-) 

EDIT - We are in Pennsylvania

Edit 2 - We have to do MAJOR fundraising and ask for donations in order to keep our  program running. Each child is responsible for a commitment fee and also asked to help with fundraising.

There has been a lot of people helped, and the influx of users has brought just as many people giving as receiving. We love this!!! 

There have been some concerns expressed about people scamming to get pizza. We really see that the mass majority of people are truly in need, but we know there are most likely some that are not. The nature of this whole thing is truly Random Acts of Pizza, meaning give it to whomever you want... 

**If your intention is to give pizza to a person in need**, and you're concerned about the sincerity of the poster you are replying to, ask for proof of some kind, or ask for a phone number so you can call and talk to them. If someone is in true need, and you offer, they should be fine with going along with this.

This does not mean that you should not just offer a pie to someone who posts a request, it just means that if you want verification there is no shame in asking for it.

**Please help the mods help the new people** There are a lot of new people trying to figure out reddit, they don't know how to pm, or not post personal info for all to see. Some don't know how to post. I personally have sent hundreds (no exaggeration) of pm's on how to do stuff in the last couple days. If you see someone doing something wrong, or asking a question help please... It is why we are all here right? Help....

If there is a scammer please report them to us. I hope their karma bites them in the ass, but we will as well....


**Finally**, your mods are spending a lot of time on this. It is a labor of love. Once in a while we could use a pizza as well :) I know that I would not say no. I am on an apprentice wage after struggling with my past occupation due to economic times. I am living in a crap rental house, with about 20 bucks to my name for the next week, with a family of three (no joke). I know Gadianton would not say no, as he has huge financial issues as well. Not really sure about snang, still getting to know him, but I am sure that he would at least appreciate the offer.

* Do not jump on others requests. If you see another request getting fulfilled, good for them, but it isn't a place where you should ask for one from the giver.  
* There seems to be a lot of sore losers lately. If you lose a contest, there is nothing a mod can do. Please continue to report contests that never get fulfilled or if something seems off.
