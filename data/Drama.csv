1368514700.0,584,self.Drama,1eav6z,Amy's Baking Company re-sells store bought food and passes it off as their own. Drama ensues.,666,82,274,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1eav6z/amys_baking_company_resells_store_bought_food_and/,"On a [recent episode of Kitchen Nightmares](http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/05/kitchen_nightmares_amys_baking_company_season_finale_gordon_ramsay_scottsdale.php?ref=trending), a bistro and pizzeria in Scottsdale, AZ, is revealed to:


a) Be owned and operated by a staff ~~entirely composed~~ **(I just watched the Kitchen Nightmares episode and I'm happy to report that only the two owners are batshit insane)** of batshit insane people


b) Taking store bought food and passing it off as their own to recoup money from their massive losses (probably because it's managed by a bunch of crazy people)



In fact, this is the first restaurant in an episode of Kitchen Nightmares that Gordon Ramsey has walked out on. Apparently even Ramsey, a man known for his screaming and crazy rants, finds these people to be too insane for his liking.



Anyway, [reddit picks up the story and runs with it](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1dzh5g/craziest_restaurant_owners_in_kitchen_nightmares/). For some reason, the mods of /r/videos disable commenting and remove the post, which had received ~2700 upvotes. The owners of Amy's Baking Company find out about this (probably through death threats and their wrongful implication in the bombing of the Boston Marathon) and [flip the fuck out](http://i.imgur.com/Uu73yB9.png) on their public Facebook page. Someone submits the screenshots to /r/cringepics, prompting a few threads:



* http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1eanuw/amys_baking_company_tries_to_scare_off_redditors/




* http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1e9tk2/so_amys_baking_companys_facebook_page_is_having_a/



Drama is still ongoing as (I assume) the owners of the restaurant will continue to have a nuclear-grade meltdown for a long while. This post was shitty. I'm drunk. Deal with it.

The Day Z mod was phenomenally successful and made bohemia interactive, the company that developed it, vasts amounts of money. So much money that they decide to create a stand alone version of the game.

And then Hammerpoint Interactive decided that they wanted to create a similar game by the name of the War Z  and as soon as everyone heard the news people started saying  that it was an enormous rip off. That they where simply trying to cash in on the success of Day Z and that they even had a similar name as Day Z. This is backed up by [images comparing War Z with War Inc](http://imgur.com/a/ZSf5V) (which was the previous game Hammerpoint Interactive had released.) [Reddit post](http://redd.it/ygwyw)


The controversy started when one of the [WarZ producers call players faggots for camping](http://uk.gamespot.com/news/the-war-z-producer-calls-campers-fgots-6398729), the exact quote being
&gt;""I'm trying to play at least couple hours a day every single day. Getting killed a lot, but 80 percent of all kills are 'honest.' I'm just being careless. I'm not trying to hide. 20 percent are shitty kills by faggot's who's spawn camping.""

Next came the revelation that the [War Z copy pastes terms of service from League of Legends](http://i.imgur.com/EBOr7.jpg). [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/11jk83)


Then there was an update where the developers forced people to [pay 750 gold coin to create a clan.](http://redd.it/13wuol)


Then there were claims by a former moderator that his account had been hacked and that the [company are going to abandon the game](http://i.imgur.com/62kg1.jpg) in 6 months if they don't get enough revenue from it. He also said that the company was banning random accounts to get people to rebuy the game, that there was a massive problem with hacking and that the game is a direct port from war inc. [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/13xv00)

[Turns out most of this was lies,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svd-p3-CURk) (except that his accout was hacked) and that he just said that because he was mad at being demodded after the hacker used his account and deleted his posts. [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/149ntp) Apparently 

Sergey Titov makes a post on the WarZ forums say that they [were considering legal action.](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?71253-Regarding-Devin-our-ex-moderator)

The drama was further escalated when one player experienced problems with the game, and he asked for a refund only to be told that the game was currently in beta and if a refund is given [they would be put on a global ban list.](http://imgur.com/t6F9c)


Its also worth noting at this point that the Executive Producer, Sergey Titov also happens to be behind the production of [big rigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f3HDsgLV68) possible one of the worst games ever made. So bad that its meta critic score [is 8 out of 100.](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing)

After that there was a heavily [upvoted post](http://redd.it/151f1d) on /r/gaming say that the [developers lied about many of the games features.](http://i.imgur.com/j9Q3f.jpg)

Meanwhile there is much argueing on the [steam forum.](http://i.imgur.com/Pi3my.png) [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/150iso)

Popular youtuber Total Biscuits then makes a [video about the WarZ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKAm3nzg6I), if I was to summarize it briefly I would say that he completely ripped the shit out of it. Of his many complaints about the game the most prominent were

* It looked ugly and had low texture quality
* That the ability to buy in game items for real world cash was ethically questionable and went against the idea of a zombie survival game.
* The game itself was as boring as hell.

/u/Bromazepam points out in the comments that there is something horribly wrong with the reflections when he spots the reflection of [a flash light in the water.](http://i.imgur.com/TEdi2.jpg)
Later comfirmed by [this](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=114076844) post on the steam forums.

Edit: Total Biscuit has uploaded an [update about the WarZ affair.](http://youtu.be/3IQrhrooSOY?t=1m25s)


[Someone makes a reddit post](http://redd.it/152tbh) stating that the WarZ has updated its game so that it's even more of a money grab. You now have to wait four hours instead of one for one of your characters to respawn and there is an option for you to pay real money to buy back into the game. They also forced you to sign a TOS which disallows refunds.


Someone starts a [petition to remove on steam](http://steamcommunity.com/app/226700/discussions/0/828925849084337399/) with over a thousand comments in it.


Developers do an [interview with game spy](http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html?utm_campaign=twposts&amp;utm_source=twitter) in which he tries to defend the game and it's lack of features. (Spoiler, he fails). Highlights from this interview include such phrases as

&gt;Let's be frank: when you read ""up to 100 players"" -- what does it mean to you personally? I mean, for me it doesn't mean that I will play with 99 other players. Really :)

As well as

&gt;There's no such thing as ""Release"" for an online game.

Edit: He then makes a [forum post](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79251-Steam-purchase-page-issues) in which he blames customers for misreading the steam page.


Now what do you do when people start criticizer you, you resort to censorship because that the one thing that the internet really loves.

Rhino crunch posts a [video stating the game is a scam](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXKu5lV69V8) and that the developers lied.

* He says that the game was only in development recently when it had been previously stated that it had been in development for years.
* He also claims that the game is nothing more than a mod and that they pulled people from War inc to make WarZ
* He was then blocked from there twitter after trying to confront them.

Edit: Rhinocrunch has made another review in which he bacisally says [I told you so.](http://youtu.be/BUrKdAjN4DM)

The game is finally [removed from steam.](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/12/19/the-war-z-no-longer-available-on-steam/)

Edit: Valve offers people that have brought the game a refund and issued a statement say:

&gt;From time to time a mistake can be made and one was made by prematurely issuing a copy of War Z for sale via Steam. We apologize for this and have temporary removed the sale offering of the title until we have time to work with the developer and have confidence in a new build. Those who purchase the game and wish to continue playing it via Steam may do so. Those who purchased the title via Steam and are unhappy with what they received may seek a refund by creating a ticket at our support site [here.](https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php)

All this drama surrounding the game currently has resulted in it being given a [meta critic rating of 1.1](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-war-z) dispite the developers asking people [to vote for them](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79039-War-Z-on-metacritic-tell-us-what-do-you-think-!).


Edit: Sergey Titov does an [interview](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash/) with PC gamer in which he talks about the problems the game has had and what has caused them. He all say the game has almost 700,000 players.

&gt; SCOTTSDALE, AZ. MAY 15, 2013 -- Amy’s Baking Company will host a Grand Re-Opening on Tuesday night, May 21, following unflattering portrayals on national television.

&gt; Customers will be able to decide who is correct: a famous celebrity chef or the marketplace that has supported the small, locally-owned business for six years. 

&gt; When re-opened, a portion of proceeds will benefit a charity organized to bring awareness to cyber bullying. 

&gt; Seating is limited. Reservations may be made by emailing sjones@rosemoserallynpr.com. 

&gt; Diners will also have the opportunity to meet, and judge for themselves the character of owners Amy and Samy Bouzaglo, who have devoted their lives to and earn their living from their small restaurant. The Bouzaglos have been married for 10 years, after Sammy emigrated from Israel. 

&gt; The owners will likely be holding a press conference before the Grand Re-Opening and answer falsehoods depicted on a reality television show, including assertions that the restaurant confiscates tips from servers. 

&gt; In fact, wait staff is paid $8-$14 per hour, two and half to nearly five times the standard hourly wage for servers. 

&gt; Questions will also be answered about what happened to their Facebook page. 

&gt; Amy’s Baking Company was recently featured on the hit PBS show “Check Please” and has received A+ reports from CBS 5 for kitchen preparedness. 

&gt; “We are very upset by what has taken place, apologize about the acrimony that has ensued but now must fight back to save our business. We hope and believe much good can result from what has transpired. We ask the public to keep an open mind as we begin to tell our side of the story,” Samy Bouzaglo said. 

&gt; For more details, please contact Michael Saucier.

1355792778.0,65,self.Drama,150x7n,[Meta] A very serious and in-depth discussion on invasions and how terrible they are. ,91,26,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/150x7n/meta_a_very_serious_and_indepth_discussion_on/,"Today is a somber day for r/Drama, our glorious and beautiful sub has been invaded by r/SRDBroke. [Here is the bridge maliciously created by members of SRDBroke](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRDBroke/comments/150kjx/holy_shit_what_the_fuck_is_wrong_with_these_people/) for no purpose other than to disrupt our proud community.

Now, I want to make it clear that invasions are very, very *bad.* I feel the best way to do this is to provide you all with some very [meticulous data on how *bent out of shape* people can get if you vote in subs you're not a part of](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/139hz6/meta_analysis_of_vote_brigading_on_a_recent/). 

But that's not it! [Here is some more in-depth research on the disruptive power of invading threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/141f8h/meta_analysis_of_srds_impact_on_ainbow_thread/)

And [another one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/wv5xh/meta_stop_starting_shit_in_other_subreddits_guys/) highlighting those who partake in thread invasions. How disgusting!

As you can see, this heinous crime makes users *very very mad*, but during my research on this topic I had a startling realization! *Why,* the utmost respected Reddit Invasionologist has seemingly become an [invader herself](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/14zmj8/gossip_laurelai_is_still_really_mad_at_cptn_sisko/c7i6y0b).

[Oh the horror](http://allthingsd.com/files/2011/09/oh_the_drama-225x285.png).

Upon noting this tragic turn of events, my research team and I also discovered that /r/SRDBroke was created for the sole purpose of calling out another sub for *thread invading*. How could this be? How could a group of people so consumed by their hatred of thread invasions turn out to be thread invaders themselves? 

After many hours of research, [my team and I](http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0018/41454/In_the_lab_4_2000.jpg) have discovered that thread invading is, in fact, caused by an *infectious parasite*. 

We have named our discovery *Srdbrokus hypocritious*. The later stages of infection of this havoc wreaking parasite can be seen here : [*S. hypocritious*](http://www.reddit.com/r/srdbroke). 

Symptoms include: 


* Teeth gnashing.

* Internet addiction.

* *Slight* cough.

* Complete loss of self-awareness.

* Hypocritical tendencies.

* *Thread invading*.

* Dry mouth.

While it is unknown how *S. hypocritious* is transmitted, we do encourage anyone who feels as though they may be infected to stay calm, and please *get a grip*.

--------
**Recovery**:

While we are all surely still quite shaken from this tragic event, and it may seem as though we will never be the same, we will prevail.

Let us mourn the loss of our 3 self-post karma, and continue on. 

r/Drama will also be instituting a sidebar list of quarantined zones. This list will consist of those areas deemed too hazardous to be visited, so as to protect ourselves from this sinister infection. 

Sidenote: **We have flair now yay!**. A full list of emotes is coming soon. If you have any graphics/pictures you would like to be used as an emote, please send it to the moderators! Thank you! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

The Red Pill (TRP) is kind of a pants-on-head-stupid mixture of the fear of Feminism from MRA, the mysoginy and ""game theory"" of PUA, and the frustrated, ""it can't be me"" rage of Incels.

*What's their core philosophy?*

""Feminism is a vast conspiracy designed to prevent beta-males from having sex as often as alpha-males, because all women are subject to their baser instincts and cannot control themselves around ""alphas"". Thus, in order to score women, I should learn to treat women like shit and reject anything that I ever thought I heard a feminist say, ever. Also, rape within realationships doesn't real and I should be allowed to hit women"". No, seriously. Keep reading, I'll back this up soon.

*Why should I care, and why is this on r/Drama?*

OK, so here's where it gets fun. TRP has been getting noticed A LOT in the last few days, like more than they were. The big thing in the #drama IRC (which you should all be hanging out in!) for a while was popping into #TheRedPill to troll/shitstir/ask-actual-questions. Here's links to a couple of logs, below, with some choice quotes picked out. Please note, these people are abject cowards who will not hesitate to use the ban-hammer on anyone who doesn't immediately fall down at the feet of their logical rationality.

[First IRC Chat in #TheRedPill](http://pastebin.com/dA3hPiLC)

It took a little while for things to get going, so the start of the pastebin is mainly users from #drama (BiPolarBear0, Celocanth14, Schadenfreude (me) and Fab500. Things pick up when Roger and Morpheus chime in, but I think our winner for the night was TRP user Kday:

 &gt;Kday: Our philosophy is learning the tools and knowledge to thrive in reality as it actually exists.


&gt;Kday: No being respectable gets you women, and in a few years that woman is going to be fucking some trucker while taking half of what you own. 

There's the bitterness! Get used to this.


&gt; Kday: No i've never been married. Im 23

So, we're speaking to an authority here


&gt;Kday: But I have been beta in my past relationships which caused them to fail.
&gt;    I don't ever blame the woman, they can't help it.
&gt;    Its what they are conditioned to do. 

This is what we call psuedoscience, if you didn't know. Psuedoscience is the basis of the TRP philosophy

&gt;Schadenfreude: Kday: [18:39:48] &lt;Schadenfreude&gt; so if I get this straight, what you're saying is that you have to change the way you behave, because women are too stupid to change the way THEY behave?
&gt;
&gt;Kday: Yes
&gt;
&gt;Kday: I didn't call them stupid I said they can't help themselves.

That's right ladies, you're not stupid. You just can't overcome your base instincts the way these manly-men can!

&gt;Kday: I never listen to women anymore, I only listen to what they respond to and their actions.



That's the important part to understanding these idiots. The real drama pops up in the actual pastebin logs, which I invite people to dissect in the comments. Pay particular attention to Scutagium, the hero #drama needed that night. He really stirs things up by demanding real, peer-reviewed scientific proof of TRPs claims. You can imagine how that went down. 

&gt; scutagium: there is still no answer to how genetics are more important then attachment theory
&gt;
&gt;Morpheus: i listened to facts instead of theories

[Second IRC Chat in #theredpill](http://pastebin.com/XtWsqbxh)

This was a much shorter chat, where Schadenfreude (me) and Fab500 attempted to get TRP to explain their stance on rape.

&gt;Schadenfreude: ok, so I was looking at TheBluePill sub today after I found you guys, and found this posting. These are quotes supposedly from one of your sidebar featured submissions, and I'm just wondering if this is really how redpill views rape: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1bma3e/i_found_rtheredpill_s_position_on_rape_surely/
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: I swear I'm not trolling by asking that
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: If you attack a stranger, hold them down and fuck them, you should be put in a deep dark hole.
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: OK, sure, but what about the rest of it?
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: You'll have to be more specific.
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: well, OK
&gt;
&gt;Schadenfreude: what about date rape? You take a girl out, get her drunk, and fuck her knowing that she wouldn't be into it sober. Is that OK?
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: There are a few problems with that question.
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: 1.) Unless I'm holding a gun to her head, she got herself drunk.
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: 2.) Her ""not being into it sober"" is such an ambiguous statement it is nearly impossible to define.
&gt;
&gt;@Son-of-Man: 3.) The definition of rape should never change based on her feelings, although it often does.

This one was less drama-y, but I wanted to include it because it's a fantastic example of how spineless TRP gets when confronted with the implications of what they're saying. Most of that chat is spent with us rephrasing questions until they fit the specific mold that TRPers can respond to without sounding like monsters. [Not that they aren't afraid of doing that](http://i.imgur.com/L8XSSnM.gif).

What you have there is a screen taken from a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1bowyb/random_beta_comment_of_the_day_4413/c98nxum?context=3) that caused a bit of a shit-storm dustup on Men's Rights, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1bw6c6/what_on_earth_is_rtheredpill/). The TRP whine-fest post can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1bzhqs/srsers_open_mr_thread_on_trp/). Please note that anyone who disagrees with TRP is automatically an SRSer. Hopefully this effortpost will change that. 

You might also notice that Redpill has a mirror sub, /r/thebluepill. This is a great source for TRP stupidity. They're so great, in fact, that they even get the occasional TRPer, such as [EccentricDuck](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/19bouq/its_a_joke_sub_right/c8mxt0w), or the time Roe decided to do a [mini-AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1bauul/hi_im_one_of_the_red_pillers_that_youre_mocking/).

*OK, that was a lot of words. What's the take away?*

I'd like to see us all come together and really appreciate just how insane and stupid some people can be. This post may not have contained the most absurd drama, but it's a quality of drama that isn't often found. We don't get to find a real, honest-to-goodness badguy to make fun of very often. So, I encourage you all to enjoy the links, and when you see one of these sub-human shitpiles start defending their positions, feel free to link it here, in your local /r/drama.

How to begin? 

One of your moderators it seems has been co-mingling and aiding SRS in ridding Reddit of users that SRS elite members have deemed ""undesirable"" (see: SRSsucks/Anti-SRS members). 

A private subreddit, /r/Bughunt (ran by prominent SRS members) has been utilized for months to track, monitor, and harass Reddit users that they have deemed racist, misogynists and generally anti-SRS for the purpose of eventually getting them shadowbanned (oh and it works).

 And guess what? 

[One of your mods has been helping them the entire time](http://i.imgur.com/259bfEh.png). 
Please note the user being followed by your own mod, is an SRSsucks member. 

It doesn't stop at just one person though, note the mod telling them:

&gt;I have gone above and beyond to send you folks the names

&gt;I'll continue supplying you with names.

Note that lovely plural. 

It doesn't stop merely at him aiding them to rid Reddit of Anti-srs/SRSsucks members, however, [your mod is also abusing his moderator position to remove anti-srs rhetoric](http://i.imgur.com/EWRcDNP.png) that SRS *really* doesn't like. 

For more about the ""4chan stuff"" [see here and note that 4chan has had an anti-srs movement for months](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1a8nct/recap_pol_has_declared_war_on_srs/). Heard about it? No? Wondering why? 

**implications**:

The most obvious is that one of your mods is aiding SRS to stifle anti-srs rhetoric, and get the most vocal of your own community shadowbanned from Reddit. 

The less obvious is that the same mod who is aiding SRS to rid the site of your own community is the same mod [""leaking"" entire pages (seemingly unabaited) from private SRS spaces](http://www.reddit.com/r/himisphere). Are you beginning to wonder why the leaks from SRShome are *less than entertaining*?

And of course, this bizarre little situation wherein one of [SRS's most ""famous"" members revealing to this mod, and *only* this mod (only that person on this website as far as we know) their new and *very* secret Reddit account.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1ehnmm/archangellestrudelle_has_been_a_naughty_boy/).

So in short, it seems SRSsucks has a mod that is not only aiding SRS to track and shadowban those SRS deems ""undesirable"" / is stifling anti-srs rhetoric in SRSsucks / is trusted by SRS's most prominent members - but also has unprecedented access to SRS's private spaces and is now ""leaking"" their most banal of conversations. 

It looks to us, as though SRSsucks has an SRS member as a mod. 

Which, no offense, [it wouldn't be the first time](http://i.imgur.com/Ekmjr.png).

Enjoy going the way of /r/antisrs, and have a good night. 

_______________________________________________________

It seems that that post never got out of the spam filter before being removed. Then another thread (posted in comments btw twasi) was successfully posted, then removed by the mods without any word.

**they are literally censoring embarrassing screenshots** in a sub that spends half of it's time complaining about ""SRS censorship.""

lmfao. 

Edit: Good news everyone! They re-approved the thread.

But then locked the comments so only the mods could whine in it, and no one else there is allowed to talk about it - unless they want to brigade /r/drama of course!

They also banned a couple people from drama it seems for asking them to not brigade.

This is SRSsucks, right? Land of Irony anyone?

And, considering no respectable subreddit on this website runs their shit on freenode anymore, /r/atheism decided to move to a Snoonet.org chan, and when Laurelai (who is on a fake reddit vacation) discovered this, decided to [enter the new chat and throw a shit fit about how mad she is](http://privatepaste.com/2acaab5d7a) because she's not the queen bee of the IRC chan for the worst subreddit on Reddit.

Brave, y'all, fucking brave as shit. 

So anyhoo, everyone pretty much laughed their asses off, and she got doxxed by a staff member (Snoonet.org Staff member) because it's apparently too funny to not do - aka brilliant showmanship of both a meltdown and complete internet Reddit ineptitude. 

BONUS: the shit fit features other Reddit meta losers! 

Horray!

Edit: forgot to mention, this is made all the more hilarious due to the fact that snoonet chans for specific subreddits are only given to mods of the actual subreddit on Reddit, so LL would have absolutely no chance of being an OP, or owner of said Snoonet chan, because...well duh [she baleeted her account a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1czprq/gossip_laurelai_have_deleted_her_account/), and is still staunchly pretending she isn't horribly addicted to Reddit and/or internet Powahz of which she wields as a majestic internet wiccan. 


**By demand, a tldr**: So LL is mad that her freenode server /r/atheism chat was removed from r/atheism's sidebar because they moved their chat to Snoonet, of which she has nothing to do with. She is pissed because she is no longer an OP, or important in any form or fashion in the /r/atheism chat, because she has no affiliation what so ever with /r/atheism in any form.

So she went to the /r/atheism chat on snoonet and basically bitch fitted at them for changing networks, and they all laughed at her, then Snoonet staff member Red doxxed her by linking her Encyclopedia Dramatica article and laughing at her as a reason for why she has nothing to do with reddit (anything) anymore.

I was just enjoying the private popcorn, which was pretty big and lasted for a few days, until at some point Lefto did something trivial that pissed me off. I think he removed one of my comments in SRSsucks, so I pledged to take him down in mod mail. I wish I had more screens about this but I got demodded then.

Biased-allied administrator decides to restart the server just as the axis are about to cap the largest city in the game which takes hours of work. (The Antwerp Incident)...,53,9,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/18byz7/battleground_europe_that_old_ww2_game_that_was/,"Hey.

So basically a pretty big thing went down in BattleGround Europe, a large-scale WW2 simulation game. It basically went down like this, I find bullet-point form will be an easier way to tell the story:

- Antwerp is the biggest city in the game, it's a huge city to capture and will result in much-needed supply for whichever side possesses it 

- Axis have pushed the allied frontline all the way back to Antwerp, this means they've captured numerous towns, cities and docks. (capping towns and cities in this game is not as easy as standing in a CP for 60 seconds, it can take hours, days, weeks to capture a town sometimes)

- Antwerp is the largest city in the game and therefore the hardest to cap, if Axis capture this city they gain valuable supply and have essentially won the campaign

- Axis attacked the city and capped all but 2 CPs within the city, 2 more CPs and they've won the campaign

- An allied player by the name of 'DOC' who also happens to be an administrator decides to take down the server for maintenance with just a 10 minute warning, he disables killing and capturing CPs just incase the axis still manage to capture it. It's quite coincidental that he decided to do this when the allies were basically unable to recapture the CPs they lost as they had lost valuable spawns

- The server is reset and the town is completely reset and is in allied control again, hours of Axis work down the drain and a shitstorm ensues

- Many axis high-command (experienced vets who have been playing for years) desert their post and leave the game forever, the Axis is basically left in dissarray

- The rest of the axis playerbase decide to give the map to the allies, putting up no resistance in what's called a 'pity map'

- DOC starts banning people who speak out against the decision and the player base begins to decline and drama starts between allied and axis players.

- CRS (the devs) are being criticized left and right.

http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/34/view/forums/thread/374738/antwerp-discussion-thread.html

I thought it was quite interesting.

TLDR: Axis almost win the game, asshole allied-biased administrator takes down the server to stop them.

1374705894.0,36,self.Drama,1izlpa,[BREAKING] r/Drama mods take it too far. Drama and dissent are being censored.,59,23,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1izlpa/breaking_rdrama_mods_take_it_too_far_drama_and/,"Hello /r/drama. There's something happening in *your own* subreddit that I thought you would like to know about. I just hope someone, anyone, gets the chance to see this before it is censored as well.

It would appear that the mods of /r/drama have decided that they no longer agree with the upvote/downvote system which Reddit relies on. They have also gone to great lengths to silence dissenting opinion. How, you ask? Well, let me explain:

Now, I'm going to keep this brief. I'm not the kind of person to dance around the issue. If I've got something to say, you can bet your ass I'll get to the point. Some people would even describe me as curt, or even terse. 

So how, exactly, are the mods censoring this subreddit? Well, let me explain:

Earlier today, I noticed something peculiar on the front page. 

**Exhibit A: [The Post That Should Not Be](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1iu6jj/gossipso_reese_ridley_wanted_a_mod_spot_in/).**

This post is terrible. Like, really terrible. It's boring and there is no drama. Not only that, but it's also boring. *So* boring. 

Now, a boring post isn't a big deal. It happens. It would be easy to assume that the mods were somehow in bed with the person who made the thread; after all, how could such a low-quality, useless post make it to the front page? Nepotism, perhaps? Maybe a little bit of self-loathing? It doesn't matter though; without proof, all of this is just conjecture. 

But wait...

**EXHIBIT B: [Censorstart (aka the beginning of Censorship)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1izb9b/looking_for_some_interesting_new_drama_too_bad/)**

This is a thread I submitted earlier (at around ~8PM PST [I don't really live in that timezone (or do I?) but I'm not going to give those who would be affected by this information the chance to dox me.]). Did you happen to see it? Probably not.

Because it was deleted immediately after being posted, by none other than your very own mod:

/u/MallardlyUpset (no witchunting)

Why? I followed all the rules. I used NP to stop vote brigading. I wasn't directly involved in the drama, and I didn't link to the full comments so I assumed I didn't need a self-post. And yet it was removed. Is that fair? Is it right? Is it just? No. It's just another continuation of the disturbing trend of harsh moderation on Reddit. Mods are supposed to encourage everyone to post as much as they can, not filter content. That's what the upvotes are for.  

Unless someone has a horse in this race that they don't know want us to know about. 

Oh, and remember how I told you in the title and then in the body of the post that the mods are silencing dissent on this subreddit? There's proof of that, too. 

**Exhibit C: The mods will remove this post before you even get a chance to upvote it.**

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""How did we miss our mods doing these things? How could such boring content be allowed when other, fresher drama is being posted by real dramanauts? What can we do about it?""

And the answer is yes. You *can* do something about it. I propose we created a new subreddit, by the users and for the users, where we let the *upvotes* and the *community* decide what we want to see. We can't sit and twiddle our thumbs while the mods sit around, blatantly censoring *our* drama. 

Just my two cents. Be careful out there guys. The censor ship will find you and sink you. ",THREAD LOCKED DUE TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH,False,self,t5_2rd2l,False,,,True,t3_1izlpa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1izlpa/breaking_rdrama_mods_take_it_too_far_drama_and/,

GunsAreCool regular /u/xinebriated comes up with the idea to notify 'the media':
&gt;
&gt;[My main goal was to put some pressure on the admins about whether or not they are ok with guns sold on reddit. I know that it is legal to do an assault rifle sale without a background check, but if reddit won't allow creepshots how can they allow weapon sales?](http://www.unedditreddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/18zdaa/i_gave_gawker_the_guns_on_reddit_story/c8jd47b) 

It doesn't take long before the media starts writing about this story.
Here's a [screen cap of the Gawker story](http://i.imgur.com/2dXKnij.png), written by Adrian Chen himself. He calls the Reddit Assault Rifle 'the most terrifying thing on the internet'. 

After that [the Huffington Post decided to pick up the story](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/21/reddit-x---x--x-x-gun-reddit-logo_n_2736684.html%5D), and yup there's a video inside too. They end the article asking themselves if the reddit admins want their logo associated with 'the Newtown massace'.

The Blaze decides to join in too with [an article](http://i.imgur.com/HlK02NR.jpg), they even quoted Gabour himself:
&gt;
&gt;“It is time for reddit to ask itself whether it is morally justifiable for it to continue to allow the sale of guns,” the Redditor Gabour wrote.
&gt;
&gt;“Although I’m trying not to resort to hyperbole here, I think it fair to say that reddit has some blood on its hands for endorsing these transactions [emphasis added],” the post continued.

One of the Guns mod makes a [post welcoming Gawker](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/18yw32/welcome_gawker_we_literally_are_the_largest/)  to reddit and not long after that GrC comes up with a [mod post](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/18ztyj/mod_statement_concerning_gawker_media_fuck_gawker/) where Gabour complains about his sub getting brigaded again and he gives his personal opinion about Adrian Chen.

----

Edit: I just found out GrC was founded by VA himself. A source who will remain anonymous pmed me the following 'statement':
---
&gt;VA created the sub after a gun nut called him a pedophile. He was a complex guy. He loved jerking off to ******'s with dicks, yet he yearned for sensible gun control, lulz.

&gt;I just think he deserves some savvy treatment otherwise SRS is going to shit all over him. He was a good guy. GrC is one of his legacies. Just try to understand that he took it seriously, and he was posting serious content (when he would get off his lazy ass to do it)

Edit2: additional media are reporting the story.

""He got the perma ban for his activity on his alt account.

This is the SRD thread:

------

This is the BODY text in case it gets removed immediately:

I'm just someone who was friendly with him and offered him to write a final post in case he got banned because he was fearing that. He himself sent me most of the info I will post here. 

Using a throwaway TOR account because I don't want to get involved.

The direct reason why he got banned: http://i.imgur.com/YgwqmAN.png - he made 4 comments in a SRD linked /r/news thread which the mods immediately removed. This was the comment he spammed: http://i.imgur.com/F2MBhab.png


Other reasons why he could have been banned:

- Making a lot of alts, and I mean A LOT of alts, up to 100 in total. Around 20-30 of them were shadow banned.

- Having contact with /u/Youregonnaloveme who is also IP banned from reddit: http://imgur.com/k8ehZDP (Read from bottom to top)

- Sending PMs to several mod mails like /r/srdbroke, /r/braveryjerk and /r/drama. At some point he shared a shock video which lead to mless.com getting banned on reddit (because the site contains CP popups): http://i.imgur.com/dMK3a0p.png his respone to /u/bitcrunch was: http://i.imgur.com/F7zrm2E.png

- Responding to a Daily Dot journalist Fernando Alfonso his PM: http://i.imgur.com/7IC7OKj.png  (he PMed a bunch of NSFW mods asking them if there was something going on around reddit) and trading information with him: http://i.imgur.com/gQgZxY4.png (read from bottom to top)

- Sending harassive PMs to mod mail like in r/news which got him banned in the first place: http://i.imgur.com/fZThR8a.png

- Wasting the admins time because people were reporting him and complaining about him all the time. Someone reported him for asking for CP for example: http://i.imgur.com/WghMutB.png

- Several cases of Doxxing: sharing a meme of a SRSer during doxxtober and also posting Laurelais penis with googly eyes photoshopped on it

- He got the crazy idea to start PMing shadowbanned users via MOD QUEUE and explain to them why they could have been shadow banned. He made /r/redditwatchdog and asked /u/Deimorz for feedback before he would make it public but Deimorz never responded and the other admins simply banned the sub once he got banned. There was a list there with all the possible bans and all the reasons why. Users would check the list first before they sent a PM to the admins asking about why they got banned.

- He also thought this could have been a reason for the ban, when he got modded to /r/imgoingtohellforthis some Feminist asked the mods to remove a post and she got doxxed by the mods because she was using her real name and he didn't report it but he shared the screen with other people instead: http://i.imgur.com/kz7pjR2.png""",,False,self,t5_2rd2l,1376625241.0,,,True,t3_1kgtm6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1kgtm6/lh_shadowban_recap/,

That's all fine and dandy. But the hilarious part (and drama) is if you look at /u/Dolonotikz (OP's) posting history, you can see that a bunch of Redditors are brigading his **month+** old posts.

OP also made a post to /r/homebrewing: [Looking to turn this into a kegerator or anything close to it, cant find any specs on it. all i know its a daewoo. HELP!](http://np.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1c61uj/looking_to_turn_this_into_a_kegerator_or_anything/)

Now, while that was amusing, it also brought us to the conclusion that AL is a man who thinks critically about social theory, and thus finds things that are offensive to the LGBT/Women/POC/Otherkin community to be the lowest form of human interaction/behavior. 

So naturally, when confronted with differing opinions, a man of such esteem is obligated via his intellect to behave properly, and educate those around him so as to open their ignorant minds to the reality that is the correctness of his opinion.

There was a large thread on askreddit where a bunch of these people clustered in their comments, and the swift hand of the admins shadowbanned them for it. I think [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19a48p/what_is_your_most_embarrassing_moment/c8m7flr?context=6) is the comment chain in specific that benned the lot of them.

AS86 is floating around that entire thread. There's prolly something amiss, though I think he's just handing out tissues for karmawhore's issues. 

---------------------------------------------------------

**Definition of things so far for newcomers**

As an explanation for newcomers, here's the breakdown: 

Shadowbanning is when you get banned for actually fucking up one of Reddit's few absolute rules: No spamming, doxxing, vote gaming, posting CP, or really pissing off the admins. Or something. I don't know what the fifth rule is but I'm fairly sure that's how PIMA got destroyed a few months ago. 

Vote-gaming is when people use artificial means to get karma, and therefore to get noticed. This usually ties into spamming, as people are forcing their stuff to be seen not based on quality, but based on other means. There's a few websites that show how to catch reddit's interest so you can boost your website/ product, so I'm pretty sure that's a reason this rule is in place. 

Vote-gaming can be achieved by using bots, or by asking for upvotes in things like modmail, private subreddits, the like. As what likely happened here, all those power-users got caught funking around on the same askreddit thread, which according to Anal Queen was coordinated by someone else. 

What's a power user/ karmawhore, you ask? I consider the two to be similar, but different things. A power user is a prominent user who is on and around reddit often, and has a large amount of karma from submitting and posting a lot. People like /u/syncretic are power users, modding a lot of stuff, posting a lot of stuff. 

Karmawhores are people that post a lot of shit for the sake of karma, often in the form of inane comments and quick jokes on early threads in default subreddits and hoping that it gets upvoted. As such, they often have easy to remember names that usually call attention to themselves. Everyone likes being in on a joke, so people will always upvote/ comment with them a lot. 

As a result, most askreddit threads are filled with bland stuff by karmawhores and the subsequent comments for about a certain period until an account gets banned (ala Potato_in_my_anus), bored (IamaWhaleSexologist), ran out (Trapped in reddit), or just ignored (apostolate. I hope. )

Horray! As we have accumulated more drama junkies, the mods here have decided to grow with ya'll and make some changes to our moderation style (it won't hurt, I promise).

There are some very minor rule changes to our sub, mostly concerning trolls.

Trolls will be banned. We don't need trolls in here fucking our discourse up with their *boring* **everything**. If you are here to simply troll, either post a funny [Rumor] post, or get out :).

Users of **excessive** slurs - not cute. If the only shit they can talk consists of mindless slurrage, then they really don't belong here - or anywhere really (how they reconcile that fact, we don't care). 

The mods will be handing out [warnings](http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/wsg/image/1339/22/1339225284605.gif) before any ban, and acting all super rude about a warning will probably land you a ban. So just edit your offending post and you won't be banned. It's literally that easy.

**This does not mean** /r/Drama is a ""safe space,"" or a social justicey preschool where all *bad words* are hanged upon. It means that if you want to get your point across, **use real words**. Actual sentence structure and other fancy literary shit is far more entertaining to read than low-brow 4chan tweenaged garbage. 

So, basically, [be a bitch](http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/18/mean-girls.jpg), and not a [dick](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/239/112/29e.jpg). It's not super hard to figure out, and if you have any questions about our new rules, please feel free to ask. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention!

If all you can talk about is SRSsucks, Anti-SRS, or SRS, we will so make fun of you for not having a life, or for having anything interesting to say, so keep that Reddit-centric political bullshit out of our sub. Thanks.

This is an effort to continue documenting Laurelai's sociopathy and general unbalanced mental state. In a recent popular thread in /r/anonymous...

- It begins in a spectacular melodramatic fashion where Laurelai claims that [an srser saved my life ( literally)](http://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/154hea/twitter_just_suspended_the_most_popular_anonymous/c7je1ij)

- A hypocritical stament is made where she has the audacity to tell someone to [""lol get a life""](http://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/154hea/twitter_just_suspended_the_most_popular_anonymous/c7jjaku) after just admitting to have been given a new lease on one. I gift her Reddit Gold for this comment after being stupefied at her lack of irony and self-awareness.

- Decide to publicy [call her out](http://i.imgur.com/EYNVq.png) on this. 

- The post is deleted shortly thereafter.

Laurelai didn't appreciate me calling her out in front of Anonymous, and predictably falls back on SRS tactics of deleting dissent and discourse.

So I take it to /r/anonymous modmail to get to the bottom of this. 

- She completely takes the defensive position and starts spouting lies by [claiming I'm an SRDer](http://i.imgur.com/Aaj24.png) and that [I'm an invader](http://i.imgur.com/izjkU.png) when I've been a lurker in anon and have been following them for quite a while now.

- Bottom-mod FVAnon [chimes in](http://i.imgur.com/10mSO.png), and Laurelai states, tounge-in-cheek (?), that Anonymous is into Misandry"" with a [childish image](http://i.imgur.com/i6pPz.gif) of ScarJo from The Avengers

- [Further reinforcing](http://i.imgur.com/Q3XOC.png) that /r/anonymous is part of SRS/The Fempire with the image macro [""Ceterum Censeo Reddit Delendam Esse""](http://i3.minus.com/jswZu4dVVmalL.jpg)

- [Further lobbing an accusation of hypocrisy](http://i.imgur.com/Co8yk.png) is met with a [childish anim](http://i.minus.com/ibxo9BNVYxQgks.gif) where she implicitly states she does not care. She seems honestly comfortable and OK with being perceived as a hypocrite.

- Continuing her pattern of evasion, [taunts](http://i.imgur.com/H2S3T.png) further with [another image](http://i.minus.com/i5xLvHM9bda8U.gif) claiming she's not even reading my pleas for debate and discourse. An issue on my end makes me believe I have been banned from posting to /r/anon, and later realize my statement was in error. State so.

- Further taunting by asking [If I am mad](http://i.minus.com/iP3qeuHMYmHEI.gif) ?

- [I decide to wrap things up](http://i.imgur.com/Tmb2v.png) as there is just no getting through to someone like her.
   
So, today folks, we have learned that /r/anonymous is not too far removed from SRS after all.

Absolutely shameful. 

I expected better from Anonymous, and much like Sergey Titov has ensured I will never buy anything associated with him, I will never again support Anonymous given this is how their agents conduct themselves and are OK with being associated with SRS.

Anon was supposed to destroy the Sith. Not join them.

/u/owmymostofme was on Omegle and met a girl named Nina from Yorkshire who allegedly goes to uni in London.

The [drama in question](http://www.buckeyeplanet.com/forum/buckeye-football/631234-giovanni-strassini-fraud-impersonating-1976-all-american.html) comes from Buckeye Planet, a message board for fans of The Ohio State University Buckeyes (and before anyone rags on the design, a sysadmin in the massive thread linked notes that they're upgrading).  

The OP, JustinAGS, kicks off the shitstorm with a pretty simple statement, hoping to engage the board's knowledge-base:

&gt;I came across something peculiar recently. There's this Buckeyes fan club in Charlotte, that celebrates one former Buckeye All-American Tight End by the name of Giovanni Strassini. He ""won the Rose Bowl in 1974 with Archie, Cornelius Green, Pete Johnson and the rest,"" says the page. He also ""caught an 8 yard touchdown pass in the 1976 Rose Bowl"", and ""was drafted by the Cleveland Browns as the 162nd player picked in the 1977 NFL Draft,"" according to his Facebook page. Not only that, ""Mr. Strassini is also a member of the OSU Football All-Century Team!"" say the Charlotte Buckeyes.

I'll not spoil the drama, but highlights include refutation of pretty much every claim Strassini has made, wiki-editing wars and someone who quite possibly is Giovanni Strassini himself making an appearance - and perhaps [the greatest wall of crazy copypasta ever](http://www.buckeyeplanet.com/forum/buckeye-football/631234-giovanni-strassini-fraud-impersonating-1976-all-american-17.html#post2338207).",,False,self,t5_2rd2l,False,,,True,t3_1eoeib,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1eoeib/ohio_state_fan_from_charlotte_nc_creates_fake/,

Watch him in his most recent meltdown,59,33,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1j2x7h/rpolitics_has_a_brand_new_mod_from_rconservative/,"We have always known they have never set the bar particularly high for themselves there, and that they select mods on a ""who you know basis"" rather than ""what you know."" 

In addition, another criticism is that once modded there they close ranks and defend each other rather than sticking their necks out to actually mod. If they did that, they might become unpopular and lose their coveted spot as mods. The bad news is that results in a corruption of the mod process. The good news is that it doesn't matter, it's still only reddit. 

An example is when former mod davidreiss666 defended two downvote brigades of the same thread by /r/politics mod /u/luster). luster was participating in that day's gun nut picket of the new queue there with 9 other of his /r/progun buddies. I called them out on it, so luster and his buddies [direct linked my comment in /r/progun and sent my comment into triple digit negative.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/19iy15/gabour_points_out_that_rpolitics_is_gamed_mod_of/c8ojao3)

Was /u/luster ever removed for downvote brigading his own sub twice in the same thread with his /r/progun buddies? Nah. Instead, I got banned for merely pointing it out. 

So eyebrows were raised when a new, extremely hardcore /r/conservative mod, /u/chabanais, known for defending the use of the word ""nigger"" with his racist buddies in /r/conservative was promoted to mod there a few days ago. He recently had a meltdown in which he called the mods of of /r/enoughlibertarianspam retarded. 

Eighteen times. 

So if you get in trouble with a super intelligent member of the /r/conservative crew in /r/politics, don't go expecting help from the mod crew as a whole, they could close ranks around their newest LCD mod rather than help you out. And you might even get banned for your trouble.  

**tl;dr Here's the best /r/conservative has to offer, and it is basically calling people ""tards"" eighteen times in a single thead**

Hopefully some of you are familiar with my anti-Gawker blog, and some things I've posted there, such as... 
 
* Uncovering the identity of Gawker writer Mobutu Sese Seko.

* Investigating whether Gawker swept a child porn controversy under the rug by firing one of their writers.
* Exposing Timothy Burke as a liar when he tried to use a sockpuppet account here on Reddit.
* Cataloging 218 Reddit accounts which I suspect were created by Gawker to spam their own links.

And I have a hunch--just a hunch--that Timothy Burke might be omitting some info regarding the whole Manti Te'o fake girlfriend hoax.  I don't trust that guy one bit.  I base that on past experience.


The Deadspin article: [HERE](http://deadspin.com/5976517/manti-teos-dead-girlfriend-the-most-heartbreaking-and-inspirational-story-of-the-college-football-season-is-a-hoax).

My blog post which will continue to be updated: EDIT:  I SAID BEFOREHAND THAT THIS MIGHT NOT PROVE PRODUCTIVE...I DID FIND SOME INTERESTING BACKGROUND INFO THAT DEADSPIN HAD NOT INCLUDED, BUT NO SMOKING GUN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.  MY POST HAS BEEN REVERTED BACK INTO DRAFT FORM FOR NOW.


HOW YOU CAN HELP:  Provide commentary here in the comments, maybe answer some questions, and eat some popcorn.  This might be very productive, or not productive at all.

EDIT 1:  There's some reporter for the Detroit Free Press named Joe Rexrode who seems like the first person to mention the name ""Lennay Kekua"" in print following the two announced deaths.  The original article on the Free Press's website is missing, but I've found other versions which contain the same text.  Where did Joe hear the name, and am I right in that he was the first person to print it?

EDIT 2:  FIVE STRAIGHT HOURS researching some football player I don't even know, and who comes off as kind of a doofus.   

EDIT 3:  I found a bunch of tweets that Te'o sent out immediately after Lennay died.  He even signed into her account at one point to send a farewell message to her followers--he signed it Manti, so...did her ""family"" share the password with him?  Who were these dumb people who interacted with the account of a nonexistent girl?  I have one name.  If anyone wants it, let me know.  You can go bother a poor girl who sent a RIP message to Lennay.  
(Not really.  Unless you're from TMZ.  They just printed a very helpful story.)

EDIT 4:  By the way, I'm very tired, so that last edit calling saddened kids ""dumb"" probably came off ruder than intended.

EDIT 5:  I'm not sure exactly what I was searching for, but in a few minutes I'll paste those tweets which Manti wrote immediately after hearing about Lennay's death.  As the OP, it's my job to deliver *something* here.  They were found on IrishSportsDaily, a message board for Notre Dame fanatics:

@MTeo_5 @LennayKay you will always be with me wherever I go! Tell dad, BJ, papa Ima, papa Santiago, and grandma that I said hello! I love you! #574L 2 hours ago.

@LennayKay: Hey everyone it's manti. The family wanted me to tell you all how much they love and appreciate all of you for all your love and prayers!

@LennayKay: We all miss Lennay but we know that we will see her again! She loves all of you and would want all of you to know that! Thank you all again!

It seems a lot of people sent RIP messages when Lennay ""passed away.""  Exactly how many, I don't know.  But for some reason I thought only Te'o was in day-to-day contact with her.

Please take a moment to read before downvoting.,183,159,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1ikdb5/update_uvolumezero_repost_fiasco_please_take_a/,"So whether this is downvoted into oblivion or not, I'd like to get my general message out there if possible. (Just as a note, this is a self-post so I don't get karma for it).


To all of those people who are going through my history and insta-downvoting, I implore you to atleast allow this one to survive your onslaught as it displays and examples some of your handi-work, perhaps you feel some form of pride for this being exposed to Reddit?


Anyway, let's start off with a general ""what the hell are you talking about"", for the people that don't know what happened.


tl;dr: I found something on imgur via a friend outside of Reddit. I posted it to /r/gaming after changing the URL to a gallery because the initial URL wasn't working with RES properly and it instantly became a highly upvoted thread. Shortly after this, the original creator /u/utterpedant posted in the topic saying that this was his content and had only posted it in /r/wtf 2 hours ago. People got mad. People started the downvote brigade. Then the serious stuff happened.


For more information, further reading can be found [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1ifz0u/the_people_of_reddit_vs_uvolumezero_for_blatant/), [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1ifzxj/poor_uutterpedant_misses_out_on_a_ream_of_karma/) and [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ifn7l/cant_believe_what_i_found_at_the_yard_sale/).


Now, after the explanations, I'd like to start with what this meant for both /u/utterpedant and myself.


/u/utterpedant received great sympathy for my travesty of a repost and earned himself over a year's worth of Reddit Gold and plenty of comment karma. I on the other hand, am tagged and dogged with downvotes no matter where I post now.


But who cares about internet points? The problem actually revolved around the more personal aspect of things. During the onslaught of my comment history, people started digging through my personal information and started to retrieve things such as my OKCupid and POF profile, posting personal pictures to various threads, and even some went as far as doxxing me to retrieve my Facebook information. I am not sure if this is the end of the doxxing, but I sincerely hope nothing further generates from this. I became one of the most witch-hunted person on Reddit, to the point where people were threatening me in PMs, both with insults and with releasing personal information to the masses.


Then there was a personal aspect of messages sent through Reddit. There were too many to list, so here is just a few typical examples:


[Insults](http://imgur.com/a/S9jLt)


etc, you get the picture, I won't spam these (there's over 500 atleast). These were fairly tame and I was able to ignore the vast majority of them. However some were really offensive, I'm surprised people got this worked up about it:


[More Serious Insults](http://imgur.com/a/nPe6P) (Third is a link to my Facebook)


But that's not to say everyone was completely horrible, it restored my faith in Reddit a little. Some of these were genuine from the start and others were initially bandwagoning but turned around after I spoke to them a bit:


[Some Faith Restored](http://imgur.com/a/m0aMW)


All in all, I'm not asking for forgiveness, regardless of the excuses or circumstances. I posted something that wasn't mine, and whilst my intentions weren't malicious, I can see why the original creator would be upset. I can only offer my condolences. However, I think that going this far as to completely destroy someone's browsing activity (I will probably have to create another account), then taking it to extremes and digging up my personal information. That's too far.

Following that entire drama regarding the allegations levied against the moderators of /r/TheBestOfAmazon and how they supposedly worked with marketers to promote products on their subreddit, it seems as if a few other ""deal"" subreddits have been banned today, including /r/Bargains and /r/KindleFree (a subreddit dedicated to providing free kindle books). In addition to that, /u/c0r3y, moderator of a bunch of deal subreddits has been shadowbanned, as detailed in this comment here:

Now if this was some kind of troll by reddit's CEO, it would be pretty hilarious, however instead of running with this or even spinning it into something funny, he quietly deleted his FB post and made no public comments about it, but not before reddit screen capped it and jumped all over it with some typical circlejerking for a while.  The DailyDot even wrote an article about it:

http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-ceo-yishan-wong-links-9gag/

Now fast forward to today, and the link that hit the top of /r/all a few days back has been removed from reddit.  In fact, the only thread I can find questioning this censorship never got any traction, which seems contradictory to the general cynicism on reddit:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15w7n4/did_the_link_about_reddit_ceos_9gag_faux_pas_get/ 

Here's the original link the made the top post on the front page:  http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/15vtmm/reddits_ceo_yishan_wong_has_betrayed_us/

Who am I? I'm a blogger and a redditor who proposed a government program to help involuntary celibate people.

I would first like to apologize for opening this thread 6 hours later than it was arranged. I hope its' not a problem. I got busy.

Anyway, at the request of one of your moderators I am opening an AMA again. My first AMA is here http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/19nwpa/governmentsgetgirlfriends_ama/

Some stuff I'd like to warn you about... Stuff you should and shouldn't do, basically

**1. Don't be an idiot**

If you say nonsense like that incel doesn't exist there's no point for me to reply. I'll just block you.


**2. Don't be a TAC member** 

TAC are The Atheist Cult, the most vile cult in the history.

http://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/quo-vadis-atheism/

http://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/cult-of-therapy-a-dangerous-death-cult-created-by-tac/

It's easy to recognize a TAC member - stupidity, insistence on idiotic talking points, therapy, misandry, feminism, lack of any logic, nauseating political correctness etc.

I will not reply to juliewashere because she's a known TAC member. I would rather debate chimps than TAC members.

**3. This is an AMA. Ask questions.**

I want questions, interesting ones. Not your critiques and monologues.

**4. IT'S NOT MY JOB TO EDUCATE YOU** 

I will not reply to idiots who say incel is about sex,that my program wants prostitution, that I think incel is a medical condition or that I am shy. Not when I made articles explaining stuff. If you are misinformed read the blog. All you can get from me here is a short insult. I don't have the time to write everything down to some random idiot.


I will post these links **here and nowhere else**

What are incel and love-shyness?
http://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/what-are-incel-and-love-shyness/

Programs for treating incel/love-shyness  http://governmentsgetgirlfriends.wordpress.com/867-2/


**5. DON'T BE NONCEL NORMATIVE**

This is slightly trickier because I have yet to make an article on this but not hard at all.

**See things I have to go through/have done in the past not through your eyes of a noncel but through eyes of somebody who has been suffering from incel about 10 years, most of the time being completely incel (no relationship, no unpaid sex).**

Now, I know not all of you can do that but I can't reply to obviously noncel normative questions.

**6. DON'T POST THREATS**

People who threaten me with dox/police/eternal damnation will be blocked, ignored and reported. This is why I will not reply to certain weirdos posting here who have already done that.

1366135377.0,27,self.Drama,1ch3zg,I noticed my last couple of SRD submissions got deleted without notice so I made a little list of posts that got removed WITH notice from a mod.,47,20,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1ch3zg/i_noticed_my_last_couple_of_srd_submissions_got/,"I was just wondering if other people were having the same problem. [I will try to post this in SRD too under the [meta] tag but I'm 100% sure it will get removed by the mods.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1ch3v5/meta_i_noticed_my_last_couple_of_srd_submissions/)

Anyway here's a small overview of removed SRD posts with users who were lucky enough to get a 'removed' or even a reason why by the mods:

-----
Mod stopscopiesme:

- [A simple ""removed"" the poster /u/barsoap asks him why and he gets ignored](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1capnb/my_humble_self_makes_an_observation_regarding_the/c9eo3jh?context=3).

- [""Removed not your personal army"" when someone links to that Morgan Freeman AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c811g/mods_censor_ama_thread_where_users_call_for_an/c9dxutx?context=3)

- [""Removed, not drama, only 1 comment"" poster replies with: ""Can't show Conservatards in a positive light, eh?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bxw4x/guy_from_rniggers_tells_others_to_unsubscribe/c9b3yq7?context=3)


-------


Mod MilleniumFalcon:

- [Removes post because it links to full comments even there's drama everywhere. Why not just give him flair ""links to full thread"" and approve it like you normally do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1ceu88/rworldnews_mods_delete_all_post_about_boston/c9ftvb8?context=3)

- [""Removed: Remain as neutral as possible; biased titles/self posts are grounds for deletion. Save the editorializing for the comments!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c5c2g/usluggdiddy_has_a_meltdown_because_he_cant_handle/c9d8gbq?context=3)

 Really MF? Have you seen the average cptn_sisko title? Here's a recent one for example: ""User in /r/Fitness is trying to get under someone's skin, even going as far back as digging up stuff in their post history from a year ago. **It's not working and it gets really awkward.**"" 

Do you want to see what you thought was too biased MF? You removed this: ""/u/sluggdiddy has a meltdown because **he can't handle his opinion being wrong**""

-----

Mod Semebay:

- [Removed for bias. This is the title of the post: ""r/gunsarecool moderator redefines a gun term to a personal definition, threatens to ban anyone who attempts to correct him."" Well you should let cptn_sisko post it next time!](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c9rq1/rgunsarecool_moderator_redefines_a_gun_term_to_a/c9egmbg?context=3)

- [""Do not post links to entire subreddits."" But there's drama everywhere! Why not use link flair for this post Semebay: links to full comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c2zm5/free_popcorn_on_rbitcoinnew_as_bitcoin_price/c9cisqr?context=3)

- [Removes post about /r/mangryshitlords (which isn't SRS) hey /r/blackladies and /r/lgbt drama is okay why this isn't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bm282/rmangryshitlords_invades_an_rintp_post_to_make/c982dd0?context=3)

----

Mod snarkypants: 

- [Removes david-me's post about transdrama he replies with: ""You really love doing this with my posts ""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c8qrf/drama_in_rscience_about_phantom_limbs_and/c9e545q?context=3)

- [He removes more transdrama, a users explains why: ""It's offensive to trans* individuals, so it has to be removed. Are you new to SRD? You can't just post ""drama"", see it upvoted, and expect it to stay.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c5k8n/conversation_turns_to_insults_in_rchangemyview/c9deqj0?context=3)

- [""Removed. Links to full comments."" Can somebody explain me when it's okay to just use flair and approve the post when there's drama everywhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1biwot/huge_slapfight_happening_now_in_rrelationships_as/c97m8i0?context=3)

---

Mod DustFC:

- This is about the SRS megathread. I just read this comment and thought it was hilarious: [""I don't like SRS drama, but it's not the only type of drama I don't particularly like. What's more important to me is that I don't enjoy the type of drama it *creates* in SRD.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c8o63/meta_more_srs_megathread_feedback/c9ebccr?context=3) Are you telling me that as a SRD mod you don't like drama in your own sub? Why are you even a mod? Check the last part of his comment, he basically invites you to subscribe to SRS (not kidding).

- [""Would you mind renaming the link titles in your post to be more neutral? I'd recommend simply providing a relevant quote with the links instead of trying to add context - that way nobody can say you were attempting to paint the mod in a bad light.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bvjiu/rfreethought_moderator_uaerik_bans_multiple_users/c9ahfsj?context=3)  &lt;-- hey this is actually not that bad DustFC! It's sure is better than ""biased, removed."" You must be a new SRD mod or something.

- You really are the new guy, you still have some humanity and kindness left in you! [Here you tell a user 'sorry' for removing his duplicate post, AND you link to that post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bregt/op_uses_a_common_gif_to_demonstrate_approval/c99cm1o?context=3). Wow. That sure beats [stealing someone else his post like stopscopiesme did recently and circlejerking in that post just during a national tragedy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1cf2zf/stopscopiesme_mod_of_srd_steals_a_submitted_post/).

----

Bonus:

- [Mods remove cringeful drama post about some fake brony/anti-brony war, oh wait shitthatneverhappened.txt since the OP is a ""friend"" of  the mods.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1c2xq7/recap_bronyhate_episode_v_the_cringe_stikes_back/c9cn26c?context=3)


----


If you are interested, these are my removed posts. I know one of them is a link to SRSsucks but the drama is genuine, SRD also allows links to /r/blackladies and I avoided using ""SRS"" in the title, I cross posted that post to /r/drama and it did fairly well here. Remember that I didn't even get a 'removed' so I'm 100% sure there are tons of other posts which got removed without notice:

- [Bigboobproblems drama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bqqxp/a_male_makes_a_post_thanking_the_girls_of/)

- [Drama in /r/Drama about LL leaving reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1beq0c/throwaway_account_leaks_info_from_a_private_sub/)

- [Facebook leak drama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1b63wp/redditor_is_not_happy_with_a_leak_from_hisher/)

**Edit: not only has snarkypants removed my post in SRD, she is also removing my comments:**

This has wound up with incredible video game completion times such as getting all [120 stars in Super Mario 64 in 1 hour and 20 minutes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL6VE_5PddM), and beating [Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time in just under 19 minutes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d738pTAmOQ)

Now, where does the drama get into this? Well, TASVideos is also the unsurprising home of the TASVideos forums, where people can submit TAS publications and discuss the hip, new, latest techniques on how to beat their favorite games.

[This thread in the Nintendo 64 subforum](http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2974&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=6760) is solely dedicated to the TASing of Ocarina of Time, and lately, people have been a bit confused as to the definition of what it means to have completely beaten Ocarina of Time 100%.

User EEssentia proposes...
&gt;
&gt;- Collect all heart containers and heart pieces.
&gt;- Collect all upgrades that are not shown in the menu.
&gt;- Collect all 100 Golden Skulltullas.
&gt;- Having each slot in the menu [including inside dungeons] filled with the best possible item that can fit inside that slot [that means collecting the best upgrades, too] when the game ends. If there is no best item, then any item will do.
&gt;- Item duplication glitch may not be used.
&gt;- No RBA to acquire not-yet collected items, but changing item amount is fine.
&gt;- Finish the game! 

What really threw the users of the thread into a kerfuffle was the amount of heart pieces the user should get. (For the record, the maximum amount of hearts you can acquire, without glitches, is 20. An extra quarter heart piece is available, but does not lead to an extra heart.) User *Slowking* suggests...

&gt; That seems to exceed 100% somewhat and gets again into ""defining every little item seperately""-territory, again.

&gt; You need to get 20 hearts. If you use the gerudo heart piece is your thing, but then you should skip another one.

But then conflict about the number of heart pieces comes up, as it is possible through the use of a glitch called [Reverse Bottle Adventure](http://zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/ba/reverse-bottle-adventure) to duplicate one heart in the game, and *completely* max out your hearts to 30. Obviously, the original game developers did not intend for you to do this.

&gt; Should a 100% run collect the Gerudo heart piece that is only accessible as a child? 

...

&gt; &gt;But the question I had, which we should discuss, is if the 100% run should get the additional heart piece in Lord Jabu Jabus belly that is only accessible with game shark codes. I think so, because it's awesome

&gt;Game Shark should never, ever be uttered when you're talking speed runs.

...

&gt; Maybe because it was relevant to the discussion of 'How do we define 100% for OoT?' - as in 'If you can get more than 20 hearts using glitches, and we allow duping/rba/etc in 100%, does that mean it's not 100% to stop at 20?'

Soon, this item-duplicating glitch leads people to contemplating other duplication strategies...

&gt; If we would start duping hearts I guess we would have to start duping Skulltulas since you can get 255 of them. And oh lord would that be boring to watch. Why dont we just stay inside the boundaries the game originaly gave us?

And that's all the drama thus far.

Going back over it, that came out to be a lot less dramatic than I first thought. But hey, I typed all of this out already, so hey.

In a move proving that there is still indeed a market for such an artist, one of the many gay male sex clubs decided to book her for a night (okay I guess the entire building isn't a sex dungeon, they have a ""bar"" area or something). Oops!

Everyone pretty much lost their fucking minds over this, and well, we get to feast upon the remains of their *still-raging* internet war!

For a while, I could expect to receive at least one nugget of homophobia and hatred in my inbox, maybe two if I was lucky. i have no clue what I did to charm him, but he's graced me with [this loveliness](http://i.imgur.com/z0qLW.png). Then it stopped.
 
And it started up again!
 
###The good stuff
 
Apparently, CGE does not like SRD at all, as evidenced by [this invasion](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/12lan3/til_that_until_it_was_forcibly_suppressed_during/c6w8lco) in an old linked TIL thread.
Of course, CGE was banned for invasion and rude comments.
 
##SRDGoneWild
 
A few days ago, CGE discovered /r/SRDgonewild in the deep recesses of the Popcorn empire, and was so offended that he set off [this poetic, passionate exchange](http://imgur.com/mGQqT) with the moderators.
 
The final straw was when CGE called one of SRDGW's Irish mods British, after which he was promptly banned by me. When CGE was notified of his ban, he picked [another fight](http://imgur.com/cqTQh) with SRDGW. TwasIWhoShotJR calls him out for having nothing better to do on Thanksgiving except for harass other people.
 
##SRDGWBroke
 
CGE announces that he will create a rival subreddit, /r/SRDGWbroke. But a SRDGW mod beats him to the punch and bans him. [CGE comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRDGWBroke/comments/13n3ft/exposing_myself_f/) in the new sub under one of their alts.
 
##The disappointing birth of FSRD
 
On an unrelated note, our courageous troll announces on [SRDbroke](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRDBroke/comments/13n1fv/introducing_rfreesubredditdrama_an_alternative_to/) a new rival to SRD called /r/FreeSubredditDrama. Its slogan is ""better than fascist SRD"" and allows for unbridled freedom of speech and expression.
 
Its first post is [this incredible sweeping generalisation](http://www.reddit.com/r/freesubredditdrama/comments/13n2ba/gay_redditors_are_such_drama_queens/c75i5jw). In that thread, the sub is universally criticized. But CGE is quick to lay the banhammer on at least two SRDGW mods (I can't post there).
 
It is then revealed that CGE invited /r/ainbow's Jess to help run the sub. Her brilliant response:
 
&gt;[I have no idea why, as a moderator of ainbow, I would be invited to moderate a shitty subreddit that wants to troll ainbow and call people ""fags""](http://www.reddit.com/r/freesubredditdrama/comments/13n2ba/gay_redditors_are_such_drama_queens/c75i5jw)
 
Jess is then banned.
 
I suspected CGE to have advertised his new project in other places, and after searching ""freesubredditdrama"" I found a [Dramalog](http://www.reddit.com/r/DramaLog/comments/13n5d2/srd_lawlt_meta_introducing_rfreesubredditdrama/) link to a [removed post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/13n4xq/meta_introducing_rfreesubredditdrama/) in /r/Subredditdrama.
 
[CGE shows up in the SRD AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/13q12c/we_are_the_moderators_of_rsubredditdrama_aua/c7654ry?context=2). Perhaps CGE has been messaging the mods there as well.
 
##YOU SUCK!! Now please do me a favor
 
Today, CGE messaged SRDGW once again, this time requesting that FSRD be sidebar'd. Here is the clusterfuck- [They put the number 9 in the subject line](http://imgur.com/cneky)
 
In his defence, he did say please, albeit spelling it wrong and still being annoying.
 
Choice comments:
 
* &gt;And you're an ablist hypocrite with bizarre sexual fetishes. That was just a test post. Fill it up with content you like, you retard.
 
* &gt;According to your logic, 'idiot' is ableist. Do you see now how retarded it is now when you pussies get upset by the word ""fag""??
 
* &gt;I don't ""go to school"" anymore. I'm doing my masters.

But you don't have to be a player to appreciate the artistry with which he brought much buttrage to nerds all across the WoWverse.


The title of the [TIL post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1165lu/til_a_wow_troll_named_angwe_camped_a_bottleneck/) about him (where [he showed up to comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1165lu/til_a_wow_troll_named_angwe_camped_a_bottleneck/c6jyl48?context=1), leading to [his AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dkyd/i_am_angwe_the_ganker_god_of_world_of_warcraft_ama/)) sums it up nicely:

*... a WoW troll named Angwe camped a bottleneck that was the only route to some key mid-level areas. He blocked the path by killing everyone who passed essentially every hour of every day for months.*

But, the best part, and the focus of today's episode, is 

[&gt;&gt;&gt;HIS MOST GLORIOUS WEBSITE&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://liquidcode.org/%7Elostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/) 

where he posted screenshot after screenshot of said buttrage, like a river of endless nerd tears, so that we can all bathe in them forever and ever, Amen.

It's long as hell, but so worth it.

Cracked.com later ranked him #1 in their [7 Most Elaborate Dick Moves in Online Gaming History](http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-7-most-elaborate-dick-moves-in-online-gaming-history/).

As you know, there is more than one drama subreddit on this website. Our biggest competitor for delicious gossip is /r/SubredditDrama, and we have decided that it is time for this subreddit to rise up as a legitimate competitor for control of the drama on reddit. Right now, SRD holds hegemony with its 50,000+ users, great CSS, and a mod team consisting entirely of sexy hunks, models, and other such second-place finalists for a lead role in Baywatch. /r/drama is a newer subreddit and needs an advantage to level the playing field.
  
My name is /u/MANBOT_. You might know me from the modlist on /u/SRDBroke, the leading front against SRD oppression. I have been hired by the mod team to help bridge relations between the two subreddits in order to ally ourselves against the SRD menace. SRDBroke is an incredibly professional subreddit which has efficiently and successfully taken down numerous branches of SRD, though I'm not at liberty to explain myself here. We predict that by the end of the third quarter SRD will be so destroyed it will be the first subreddit with negative subscribers. /r/SRDBroke and /r/drama have a mutual interest here, and with our coalition we will more quickly disestablish the drama-archy.
  
Some changes are being made to the subreddit to display our allegiance.
  
**First,** we will be using SRDBroke's CSS to display our alliance. SRDBroke's CSS is vastly superior to any CSS ever used on reddit, far exceeding the dingy stylesheet here. All future subreddits formed by the two of us will use this amazing CSS as well.
  
**Second,** we will be making some rule changes. To make the subreddit more welcoming to our friends and siblings from afar, we will be making /r/drama a safe space, free of bigotry and fun. Any undenied privilege will be met with a swift ban. No sexism, ableism, ageism, gingerism, bronyism, commentkarmaism, tulpa-shaming, and cat-owner supremacy is no longer welcome here. Please take this shit to a more lightly-moderated space, like SRSWomen (relatively speaking).
  
**Third,** we will be replacing the mod team with drama-SRDBroke co-password accounts. By sharing our accounts, we will show unity without denying our mod privilege unto others. As a moderator of both, my account will remain unchanged.
  
**Fourth,** and last, we will be using the No Participation CSS to prevent SRD from ~brigading~ us. This is our only line of defense against people who don't know how to remove the np. from their URL's, and we need everything we've got.
  
These changes will take place effective immediately. Please refrain from disagreeing, as that would show support for SRD scum and will be met with an immediate ban. Commence praise in the comment section!

Here's a board where she makes very many posts about, er, god only knows what.  (http://www.american-buddha.com/bulletin_board/about710-0-asc-0.html) I can't select any little chunk of it, because part of the impact comes from the sheer quantity of stuff she posts.  Look at the time stamps.

Here's another forum where she appears to be the main poster. (http://www.naderlibrary.com/bulletin_board/index.php) Here's the thread about The Oatmeal. (http://www.naderlibrary.com/bulletin_board/viewtopic.php?t=896)

I can understand a bit of animosity toward the Oatmeal, but she *really* hates him.  

I don't particularly want to point and laugh at people with a mental illness, but *points* hahaohwow.

1352231227.0,17,self.Drama,12qvjx,[Meta] Welcome!,22,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/12qvjx/meta_welcome/,"So we have grown a bit and I thought it would be a good time to reiterate all of the rules and expectations (or lack there of) of posting and commenting in r/Drama. 

/r/Drama's main goal is to cater to off-site drama first and foremost. This means open season on anything dramatic from anywhere on the internet. The caveat with this is that Reddit drama is also welcome, as many online communities overlap with Reddit communities. Reddit drama will not be removed so long as it does not contain dox. That takes us to..

**Dox**. What is and is not dox is decided solely by the admins, [you can view what they consider dox here](http://www.reddit.com/rules). Linking to other sites/forums is not considered dox so long as you do not **link the usernames on the other forum to a specific Redditor**. Do not do that. All dox will be removed immediately, and we will make a gossip post about how funny it is that you got shadowbanned. 

**Moderation**. Moderation here will be very loose. As long as a link isn't going to get the admins angry, and is dramatic, we will keep it up. Same goes with the comment sections. If someone says something horrible, downvote them, refute them, whatever. The mods here are **not** the morality police. 

**Gossip**. Gossip is awesome. We adore gossip. If you have some juicy gossip, feel free to post it **with context**. A short (or long) explanation of your gossip is required for maximum lulz. If your gossip is not true, post it anyway, that shit is hilarious. 

**Lolcows**. If you discover someone who is pure internet entertainment, feel free to post them here so we may rubberneck their hilarity. No dox, but news stories are free game, and non-reddit affiliated forum users are okay as long as there are no *real life names*. Facebooks/Twitters should be screenshotted and have all names removed, unless they are a celebrity. 

**Brigades**. Try really super hard to not brigade because it's bad mkay. 

**Rumors**. See Gossip. Same story.

**Other stuff**. Tags, flairs, and other neato shiney shit is on it's way. 

**Summary** - Don't post things that [anger the admins](http://www.reddit.com/rules) and have a lovely time. &lt;3",,False,self,t5_2rd2l,1352255284.0,,reginaflair,True,t3_12qvjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/12qvjx/meta_welcome/,moderator

(Really, if you don't know Etho or PaulSoaresJr, what rock are you living under?)

They have a periodic event called Ultra Hardcore, in which a group of them get together on a weekend and change the game rules - no automatic health regen, no regeneration potions, and no respawns - if you die, you log out.  Last one standing is the winner.  Well, this season, UHC XII, has been plagued by bugs, to the point where most of the deaths have been to mobs or the environment rather than to PVP.  It's widely regarded as the worst UHC season ever.

[Blame the Controller can't take the criticism](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1j6log/uhc_s12_e07/cbbmfmr?context=3) anymore, and loses his shit at one of the subscribers.

[Begin witchhunt.](http://www.reddit.com/user/BlameTC)  BTC has never been the most popular of the mindcrackers, but some of them decide to punish him for his sins, or some shit.

[AvidyaZen, ever the chill cat](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1jaj04/guys_we_need_to_have_a_talk_about_the_state_of/), tries to defuse the situation by posting a link to Don't Worry, Be Happy, but it's not really successful.

Second mod [Aubron decides to have a town hall meeting](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1jbivu/rmindcrack_community_round_table_72913_rule_and/) about new rules and the direction of /r/Mindcrack.  [Guude, the founder and owner of the server, chimes in](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1jbivu/rmindcrack_community_round_table_72913_rule_and/) explaining that while he values the community and their input, it's his server and no amount of kneejerking is going to make him throw someone out.

Well, that's when [Aubron decided he was done and posted this rant](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1jdw0d/psa_i_am_not_a_moderator/), telling the woe-is-me story of how he never wanted Guude to be headmod, and how Guude doesn't take the subreddit as seriously as he does, and how a subreddit devoted to a group of youtubers shouldn't treat those content producers differently from the fans.  Cue ragequit and call the waaaaaaambulance.

Oh, and a guy named /u/sub_par created a place called /r/mindcrackers that will supposedly live up to Aubron's vision.  [I think his name pretty much says it all.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/bc120b7efead7c5f9d8fad771ca8beeb/tumblr_mk078gnqoa1r0ftodo1_500.gif)

1364260202.0,19,self.Drama,1b0gmn,[Meta] State of the Subreddit. Aka super important things are going to be said here! Lyke Oh Em Gee!,26,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1b0gmn/meta_state_of_the_subreddit_aka_super_important/,"Just a fabulous reminder that we are, indeed, the [best thing ever.](http://www.theprophetblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Yuri-laughing-GIF.gif)

But really! We have had an influx of new users, and while they are totes as amazing as the morning sun shining on the face of one of our many lolcows here in r/drama, we need to take a moment and gather ourselves, because super important things are needing to be said!

r/Drama is a drama sub that caters to all forms of drama, gossip, and rumors from pretty much the entire internet. This means everything from national news stories, to the comment sections of IMDB, we take it all, and we love it. If there is a comment section, there is drama, and we want you to post it here!

While also catering to off-site drama, we still love and adore Reddit drama, including meta happenings, and general shittery that occurs on Reddit. So feel free to post whatever! 

**Tags:** 
We have them! As a sub that includes offsite drama, it's important to let readers know what platform their drama is coming from. Currently we have:

[Facebook] / [Twitter] / [Tumblr] / [LOL] (for general drama, usually from a news source) / [LiveJournal] / [Meta] / [Recap] / [Meltdown] / [Gossip] / [Rumor]

Gossip Tags: The gossip tag is for general information, doings, shenanigans, and faux pas that, while not uber dramatic, are of interest to those who keep up with topics of that subject matter - not to mention the meta! A lot of meta happenings on Reddit are considered gossip, and we encourage users to post them!

Rumor tags: We don't really know. It was just funny at the time, if you have a rumor of some kind, it doesn't really have to be truthful, just provide context. In the past, rumor tags have been used as ""call-out"" posts to specific users, and that's fabulous, so go wild. 

**Reminder:** Tags used for self posts will change pretty colors! Oh em gee, right? So if you are going to be using a tag, please feel obligated to do it in self-post form, and provide any context you feel is necessary, just posting the link is great too. 

If your drama is from a website that does not have a tag, then just post it anyway! 

**Flairs:** Get one! If you don't like our flairs, and you suspect you may be spending a considerable amount of time in our comment sections, then feel free to send the mods a png of something you'd like to be your flair, we are more than happy to oblige (just nothing pornographic plez).

**IRC:** We have one! It's in our sidebar, but [here is the link for the lazy](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/drama?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9). Our IRC is very active, in fact it is frighteningly active - and thus amazing.  Don't be shy, pop in and say hi!

**Moderation:** This subreddit is lightly moderated, and depends upon its userbase to downvote naughty things it doesn't like. Of course all things that break site-wide guidelines will be removed immediately, but other than that, users are allowed to say anything they want. Just don't be too awful, your karma score will not be happy with you in the morning. 

I think that's it. It probably isn't, and I'll just edit in anything else later. 

Basically, have fun dramatologists!

Apparently [this gentleman] (http://www.staresattheworld.com/) is a well known men's rights advocate online and has become fairly popular with the community through a regular series of youtube videos.

Recently, however, he has had an affair with a woman from the community who has left her husband for him, leaving behind two children in another country.

I was linked to the following video, where he rationalizes what he did, basically going against his previous viewpoints, with hilarious results.

The comments are pretty funny - 


*Aurini is being attacked for seducing and fucking﻿ a married mother of two and then making a video 2 days after she left her family for him where subtly, passive-aggressively and pre-emptively tells anyone personally affected by his scummy actions that they are ""taking the low road"". It's disingenuous and hypocritical of him to constantly criticize people for being degenerate and then engaging in the exact kind of degeneracy he rails against.*


*You have revealed yourself﻿ to be the very worst kind of degenerate. You have poisoned not only yourself, but a family as well. You have contributed to the decay of civilization in the most direct and concrete way possible. The moral grandstanding that so many of your videos consist of has been rendered a sad joke, a satire of morality. You can no longer look down on the masses, the sugar addicted, mindless, sex craved, hedonistic, idiots. From where you’re standing now, you’ll be looking up.*

Context: GBFans is a ghostbusters fansite, focusing largely on making replica props of proton packs, PKE meters, uniforms, and anything else you can think of (seriously, give the build section a look). People make absolutely astonishing, often screen-accurate replicas of props from the films, cartoon, game, etc. A few folks even produce some really beautiful components or entire props to resell.

Recasting is basically bootlegging parts made by someone else, and selling them as your own work. It's a pretty big no-no, because you're taking money away from the original artist, and claiming their work as your own (recast parts are usually quite inferior to the original, too). 

The linked forum post is about a pretty notorious recaster named VideoBob. The tl;dr is that a couple of years ago, VideoBob started selling what he has more than once admitted are recast parts. VideoBob was subsequently shunned by most of the community, but continued (and still does) to attempt to sell his recast parts. In addition, he's known for making some pretty wild claims, like that he's getting a prop making show on the Discovery Channel, or an exclusive deal with Sony.

Enom has the answer...,25,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/195p4e/wondering_why_your_images_arent_showing_up_today/,"According to [this WHOIS lookup from the name registrar](http://www.enom.com/whois/Default.aspx?DomainName=imgur.com), it would appear that ImgUr.com has been ""blocked for abuse"".

At this point, ImgUr itself seems either blissfully unaware this is happening, or is keeping quiet about it. No mention on their twitter or facebook pages, but they're also at SxSW right now so it's possible they're simply mostly out of the office and partying and haven't noticed.

**UPDATE:** On the off chance they hadn't noticed, I gave a call to the contact on their WHOIS and, surprisingly, Mr. Schaaf picked up immediately. He sounded startled that imgur didn't have the correct nameservice enabled and is (at the time of this writing) on the road coming home from Texas and SxSW. Hopefully he'll be able to correct the problem.

**Update 2:** Imgur followed up, talked to their registrar, and worked out getting things back online, quoth their [facebook post:](http://www.facebook.com/imgur/posts/10151258499312471)

&gt; Access to Imgur may be spotty for some people depending on your ISP. This morning Namecheap.com disabled the domain. We've been in contact with them, and they just agreed to restore access. If the site isn't working for you, please be patient. It should be fully online for everyone within 24 hours.

**Update 3:** Looks like the CEO of Namecheap has chimed in on that thread, looking to save his ass in the wake of a minor uprising:

&gt; I'm the CEO of Namecheap here. Just want to let you all know that I am personaly looking into this. The domain was taken down by an overzealous abuse team member who had no knowledge of who imgur was. Although we did send 6 seperate emails over the last week, it should have still been escalated. I am reviewing our policy to see how we can avoid this type of situation further in the future. To the folks at IMGUR, I want to sincerely apologize for this situation and the extreme inconvenience this has caused you. If you can connect me with someone in your company. I'd like to give you a personal call and discuss the matter further.

My apologies if this is frowned upon. This issue is bigger than us, and I wanted to give it some exposure. I'm borrowing some words from one of our user's submissions in ModTalk.

Bitcrunch, community operations, removed [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/14zjt9/agent_orange_and_avfm_expose_feminist_hate_at/) submission two days ago, claiming there had been complaints. [My comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/14z3is/merry_christmas_the_package_has_been_delivered/c7hv3pn) was also removed at the time.

As most of you will recall, a couple of months ago ShitRedditSays embarked on a campaign of intimidation and harassment against ViolentAcrez. I think [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/11ea2m/project_panda_va_outed_peaches_thawed_all_around/) was the original submission. Some argued that he brought it on himself (and perhaps he did). The issue was that the doxxing was allowed to continue. /r/ModTalk was up in arms, and eventually Yishan, Reddit CEO, stepped in to clarify the rules surrounding doxxing. [This](http://imgur.com/7oWt3) is a screenshot of the submission by Yishan. He clearly states:

&gt;1. We will ban doxxing posted to reddit.
&gt;2. We will ban links to pages elsewhere which are trivially or primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing (e.g. wikis or blogs primarily including dox).

&gt;**TL;DR: We stand for freedom of speech. We will uphold existing rules against posting dox on reddit. But the reality is those rules end at our platform, and we will respect journalism as a form of speech that we don’t ban. We believe further change can come only from example-setting.**

This, of course, caused outrage. It is an open invitation to doxx users on Reddit. We accepted it because free speech and practicality etc. Yishan's word is ultimately law. However, now we have an example of a similar case, only from the other side of this little gender studies battle. This time, however, the article is removed immediately. No pretense of free speech or removing instances of it being impractical. This time, ""there's no grey line here"". Now, apparently, the rules have changed again. So where exactly do the moderators stand? Why is [this](http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/happy-birthday-radfem-scthhum/) article banned, but [this](http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web) one allowed to remain? While one is certainly more verbose, they both represent the lowest form of ""investigative journalism"".

[This](http://i.imgur.com/8pUzR.png?1) is the conversation I've been having with bitcrunch so far. I am particularly concerned with the apparent unwillingness to give us any firm rules on this matter. Yishan made ""Reddit's"" stance very clear. I have explained that to bitcrunch, yet she seems to disagree with Yishan, only insofar as /r/MensRights is concerned. I wonder how many other subreddits and users this double standard applies to?

In other words, the admin, at their whim, may decide what is considered ""trivial"", or ""primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing"". Yet, inexplicably, the Gawker article did not fall under this definition. [Here's another example](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/15d5rg/big_red_high_school_football_team_raped_girl/).

I believe we have the smoking gun. This is an example of ShitRedditSays being allowed to continue a disgusting campaign of intimidation and harassment. When the other ""side"" returns fire, all links are instantly removed. This speaks to the very integrity of Yishan's statements.

Laci Green is or used to be a sex vlogger on Youtube. As with many internet personalities, she had a Tumblr account. It surfaced that in her earlier videos, she had used the word 'tranny' and made comments criticising Islam (she is atheist but had grown up in a Muslim household). A few tumblrites got a hold of this and chewed her out. Here is [a better recap](http://youtubegazette.tumblr.com/post/26960268142/sex-sexuality-and-gender-vlogger-laci-green-receives).

Green apologised and removed the offending videos. However, she received [this threatening PM](http://lacigreen.tumblr.com/post/26843554247/hey-peeps-i-am-going-to-be-taking-a-break-from). Green contacted the police, moved, and went offline. 

Author John Green, unrelated to Laci Green, decided to get involved.

[I AM PISSED OFF](http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com/post/26908704341/i-am-pissed-off) is the post that amassed thousands of notes, likes, and reblogs on tumblr.

&gt;casual use of the word “tranny” in a video she made more than three years ago.

leads to drama. One user is upset that John Green even typed out the word tranny, nevermind that he didn't use it in a derogatory way. They inform him:

&gt;The minute you use a slur that doesn't belong to you is the minute you lose all credibility. The t-word is NOT okay for you to say. It doesn't belong to you.

John Green [responds](http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com/post/26922462196/the-minute-you-use-a-slur-that-doesnt-belong-to-you-is) and gets hundreds of notes. Plenty of them are not happy with his explanation.

disclaimer: everything involved in the linked threads sounds foolishly dangerous. 

Okay I'm briefly coming out of retirement to post this. 

So, there is some news that [John McAfee may or may not be a suspect for murder](http://gizmodo.com/5959812/john-mcafee-wanted-for-murder) in Belize, a country in Central America John escaped to avoid a $5 million lawsuit in the USA. 

However, the interesting drama occurs in the [bluelight drug forum](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question), where McAfee posts as the user stuffmonger. He outs himself several times in the thread, once claiming to have bestiality blackmail on his boss 

I've read all 41 pages and I still can't tell what is going on. If you have the next couple hours free I recommend skimming all of it, because it is simply *insane*. 

So, apparently John claims he doesn't know much about chemistry, but has this huge chemistry lab setup so that he can convert the bath-salts drug MDPV into a hypersexualized ""tan"" freebase version, that apparently briefly existed in the early 90s. Apparently John is the only one now that knows how to create this stuff, and goes around carefully giving a cabal of a couple hundred trusted users in Belize a form of this cut with Excedrin, to prevent them from doing too much and raping all the country animals.  He originally posts asking how he can do this process more efficiently, then when users ask how to make this stuff, he posts 3 different versions of how to go about synthesizing it. 

Except only John and his apparent alts can make this magical stuff. Several other users try and fail. [On page 11](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page11), he explains the only thing that comes close is this bath salts product called Ultimate Sextacy from Am-Hi-Co. Page 11 is also where he outs himself as John and posts pictures of his compound and lab. 

On [page 12](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page12) is where he is first accused of astroturfing for Am-Hi-Co by lineartransform. This continues on for the rest of the thread. I still don't know if he was actually astroturfing, as his recommendation elsewhere of the product and other products of the company isn't exactly glowing and the process to synth this magical tan stuff sounds incredibly dangerous. Another user claims Am-Hi-Co is based in Belize, but I couldn't find out if that is true or not. Another odd thing is that the Am-Hi-Co website goes out of its way to claim its products are not MDPV derivatives, but if this is astroturfing it makes it readily apparent it is a MDPV derivative, so it doesn't make much sense to me why he would astroturf this product in that manner. 

Regardless, the thing begins to get really sketchy. [On page 14](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page14) user nunezzorro comes in with glowing reviews for this new type of custom freebase that he was only able to get right by cooking 1 out of 10 tries. A mod calls BS because the IP is the same one of stuffmonger, who later explains it's because the country has one internet provider and like 2 computers.  

However, later [on page 40](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page40) mmax91 claims the photos of stuffmonger and nunezzoro have:

&gt; same IP address, the same digital camera (Canon G11) with the exact same serial-number and settings, use the same serial-key for Photoshop, live close to each other and magically get the same ""Tan"" product.

in-between is 30 pages of back and forth between users convinced this is a troll, that it is an incredibly dangerous thread that should be pulled, that this conversion is somehow caused by the bacteria psuedomonas, or convinced it somehow will or has worked. Eventually at page 41 the thread is pulled by mods, who still have no idea what is going on. The most likely explanation to me is that John was on a year long MDPV bender and completely lost his mind, convinced he could synth this magical form of MDPV.

But why?? Why hath her cyberspace netizens turned against her? Why would GOD hisself allow this to happen?

Oh yeah, [it's because she's a big ole nasty bigot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-p98umv1gg).

&gt; Don't propagate your hate, because I have a higher standard on who you date - Apologetics' asshole.

So, Now her small time bigot poem vid is just over 300,000 views, and oh my, the responses. From piles, upon piles, upon MORE piles of angry comments, she has gotten a slew of video responses, and has even made it onto Huffpo, and the advocate.

&gt;Jitterbugjive (AKA BaldDumboRat) is a pony artist who is HEAVILY involved in the R34 community on Tumblr. He specializes in drawing art for his webcomics, which focus on glorifying rape and abuse (ZerumWhooves), regular-type abuse (DiscordedWhooves) and his newest project, which glorifies all of the above (Crossed). (Let's just say: if you've never seen snuff and rape in the same picture, now you'll have an opportunity to?)

The initial report of this [caused a bit of a kerfuffle here in r/BJJ](http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/169kwv/very_disturbing_high_level_bjj_players_caught_on/).

Shortly after that news broke, the Internet dug up evidence that the instructor of the victim and the two accused, Lloyd Irvin, [was himself involved in a gang rape case over twenty years ago](http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/1/10/3856994/team-lloyd-irvin-rape-case). Irvin was acquitted, claiming he had a limp dick and thus couldn't join in, but others who took part in the act were found guilty.

Irvin, who is well regarded as an instructor, but generally thought of as a huge sleazeball with his shady marketing schemes quickly responded to the unearthing of his old rape charges by flexing his SEO muscle.  He posted several videos from a recent rape prevention seminar to [his youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/lloydirvin), and [set up a web site](http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/1/11/3864948/mma-bjj-ufc-lloyd-irvin-purchases-lloydirvinrape-marketing) called [LloydIrvinRape.com](http://LloydIrvinRape.com), to promote his upcoming rape prevention seminar (the promotional material has since been removed). To prove to the world that he was doing this out of the goodness of his heart and not as an attempt to push links to these rape cases down the page of web search results, he also [issued a press release via PR Web](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/1/prweb10307266.htm) further promoting his seminar.  Naturally, this all [generated more internet drama](http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=forum.posts&amp;thread=2115573&amp;forum=1&amp;page=1&amp;pc=79), including [a bit on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/16dsg2/well_i_think_im_done_with_all_things_lloyd_irvin/).

These moves by Irvin upset another name in the BJJ community, Randy Jones, also known as Balto. Jones had known about Irvin's old rape case for years, but had remained silent, wanting to give Irvin ""a fair chance"". But Irvin's actions pushed Jones over the edge, and he set up his own SEO counterattack site, [LloydIrvinRapeExposed.com](http://LloydIrvinRapeExposed.com).

On Friday, [the criminal complaint against Maldonado &amp; Schultz was released](http://www.fightopinion.com/2013/01/12/court-lloyd-irvin-students-rape/), containing the graphic details of the rape, and causing a tiny bit of drama in the comments.

And in the latest round of drama surrounding the case, Lloyd Irvin black belt and owner of Wrightson BJJ, Phil Proctor, posted a small rant online, defending Irvin. In his post, [Proctor calls the victim in Irvin's case a ""dirty whore that got to feeling guilty""](http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=forum_framed.posts&amp;forum=1&amp;thread=2116701&amp;page=7). This spawned eight pages of comments in which people call for Anonymous to get involved and Proctor shows up to make a half-hearted apology that is not well received.

&gt; Well... this is it. I'm done with Nodus. I've been programming Nodus for a very long time and I've seen it grow into something I don't like at all. The Minecraft community has fallen to shit and Mojang seems to not care. At one point there were 6, 000 people online the Nodus IRC channel (connected from the client) a year ago when we had IRC. That's rediculous. It's been a fun run but it's time to say good bye.

&gt;If you've donated for a cape you'll still have it on your character for the current version of Nodus and you'll have it in future versions if I ever decide to continue the project. (Perhaps even access to something special we were planning for donators). Almost all of the requests I'm recieving now are spam so I've removed the form. I haven't had a chance to get through all of them so if you're still waiting on you cape/cape change it may be done soon.

/u/kaax decides to interpret it as a violation of reddit's rules and a conspiracy between the moderators of /r/fitness and the people over at greatist.com who compiled the infographic.

I'll do my best to explain things to people not familiar with TwitchTV.  
  
-----  
On Saturday Nights, many speed runners compete in Ocarina of Time bingo, which is where runners must complete a set of 5 tasks in any order as fast as possible. RunnerGuy (a long-time OoT runner) decided to participate while being drunk. Many fun times were had watching DrunkerGuy fail glitches he normally would've gotten quite easily, but the actual bingo part isn't important at all. What happened after the run started it all.  

RunnerGuy is a big fan of FrankerZ (an e-mote of a dog that has become wildly popular to spam and is associated with ""hype""), and in his drunkenness even more so. He held an afterparty where he sat and played the FrankerZ song over at tehurn.com/FrankerZ while he ""directed"" the ""FrankerZ train"" to various Twitch channels. Basically, the streamer where the FrankerZ train has landed would have massive ASCII art of FrankerZ spammed alongside the regular FrankerZ face, and the streamer who is being raided becomes the ""conductor"" who picks the next person for the raid. Runnerguy would direct the train to Twitch users, most of whom were SRL (SpeedRunsLive, a community of speed runners who stream their games live and participate in many races) people and knew about it, in order to see their reactions. Eventually, the train was beginning to run out of SRL people to link to (RunnerGuy wanted to find people who *didn't* know about the FrankerZ train, in order to get a better ""LOL WTF"" reaction), so non-SRL people began being linked as well. Some of these users were from Team Ludendi (European version of SRL), but others were unaffiliated with speed running at all. This is where the problem began.  

Twitch user Crumps2 (a non-speedrunner, but somewhat popular video game streamer) was linked, and his chat flooded with FrankerZ e-motes and ASCII art. A Twitch admin by the name of Itaku happened to be watching Crumps2's stream, and had set-up an anti-spam bot to monitor Crumps2's chat. The bot, however, enacted an incredibly large number of bans so quickly (because the FrankerZ spam came so quickly and in large numbers) that it itself was IP banned for ironically ""spamming"" the chat. Subscriber mode was turned on in the chat, and Crumps2 and Itaku were both visibly angry. Itaku allegedly said that he was going to go through the chat logs and IP ban any user who participated in the spam raid (later clarified by another admin named George that only ASCII art spammers would be banned). Itaku and Crumps2 allegedly used a few slurs against the people from the FrankerZ train in their rage, and Crumps2 laughed at the raid by telling them it was only going to raise his viewer count to the point where he could apply for Twitch partner. The combination of the bans, alleged use of slurs, and Crumps2's condescending remarks angered the people from the FrankerZ train, and many took to RunnerGuy's (now empty, as he was offline) chat and IAteYourPie's (in the middle of a Paper Mario All Cards race, but otherwise previously unrelated to this drama) chat to speak about their anger.

Now it gets even crazier. A lot of mud was slinged around, screencaps of convos posted, and many SRL runners involved themselves in Pie's chat and on Twitter. Pie HIMSELF calls out Itaku on his stream, and tells people to report Itaku ON STREAM. The admin named George shows up and turns on subscriber mode on Pie's stream to have a direct conversation with him as well as the other SRL runners on Pie's chat. I'll try and sum up the arguments both sides made here:  

FrankerZ Train/Speed Runners:

1) IP banning was a disproportionate reaction to the FrankerZ train.  
2) FrankerZ train was friendly, and would leave within minutes.  
3) FrankerZ train exposes viewers to new streamers.  

Crumps2/Itaku:  

1) It was unnecessary spam, flooded the chat. The streamer never asked for it.  
2) Caused chat servers to slow down, likened the raid to a DDoS.  
3) Raiders broke the streamer's chat rules.  

Both sides kept to their own chats, and each felt they were in the right. The man who started it all - RunnerGuy - even showed up on his offline stream's chat (apparently sobered up) to find out what the hell just happened. Who would've thought an e-mote of a dog would have caused so much trouble?

I broke his nose and he went to the emergency room.

Looking for a place to vent without fucking up other subreddits with my stupid bullshit. Here's what happened:

Old friend from highschool.  I took him in rent free when he called me up crying one day.  He was scared he would be killed.  Apparently he was squatting in a house in an urban area with a bunch of other people and they got violent with him.

Fast forward six months to the present.  He's living in my living room.  He's a hoarder.  Unclean.  Smokes weed and sleeps constantly.  Kind of crazy, and prone to screaming fits and childish tantrums.  Yesterday my dog ate his pillow.  I offered to buy him a new one, but he was really treating me shitty.  He was being very difficult - so I went to find the pillow to see how much it was.  He got upset at me and accused me of 'checking his work' because he had already told me he was looking for the pillow and couldn't find it.  He became verbally abusive, started yelling at me.  I told him not to do this, and demanded an apology, told him I wouldn't leave the living room, which is technically his room, until he calmed down talked to me.  I was also concerned because the dude was suicidal, and I had had to take his prescription medicine away from him.  I wasn't sure what state of mind he was in, and wanted to be sure he was OK.  He wasn't.  He attacked me, and long story short I broke his nose.  I offered to take him to the hospital but he was still being completely irrational and abusive.  He took the bus.  He's there now, and I'm packing my things.  Thankfully I had been planning to move out for awhile now. I don't even care about the deposit.

Pictures:

[He blew his nose at the bathroom mirror to spite me as I calmly waited for him to leave.](http://i.imgur.com/F9dAtop.jpg?1)


[The initial scuffle - pushed him into a pile of his shit which knocked over.](http://i.imgur.com/AUpbOP5.jpg?1?4927)

[This is the rest of his room.](http://i.imgur.com/s2Snv6k.jpg?1?7335)

He smelled really bad, I still smell his BO on me from the fight.  I've known the guy for a long time - enough now to know that he's kind of like a force of nature.  You can only kind of suffer him.  You can't get a long with him.  This is why I don't feel regret.  I feel like I kinda had to put my dog down because he had rabies.  Not sure what else to do for him.

All well.  Cracking open some beers and packing.  Here's to brighter horizons.  AMA.",,False,self,t5_2rd2l,False,,,True,t3_18btod,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/18btod/my_roomate_and_i_got_into_a_fight_just_now/,

On the last day of the marathon (around 12 hours ago at the time of this post) during one of the final runs (Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker) one of the couch commenters whose screen name is ""Mirrored"" gave a little too much commentary, often not allowing the actual runner to speak. At some points he would also point out mistakes that the runner (CosmoWright) made. The viewers on Twitch were extremely pissed off, and the hate that spewed from the chat was so great that they shut off the chat for an hour until it died down. Unfortunately I don't have any screen grabs from the twitch chat as it moved way too fast (40k+ viewers) and way too many messages were being deleted, but the drama spewed over to 4chan's /vg/ board.

1353571899.0,12,self.Drama,13m2bs,[meta] [british] an attempt to cover the PEDOGEDDON.,14,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/13m2bs/meta_british_an_attempt_to_cover_the_pedogeddon/,"There's recently been a **lot** of drama in the UK about pedophiles.

The core of all of it is sad - vulnerable people were sexually abused, many times.  Some of them reported the abuse.  They were ignored, and the abuse continued.  The abuse spanned many years.

The drama comes from the way the abuse allegations were revealed.  This is complicated, so bare with me.

**1) Jimmy Saville OBE (now dead).**

Jimmy Saville was a popular radio DJ and TV personality.  ""Jim'll Fix It"" was a much loved tv show.  He did a lot of work for charity.  When he died the BBC had a set of commemorative programmes about him.

There had been long running rumours in the industry that Saville had been an unpleasant man, and perhaps abusive, but no-one had done anything about it.  A BBC tv programme (their flagship news programme, ""NewsNight"") had investigated, and came to the conclusion that he was a child abuser.  That programme was not shown; BBC bosses cancelled it.  

Some time later another programme on the competing ITV network did their own investigation into Saville.  They decided he was a serial abuser.

(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9580096/Jimmy-Savile-Questions-about-why-BBC-dropped-Newsnight-investigation.html)

(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9577087/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-ITV-goes-where-BBC-fears-to-tread.html)

Here's where a lot of drama explodes - why the hell didn't anyone say anything?  Why were the victims ignored? How much did the BBC know? (BBC have a yearly charity drive called ""Children in Need""; they banned Saville from any involvement because they didn't like the allegations.) etc etc.

The BBC then do a programme (using their flagship documentary ""Panorama"") about what went wrong at ""Newsnight"".  

More victims come forward.

More stories are heard.

It turns out that this man was evil and he abused very many people over very many years.  He may be one of the UK's most prolific sex offenders.

Bizarrely this radio and tv personality was invited into a high security psychiatric hospital, as a volunteer ""help"".  (To make the jargon clear: this is a place for very disturbed people involved in serious criminal behaviour.  The Yorkshire Ripper is at Broodmoor.)  Saville used this opportunity to abuse very vulnerable women detained at Broadmoor.

So far it's all pretty shitty for the BBC - many people lost their jobs.

**2) North Wales Children's Homes**

And then there's some separate allegations about abuse in Children's home in Wales.  These were serious allegations and nothing much was done and there was an investigation at the time, but justice wasn't done.  The BBC did a programme.  Remember that they're under considerable scrutiny because of piss-poor journalism.

A victim says he was abused by (at the time) a senior tory politician, but does not give the name.  The BBC allow that comment to be broadcast.

Turns out that when the victim was originally interviewed by police, many years ago, they showed him a photograph of someone that the victim identified as the abuser.  The police put a name to that photo.  But they put the wrong name to that abuser.

Twitter is abuzz - who is this politician?  A name is found.

The Prime Minister appears on a breakfast TV show, and the presenter hands over a list of alleged pedophiles.  Accidentally this list is shown on camera.

Very great harm is done to this man, who is not a pedophile, because the most important news programme on the BBC fucked up again.

That innocent man is now going after people who tweeted or re-tweeted his name.  Regular people are being asked to pay £5 to a children's charity.  Celebs will be asked to pay much more.  The BBC has already had to pay £187,000 and that sum was kept low because of the way the BBC is funded.  ITV (the breakfast programme people) will have to pay considerably more.

1368886340.0,8,self.Drama,1ekrri,"Somebody recommended I post this here, so here it is: A yarn about the abusive relationship between the /anime mods and me. [Wall of text] [some effort]",14,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1ekrri/somebody_recommended_i_post_this_here_so_here_it/,"So, it all started when I tried to make a meta sub for /anime. The anime mods thought they should be in control of such a subreddit and vocally opposed such a subreddit. They had a rule against meta discussion in /anime. This advertising didn't really break that rule--I was advertising a subreddit, not discussing the /anime subreddit. But hey, they're the mods so they got super pissed when I pointed this out and removed all my comments. I posted in /modclub asking how to advertise my metasub and the /anime mods started up [a discussion here too that didn't lead anywhere.](http://www.reddit.com/r/modclub/comments/14wzgs/so_i_made_ranimemeta_but_the_ranime_mods_dont/c7h9je3)

So, anyways, it turned out that one of the private subs I stumbled on whilst trying to find a name for my meta sub is actually one the /anime mods have been working on for a month or two before I started mine (please note that they haven't said anything about this before I sunk like two+ hours into opening my sub, putting up some copied CSS and adding a bunch of people as approved submitters). So they opened their own meta sub and I was like FFS, since I can't really compete with an official sub.

But hey, mission accomplished--I was banned from their meta sub for advertising my own alternative (apparently, it's meta when it's in /anime and it's not meta when it's in /animemeta.....whatever) but there was some success--I got them to actually have some space for meta discussion. It's obviously biased to hell because as you can see they aren't exactly prone to making logical, consistent moderating decisions but hey, it's *something*. 

While all this was going on, there was also a lot of modmail discussions about this, and the /anime mods grew steadily more angry the more I tried to get them to see logic. One of the /anime mods just happened to be a mod of /awwnime, where this mod started verbally abusing me in modmail when I tried to find out why one of my submissions has been removed. 

I, of course, stayed polite throughout all my interactions with all the mods of /anime and /awwnime (being completely serious here, if a mod is acting like a five year old, I won't come down to their level). I complained to grozzle about the abuse in modmail (and obvious bias of one of the mods) and he said that modmail verbal abuse is apparently acceptable, that a mod shouldn't treat a polite subscriber as a human being. So now, as I tried to explain how illogical *that* was, the other two mods of the sub apparently got mad that they had to perform their mod duties (answer modmail) and now consider me a troll, even though all I've tried to do is have a polite conversation about one or two of my removed submissions in /awwnime. They've also somehow convinced some of the regulars in the sub that I'm a troll as well, so now my comments there tend to get downvoted and people send me abusive messages if I complain about this bad treatment. Nothing too horrible but ""leave this sub"" does get annoying if it's repeated forcefully enough.

Also, grozzle has a metareddit alert thing for mentions of awwnime and his name so he'll probably see this ~~comment~~post--hi grozzle! I obviously welcome his interpretation of things.

But yeah, that felt good. Hey, grozzle, if you could provide screenshots of the modmail conversations we had, that'd be great. 

Oh and also, one of the /awwnime users who suddenly disliked me in /awwnime now downvotes and complains about me in [completely unrelated subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1bxwy2/requesting_rkatawashoujo_mod_is_inactive/c9bh54r).&lt;/rant&gt;

See /r/animemeta for more evidence, unless they delete their comments.

Also, the latest passive-agressive move was Lolimaster taking over /r/republicofanime and restricting submissions after I applied for it and was denied because I was over my quota, even though I had no way of telling whether I'd be denied for the previous sub....",,False,self,t5_2rd2l,False,,,True,t3_1ekrri,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1ekrri/somebody_recommended_i_post_this_here_so_here_it/,

One of the features of this server is that Paradox, the admin of the server, is living and playing with two others on the survival world (the main world of the server), Snafoofoo and Tigrr. The trio built a large base called Ft. Dude and, with the aid of Paradox (I should note that it seemed that Paradox had provided the group diamond pickaxes that could not break, something that's obviously not available to everyone else), steadily progressed above everyone else. 

SickLaxBro is one of a handful of players that have started playing there, and apparently, develops an early rivalry with Tigrr after Tigrr spawn-kills him several times. It should be noted that in that incident, SickLaxBro managed to kill Tigrr, who was in full iron armor at the time, with his bare fists, and this prowess for PvP will become relevant later on.

Fast forward a week or so and things are going fine, the economy of the server's rolling and new players are periodically rolling in. Then, just earlier today, it seemed that SickLaxBro's farm was lava griefed by Paradox (once again the admin of the server) and Tigrr. SickLaxBro, for some odd reason angered by the destruction of his wheat, vows vengeance and, over the course of the next 3 hours, goes about killing and griefing (from my count, he killed every member of Ft. Dude at least once, several bystanders, and lava griefed at least two places). This apparently angers Paradox, who promptly banned SickLaxBro from the server and then from the IRC server as well (Paradox apparently is an IRCop for Snoonet).

BONUS: LH has leaked a slightly embarrassing mod mail. ",14,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/14pl8k/laurelais_hygiene_makes_a_post_in_srssucks/,"This is a follow up of r/drama's previous gossip post about Laurelais_Hygiene. Shit got pretty funny. 

~~LH is currently none too happy about his shadow ban for something ""that was not dox""~~ and in a flurry of rage and tin foil hats, he has made a post to SRSsucks calling out all of those who have wronged him. 

**Removed post text**:

&gt;I have been with LeftoNhahe in private modmail for a while. Some other users from this sub are in there too. Very recently we had a minor leak: /u/LeftonHahe [3] admitted that he is in Game of Dolls and HarrietPotter is a good friend of him in real life. He said he was the leaker.
His opinion on this is: 'I am a good mod, I didn't do anything wrong, I can choose who my friends are outside of reddit.' I believe there's conflict of interest though, he's playing buddy with people like /u/Laurelai [-30][4] in a private sub. He's been friends with HarrietPotter before he even was made mod. Look at the age of his account. I won't leak modmail conversation, but believe me if I say this: a lot of other people in there were and still are pissed off at him. They lost /r/antisrs[5] over bullshit like this, I myself wasn't there at the time so I couldn't give my opinion, I just enjoyed the popcorn.
The reason why I got banned: we were having fun with /u/lolsail [+2][6] . I found a picture of him that he posted in /r/mildlyinteresting[7] . He said he was okay if I posted a link to it, so I did. Laughs were had. I made a meme out of it. He thought it was funny. After that I posted the meme in a response to /u/cojoco [+2][8] .. Not long after that /u/lolsail [+2][9] pmed me that he wasn't feeling comfortable with the meme anymore, categorizing it as official doxx. Note that it wasn't doxx when I made the meme, he made it to be doxx by stating that he wants it removed from reddit. So I did. I removed every picture of user /u/lolsail [+2][10] , even though he thought it was funny: Okay, I actually laughed at that one.
Reddibots still has the old screen containing the links to the pictures. What funny was: he even posted a 'better' picture of him where we could see his Edward Scissorhands haircut (I'm not kidding). He was perfectly fine with everything at the time. We were having a laugh. He even thanked me in PM. Now this is where it comes together. I know /u/LeftoNhahe [11] is in /r/gameofdolls[12] , I was even planning on taking him down because of that, (sorry Left but I just don't like people that team up with the enemy). You are saying that you're acting like a mole, but we both know you aren't and they will never give you juicy information. You are being played by harrietpotter because you're gullible, someone in modmail even compared you with an Aspie (not me this time, but it was funny as hell). The reason for his friendship with her: 'I was feeling very bad at a time in my life when broke up with a girl. HarrietPotter was there for me. She was very supportive and I like her as a friend. We even watch youtube together over skype.'
Guess who else is in /r/gameofdolls[13] ? /u/Lolsail [14] . Not only him but a lot of people you don't want to be associated with:
/u/cojoco [+2][15]
/u/Laurelai [-30][16]
/u/anguilax [17] (HarrietPotter)
/u/brucemo [18] (aSRS mod under different nick)
etc.
People in modmail asked /u/LeftoNhahe [19] to make a screenshot of all the mods and regulars there. He didn't do it. But he's a good mole right?
TL;DR: /u/lolsail [+2][20] and /u/LeftoNhahe [21] are in /r/gameofdolls[22] together with some despicable people like /u/Laurelai [-30][23] and /u/HarrietPotter [24] . I have reason to believe that they massively reported me and /u/ss2james [25] to the admins over something that wasn't even doxx.
PS: WHO THE FUCK CARES ABOUT A SHADOWBAN ANYWAY IF I CAN JUST MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT

[Here is the link to the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/14p813/i_am_laurelais_hygiene_i_got_shadowbanned_for/). The comments range from conspiracy theories, to calls to move to a new sub.

The mods of /r/gunsarecool did not report the vote flipping, although one of us probably would have had we known about it.

I was asked to give a plug for the downvote brigaded sub.  So I want to do that.  Subredditdrama sent a lot of great redditors to /r/gunsarecool, and we share a lot of the same users and it wouldn't be the same without you because SRDers in my experience tend to be pretty sharp and witty contributers.

But you really should check out /r/gunviolence too, because it is exceptionally difficult to start a sub related to gun violence on reddit due to it's voting structure and the nearly 130,000 people opposed to it.

Other Side of Amy’s Baking Company Controversy in Scottsdale To Soon Be Told

SCOTTSDALE, AZ. MAY 15, 2013 -- Amy’s Baking Company will host a Grand Re-Opening on Tuesday night, May 21, following unflattering portrayals on national television.

Customers will be able to decide who is correct: a famous celebrity chef or the marketplace that has supported the small, locally-owned business for six years.

When re-opened, a portion of proceeds will benefit a charity organized to bring awareness to cyber bullying. 

Seating is limited. Reservations may be made by emailing sjones@rosemoserallynpr.com. 

Diners will also have the opportunity to meet, and judge for themselves the character of owners Amy and Samy Bouzaglo, who have devoted their lives to and earn their living from their small restaurant. The Bouzaglos have been married for 10 years, after Sammy emigrated from Israel. 

The owners will likely be holding a press conference before the Grand Re-Opening and answer falsehoods depicted on a reality television show, including assertions that the restaurant confiscates tips from servers.

In fact, wait staff is paid $8-$14 per hour, two and half to nearly five times the standard hourly wage for servers. 

Questions will also be answered about what happened to their Facebook page. 

Amy’s Baking Company was recently featured on the hit PBS show “Check Please” and has received A+ reports from CBS 5 for kitchen preparedness. 

“We are very upset by what has taken place, apologize about the acrimony that has ensued but now must fight back to save our business. We hope and believe much good can result from what has transpired. We ask the public to keep an open mind as we begin to tell our side of the story,” Samy Bouzaglo said.

As you can see in that log, space_ball is mad at Laurelais_Hygiene (completely reasonable) for stirring up shit in IRC. But then the conversation moves on to voice flags, and space_ball's case for why he should have them. BipolarBear0 fields his questions but the chat breaks off at the end when he seems a bit confused as to what space_ball is saying. Conversation dwindles for a bit, and then this:

[22:13] * You were kicked from #trivia by space_ball (BipolarBear0)


Out of the blue, space_ball kicks BipolarBear0 from #trivia, a channel they both op. BipolarBear0 pops into #drama and asks what he did that for, [prompting this discussion](https://privatepaste.com/2423ca3e1d)

BipolarBear0 proceeded to remove space_ball's operator permissions in #trivia, but a few minutes later he re-enables them. A few more minutes pass, and then space_ball private messages BipolarBear0 again:

[22:58] &lt;space_ball&gt; we need to talk. you wanna do it in drama or in query? your choice

[22:58] &lt;BipolarBear0&gt; Talk about what?

[22:59] &lt;space_ball&gt; really?

[22:59] &lt;BipolarBear0&gt; You're not getting flags and you need to calm down about internet ""status"".

[22:59] &lt;space_ball&gt; wow you really are drunk. you don't usually act like this

[23:00] &lt;space_ball&gt; have a nice night with your fucking jamo you drunk asshole. if you wanna talk tomorrow about how you're being a dick to me, let me know. otherwise, don't talk to me anymore.

[23:00] &lt;space_ball&gt; fuck off dude

Some more time passes, and space_ball kickbans BipolarBear0 from #trivia AGAIN. This time BipolarBear0 comes in and permanently takes away space_ball's operator status. space_ball then brings it into #drama for [one last hurrah before he quits](https://privatepaste.com/52057a9e84)

EDIT 1 : [Space_Ball believes that this is all a biased attack set up to make him look like an asshole. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1beqeq/irc_a_slapfight_of_epic_proportions_occurs_when/c9679kq)

Edit 2 : Spaceball deleted the comment. For those that don't have unedit reddit it said 

&gt;This is all conveniently set up to make me look like an asshole, but the truth is that BipolarBear0 is just another mod who really gets off on his power on IRC and this sub. Go ahead, everyone. Call me an asshole. I have the logs. I tried really hard to get this guy to at least talk to me but his face is red with furious internet angers because I banned him from #trivia ( yes, you heard that right, a fucking trivia channel) AS A JOKE which is (was) the only irc channel I had ops in. BipolarBear0 was wasted tonight (which he admitted) and didn't like my joke so he went on a childish rampage and caused what you see. When I kickbanned him (once again, as a joke) he got so raging mad that he removed my flags in that channel and stopped talking to me, like a petulant child. So there's your drama. Talk to him, because lord knows, he won't talk to me anymore. This is so funny.

He also replied to u/nidderfaddit with the following 

&gt;I need to clear something up. I was not crying about +v. Somehow, that's what everyone is talking about, but it's not true. We made a joke about voice in the channel and I was like ""hey I've been around for a while, when do I get my v"" and it was totally a joke because +v means absolutely nothing in irc. So Bear gave me +v and I was like ""hey, you know what, I don't want v unless &lt;this other guy&gt; gets v because I think he's cool. This was all just normal irc joking but then people started accusing me of taking +v too seriously and when I defended myself I was accused of taking everything too seriously and before you knew it, you had drunk irc ops acting like douches and making me look bad because they didn't get jokes. Guys, I was kidding. And when I said I was kidding everyone said ""NO WAY YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE"" and I never recovered. I'm still confused. *edit and I think BipolarBear0 doesn't like me anymore because I spent a couple of minutes telling the channel how much of a fucking drunk douche he was being, which is true and I don't take it back. He admitted he was wasted on Jameson and that always makes for bad moderating but whatever, when you're in charge you can be trashed and preach to everyone about how things will be. So that part was true.

Torvalds saw those comments, and decided to respond.

Reading the thread it all seems like vigorous debate; nothing too harsh.  But in 1992 that was a big thing; Wikipedia says this is sometimes seen as a flamewar.  People wrote to Linus to remind him about netiquette.

&gt;Precautionary note: As I've called out multiple meta subreddits, I expect this post to be brigaded. Expect derailing comments.

The thread didn't really get any derailing comments in the first day of its posting. It went over fairly well, and got a couple dozen upvotes and comments. MWM saw it and linked the r/cringe mods to it, spawning [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1a3qxd/the_enemy_at_the_gates_aside_from_corporate/c8u3ouq) comment chain. Note the timestamps on all comments.

(Also note the lack of a reply from btwstopsrs to my comment. He's full of shit, but whatever.)

This remark in the text of btwstopsrs's self-post:

&gt;We even see this in /r/braveryjerk, which uses irony as it's main organ of operation. Opposing arguments are ignored and derailed with aggression and wall of text copypasta (a de facto brigade).

[Goes exactly as expected.](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1a3qxd/the_enemy_at_the_gates_aside_from_corporate/c8u7tj4) Seriously, if you complain about Braveryjerk spamming, you're pretty much asking for it.

**Snakepliskinist**: Youtube user with 1000 or so subscribers, usually rambles to the camera about how awesome MRAs are. Doesn't appear to shower. 

------
**The Slapfight:**

Snakepliskinist randomly stumbled upon one of CasesAndMaterial's videos, and upon attempting to comment on said video, discovered he had been blocked by CasesAndMaterials. *Oh my*.

Snakepliskinist then [made a ten minute long video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3pg8DxbJSg) about how *not angry* he is that someone he has never heard of had blocked him. (Hint: He really mad).

&gt; CaseAndMaterials is what MRAs would call a, ""mangina."" - Snakepliskinist.

Upon seeing this video, CasesAndMaterials made a [video response](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoDmSr4t4FI) about what a moron Snakepliskinist is.

&gt; I can block whoever I want...I don't want bigots and idiots running around my channel - CasesAndMaterials

Upon seeing CasesAndmaterial's video, Snakepliskinist made **another** [video about how still not mad he is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBM_YcLZO7w). The video even includes fancy editing! 

&gt; Please forward this to CasesandMaterials. Perhaps his testicles will descend. - Snakepliskinist.


**Then** after seeing Snakepliskinist's video, CaseAndMaterial made *another* video to Snakepliskinist entitled [""You will never be 1/10th of the man I am.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq2LQrWFrTg) The video really is as bad as it sounds. **This is pure internet gold**.

[Snakepliskinist replies to that video, telling CaseAndMaterials that he should take some notes from him because he's a ""real"" man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DeeIktMGiQ) and gets hotter sex than he does. 

[Then another reply from CaseAndMaterials](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N67QetpbFdg&amp;list=UUCTVayGDYHmvemqDye08LRA&amp;index=3) after a lot of people got mad at him for posting the 1/10th of a man video, (see comments).

[Snakeplinkinist makes his rebuttal about how he's totally not a bigot, and how he's only trying to teach CasesAndMaterials about ""life""....or something](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sydlho9soCE)

Then another one from CasesAndMaterials where he parodies Snakepliskinist. [It's so bad it's almost good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjjSvhpjXUg&amp;list=UUCTVayGDYHmvemqDye08LRA&amp;index=2)

[Snakeliskinist replies with a ""parody"" video of his own, kind of.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sydlho9soCE). Includes more magical editing!

And then nothing.....

This appears to be the end of this days-long running youtube slapfight, and for that we are sad, but I will be updating this is if it appears one of them makes another video.

Two days later, tournament organizations and community representatives come together to ban Collusion in medium and major fighting games tournaments. The community explode, some of joy saying this was long needed while other's preach the incoming apocalypse with accusations of selling out, bias and the wonderful ""*strong and independent first world anarchists who need to policing*"".

The drama is currently unfolding in the comments of this [**article**](http://shoryuken.com/2013/07/30/major-tournaments-agree-to-rules-standardization-on-player-collusion-event-coverage-determined-by-rule-inclusion-and-enforcement/) and can also observed in the comments of this [**other article**](http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2013/jul/30/major-tournaments-shoryuken-eventhubs-and-mad-catz-speak-out-against-collusion-coverage-will-be-determined-rule-inclusion-future/?page=2) - although the second one has calmed a bit.",,False,self,t5_2rd2l,False,,,True,t3_1jeaa8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/1jeaa8/fighting_game_community_bans_collusion_in/,

03:25:10 &lt; hoobsher&gt; ...so hi, how's it going #drama  
03:25:13 &lt;@sair&gt; BipolarBear0: hoobsher is a friend of mine. he is my guest.

03:25:30 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; sair: If he were your guest he would say something in this channel.  
03:25:34  * sair tells hoobsher to behave.  
03:25:35 &lt;@Hugstable&gt; bear, tbh, isn't that the point of this chat and our subreddit?  
03:25:36 &lt;@aboynamedsu&gt; &gt; [8:24pm] BipolarBear0: hoobsher: If you're going to be allowed in this channel you will act respectfully and actually talk. This channel is for discussion - I generally don't tolerate idling - and thus far I've only seen you come in here when you have something negative to say.  
03:25:38 &lt;@aboynamedsu&gt; yeah, no  
03:26:07 &lt;+ReubenMcHawk&gt; the i in irc might as well be idle  
03:26:16 &lt; hoobsher&gt; idle relay chat  
03:26:18 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; He only comes in here when he has something negative to say, which is my main issue with this.  
03:26:19 &lt; hoobsher&gt; rolls nicely  
03:26:22 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; Anyway, we're talking about TheGhostofDusty  
03:26:28 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; This is really a distraction  
03:26:29 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; TheGhostofDusty  
03:26:35 &lt;@sair&gt; BipolarBear0: scut isnt answering me. which means he is busy. he usually always answers me within 2 minutes if he's not busy.  
03:26:39 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; I believe I asked you what ""the truth"" is  
03:26:41 &lt;+ReubenMcHawk&gt; and yeah if you're expecting no shittalking in a chat about r/drama then LOL  
03:27:00 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; Yeah, I'm sure it's fine.  
03:27:35 &lt; TheGhostofDusty&gt; The truth is what you stated.  
03:28:00 &lt;@Hugstable&gt; oh hey its that guy  
03:28:29 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; I invited you in here because I want to talk about your subreddit  
03:28:42 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; You've been shadowbanned I assume, as have many other users in NLW  
03:28:46 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; There's obviously a reason for that.  
03:28:55 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; You dox, you harass and stalk users... You don't see that as bad?&gt;  
03:29:52 &lt; TheGhostofDusty&gt; I have not been banned, I do nothing that you have stated. The subreddit follows the rules and guidelines of Reddit  
03:30:45 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; Alright, but as a moderator of that subreddit you sort of speak for the users and your fellow moderators.  
03:30:55 &lt;@BipolarBear0&gt; Those people HAVE been shadowbanned. What do you have to say about that?

1. Jan 03 12:40:21 &lt;Daemon_of_Mail&gt;	wtf
1. Jan 03 12:40:31 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	well, they are in that thread
1. Jan 03 12:40:33 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	lol david me, what?
1. Jan 03 12:40:34 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	LauraOfTheLye, of course it does, intelligence is demonstrably heritable 
1. Jan 03 12:40:40 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	no it isn't
1. Jan 03 12:40:51 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	yes, it is, c'mon that stuff is even on wikipedia
1. Jan 03 12:40:52 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	show me a study that says so
1. Jan 03 12:40:53 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	go ahead
1. Jan 03 12:40:53 &lt;Nerolette&gt;	i'm a white person and I'm oppressed?
1. Jan 03 12:40:55 &lt;Daemon_of_Mail&gt;	looks like r/niggers invaded that thread as well
1. Jan 03 12:40:59 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	there are components
1. Jan 03 12:41:01 &lt;Nerolette&gt;	It's like, -go fuck yourself-
1. Jan 03 12:41:01 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	but mostly
1. Jan 03 12:41:08 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	intelligence is correlated with wealth
1. Jan 03 12:41:15 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	and access to educational resources
1. Jan 03 12:41:28 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	the test we do now
1. Jan 03 12:41:28 &lt;david-me&gt;	LauraOfTheLye   Whaire pride is being proud of who you are and your heritage.  White rights are racists and bogits
1. Jan 03 12:41:30 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	LauraOfTheLye, no, intelligent people tend to be richer and get more schooling
1. Jan 03 12:41:35 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	lol no
1. Jan 03 12:41:38 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	lol, yes
1. Jan 03 12:41:40 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	intelligent parents
1. Jan 03 12:41:43 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	are richer
1. Jan 03 12:41:47 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	and can provide more for their kids
1. Jan 03 12:41:50 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	no, not just parents
1. Jan 03 12:41:55 &lt;Daemon_of_Mail&gt;	""white pride"", if meaning the same thing as any other kind of racial pride, implies that there's a high degree of white shame, which there isn't
1. Jan 03 12:41:56 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	but it doesn't prove that their kids started out intelligent
1. Jan 03 12:41:57 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	intelligence isn't coorelated with race
1. Jan 03 12:42:00 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	intelligent single people are also richer
1. Jan 03 12:42:01 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	just that they also ended up intelligent
1. Jan 03 12:42:03 &lt;runfromnowhere&gt;	david-me: I can kind of understand how you are making those distinctions, but 99.999% of the time out there in the world ""white pride"" is code for racism
1. Jan 03 12:42:03 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	HexagonSun, yes, it is
1. Jan 03 12:42:09 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	i'm not getting into this
1. Jan 03 12:42:13 &lt;Nerolette&gt;	Racism is basically feeling that you're being oppressed by a group in someway, either through benefits they receive that you don't, and getting hurt in the butt over it.
1. Jan 03 12:42:18 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	if your source is the wiki
1. Jan 03 12:42:25 &lt;david-me&gt;	runfromnowhere   is there a better term?

1. Jan 03 12:42:36 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	no, my source is not the wiki, it's just so obvious that it's even sourced in the wiki
1. Jan 03 12:42:37 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	Steven Pinker is the patron saint of the ""nature"" side of the ""nature vs. nurture"" debate
1. Jan 03 12:42:46 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	lol yup
1. Jan 03 12:42:47 &lt;Daemon_of_Mail&gt;	it's like people who say ""WHAT ABOUT STRAIGHT PRIDE""
1. Jan 03 12:42:50 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	that's how science works
1. Jan 03 12:42:50 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	he says racial intelligence is bullshit
1. Jan 03 12:42:53 &lt;Daemon_of_Mail&gt;	implying straight people are oppress
1. Jan 03 12:42:57 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	i can't see the rounding of the earth
1. Jan 03 12:42:59 &lt;david-me&gt;	Daemon_of_Mail   really?
1. Jan 03 12:43:00 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	it is flat
1. Jan 03 12:43:02 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	that's so obvious
1. Jan 03 12:43:17 &lt;runfromnowhere&gt;	david-me: Maybe something like ""to celebrate one's heritage""?  Unfortunately the phrase ""white pride"" has been coopted and imbued with meanings that are not very well-liked
1. Jan 03 12:43:18 &lt;david-me&gt;	CIS PRIDE       !!!!!!!
1. Jan 03 12:43:26 &lt;Nerolette&gt;	""Oh my god, affirmative action!?! I'm oppressed because the people we used as slaves get a little help coping with the dysphoria we've instilled in them""
1. Jan 03 12:43:28 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	white pride is a stupid idea
1. Jan 03 12:43:29 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	HexagonSun, I'm glad we found the arbiter of reality, what is his take on many-words hypothesis? 
1. Jan 03 12:43:34 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	you can and already do have national pride
1. Jan 03 12:43:37 &lt;david-me&gt;	thanks runfromnowhere   good to know
1. Jan 03 12:43:58 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	he has books, you know
1. Jan 03 12:44:00 &lt;david-me&gt;	LauraOfTheLye   not national pride
1. Jan 03 12:44:03 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	he makes good arguments
1. Jan 03 12:44:14 &lt;david-me&gt;	pride beyond nation.   Family
1. Jan 03 12:44:17 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	there's nothing to hold white people together as a ground
1. Jan 03 12:44:19 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	I'm not going to dig a million citations up for you
1. Jan 03 12:44:24 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	white people are not a family
1. Jan 03 12:44:37 &lt;david-me&gt;	Either are blacks?
1. Jan 03 12:44:49 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	well in america yes
1. Jan 03 12:44:57 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	HexagonSun, race and intelligence are obviously correlated, there's a mountain of data on that http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/james-watson-tells-inconvenient-truth_296.php 
1. Jan 03 12:44:57 &lt;LauraOfTheLye&gt;	they mostly all come from the same geographical area

1. Jan 03 12:46:06 &lt;telnet_reddit_80&gt;	david-me, as far as correlation between race and intelligence goes -- that's all the story there is
1. Jan 03 12:46:09 &lt;HexagonSun&gt;	basically, it says you're crazy
1. Jan 03 12:46:15 &lt;JustPassingThrough&gt;	sod off, telnet
1. Jan 03 12:46:25 &lt;david-me&gt;	whites are smarter than blacks because they are more affluent and dont grow up in the ghetto

1353041006.0,4,self.Drama,13a7j1,Tumblr Male vs. Female Privilege Drama.  Featuring several Tumblrs over a four month period!,6,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/13a7j1/tumblr_male_vs_female_privilege_drama_featuring/,"So, apologies, because Tumblr's format is a little bizarre and this spans a period of months, so hopefully this is understandable.

The Tumblr battle begins four months ago when opposing Tumblrs [All About Male Privilege](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com) and [this is female privilege](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com) come into existence.  The opposing forces will be referred to as AMP and TMP respectively because I am lazy.  Both blogs are submission based, so sort of like reddit except you wouldn't realize it wasn't the blog owners writing everything if they didn't explicitly tell you so.

AMP kicks off with a positively received [first post](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/26573746446/male-privilege-1#notes).  TMP, on the other hand, [starts drama immediately](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/26985612159/female-privilege-is-the-ability-to-chose-to-have) in a comment about hair length, attracting 187 notes and confusion over whether the blog is serious or not.  

TMP quickly gains both [fans](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/27019815604/im-a-girl-and-honestly-when-i-see-people-talking) and [enemies](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/27021884958/your-mother-is-ashamed), including another Tumblr, [Actually This is Male Privilege](http://actuallythisismaleprivilege.tumblr.com) which is dedicated to refuting TMP and lasts about a month.  AMP is less controversial, with most of its early detractors [angry about the WNBA](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/26662225435/i-forgot-that-when-only-3-000-people-show-up-to-watch).  Both continue to receive a fair amount of fan/hate mail up to the present day.

AMP and TMP finally cross paths with [this post about feminism](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/27261315282/actually), which AMP reblogs and comments on.  This starts a sort of Tumblr Cold War where neither side engages the other directly.  Instead, they stick to [reblog rebuttals](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/35251327780/misandry-the-hatred-of-men-tw-csa-airline-issue) and attacking the [other's tags](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/35718990869/if-you-guys-want-we-can-fill-up-the-female-privilege) with gifs and pictures of [their face](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/35767886452/female-privilege-is-my-perfect-face-d-redd#notes) but semi-hidden.

The Cold War shows no signs of slowing, with at least [one new Tumblr](http://allaboutfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com) rising up either to [troll AMP](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/tagged/allaboutfemaleprivilege) or support TMP, and both AMP and TMP still updating daily addressing things like [battered wife syndrome](http://thisisfemaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/35673275370/female-privilege-is-battered-wife-syndrome-a) and [bus etiquette](http://aboutmaleprivilege.tumblr.com/post/35549042843/male-privilege-is-when-a-guy-sits-next-to-me-on).

Some people just like the Internet.
