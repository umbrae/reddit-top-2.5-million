1276703264.0,245,self.opendirectories,cfnj4,A reddit FTP server!,306,61,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/cfnj4/a_reddit_ftp_server/,"So, I know this has been done before using Amazon S3 and whatnot, but I wanted to provide something for people to be able to use as much as they like.  I have a couple hundred gigs of space sitting on a server in my house, and figured ""Eh, what the hell, Reddit's cool.""

So, I made you guys an FTP server.  Currently, it is set up as follows:

* Only uploads and downloads work
* Deleting is not possible by average users (I reserve the right to do so)
* Files are not modified in any way after being uploaded, unless they are clearly illegal or corrupted.
* Use of the service is open to all redditors, and will remain open to all redditors for the foreseeable future.
* I reserve the right to ban any specific IP addresses for abuse, or excessive usage of bandwidth

So, if you'd like to check this out, and maybe upload a few files, feel free to check it out.  It's currently hosted on a cable internet connection, and is nowhere near as fast as I would like it to be, but I will investigate the possibility of moving it to my other, much faster server soon.

The connection details are as follows:

* **Hostname:** *redacted*
* **Port:** *redacted*
* **Username:** *redacted*
* **Password:** *redacted*
* **Protocol:** *redacted*
* [Or just click here](http://www.google.com ""redacted"")

If you need an FTP client, I would highly recommend [FileZilla](http://www.filezilla-project.org), which works for Windows, Mac or Linux.

If anyone has any feedback on the server, feel free to let me know.

Enjoy!

EDIT:  Because some assholes can't take a fucking hint, there is no porn allowed from now on.  Sorry guys, it's all over the net.

EDIT2:  I'm taking the server down for an hour or so, I have some stuff to deal with.  I'll post when it's back up.

EDIT3:  If you have a request to have a particular file deleted, please post a direct reply to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/cfnj4/a_reddit_ftp_server/c0s8tvr).  Thanks.

EDIT:  **The server has been quiesced.  This means any existing transfers will be allowed to finish, while new transfers will be denied.  I'm going to be making a change to how this works tonight, but in the meantime, I'm going out to eat and can't sit and watch this the entire time.  As of 6:00PM EST NO NEW TRANSFERS WILL BE ALLOWED.** 

** Final Note:** For the time being, the server will be down.  I'll be considering building some kind of web script that allows you to register for an account, and integrate it into my server, but that might not be for a while.  As of right now, I simply do not want to take the risks associated with operating an anonymous filesharing service.  If I do decide to do something similar to this again, I'll certainly let everyone know.

Thanks,

Raw links to my server getting posted around destroyed my network by crappy spiders.",116,15,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/h3e2w/please_use_the_nyudnet_links_raw_links_to_my/,"Basically, some some movie search engine divxcrawler.com picked up a link to my server, and then posted up direct, un-cached links to my web server. Because we have 1.5TB of movies and TV shows on this server, we naturally got a lot of hits, which essentially DDOSed our house for two days while I've been gone.

I understand that this is a risk inherent in hosting an open web server. But please understand that a lot of people who host open directories are just wanting an easy way to share things, and might not be able to diagnose the problem, let alone set up redirects, anti-spider measures, bandwidth throttling and the like. 

This is more important with ""readyshare"" routers, and such cases, where there's a absolute minimal amount of understanding to configure web sharing like this, and no way to easily moderate it. Throw in bandwidth caps that most ISPs are throwing in now days, and you can wind up causing serious hassle for people.

It's good to see that most links already use the coral cache, but I just wanted to stress the importance that they get *posted* with the cache link. I'd almost say it's a significant enough issue that non-nyud links be reported and removed/modified before spiders and hotlink sites get ahold of them.  

*updated with more info:* due to some misunderstandings, here's a bit more info. 
Top of my access log two days ago is the referall link from a google search of ""Index of parent directory filetype:"". Standard stuff used to find a open directory. However, in this case, it was thrown into http://divxcrawler.com's spider, which then threw up direct hotlinks to my poor home server. Since then, I've pulled the files, moved the directory structure, and hid it from the root url, so that it's no longer accessible. The site has no methods of contacting admins, nor removing dead links, so it's just going to sit there for some time. It's pretty much audioraider with ads and IMDB integration.  I've also used mod_rewrite to kill any links from those sites specifically, just in case. Any existing links only throw errors now. However, throwing out that many 404's is DDOSing my server, and causing enough traffic that I just have to keep apache turned off. Turning it on kills everything again. My only solution at this point, is to just change my domain (just a no-ip free, so not a big deal).

It will simply leave a comment in the post saying that the link is dead. and the reason, i.e 404, 403, 503, 418. 

But, I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions, or if any of the mods here approve of this? Or they have any suggestions.

If the bot was a moderator, then it could have more powers, like removing posts that are dead, etc, etc.

So, let me know what you guys think, and any recommendation for the bot. At the minute, it's not currently running, but I hope to change that after some more improvements.",,False,,t5_2r1e4,False,,,True,t3_1iylpi,http://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/1iylpi/meta_ropendirectories_bot/,

I've found so many strange things skydriving. 

*Example Skydrives I've found:*

-A ton of iphone IPAs, including ""asian boobs.ipa""

- 28 PORNO powerpoint presentations in french (WTF)
https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=a2fccad5bc78a766&amp;amp;id=A2FCCAD5BC78A766%2113251
-119 sheet music PDFs with Classic music &amp;amp;linkin park
https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=2405BB82580E9CE0&amp;amp;id=2405BB82580E9CE0%21106

The fun is that you can find virtually anything. I've found a cache of SNES roms, a huge ebook library of the best scifi and cyberpunk books, and even whole OS installs. 

Alot of the Skydrives are in different languages, so I think that adds a bit of mystery, too.

edit: thought i'd add that i was specifically having trouble with the recently posted directory of pen and paper games found at http://www.baneless.com.nyud.net/Books/

further edit: looks like i just needed to look around more. everything that downloaded normally showed up in the directory [directory]\{url}.nyud.net\[stuff], but the things downloading with 'coral_no_serve' appended in the cmd line were actually being downloaded, just to [directory]\{url}\[stuff]. 

After reading through the documentation a bit more, it looks like when nyud.net doesn't have things mirrored properly, it bounces the request back to the original server but somehow appends 'coral_no_serve' to the filename so that the request doesn't go back to the mirror host. or something close to that. because of how wget manages directories, the files ended up in a different folder from everything else, with slightly screwy extensions since the tag was put on the end of the filename (ie onto the extension)",,False,,t5_2r1e4,1342001379.0,,,True,t3_wdluf,http://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/wdluf/meta_problems_with_downloads/,

I just found this subreddit through randomly searching reddit. Everything seems pretty interesting here. I have a few questions I was hoping someone would be able to answer.

* Do i need to install any software to download from open directories? 
* I noticed the WGET guide... what is it and how is it used? Is that how you find these directories?
* Is this illegal (don't worry I'm not the police)
* I've clicked some of the links and found various directories. Sometimes I get a 503 error or a different error from Google saying something like ""Directory not found."" I'm using Chrome, is there anything I'm doing wrong or does that happen often?

with more that can be easily added. hopefully this will be useful to someone

I assure you that this is not true, it will only work on sites it supports, and i will not steal your data anyway, you can view the source if you want.

1375711258.0,11,self.opendirectories,1jqn32,I made a little guide with tips and tricks on how to make the most when it comes to searching for the files you want via open directories. I hope someone can find it useful. :),12,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/1jqn32/i_made_a_little_guide_with_tips_and_tricks_on_how/,"Opendirectories: A bit like virtual dumpster diving for some interesting/useful files out there in the open, but without taking anything away permanently. Whatever your definition is, I created this little guide of tips and tricks to help you easily find, browse, and download what you want. I'm not tech/code savvy at all so don't worry, you don't have to be either, to follow this quick guide.

Okay, so first of all, drag and drop these 3 main bookmarklets to a bookmark folder/toolbar/anywhere you want.

1: [intitle:index of](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=intitle%3A%22index+of%22)

2: Drag and drop the Coralize bookmarklet at the bottom of this page [here](http://www.coralcdn.org/plugins/).

3: Drag and drop the third, Wayback bookmarklet which you'll find on this page [here](http://archive.org/web/web.php). Ctrl+F bookmarklet to find it instantly.

Okay. So the first google bookmarklet is essentially the primary key to finding open directories. Click and add then search for what you want. Give it a go! Add MP3/PDF/MOBI/EPUB at the end to restrict your search to files (but not too restricting as filetype:x).

The second bookmark automatically adds .nyud.net to any url you're on which enables you to use the Coral cache network to mirror files for you to download without crashing the original server - and interestingly enough, it also works well when reddit is overloaded! Try it the next time you get the ""we took too long to load this page for you"" message, you won't be logged in to comment/vote etc. Coral cache doesn't work everytime is run by volunteers so respect it and don't use it for huge lengthy downloads, especially when there are alternative methods, which I'll come back to.

The third bookmarklet can sometimes help when you reach a dead directory/website. Click on the Wayback bookmarklet to check if it's been archived by the Wayback machine. Also, when you stumble across a directory where the files aren't too big, give this bookmarklet a click. It will say that the wayback machine doesn't have this url - but because you've clicked it, you've added it to a queue of websites to later on be cached. Check it out some time later to find it cached! This doesn't work well with directories but it works quite well on webpages and news articles. Once something has been cached by Wayback, you never need to worry about it disappearing or going down (unless you make a special request to them). It's on the web forever! If wayback doesn't have the dead directory, enter the url in google and see if Google has cached it. Google the filename(s) to find them elsewhere, if you can.

There is a fantastic firefox addon called [Location Bar Enhancer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-enhancer/) which makes browsing directories really easy via the url bar. Each level/folder in the url becomes a clickable button and moving up one, two, or 10 levels becomes effortless rather than clicking ""parent directory"" multiple times to go up. Like so: http://i.imgur.com/VB4AVpv.png I don't think such an addon exists for chrome users unfortunately. I searched but couldn't find anything similar. Sorry guys.

[IDM](http://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) is the best download tool ever. When you want to download a list of files on a directory, you can highlight the ones you want and right click, or right click and download all (with options to uncheck etc). As a cool bonus, for every YouTube vid you watch (and practically ANY other you find online, Vimeo/Liveleak etc), you get the option to [download](http://i.imgur.com/rCJWqMs.png) flv/mp4 vids (for youtube, from 240p to 1080p quality), if possible. Your downloads are accelerated and the speed can be limited, too so you don't hog speeds for other internet users in the house. I highly recommend it. You can try it for free and then buy it for $25 or it can be found on other places of the [web](http://www.warez-bb.org/viewtopic.php?t=14744350). Other firefox addons such as [DownThemAll](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/) work great, too.

Music. I used to [YouTube to MP3](http://onlinevideoconverter.com) my music because it was quicker than torrenting (and felt less illegal for some reason) but then when I learnt about opendirectories, I was delighted to find that much of my music could be found by this method. But not all the music I was interested in was there. So, I now use this method which I shared over but others weren't too keen: http://i.imgur.com/zsV2Gza.jpg , maybe you guys might find it interesting. It works great on tablets too, and it's 100% free and safe so there's no monthly ties like spotify, you can do what you want with the mp3 files you choose to download.

If you found a big file/movie on a directory and want a way to store it without downloading it or the directory going down, create a [putlocker](http://putlocker.com)/[sockshare](http://sockshare.com) account and use the remote upload feature. You file can potentially be stored forever if you keep it active every 14 days. With a free account, share your folder via a link, log yourself out, and then just buffer a movie for a minute or start downloading a file and then cancel it after a few seconds. Works great!

Also, [this](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/154467) fantastic userscript lets you download from putlocker/sockshare like a pro user with instant starts and no waiting times. It is one of the best things I've found and it works very well. If you can't find your tv-series or movie on an opendirectory, you will most likely find it on [Project Free TV](http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/),[watchseriesonline](http://watchseriesonline.eu), or [fanstash](http://www.fanstash.eu) etc. And then you can download, even in a smaller mobile-friendly mp4 format. Note: for userscripts, you'll need an addon to install them such as [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Chrome.

Ebooks. Many epubs which I like to read can now be found mostly via opendirectories, but when they're not available, I use [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc) (my client of choice is [ChatZilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla)) which I learnt to use via this [golden comment by ManWithoutModem](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/hrgmv/tracker_with_pdfsebooks_of_college_textbooks/c1xrq44), which also includes some fantastic websites to find textbooks and more. Check it out. IRC has found the epubs I've wanted pretty much nearly every single time.

So that's all I could think of from the top of my head, if you have any more tips, please include them below.
Happy searching and best wishes to all. AC

edit: spelling, links. 

P.S. And as always, if you really like what you download, support the author/maker. But honestly, do whatever you want. I'm just another internet stranger at the end of the day, and always remember, you don't really have any obligations towards anyone on the net.
